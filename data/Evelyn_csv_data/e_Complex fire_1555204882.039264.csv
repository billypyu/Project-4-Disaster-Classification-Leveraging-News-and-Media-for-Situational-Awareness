TIM ARANGO,"Upper Lake — founded in 1854, a red archway in town announces — lies just beyond the checkpoint to the evacuation zone, which is managed by the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. Upper Lake was settled by two Anglo-Americans who had helped lead a revolt against Mexican rule in nearby Sonoma, a nugget of history written on the back of the postcards Mr. Lynch has stacked on the front counter. Upper Lake’s main street is a line of Old West-style storefronts, and with the evacuation of most residents, the place had the feel of a ghost town. Mr. Lynch described the area as economically depressed, and a place where people like to be left alone by the government. And even amid a devastating fire season and news reports about rising temperatures, there is plenty of skepticism over climate change. “Millions of years ago, I’m sure they had fires that raged and raged for months — it just so happens that we are in one of those cycles,” Mr. Lynch said. Other residents have stayed behind because they are worried about looters, concerned that they would return to find “their back doors kicked in,” he said. As he spoke, one of his regulars, Steve Lugger, came in to buy cat litter. “I’m the last living one in my family, and I just wanted to live in my house,” said Mr. Lugger, 68. “And I have 12 cats to take care of.” On a normal day, you can see clear across the lake, where almost every weekend there is a bass fishing tournament. But the fires have brought a thick haze of smoke.","We drove roughly 50 miles along Highway 20, from the firefighters’ base camp to the town of Clearlake Oaks, while the region was still under a mandatory evacuation order.",2018-08-10T09:40:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Inside the Mendocino Complex Fire Evacuation Zone,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/us/california-fires-mendocino-complex.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/10/us/10MENDOCINO-lede-01/merlin_142146867_cafa7abc-2773-4803-8940-5e862575bb04-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Complex fire,1

 Hundreds of people were evacuated from the shopping centre and hotel
At least two people have died after a fire broke out at a major Bangkok shopping mall complex on Wednesday.
The fire, which has now been brought under control, reportedly started on the eighth floor of the Centara Grand hotel at 17:40 local time (10:40 GMT).
At least one of those who died had fallen from the building, local reports say.
Videos on social media showed hundreds of people evacuating from the large shopping complex.
Other clips showed emergency services struggling to get through gridlocked rush-hour traffic to get to the scene.
Bangkok Governor Assawin Kwanmuang told local media that one person had died at the scene and two others at local hospital. He also said seven other people were injured. 
Hospital and police officials could only confirm two fatalities.

Tom McKay,"Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday. According to the report, Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden brought up the throttling in an addendum to a multi-state legal brief seeking the overturn of the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission’s decision to throw out Barack Obama-era net neutrality rules. Bowden alleged that Verizon had throttled a SIM card connecting a fire department mobile command vehicle named “OES 5262” to 1/200th of its normal speed, putting lives and property at risk, and that the company’s support team refused to lift the restrictions until fire officials purchased a new data plan at “more than twice the cost.” Ars Technica wrote: “County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,” Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a declaration. “This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire’s ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.” Bowden’s declaration was submitted in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission. The government agencies are seeking to overturn the recent repeal of net neutrality rules in a lawsuit they filed against the Federal Communications Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. According to Bowden, County Fire IT staff verified the connection was being throttled, which “severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively.” When those staff reached out and said the throttling was impacting public safety, Verizon customer support personnel confirmed they had deliberately limited OES 5262's connection, but that it would only be restored if County Fire switched to a more expensive plan and contacted the billing department. As a result, fire personnel were forced to use other departments’ service providers as well as their personal devices until County Fire paid up. Bowden wrote those personnel were deployed to help fight the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest in the state. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that fire is extremely hazardous to the nearly 3,500 firefighters currently fighting it, with Draper City, Utah fire department Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett dying this month while trying to help contain the blaze. In general, the blazes across the state have increasingly exhibited extreme behavior like immense fire tornadoes. Adding a service provider dispute to this situation is indisputably not helpful. Bowden further alleged that Verizon knew full well what it was doing and took advantage of the situation to “coerce” County Fire into paying more: While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher-cost plans, ultimately paying significantly more for mission-critical service—even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. In a statement provided to Gizmodo as well as Ars Technica, a Verizon spokesperson wrote that the company “made a mistake in how we communicated with our customer about the terms of its plan,” which was a “government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost.” The spokesperson wrote that while the plan offers “unlimited amount of data... speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle”—though they added that Verizon maintains “a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations” and the incident was a “customer support mistake.” Verizon also stated that the matter had “nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court.” It’s true that throttling a plan that goes over its data limits isn’t a net neutrality issue per se. The Obama-era rules prohibited service providers from artificially slowing down or blocking content in a discriminatory fashion, whether it’s to limit their customers’ access to rival services or just charge extortionate fees to access certain services. But Bowden’s argument appears to be that County Fire’s experience with Verizon led him to believe they are quite willing to do just that to emergency personnel. “Please work with us,” a fire official wrote to Verizon on July 30th, according to documents filed with Bowden’s addendum. “All we need is a plan that does not offer throttling or caps of any kind.” [ Ars Technica ]","Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday.

Robbie Gonzalez,"Not for the first time this year, Californians this week donned face masks to protect their lungs from the harmful airborne particles that have smothered the state in a sickly, sooty haze. The pollutants are products of three devastating infernos raging hundreds of miles apart, the largest of which, Butte County's Camp Fire, has swelled to become the deadliest and most destructive in state history. They join the more than 7,500 California wildfires that have this year consumed nearly 1.7-million acres of landmore than any fire season on record. The increasing intensity of California's blazes has many residents of the Golden State wondering: Is the smoke from wildfires also getting worse? That's a complicated question. On one hand, data suggests California's fires are burning hotter and consuming more land than they did in the past. ""If you use intensity as a proxy for pollutionthat is, if you assume stronger fires will produce more emissions like smokethen by stint of that, yes, there ought to be more smoke,"" says atmospheric composition scientist Mark Parrington. A senior researcher at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Parrington tracks wildfires around the world to better understand their effect on pollution and public health. Most mornings he's in his office by 8 am, downloading the previous 24 hours' worth of fire data from a supercomputer operated by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The datathermal infrared radiation measurements from NASA's MODIS instrument allow him to estimate the intensity of fires burning around the world; how many emissions (like lung-aggravating aerosols and greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide) they're pumping into the atmosphere; and how those emissions affect global air quality. From his office in Reading, just west of London, he's kept closer tabs on California's current wildfires than most. ""You really don't expect to see emissions of this magnitude, this late in the year,"" Parrington says. ""Even on a global scale, it really stood out."" Parrington also compares each day's emissions data to past measurements, which is how he knows that California's current wildfires have pumped more schmutz into the atmosphere than any November blazes on record. In fact, this year's California wildfires have produced more emissions than all but 13 of the past 16 years. ""It's not just the Camp Fire, but the wildfires from this summer,"" Parrington says. ""The Carr Fire, the Mendocino Complex Firethey've been devastating."" If the state sees any major wildfires in December (the way it did in 2017), 2018 could become the year with the highest emissions ever recorded for California. And yet, the question of whether smoke is getting worse is more complicated than many people realize. That's because smoke itself is pretty complex. For starters, it contains well beyond the 40 different ""pyrogenic species"" Parrington says his analyses account for, which include various forms of carbon, and toxic aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene. The relative and absolute quantities of said species can vary considerably, based on the conditions of the burnlike whether it's wet, dry, or has burned in the past. ""All of these factors contribute to how much of those fire emissions get turned into smoke and how the pollutants interact with each other,"" Parrington says. Determining how much smoke is actually in the atmosphere, let alone entering people's lungs, is also challenging. Parrington says it requires understanding how smoke interacts with large scale weather conditions like wind, ground temperature, air temperature, and cloud cover. In the Bay Area, for instance, high pressure atmospheric systems tend to produce inversion layers that, like a lid on a shallow pan, keep smoky air close to the ground. Determining the region's air quality has to do not just with the absolute quantity of smoke, but how much of it is is trapped at ground level. There's also fuel sources to consider, variations in which produce different kinds of smoke. ""The fact that more fires are happening at the wildland urban interface means that fires are encountering new materials,"" says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University specializing in fire-related air pollution. When it comes to fuel, McCarty says, fires are agnostic. If it's hot enough, it doesn't care if it's a tree, a house, or your car. But as a rule of thumb, the emissions emanating from a burning shrub are less caustic than those of a burning Subaru. ""Wood is far from clean, but it's nothing compared to something like burning rubber, which is downright toxic,"" McCarty says. Which is why, as people build deeper and deeper into wildland areas, the relevant question isn't just how much pollution these fires producing, but what kind of pollution they're producing. Answers to both questions, Parrington says, could be found in computational systems like the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring service, which is capable of taking many of these variables into account and synthesizing the data across multiples wildfire seasons. CAMs has only been operational for three years, but the data it collects is openly available to scientists around the world who are increasingly interested in nuanced questions about wildland smoke. For residents of California, answers to those questions can't come soon enough. In the meantime, hang on to any extra air masks you have lying aroundthere's no telling when you might need them again.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Local officials have hit back at President Trump's claims that firefighters don't have enough water Twin wildfires in California, known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, have grown to become the largest active wildfire in state history, officials said on Monday. The fires have spread rapidly in recent days to burn 283,800 acres of land - an area almost the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters are tackling 16 major blazes across the state amid hot weather, strong winds and low humidity. At least seven people have been killed in the Carr fire in the state's north. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump has reiterated social media comments that the fires' spread is being ""made so much worse"" by California's environmental laws. Local officials and experts have criticised and dismissed his tweets. Where are the fires burning? More than 14,000 firefighters and hundreds of US army personnel are trying to contain the more than a dozen major fires burning throughout the state. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Officials say the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two nearby fires being treated as the same incident, has surpassed last year's Thomas Fire to become the largest in state history. Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) described the wildfires as ""extremely fast, extremely aggressive, extremely dangerous,"" ""Look how big it got, just in a matter of days... Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen,"" he said on Monday. It is only 30% contained so far, with authorities warning it could take another week to get the blaze under control. Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". What is the row with Mr Trump?

TIM ARANGO,"Every fire is investigated, and as wildfire seasons have grown worse, California has been more aggressive in holding people accountable — either with criminal charges for arson or negligence, as with Mr. Martinez, or, if there is a deep-pocketed culprit, with a lawsuit to recoup costs from fighting the fires. In the summer of 2013, a wildfire broke out in Riverside County and grew to threaten the desert resort town of Palm Springs. No one was killed, but it took thousands of firefighters, and almost $26 million, to put it out. Investigators found the blaze started with a faulty electrical box on a private property. Lawsuits in both state and federal court against the owner, a wealthy Saudi businessman, are still pending, although the state case may be resolved soon by mediation, according to the Idyllwild Town Crier, a newspaper in the area where the fire occurred. “Our civil cost recovery is definitely something we do on a regular basis,” Ms. Tolmachoff said. “Ninety-five percent of these fires are caused by humans and they could have been prevented somehow.” Last year the state saw what was then its biggest wildfire in recorded history — the Thomas Fire, in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties — and its most destructive, the Tubbs Fire in Northern California’s wine country. The causes of both fires are still under investigation, but some lawsuits point the finger at the power companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. And in several other Northern California fires last year, Cal Fire determined that faulty power lines were the cause. In the aftermath of those fires, California’s power companies have received close scrutiny from the State Legislature. “They talk about climate change,” said Steve Campora, a Sacramento lawyer who has made a career of suing utility companies on behalf of fire victims. “And climate change makes it more difficult to control the fire. But climate change does not cause ignition.” Edward Struzik, a fellow at the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy in Ontario and the author of “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” said he believes fires will continue to get worse, year by year, through a combination of climate change and human activity. “There is no end in sight for this fire activity,” he said. Referring to the human causes of wildfire, he added that “education is still a really big problem. There are many people who are oblivious to the dangers and volatility of forests.”","Firefighters battled the Mendocino Complex Fire this month.

Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires. What's more, over the same period, the state has experienced eight of its 10 most destructive fires in history. The U.S. Forest Service is in its highest level of fire response, with 29,500 firefighters battling blazes around the nation. Most, however, are combating fires in the super-parched West, where the record-breaking Mendocino Complex promises to spread even more.","For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history.

SARAH MERVOSH,"A fire raging in Northern California has become the largest in modern state history, the state’s fire agency said on Monday.

She noted that the state was only in the middle of its fire season, with the worst fires often occurring later in the year, as the land becomes increasingly dry and weather patterns create windy conditions. “We’ve got a long road ahead,” she said. The Mendocino Complex Fire overtook last year’s Thomas Fire, which ate up nearly 282,000 acres. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“A good analogy is a clogged bathtub. You’re just putting more and more pollution into a limited space and it’s getting more concentrated, more concentrated, more concentrated,” said Jamie Holt of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. “We don’t create more pollution than other parts of the country, we actually create a lot less pollution,” she added. “But because we have this topography and meteorology, we have less ability to clear the pollution out.” It’s not just the inland San Joaquin Valley that is getting hit.

""The resident was found by crews hired by the building owners to evaluate the safety of the structure,"" Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a press conference Monday. The man was taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life threatening, she said. The fire broke out at the Arthur Capper Senior Housing Center on September 19. At the time, officials with DC Fire and EMS said in a news release they had rescued more than 100 residents, and it was believed everyone had been accounted for. Bowser said Monday the building's owners have been asked to check again for anybody else. The search has been turned over to DC Fire, EMS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobbaco, Firearms and Explosives, she said.","A 74-year-old man has been discovered alive five days after his senior living apartment complex in Washington, DC, caught fire -- but nobody knew he was missing.",2018-09-24T18:47:41Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",74-year-old man found alive 5 days after building fire,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/24/us/dc-fire-man-alive/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924142814-01-dc-building-fire-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Complex fire,1
JENNIFER MEDINA,"Should San Francisco force workers outside their offices for meals? We asked you to weigh in last week about the news that two members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors proposed an ordinance to ban new corporate offices from including cafeterias. Dozens of emails poured in and the response was a resounding no. Many criticized what they saw as a “nanny-state” law. Here are excerpts from some responses: “If you had to pay $18 for an avocado salad at the corner restaurant or a free lunch at work as part of your compensation, which would you choose? San Francisco restaurants are ridiculously expensive as has become the norm in Los Angeles, San Diego, Portland and Seattle too. Consumers need to say no to restaurant’s high prices. The San Francisco supervisors need to concentrate on rent control and homelessness.” Robert Worley “I have worked for 35 years and can count on one hand the times I didn’t bring lunch from home. Will that be the next rule, no home lunch? As for those businesses that popped up expecting a lunch crowd, perhaps they need to think out of the box and provide affordable food to those who need it during the day, and happy hour to those who work next door.” Cassandra Cline “Vendors have no legal right to force people into their shops and restaurants. This is a slippery slope. What’s next — school lunches?” Anne Britt But at least one reader supported the cafeteria ban: “I have lived and worked in San Francisco for 50 years, and it is disheartening to see small local businesses including restaurants being driven out by techs who make very generous salaries then cry that it is so expensive to live in San Francisco that they need free food!

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction. It’s the latest reminder that we now live in an era of fast-growing, hard-to-contain megafires. Update 8/7: Well, it happened: The Mendocino Complex fire now stands at 283,800 acres and containment remains low. It’s eclipsed the Thomas Fire and still growing. The Mendocino Complex fire, which includes the Ranch and River fires burning side by side in Lake and Mendocino counties, currently stands at a combined 274,000 acres, placing it just shy of the Thomas Fire as largest wildfire in modern state history. The fires are still growing, and state officials believe the fire complex could climb to the top of the list soon, according to the LA Times. “Look how big it got, just in a matter of days,” Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), told the LA Times. “Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn’t happen. That just doesn’t happen.” Indeed, the fires exploded into existence just 10 days ago on July 27, and have been consuming land at breakneck speed. The larger of the two—the Ranch Fire—makes the top 10 list in its own right. As of this morning, the blaze had torched 225,000 acres and was just 21 percent contained. The River Fire, meanwhile, is closing in on 50,000 acres and nearly 60 percent containment. Thousands of personnel are working to contain the fires, which together threaten thousands of structures. But with scorching temperatures and little rain on tap for the next few days, they may prove hard to stamp out. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump declared a “major disaster” in California, ordering that federal funds be made available to help the state cope with its destructive blazes and help residents affected by the Carr Fire, another enormous wildfire burning not too far away in Shasta and Trinity counties. Trump also took to Twitter to blame California’s “bad environmental laws” for the situation and to falsely assert that the state is somehow diverting water it could be using to fight fires into the ocean. So, there’s that. The truth is that mega-fires like the Mendocino Complex are increasingly becoming the norm out West thanks to a combination of more humans living at the wildland-urban interface, persistent drought, misguided policies that caused large amounts of vegetation (aka fire fuel) to build up on landscapes, and climate change. “Our contribution to climate warming has effectively made fuels 50% drier and doubled the amount of western forests that have burned since 1984,” Jennifer Balch, a fire ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Earther via email. John Abatzoglou, a climate scientist at the University of Idaho, noted several climate and weather factors that set the stage for the Mendocino Complex conflagration. There was the very wet winter of 2016-2017, which “helped created a bumper crop of grasses last summer,” as Abatzoglou put it in an email. This year’s fire season has been incredibly dry, with unusually hot nights since July that have inhibited fire-suppression activities. Abatzoglou also pointed to the long-term trend, noting that the dryness of fire fuels and frequency of hot nights have trended upwards in recent years. The rise in extreme fire activity across the West has been on display over and over in recent months, and it’s clear we need to get our shit together. A wildfire fix in the 2018 omnibus spending bill was a step in the right direction, allowing federal agencies to access disaster funds rather than tapping their normal budgets to deal with the biggest blazes. But there’s still plenty more work to do, from allocating additional resources toward removing vegetation on wildfire-prone landscapes to setting and enforcing strong building codes to holding those who start fires accountable. We could also try doing something about climate change.","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction.

JENNIFER MEDINA and SARAH MERVOSH,"The fires are fueled by extreme heat and parched vegetation from years of drought. And firefighters have repeatedly been vexed by the soaring temperatures and rugged terrain of the current fires. Scientists say climate change is a central factor in creating the atmospheric ingredients that make wildfires like California’s more extreme. Warmer global temperatures, driven by the greenhouse gases emitted from man-made activity like burning coal and driving cars, has led to droughts as well as more intense heat waves that last longer. The result: increasingly intense fire seasons that start earlier and last longer. “You combine drought and heat, you get record wildfires. It’s not rocket science,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it is still not possible to quantify the role that climate change plays versus other factors from more housing developments to the way forests are managed. But, Mr. Wehner said, “It’s fair to say that there is a human influence, and it’s not small.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday. It has so far destroyed 143 structures, including 75 residences. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said. Of the top 20 largest wildfires in California, about half have come in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. “That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,” Ms. Tolmachoff said.","Two fires have combined in Northern California to form the largest wildfire in state history.

Chris Velazco,"While the Fire Phone was a punchline and a commercial failure, it did lead to good things — eventually. In a conversation with Engadget at CES, Sandeep Gupta, Amazon's Technical Program Manager for Fire TV, suggested that the teams and processes built to make the Fire Phone reality also made possible the impressive hardware ecosystem we now see. ""Building the phone was sort of a trial by fire,"" Gupta said before groaning at his pun. ""It was a very intense product, and we learned so much. And the teams we built from the Fire Phone have helped seed a lot of the other teams. You'll see people on the Echo team, the TV team, the tablet team who got their start on the Phone team."" If Amazon's teams learned a lot, it's because they needed to achieve a lot. The Fire Phone wasn't Amazon's first hardware project; a handful of Kindles came before, not to mention a few Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top boxes. But the Phone presented fresh technical challenges for Amazon to grapple with. ""The phone is, without a doubt, one of the hardest working hardware products you can build,"" Gupta said. ""They're very compact. You've got antennas, you've got an ecosystem, you've got an app store, you've got content services, you've got the whole kit and caboodle."" It didn't help that the Fire Phone was designed to be more complex than rival smartphones from the get-go. Four front-facing sensors tried to track the motion of user's heads so some of the images that appeared on-screen would move with them. And since the Fire Phone was intended to be a kind of concierge for Amazon's massive online store, we got Firefly : a feature that allowed people to scan everyday objects around them for identification and eventual purchase. That's one hell of an undertaking, but Amazon powered through despite a relative lack of experience. Along the way, Gupta says, Amazon was forced to figure out the intricacies of small-scale hardware design, not to mention more efficient ways to work with chipset vendors and manufacturers. Amazon also had countless other questions to answer. How do you define your product? What are the milestones in development to work toward? While the answers to those questions weren't complete, they were enough to prepare Amazon to do better in the future. ""The engineering excellence was there,"" Gupta said. ""That's what continued to flow through the organization and allowed us to get to where we are."" If Amazon had learned those lessons sooner, the Fire Phone might not have turned out the way it did. Still, even though it languished on store shelves, the Fire Phone itself wasn't a bad device. The hardware was expensive but functional. The software was overly ambitious, but it was impressive when it worked. Amazon (perhaps wisely) decided not to use its refined understanding of the development process to build another phone, but Gupta is adamant that the company's ""trial by fire"" made subsequent devices like the Echos and the improved Fire TVs better. ""We took those learnings and now we've been able to apply them to a lot of the other products we're building,"" Gupta said. ""And sometimes you learn what to do by learning what not to do.""

Andrew Liszewski,"While youre struggling to toast bread without burning it, metalsmith Seth Gould harnesses heat and fire to turn raw steel into masterful creations like this lock box featuring a complex series of steps that have to be perfectly executed in order to open it. 
It took Gould, who was in residency at North Carolinas Penland School of Craft at the time, almost two years to design, forge, and build Coffer from scratch, using iron, steel, brass, and lots and lots of heat. Filmmaker Jesse Beecher documented the process, and watching Gould make everything from bolts to springs from scratch is just as satisfying as watching him painstakingly walk through all the steps involved in actually opening the box.
Gould drew inspiration by studying the creations of lock makers who honed their designs between the 17th and 19th centuries, long before machines automated the process and removed a lot of the art and creativity from the craft. But he didnt just copy classic designs; he instead used what he learned as a starting point to make the mechanisms inside his Coffer box truly unique, which added to its complexity. An original puzzle is infinitely harder to solve than one based on tricks and techniques often seen before.
Just dont expect Gould to sell his puzzle box, or expect one to be even remotely affordable if you somehow convince him to make one for you. Two years is a lot of time (and sweat) to put into a creation like this, so maybe just enjoy the video a few more times while you fiddle with a Rubiks Cube.

Tom McKay,"Mobile giant Verizon has faced withering criticism in the months since it throttled Santa Clara County Fire Department firefighters trying to contain Californias Mendocino Complex Fire, then tried to force them to purchase increased data even as they were begging for immediate assistance. It said it would immediately stop throttling emergency personnel responding to wildfires in the West Coast and Hawaii, and released a glowing ad trying to convince people that first responders actually really love the mega-corporation (over 1,000 signed an open letter saying they do not ). When we last checked, it remained unclear whether Verizon had actually rolled out a promised plan with priority access and no caps on mobile solutions for first respondersthe company told Ars Technica those contracts needed to be approved by various national and state agencies. But this week, it did announce that current and former police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and emergency volunteers can now shave a few bucks off their personal unlimited plans (the cheapest of which can be throttled at any time, and the most expensive of which has a built-in cap of 75 gigabytes a month before throttling kicks in). Per a Verizon blog post : Starting today, customers who are state &amp; local police, fire and EMS employees, retirees or volunteers can sign up for the Go Unlimited plan for $30 per line per month for four lines when enrolled in Auto Pay a savings of $40 per month (plus taxes and fees). And now that you can mix and match unlimited plans for the whole family, first responders can save even more on all Verizon Unlimited consumer plans: get $15 off one line, $35 off two lines and $40 off three or more lines. Verizon is doubling down on our support of these brave men and women by giving them even more value on their personal lines, Verizon executive Mike Maiorana said in the statement.

Mark Kaufman,"Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast. They're escaping the smoke. Davis, California, sits amid a layer of wildfire smoke in Northern California. To the northwest, the largest fire in state history, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn. To the southeast, the Ferguson Fire has closed down smoke-choked Yosemite National Park indefinitely. And to the North, the Carr Fire, infamous for its towering fire tornado, still burns. SEE ALSO: California just had its hottest month on record, and that means more wildfires The air quality in the region around the fires — whose spread has been enhanced by extreme heat parching the land — is some of the worst in the world. ""I decided to go out to the coast for a couple days because it was so ridiculous,"" Wexler said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service illustrated how winds have lifted bounties of smoke across the entire U.S., bringing pollution even beyond the East Coast. Smoke from the western fires is making it all the way to the East Coast and beyond (at least aloft—mostly above a mile above the surface). Here's the vertically integrated smoke (HRRR model from last night). Another map showed some smoke near the surface even in New England. pic.twitter.com/0Jl6WDAFjg — NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) August 8, 2018 That said, it's not as if these smoke particles are harmful to those on the East Coast. By the time that smoke arrives in Boston and New York, the particles have been diluted with fresh air, and certainly can't be seen, nor are concentrations unhealthy. It's normal for pollution to waft from west to east across the country, just like pollution from China is regularly transported over the Pacific Ocean into the U.S. That's how air generally moves over the Northern Hemisphere, said Wexler. But it's much rarer for even low concentrations of smoke to find their way across the nation. ""It doesn’t happen every day,"" Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab, said in an interview. ""But, it can happen."" ""Normally, the pollution isn’t so great that it’s noticeable when it gets east,"" added Wexler. But just how bad is the air pollution in large regions of the West? ""It's been like a reasonably decent day in Beijing,"" said Wexler. ""That's really telling. It’s really awful there."" ""It’s unbelievable,"" said Pfister. She noted that planes flying over the area, as part of a National Science Foundation-funded wildfire study, have picked up some alarming pollution numbers. It's expected that particulate matter — tiny fragments of pollution 30 times thinner than a human hair — would be bad. But the flights even picked up abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be dangerous to human health in enclosed spaces, and at worse, lethal. However, some of the measured values around the fires are about 5 parts per million, or ppm, which are not considered nearly dangerous — but it's still telling. ""These are values you don’t typically find near the surface in the U.S.,"" said Pfister. ""Maybe you’ll find that if you stick your head into the exhaust of a car."" It's not carbon monoxide, however, that people in burning regions need to be concerned about. One of the main factors that's figured into air quality ratings is particulate matter. Both U.S. government and university researchers have repeatedly shown that breathing this stuff is bad for your heart, as it accelerates plaque build-up in blood vessels. In some areas of Oregon, the Air Quality Index currently registers as ""Hazardous."" In Redding, California, where a fire tornado spun for 80 minutes last week, the air quality is rated as ""Unhealthy."" But out near the windswept coast, like in San Francisco, the air quality is ""Good."" It's likely that the West will be intermittently blanketed in unhealthy to hazardous air for months ahead, as the fire season is not nearly over. Rains aren't expected for months, and more temperature and fire records might be broken. Many Westerners aren't near the fires themselves. But it's harder to outrun the smoke. ""In my experience, it's never been this bad,"" said Wexler.","Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out. The Ranch Fire can now officially take its place in the record books, having burned a grand total of 459, 123 acres. The Ranch Fire was part of the Mendocino Complex, which lit up on July 27. Paired with the River Fire, the complex became the largest fire in state history in early August. Just a week later Ranch Fire took the title of the largest single fire in California history, fanned by powerful winds over a hot, dry landscape. The Ranch Fire continued its smoldering march through Mendocino National Forest just northeast of Ukiah until it was officially declared out on Wednesday. Crews are doing mop up work, helping clean up fire lines dug to contain the fire and searching for any last hot spots. While the blaze is out, the California’s state fire agency warned plumes of smoke could still rise due to the warm, dry weather. As crews continue assessing the landscape, a large closure remains in effect for the forest, including the Snowy Mountain Wilderness Area. The Ranch Fire was one of a few notable fires in California this summer. The Carr Fire left a swath of destruction in Redding and spawned a firenado while the Ferguson Fire shut down parts of Yosemite National Park. And we may not be done yet. Southern California’s fall fire season is just getting started. The Santa Ana winds that usher hot, dry air into the region helped fan last year’s Thomas Fire, which held California’s largest fire crown for all of eight months. The winds are calm for now, but they may not stay that way. “So after the present reprieve, I would not be surprised to see a renewed surge in heat, wind, and fire activity before the winter rains arrive,” UCLA climate scientist and California weather watcher Daniel Swain wrote on his blog this week. “I’ll keep my fingers crossed that we get a break this year, though. It’s already been a rough few years as far as California wildfires go.” All fires now occur in the context of a warming climate. This was California’s second-hottest summer on record, which no doubt helped the Ranch Fire take the title of California’s largest fire yet. Hotter conditions melt out snowpack earlier and dry out vegetation, creating a landscape more prone to explosive conflagrations. Research has shown that climate change has essentially doubled the area burned in western forests since the 1984. It’s enough to make one wonder if we should keep building in these places.","After nearly two months, the largest wildfire in California history has finally been put out.

LISA W. FODERARO,"He noted that the city’s plan to close Rikers within 10 years was not legally binding. In a statement, Mr. David added that the plan was “wholly unacceptable and repugnant to federal and state constitutional principles.” Rikers has garnered national attention for its brutality, spawned federal investigations and become a lightning rod for protests. State officials said the Commission of Correction could issue a citation to New York City for failure to correct violations, and then hold a public hearing. If the city failed to provide evidence that it could bring Rikers into compliance, the state would have the option of moving to close the complex. An immediate closure was unlikely, however, given the logistics of relocating several thousand inmates. In preparing the report, the Commission of Correction conducted site visits and interviews at scores of county jails across the state, focusing on inmate deaths and physical conditions. It labeled Rikers one of the five “worst offenders,” joining jails or penitentiaries in Greene, Erie, Dutchess and Onondaga Counties. Last March, Mayor de Blasio pledged to close Rikers in 10 years, embracing a report prepared by an independent commission empaneled by Melissa Mark-Viverito, then the City Council speaker. The report called on the city to replace the jails on Rikers with a network of smaller jails in each of the five boroughs. On Tuesday, Eric Phillips, the chief spokesman for City Hall, sought to highlight the city’s resolve in shuttering the complex, while giving Mr. Cuomo a none-too-subtle poke for the timing of the state’s attention. Photo Although the state may move to close Rikers Island ahead of the city’s 10-year timeline, an immediate closure was unlikely given the logistics of relocating thousands of inmates. Credit Spencer Platt/Getty Images “The mayor’s not only invested deeply in improving conditions at Rikers in the short term, he’s made the historic decision to close the jail and move off the island as soon as possible,” he said. “We appreciate the governor beginning to show interest in this process, and in fixing the embattled prison system he runs.” The backhanded expression of gratitude appeared to refer to the package of criminal justice reforms that Mr. Cuomo has made part of this year’s state agenda. Among other things, he would revamp the bail system, ensure access to a speedy trial and launch programs to help released inmates make the transition from prison to the community. Last year, the governor and state lawmakers raised the age of criminal responsibility. And according to his office, Mr. Cuomo has closed 24 prisons and juvenile detention centers, pushing down the prison population by more than 6,000. But Rikers, according to the Commission of Correction, remains a blight on New York’s criminal justice system. The report highlighted “significant incidents,” including deaths, escapes, fires and group actions, noting that in almost every category, there were more incidents at Rikers Island facilities than at all the county jails, even though the average daily inmate population for Rikers was half that of all county jails in the state combined. Gang and individual assaults involving inmates at Rikers were more than double the corresponding totals at the county jails, and attacks between inmates and personnel were 10 times more frequent. And many categories of serious incidents rose from 2016 to 2017, including fire (up 200 percent), gang assault (up 160 percent) and hospital admission of an inmate (up 2,300 percent). The report, which was obtained by The New York Times, also focused on deficiencies across categories ranging from security and supervision to discipline and visitation, exposing “conditions that are unsecure, unsanitary and dangerous, for staff and inmates alike.” Investigators found broken pieces of metal and glass, as well as holes and divots, in the exercise yards at the Anna M. Kross Center, a 40-acre unit at Rikers that houses male detainees. At the Robert N. Davoren Center, another male detention unit, they found that prisoners requiring constant observation were being supervised by officers of the opposite gender, while inmates were able to “pop open” secured cell doors. And across the complex, there were instances of unmanned security posts, poor record-keeping, papered-over security cameras, rodent infestation, water leaks, sagging floors and expired fire extinguishers. Even the basic requirements for laundry services were not being met, with inmates washing their personal clothing in buckets in their cells and hanging them to dry, obscuring sight lines of correction officers. Reached by phone in advance of the report’s release, Jonathan Lippman, the former chief judge of the state’s highest court who chaired the independent commission on Rikers, said he could not comment without knowing its contents. Some state lawmakers said they hoped the report would lend urgency to the push to close Rikers. Last year, Brian A. Benjamin, a Democratic state senator whose district includes Harlem, sponsored legislation that called for Rikers to close within three years. “It’s a very aggressive timeline, but what we are seeing requires aggressive activity on our part,” he said. “Ten years is way too long. I want it done before people leave office because you have no idea who could be the next mayor and what the priorities that a new mayor will have.” Continue reading the main story","Despite heightened scrutiny from state and federal officials, violent incidents at the Rikers Island jail complex have risen from 2016 to 2017.",2018-02-14T10:00:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York State May Move to Close Rikers Ahead of City’s 10-Year Timeline,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/nyregion/rikers-island-jail-closing-timeline.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/14/nyregion/14rikers1/14rikers1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Complex fire,1
Tom McKay,"Authorities have charged 27-year-old Bethesda, Maryland stock trader Daniel L. Beckwitt with involuntary manslaughter and second-degree murder after worker Askia Khafra died in a fire while building an elaborate 200-foot network of underground tunnels designed to protect Beckwitt from a North Korean nuclear attack. According to the New York Times, police and firefighters arrived at Beckwitt’s home on September 10th, 2017 to find Khafra’s dead body in the tunnel complex under it, leading to his indictment on May 31st: Police officers and firefighters responded and spoke with Mr. Beckwitt. In the basement, they “discovered the naked, charred body of a deceased male,” court documents said. They also found a hole in the basement floor, with an entrance shaft that dropped about 20 feet down and fanned out into tunnels spanning about 200 feet underground. The man who was found dead, Askia Khafra, 21, had been working to dig the tunnels. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was smoke inhalation and thermal injuries. Beckwitt’s lawyer, Robert C. Bonsib, told the Times his client had made “seven figure” profits trading stocks and “was concerned about the increase in international tensions, and in particular North Korea’s acquisition of long-range ballistic missiles, and he was in the process of building a secure location for himself.” Authorities alleged in court documents that the home was in “hoarder” conditions and the underground complex was “served by a haphazard daisy-chain of extension cords and plug extenders that created substantial risk of fire,” the Times wrote, and that Beckwitt was aware of a fire risk and Khafra’s reports of the smell of smoke when he flipped a circuit breaker before the incident. They also claimed Beckwitt lied about the location of the home and only drove him to the work site in blackout glasses. Beckwitt’s side of the story, Bonsib told the Times, is that Khafra was an “experienced, willing participant” with pre-existing business relationships with Beckwitt, who worked several times on the complex, and who used the opportunity to snap photos for social media. Beckwitt says he tried twice to rescue Khafra but was overcome by smoke inhalation. Beckwitt faces a maximum sentence of 10 years if found guilty of manslaughter and 30 if found guilty of second-degree murder, the Times wrote. Though the Times described the tunnel complex only briefly, Swiss federal engineer Cédric Vuilleumier told the paper in a separate interview that the process of building a shelter capable of surviving a nuclear detonation is somewhat more complex than digging holes underneath one’s house: Start with what Vuilleumier calls a “protective envelope” of concrete and reinforced steel rebar with walls between one foot and 2-feet-7-inches thick. Don’t build near anything flammable. Your budget may allow for more spaciousness, but plan for a minimum of nine square feet per person, which is what Switzerland provides. Install eight-inch-thick concrete and steel doors that open out. Add a ventilation and air-filtration system that can be operated with a hand crank in case of a power failure. While the defendant’s prophesied nuclear war has not as of yet materialized, North Korea has spent the past few years stepping up development of long-range missiles that could potentially be used to deliver a nuclear warhead. How close the nation is to truly having intercontinental nuclear strike capability remains unclear—they are believed to have miniaturized warheads, though not necessarily missiles advanced enough to deliver them to the mainland US. That distinction may not matter on the Korean peninsula itself. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper recently told Bloomberg that his impression is that North Korean commanders believe they have already achieved a functional nuclear deterrent capable of deterring the conventional military superiority of US-backed South Korea. President Donald Trump’s administration is still preparing for a summit with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un, who CNN reported seems to have been replacing key officials with “younger Kim loyalists” who could help the autocrat retain control of potential outside investment if a deal is reached. However, such a deal is far from certain and the possibility remains that even if the summit does happen, it could fall through and leave both nations at the current status quo or worse.

"Madison Park, CNN","(CNN) It may take until September to contain the largest fire in California history, which is now nearly the size of Los Angeles. So far, two firefighters have been injured while fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire, which consists of two fires -- the Ranch Fire and the River Fire -- in Northern California. The pair have burned 292,692 acres and was 34% contained as of Tuesday evening. The colossal fire altogether has destroyed 75 residences, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Cal Fire estimated that full containment could take until September 1. The Mendocino Complex Fire ignited on July 27. Last year's Thomas Fire, which is the second-largest fire in California history, took more than six months to extinguish after burning 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Firefighters in the state are currently battling 17 large fires. Trump weighs in on wildfires This week, President Donald Trump appeared to blame California's environmental protection laws for the cataclysmic fires. Administration officials declined to offer any clarity on Trump's series of tweets. Trump claimed in his tweet that the fires were being ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized."" He also added that water in the state was ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" in a tweet that named California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""This does not merit a response,"" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman. Environmental scientists, California water experts and local officials have disputed Trump's claims. ""It is climate change that is causing this,"" says Michael Mohler, spokesman for Cal Fire. ""There is no other way to explain explosive fuel conditions, that come with increased winds and higher temperatures."" California's multiyear drought ended last year, but it also left a lot of dried and weakened plants and trees. ""You don't recover from six years of drought overnight,"" Mohler said. California has approximately more than 100 million dead trees in the state due to drought and infestation from bark beetles. Dead trees pose a major hazard as they allow wildfires to spread rapidly in hot, dry conditions. Cal Fire's vegetation management crews are out year-round to thin and remove such trees, while also doing prescribed burns. Experts cite hotter temperatures causing lengthier fire seasons, that burn up dry, dead vegetation as factors for more wildfires. Other fires in the state continue Cal Fire reported that warm temperatures, with highs in the 90s and triple digits, are expected in most areas of the state -- which isn't good news for firefighters. But a slight cooling is in the forecast for the weekend. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling the wildfires across the state. The second biggest fire in California is the Carr Fire, located in Shasta County in the northern part of the state. The deadly fire has been burning for more than two weeks and consumed 172,055 acres, as of Tuesday evening. It has killed seven people and destroyed more than 1,100 homes. The next largest fire is the Ferguson Fire, near Yosemite National Park, with 94,992 acres. That fire which has lasted more than three week, has killed two people.

Natasha Lomas,"A UK government backed drone innovation project that’s exploring how unmanned aerial vehicles could benefit cities — including for use-cases such as medical delivery, traffic incident response, fire response and construction and regeneration — has reported early learnings from the first phase of the project. Five city regions are being used as drone test-beds as part of Nesta’s Flying High Challenge — namely London, the West Midlands, Southampton, Preston and Bradford. While five socially beneficial use-cases for drone technology have been analyzed as part of the project so far, including considering technical, social and economic implications of the tech. The project has been ongoing since December. Nesta, the innovation-focused charity behind the project and the report, wants the UK to become a global leader in shaping drone systems that place people’s needs first, and writes in the report that: “Cities must shape the future of drones: Drones must not shape the future of cities.” In the report it outlines some of the challenges facing urban implementations of drone technology and also makes some policy recommendations. It also says that socially beneficial use-cases have come out as an early winner over of cities to the potential of the tech — over and above “commercial or speculative” applications such as drone delivery or for carrying people in flying taxis. The five use-cases explored thus far via the project are: Medical delivery within London — a drone delivery network for carrying urgent medical products between NHS facilities, which would routinely carry products such as pathology samples, blood products and equipment over relatively short distances between hospitals in a network Traffic incident response in the West Midlands — responding to traffic incidents in the West Midlands to support the emergency services prior to their arrival and while they are on-site, allowing them to allocate the right resources and respond more effectively Fire response in Bradford — emergency response drones for West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service. Drones would provide high-quality information to support emergency call handlers and fire ground commanders, arriving on the scene faster than is currently possible and helping staff plan an appropriate response for the seriousness of the incident Construction and regeneration in Preston — drone services supporting construction work for urban projects. This would involve routine use of drones prior to and during construction, in order to survey sites and gather real-time information on the progress of works Medical delivery across the Solent — linking Southampton across the Solent to the Isle of Wight using a delivery drone. Drones could carry light payloads of up to a few kilos over distances of around 20 miles, with medical deliveries of products being a key benefit Flagging up technical and regulatory challenges to scaling the use of drones beyond a few interesting experiments, Nest writes: “In complex environments, flight beyond the operator’s visual line of sight, autonomy and precision flight are key, as is the development of an unmanned traffic management (UTM) system to safely manage airspace. In isolation these are close to being solved — but making these work at large scale in a complex urban environment is not.” “While there is demand for all of the use cases that were investigated, the economics of the different use cases vary: Some bring clear cost savings; others bring broader social benefits. Alongside technological development, regulation needs to evolve to allow these use cases to operate. And infrastructure like communications networks and UTM systems will need to be built,” it adds. The report also emphasizes the importance of public confidence, writing that: “Cities are excited about the possibilities that drones can bring, particularly in terms of critical public services, but are also wary of tech-led buzz that can gloss over concerns of privacy, safety and nuisance. Cities want to seize the opportunity behind drones but do it in a way that responds to what their citizens demand.” And the charity makes an urgent call for the public to be brought into discussions about the future of drones. “So far the general public has played very little role,” it warns. “There is support for the use of drones for public benefit such as for the emergency services. In the first instance, the focus on drone development should be on publicly beneficial use cases.” Giving the combined (and intertwined) complexity of regulatory, technical and infrastructure challenges standing in the way of developing viable drone service implementations, Nesta is also recommending the creation of testbeds in which drone services can be developed with the “facilities and regulatory approvals to support them”. “Regulation will also need to change: Routine granting of permission must be possible, blanket prohibitions in some types of airspace must be relaxed, and an automated system of permissions — linked to an unmanned traffic management system — needs to be put in place for all but the most challenging uses. And we will need a learning system to share progress on regulation and governance of the technology, within the UK and beyond, for instance with Eurocontrol,” it adds. “Finally, the UK will need to invest in infrastructure, whether this is done by the public or private sector, to develop the communications and UTM infrastructure required for widespread drone operation.” In conclusion Nesta argues there is “clear evidence that drones are an opportunity for the UK” — pointing to the “hundreds” of companies already operating in the sector; and to UK universities with research strengths in the area; as well as suggesting public authorities could save money or provide “new and better services thanks to drones”. At the same time it warns that UK policy responses to drones are lagging those of “leading countries” — suggesting the country could squander the chance to properly develop some early promise. “The US, EU, China, Switzerland and Singapore in particular have taken bigger steps towards reforming regulations, creating testbeds and supporting businesses with innovative ideas. The prize, if we get this right, is that we shape this new technology for good — and that Britain gets its share of the economic spoils.” You can read the full report here.","A UK government backed drone innovation project that’s exploring how unmanned aerial vehicles could benefit cities — including for use-cases such as medical delivery, traffic incident response, fire response and construction and regeneration — has reported ea…",2018-07-23T12:26:55Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Drone development should focus on social good first, says UK report",http://techcrunch.com/2018/07/23/drone-development-should-focus-on-social-good-first-says-uk-report/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_4165.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Complex fire,1

Media captionNairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation
Nine people have been arrested in Kenya following an attack on a luxury hotel compound in the capital Nairobi that killed at least 21 people.
All five militants who stormed the DusitD2 hotel and business complex on Tuesday have been killed, officials say, and a major hunt is under way to find those who helped organise it.
Somalia-based Islamist group al-Shabab says it was behind the attack.
Kenya's Red Cross says everyone who was missing has now been accounted for.
What do we know about the attackers?
Kenyan media reports that the wife of one of the suspected attackers has been arrested in Kiambu county, just north of Nairobi.
Police said they had identified Ali Salim Gichunge, also known as Farouk, through the car used in the attack.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Police stand guard outside the home of one of the suspected attackers, in Kiambu County
Neighbours told The Standard newspaper that he and his wife had moved in to their home in October. The couple were secretive, they said, and had put the contents of their home up for sale before the attack, saying they were ""moving out of Nairobi this week"".
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 The attackers, two of which are shown here, were caught on CCTV as they entered the complex
President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Tuesday that five jihadis carried out the attack, and all were ""eliminated"" by security forces after a 19-hour siege.
Al-Shabab issued a statement calling the attack ""a response"" to US President Donald Trump's controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
A White House National Security Council spokesman responded by saying: ""This senseless act is a stark reminder of why the United States remains resolved in our fight to defeat radical Islamist terrorism.""
Who are the victims? 
Details are starting to come through of those who lost their lives. A policeman was revealed to be among the dead as the death toll rose on Wednesday. 
Kenyan James Oduor, commonly known as Cobra, had tweeted about the attack as it unfolded. The LG Electronics worker, who died on the eve of his birthday, was well-liked and known for his love of football.
Two Kenyan friends, Abdalla Dahir and Feisal Ahmed, were having lunch together in the grounds of the hotel when the suicide bomber struck, Reuters news agency reports. Friends described the pair as inseparable. 
US citizen Jason Spindler is among the dead. His brother, Jonathan, announced on Twitter that Jason had survived the 9/11 attacks in New York in 2001. 
In an interview with US broadcaster NBC, Sarah Spindler said her son had been trying to ""make a positive change in the third world in emerging markets"".

 A burial ceremony has been held for friends Abdalla Dahir and Feisal Ahmed
How did the attack unfold?
The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Tuesday. The gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say.
Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days.
At 23:00, a government official said that all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. But gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported just an hour later, and there was more heavy gunfire at about 07:00 on Wednesday.
Security forces then combed their way through the building where frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside, hiding in offices, toilets and even under tables.
Nairobi's DusitD2 hotel
The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants.
In all, some 700 people were evacuated from the complex, officials said. Twenty-eight people were admitted to hospital with injuries.
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 Many civilians were trapped in the complex for several hours
Some of those killed had been dining in the Secret Garden restaurant. Other bodies were found on the third floor of the 101 room hotel.
Who are al-Shabab?
They oppose the Somali government, but have carried out attacks throughout East Africa.
In September 2013, al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers.
During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed.

Robin Seemangal,"The long-awaited Falcon Heavy rocket roared to life on Wednesday at 12:30 pm Eastern, as SpaceX fired up the 27 Merlin engines that power the triple-booster rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Perched atop what CEO Elon Musk claims will be the most powerful lift vehicle in the world is the billionaire’s Tesla Roadster, which will launch toward a Mars elliptical orbit on the Falcon Heavy’s upcoming maiden flight. The firing lasted a whopping 12 seconds, creating a mountain range of exhaust plumes that surrounded the facility and rattled the space coast with over 5 million pounds of thrust power. A loud rumbling lasted most of the firing, capped by a giant boom. SpaceX rolled out the Falcon Heavy to Launch Complex 39A earlier this month in advance of the test fire, amidst reports that SpaceX’s previous satellite delivery, Zuma, may have not made it to orbit. (The Air Force has since confirmed that the company is not responsible.) The Falcon Heavy remained at 39A over the last two weeks, as SpaceX planned and then pushed back the test, day by day. First, sensors picked up an issue with ground equipment during a dress rehearsal. Then further delays pushed the static fire to January 19, but SpaceX competitor ULA first had to launch a mission for the Air Force from a nearby pad at Cape Canaveral. When that launch was scrubbed, SpaceX was pushed and then delayed again due to the government shutdown. No launch providers can operate at the Cape without personnel and assistance from the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing—who finally returned to work after after President Trump signed a bill on Monday ending the government shutdown. Soon after, sources confirmed that SpaceX would run a full wet dress rehearsal on Wednesday at pad 39A followed by a static fire of the Falcon Heavy. Launch Complex 39A has a legacy of hosting the world’s most powerful rockets—at least the most powerful of their eras. The Saturn V was launched from the pad with the crew of Apollo 11 and later, would host flights of the Space Shuttle program. But because previous vehicles were primarily test-fired elsewhere, Cape Canaveral has never seen a hold-down fire as powerful as the one conducted with Falcon Heavy. The engine test was contained to pad 39A’s flame trench, built to withstand the acoustics, heat, and vibration produced by the rocket. (SpaceX compared the Falcon Heavy’s power to that of 18 Boeing 747s taking off at the same time.) Musk claims that the world’s next-most powerful rocket, the United Launch Alliance Delta-4 Heavy, is dwarfed by the Falcon Heavy’s capability by a “factor of two,” and SpaceX advertises as much on their website. According to ULA, the Delta-4 Heavy can generate up to 2.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. Musk has been publicizing the Falcon Heavy since 2011, when he unveiled plans for the rocket at a press conference in Washington, DC, floating the idea that SpaceX could launch as soon as 2013. But development delays, a failure of the Falcon 9 during a NASA launch in 2015, and the disaster at Pad 40 in September 2016 set the company’s plans back. After leasing what Musk calls the “Times Square” of launch pads, SpaceX built a large hangar at the base of Launch Complex 39A to house its boosters and began manufacturing a new strongback—the device that transports, erects, and launches rockets—that could manage the 230-foot-tall Falcon Heavy. The facility also required upgrades to electrical systems and the water-based sound suppression system to accommodate the enormous vibration created by a heavy-lift vehicle. Last summer, at the ISS R&amp;D conference in Washington, Musk attempted to manage expectations for the Falcon Heavy’s maiden flight, which is planned before the end of the month. Simply not destroying Pad 39A would be a “win” for SpaceX, he said, let alone making it to orbit. Even just firing the Falcon Heavy’s 27 engines was going to be complex despite its makeup of proven hardware. “It actually ended up being way harder to do Falcon Heavy than we thought,” Musk said. “At first it sounds real easy. You just stick two first stages on as strap-on boosters. How hard can that be? But then everything changes.” The Falcon Heavy demo vehicle is comprised of a brand-new central core booster and two previously flown Falcon 9 boosters. About eight minutes after the rocket’s anticipated liftoff from pad 39A, if all goes according to plan, SpaceX hopes to fly back the core booster to Of Course I Still Love You, a robotic landing ship parked in the Atlantic ocean. The two side boosters will be flown back almost simultaneously to Cape Canaveral for touchdowns at Landing Zone 1 and the newly completed Landing Zone 2. The event will be a reminder of the Space Shuttle era when loud back-to-back sonic booms jolted Cape Canaveral during both launch and landing. Following what SpaceX hopes will be a successful demonstration of the Falcon Heavy, the company has four listed missions flying atop the rocket on its manifest. Three are relatively routine satellite deliveries that could have been launched on the ESA’s Ariane-5 and the ULA Delta Heavy. And one the Air Force notably decided to take a risk on by purchasing a still-untested Falcon Heavy for their STP-2 satellite bundle launch. The Planetary Society, founded by Carl Sagan and now headed by Bill Nye, will fly its Lightsail 2 spacecraft as a secondary payload on the Air Force’s mission. How will a Falcon Heavy mission differ from one flown on a Falcon 9? Far heavier payloads going to geostationary orbit––over 22,000 miles above Earth’s surface—and beyond. The Falcon Heavy can lift 50,000 pounds to that destination, 37,000 to Mars, and a little under 8,000 to Pluto according to SpaceX. “While Falcon 9 can accomplish the vast majority of space industry missions, Falcon Heavy will round out all the possibilities for launching spacecraft into LEO, GTO, and beyond—including planetary exploration like Europa or Mars,” explains Phil Larson, a former White House and SpaceX communications official. “It will give NASA and the Pentagon more options for accomplishing their missions for less, and will open up the possibilities for missions that previously were thought unachievable.” That is, if it can launch at all.",Elon Musk’s personal Tesla Roadster was perched on top the triple-booster rocket as its 27 Merlin engines roared to life.,2018-01-24T18:02:14Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",SpaceX Test Fires Its Falcon Heavy Rocket for the First Time,https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-test-fires-its-falcon-heavy-rocket-for-the-first-time/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a4fde6644fdf947740157ae/191:100/pass/SpaceXFalconHeavy-FeatureImage.jpg,wired,Wired,Complex fire,1

Noah Berger/AFP/Getty Images As firefighters work to contain one deadly wildfire in Northern California, another is rapidly expanding, threatening new communities and prompting fresh evacuations. As other wildfires in California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho continue to burn vast swathes of land, firefighters have been stretched thin battling the numerous blazes. The headline-grabbing Carr Fire, located in Northern California near the city of Redding, is now 45 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The immediate threat to people's homes has been greatly reduced, Sonja Hutson of member station KQED reports. A firefighter walks along a containment line while battling a wildfire in Redding, Calif., on July 28. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP At least seven people have been killed in that fire, which has burned more than 160,000 acres of land over the past two weeks. Late last week, state fire officials announced that the Carr Fire had become the sixth most destructive fire in California history. Inmate firefighters take a break from battling the River Fire in Lakeport, Calif., on Aug. 1. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Meanwhile, attention has shifted to the Mendocino Complex Fire, which at 273,000 acres is now even larger than the Carr Fire and poses a threat to more than 9,000 structures northwest of Sacramento. It is the second-largest wildfire in state history, according to the Weather Channel. A firefighter gathers water from a pool while battling the Ranch Fire near Clearlake Oaks, Calif., on Saturday. Noah Berger/AFP/Getty Images It's called a ""complex"" because it consists of two fires being fought simultaneously, KQED's Hutson explains — the River and the Ranch fires. ""The fires... are burning really close together in Mendocino and Lake counties, which are about 20 miles north of the Napa wine country,"" she tells NPR's Morning Edition. ""As a whole, they're 33 percent contained. There's over 9,000 structures threatened and 130 destroyed, so they are very destructive."" Debbie Prior leads a horse to safety as the Ranch Fire tears down New Long Valley Road near Clearlake Oaks, Calif., on Saturday. The Ranch Fire is part of the Mendocino Complex. Noah Berger/AFP/Getty Images The communities in the region are largely rural and low-income, which makes the fires even more devastating, she says. ""There's really a lack of affordable housing in the area, so low-income people whose houses get burned down will usually go to where ever they have friends and family they can stay with in the immediate aftermath of the fire,"" Hutson says. ""And if that's not in the area, they can miss out on a lot of help from nonprofits and the government in getting them back into housing in the area where they have lived for years."" Alex Schenck carries a water bucket while fighting to save his home near Clearlake Oaks, Calif. on Saturday, as the Ranch Fire approached. Noah Berger/AFP/Getty Images Farther south, the Ferguson Fire — burning for three weeks now — has forced the indefinite closure of the most popular part of Yosemite National Park. At the same time, fires are also burning in Idaho, Washington and Oregon. The numerous simultaneous blazes have strained the nation's firefighting resources.

David Murphy,"If youve ever built a desktop PCand if you havent, you should give it a trythen youve probably had at least one (or possibly a number) of mishaps. It happens. Computers are still a little complex, whether youre building a basic rig or cooling your system with scary, parts-destroying liquids.
With more than two decades worth of PC-building experience, I have plenty of stories of my own building failures. Most involve nicking my finger on the sharp edges of a CPU cooler and not noticing that Im dripping blood on my motherboard until its too late. However, there was that one time I plugged an IDE power cable upside-down into my hard drive, causing the wire to catch fire and shoot smoke all around my case. And, of course, those oh god is it leaking yes its leaking moments from my many adventures in water-cooling.
Tragic as some of these instances might be, theyre always great learning opportunities. With that in mind, I recently stumbled across a great lets talk about all the times we screwed something up thread from the mighty /r/buildapc communityone of my favorite subreddits. 
I recommend reading the entire thread, since the others failings could help keep you from making a costly mistake the next time you go tinkering around with the insides of your desktop PC. If youre looking for a few quick hits, here are a few of my favorite stories of woe:
Always check your cables. Always.
I disconnected my SSD to do some cable management. Reconnected it and couldnt boot into Windows anymore. Tried to disconnect/reconnect it many times. Nada. Figured the SSD just died.
Ordered a new SSD. I connect it and then figured I never reconnected sata power to the old SSD, only data.
Never told my wife I changed that SSD for nothing.
Few weeks ago my Z170 mobo died. She asked if it died, or if it died. Shes onto me...
Redditors jgodin03 story is a familiar one. As I mentioned, I once accidentally inserted a HDD power cable backwards, but didnt realize at the time that the fried cable was what caused a bit of smoke and stink to emanate from my chassis. What I did notice, however, was that my primary hard drive wasnt turning on. And when I looked at the cabling and assumed everything was correctly plugged in, I started fretting about the possibility of my (not backed up at the time) hard drive being toast.
Again, this an issue that got a bit out of hand as a result of my anxiety at the time (move-in day for my freshman year of college) and my lack of general troubleshooting know-how. As the Reddit poster no doubt learned, its a lot easier to test, test, and retest cables than to buy a brand-new drive, replace it, and dab away the tears from all the data you assumed you lost. One of the first major steps of troubleshooting I typically try is unplugging and reconnecting everything in my desktop systemyou never know when the cable you thought you plugged in actually didnt connect. If that doesnt work, I try other cables, break out a second power supply, etc. The less I have to remove and replace actual hardware, the better.
Can you remember the last time you cleaned your desktop PC? I dont mean wiping some guacamole off

I havent made mrwillard95's mistake myself, but its a classic one that could ensnare any inexperienced PC builder. Remember, most power supplies have a switch on the rear that you need to turn on before you can use the switch on your PC to turn everything on. Ignore the switch, and your plugged-in PSU wont do anythingnor will your PC turn on.
(This is also handy to know if youre ever jumping into your case to mess with your system. Not only should it be offof coursebut youll want to either unplug the PSU entirely or flick that switch to ensure that no power can go to your motherboard or your systems other components.)

Dont forget that IO shield, either
Spent a few hours meticulously building my PC making sure to do everything correctly. Get it all installed and find out the IO plate goes on the inside of the case and dose not snap on from the outside.
I am ashamed to admit that Ive repeated Cantstandyuhs issue many, many times. So much so, that I now make an effort to place my motherboards IO shield in a cant-miss-it location before I attach my motherboard to its tray. Its so easy to miss this step in all the excitement of a new PC build, but its one that will cost you precious time later, as youll probably have to pop out your graphics card, disconnect a few cables, and unscrew your motherboard in order to free up enough space to squeeze your IO shield into place. 
Sure, your system will work fine without one, but an IO shield helps keep dust out of your system (at minimum) and makes the back of your case look great.

What the what
I decided to sell my Ryzen 1600x for a 2700x when the 2xxx series released. Removed the 1600x to ship out after it went on eBay, realized I needed it to update the bios for my 2700x.
I figured I would just drop the 1600x back in, lay the case on its side and use gravity to hold the cpu cooler (not plugged in) on top as a heatsink so I wouldnt have to waste time/thermal paste.
After I installed the new bios, I turned off my monitor, grabbed the cpu cooler off the top of my cpu, promptly forgot my desktop was still running, and flipped the pin to release the cpu while grabbing it to remove it.
Ended up both electrocuting and burning my fingertips as well as throwing the cpu against the wall when I jerked away by reflex. By some miracle nothing broke.
This sordid tale from Kasilim is a great reminder that cutting corners might sound like a great idea on paper, but it can sometimes lead to near-disastrous results. Weve all been there, thoughmounting a graphics card without screwing it into the case, jumping your system on by poking the motherboards front-panel headers with a screwdriver, assuming that your liquid-cooling setup is perfect and doesnt need a leak test before you install it in your case, et cetera. Im glad this mistake didnt result in a total catastrophe, but it doesnt hurt to spend those extra few minutes of work to ensure you dont accidentally destroy your expensive components.

Cooling is, and will forever be, important
Removed my CPU Cooler when trying to troubleshoot my first build when it wasnt booting. Forgot to replace it and a few boot attempts later wondered why I could see a bit of smoke and smell burning.
If it wasnt broken before, it sure it was then!
Remember, your computers natural tendency is to get hot. While Neilshhs system should have powered off before it reached a critical temperature, you dont want to be putting your pricey electronics in that kind of a predicament. Make sure your fans are always secured and workingboth your cases fans, as well as the fans cooling your CPU and GPU. And dont forget to clean all those intake vents so you can get great airflow, too.

PC parts can be a little sharp
During my A+ test in school we had to take apart a PC and put it back together and it had to work to pass the test. Easy enough I did this often. Well the test computer cases were cheap and I cut open my finger and was bleeding pretty bad. I wrapped my finger in some notebook paper and finished the build, praying it would boot after I got blood on the MB and other parts. To my amazement it booted, I passed the test and went straight to urgent care to get some butterfly bandages.
Been there, done that, Oshien. I usually slice my fingers on the metal fins of the bulky aftermarket coolers. It doesnt sting, so I dont tend even notice something happened until I see a red splot on my motherboard. Then I make a quick trip to the bathroom for some rubbing alcohol (for the mobo) and a band-aid (for me).
Always use the standoffs
I may have screwed a motherboard directly into a case without the risers this one time... 
Standoffs come in your motherboards bag of screws for a reason. Use them, and avoid IM_the_Marks big mistake. Yes, you should use the ones that come with your motherboard; dont try to swap in your own substitutions.
Your CPU is very delicate
I once had to RMA a reallllyy expensive TR (thread ripper) board. I picked up the cpu and dropped it right in the socket. Every single contact and pin on the lower half of the chipset bent at a 90° angle. Thanks to msi though for fixing it a fair price of 300usd.
Those little pins on the bottom of your processor are precious. Treat them gently. Do not get thermal paste all over them. Do not bend them. Do everything you can to ensure that they dont get bent when youre doing anything involving the CPU, because one tiny drop at an unfortunate angle could cause a world of expensive hurt. Right, D3M0N2?
Oh, and dont throw your CPU. In fact, do everything you can to ensure it doesnt go flying... anywhere.
Make sure you know what youre connecting
My worst mistake, which thankfully was benign, was plugging in the front panel connectors to a spare USB 2 header.
The motherboard was kinda dense in the area the power header was on, so they put the silkscreen for the panel header next to the USB 2 header with a little light line over to the power header, which I overlooked.
It got to the point where we tore down my sons old PC to harvest the power supply (it was a build for him) because I was sure I had gotten a bunk one, and I realized my mistake as I was reconnecting the front panel.
He still tells me to make sure and plug in the right connections whenever I build stuff now. I dont think Im ever going to live that one down, lol.
Thankfully it was none the worse for wear since the header was never powered.
While some parts of your motherboard should look pretty familiar to experienced PC builders, Short_Bus_Driver shows why it never hurts to pull out the manual and triple-check that youre connecting your cables correctly. There might be some alternative use for a connection you dont know about, or you might need to check your BIOS and enable the connection before it actually does anythingthings like that. Take some time to fully understand your motherboards options the first time you build your system, and youll probably be set (as long as you arent forgetful) the next time you make an upgrade or fiddle with your systems wiring.","If you’ve ever built a desktop PC—and if you haven’t, you should give it a try—then you’ve probably had at least one (or possibly a number) of mishaps.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them California's biggest wildfire on record is expected to burn for the rest of the month, fire officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex Fire has already engulfed 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles. Barely a third of it is under control, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Firefighters are tackling 18 major blazes across the state amid strong winds and low humidity. The fire - which comprises two blazes in the state's north - was declared the biggest in California's history on Monday. Officials had set a target to extinguish the fire by mid-August, but they now say they will need until early September. The fire has burned 75 buildings and led to thousands of evacuations. A separate blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more that 1,500 structures. Burning through almost 160,000 acres, it was 47% contained by late Monday. Meanwhile, more fires have been breaking out, adding to the mammoth workload of fire crews. The so-called Holy Fire, in southern California, grew dramatically and rapidly on Monday, with two hikers needing to be airlifted to safety. How are firefighters coping? At least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but they also receive $2 (£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires. Firefighters told the LA Times about their gruelling schedule. One said his crew had slept - sitting up - in the seats of their fire engine on some nights. ""It's been pretty crazy - they're calling this the new norm,"" said Omar Estorga, captain of a crew working on the Carr Fire. ""In years past, there were one or two big fires a year. Now they're doing three to four huge fires in a week."" Nearly half of the 10 largest California wildfires on record have occurred in the past decade, according to Reuters news agency. Officials have rejected a theory, tweeted by President Donald Trump, that the fires' spread was being ""made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Deputy fire chief Mr Mclean dismissed Mr Trump's comments to US media, saying firefighters had ""plenty of water"" to carry out their work. Will it get worse? National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned that conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation.

TARIQ PANJA and MANUELA ANDREONI,"That much was clear at a memorial for the 10 players who died at Flamengo. Midway through the service, a team official rushed to cover a large montage of photos of the boys: someone had realized that a player who survived had been mistakenly included.
The streets of Xerém, about 50 kilometers outside Rio, teem with boys of various ages in red, green and white jerseys the colors of the Fluminense soccer club.
Until the team built its training complex there, Xerém was little more than a swamp, locals say. But now, despite the humid heat that tops 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is home to players and families whose lives revolve around the club.
Among them earlier this year was an 11-year-old nicknamed Maradoninha, for his resemblance to the former Argentine great Diego Maradona. Even in this hotly competitive town, Maradoninha was attracting attention.
Two years ago, a talent scout from Fluminense saw the boy, whose real name is Leandro Gomes Feitosa, play in a local tournament and approached his family. The boy was only 9, and Brazilian law does not allow soccer clubs to house children under 14. But if the family could get to Rio, the scout said, Fluminense would train him.
 A group of local businessmen put up the money for a cut of future proceeds and the family moved more than 1,200 miles, from the town of Palmas to Xerém, to pursue the dream.
Almost all the families living in their community of 26 rowhouses have a similar story, Maradoninhas father, Evandro Feitosa, said.",Young players with dreams of glory think elite training programs lead to riches.

MAX FISHER,"The Facebook employees who meet to set the guidelines, mostly young engineers and lawyers, try to distill highly complex issues into simple yes-or-no rules. Then the company outsources much of the actual post-by-post moderation to companies that enlist largely unskilled workers, many hired out of call centers.
Those moderators, at times relying on Google Translate, have mere seconds to recall countless rules and apply them to the hundreds of posts that dash across their screens each day. When is a reference to jihad, for example, forbidden? When is a crying laughter emoji a warning sign?
Moderators express frustration at rules they say dont always make sense and sometimes require them to leave up posts they fear could lead to violence. You feel like you killed someone by not acting, one said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement.
Facebook executives say they are working diligently to rid the platform of dangerous posts.

Jennifer Calfas,"The Mendocino Complex Fire rapidly became the largest wildfire in California history. And it’s still burning. The fast-moving inferno, sparked Friday, July 27 in Northern California, has now scorched 290,692 acres and is just 34% contained, according to California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The Mendocino Complex Fire is comprised of two neighboring fires that have scorched through thousands of acres each day and destroyed 75 homes. It continues to threaten 9,300 homes and structures in Lake, Mendocino and Colusa counties as nearly 4,000 firefighters work to take hold of the aggressive flames. At more than 290,692 acres, the fire spans more than 454.2 square miles. That’s almost the size of Los Angeles, nearly double the size of Chicago, and more than triple the size of cities like Philadelphia, Detroit, Portland, Atlanta and Las Vegas. Here’s what to know about California’s largest ever wildfire. Where is the Mendocino Complex Fire? The Mendocino Complex fire is burning in Colusa, Lake and Mendocino counties, just north of wine country in Northern California. The fire surrounds Clear Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in the state, a vital habitat for fish and other wildfire and a spot for water sports enthusiasts. The fire itself has burned through the southern portion of the Mendocino National Forest and continues to threaten surrounding towns. Is there one fire, or are there two? The Mendocino Complex Fire is comprised of two twin fires: the River Fire and the Ranch Fire. Fire officials use the term “complex” fire to describe two or more fire incidents in the same area that are under the same operational control. It doesn’t mean that the fires have necessarily joined — and in the case of the Mendocino Complex Fire, the River Fire and the Ranch Fire have yet to meet. The Ranch Fire is the bigger of the two, scorching 241,772 acres at just 20% containment. The expansive fire is burning north of Clear Lake and through the Mendocino National Forest. The River Fire is smaller, scorching 48,920 acres so far, and burning to the west of Clear Lake. Firefighters have achieved 78% containment on it as of Tuesday morning, making significant progress over Monday night. A number of complex fires fill the list of the top 20 largest wildfires in California history, including the 192,038-acre Klamath Theater Complex Fire near the Oregon state line in June 2008. How many homes have been destroyed by the Mendocino Complex Fire? Seventy-five homes and 68 other structures have been destroyed by the fire so far. Another 12 homes and 14 structures have been damaged, too, and 9,300 homes and other buildings are still threatened by the inferno, officials say. Has anyone died? There have been no fatalities reported as a result of the Mendocino Complex Fire so far. One firefighter has been injured, according to Cal Fire, but the severity of the injury is unclear. Nine people have died as a result of other fires in the state since July, however. That includes a great-grandmother and her two great-grandchildren, all of whom died in their Redding, Calif., home as a result of the Carr Fire. How did the Mendocino Complex Fire get so big? The Mendocino Complex Fire grew under conditions ripe for an aggressive, fast-moving wildfire. Bone-dry vegetation, triple-digit temperatures and afternoon winds fueled the fire as it rapidly spread tens of thousands of more acres with each day since it first sparked. Blazing temperatures during the day have exacerbated the wildfire. California is also coming off of a years-long drought and a notably dry winter, making officials anticipate this season could grow far worse. It’s unclear how the Mendocino Complex fire began, as its cause is still under investigation. Many of the largest fires in state history were caused by humans. That can range from anything from a spark from a vehicle that catches fire in dry brush nearby, to, in extreme cases, arson. Sparks from power lines have also been known to spur massive infernos, as well as lightening. What are firefighters doing to stop the Mendocino Complex Fire? More than 3,900 firefighters are working to contain the Mendocino Complex Fire, with more than 60 fire crews and 441 fire engines, according to Cal Fire. Firefighters, with the help of 85 bulldozers, are building and reinforcing containment lines as the fire continues to burn. And these firefighters are are working through the night to stop the blaze. A number of air tankers have been used as well to drop fire retardant, as well as 15 helicopters to help dump water in the area. Firefighters have gained significant momentum on the River Fire portion of the wildfire and will continue to work on containment efforts on the Ranch Fire throughout Tuesday. What was California’s second-largest fire? Before the Mendocino Complex Fire, the Thomas Gire in Ventura and Santa Barbara was the state’s largest-ever fire. It happened in December 2017 — only nine months ago. The 281,893-acre fire destroyed 1,063 structures and prompted tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes. That fire, which burned in Southern California, was fueled tremendously by strong winds of up to 30 to 35 miles per hour, making it difficult for firefighters to use aerial operations to help control the flames.","The Mendocino Complex Fire rapidly became the largest wildfire in California history.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As out-of-control wildfires raged across the West, U.S. firefighting authorities took a seemingly unusual step late last month: they called up Australia and New Zealand and asked for help. It was the first time the southern hemisphere nations had been called on to fight U.S. wildfires since the summer of 2015, when 68 firefighters from Australia and New Zealand spent a month helping stamp out blazes in the Pacific Northwest. But this nearly 20 year old partnership has proven its value time and again over the years, with Australian and New Zealand firefighters coming north during their off-season and vice-versa. Unfortunately, climate change could make the fiery alliance harder to maintain in the future. The U.S. certainly needed the extra hands on deck this summer. About six million acres have burned across the West this year, already a million acres more than the ten-year average. California in particular has been on a seemingly endless tear of destructive, record setting blazes, from the Carr Fire that ripped through Redding in July to the Mendocino Complex, which spawned the biggest single fire in California’s history earlier this month. Mike Ferris, an emergency management specialist with the U.S. Forest Service, told Earther that when the nation hit a National Preparedness Level 5 with respect to fire activity (this happened just after a fire tornado exploded into life near Redding on July 26), international partners were mobilized. This scale, which ranges from 1 to 5, essentially describes how much of the nation’s state and federal firefighting resources are being used. Level 5 means personnel and other resources are basically stretched to the max, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. “When we hit that mark, that means we’re pretty much spread thin, we’ve exceeded the ability to fill [firefighting] orders that are coming in,” Ferris said. In early August, 140 firefighters from Australia and New Zealand arrived at the the National Interagency Fire Center headquarters in Boise, Idaho, after which they were dispatched to help fight the Carr and Mendocino Complex fires in Northern California, as well as several wildfires in Oregon and Washington. According to Ferris, the foreign firefighters could stay through the end of the month or even longer, depending on need. And with the fire situation out West still looking pretty grim, the need could definitely be there. Ferris said that the similarity in command structure, technology, and the types of fires experienced in the hot, dry West and the Australian bush make it easy for Australian firefighters to integrate into U.S brigades. The same is true when Australia calls on U.S. firefighters. “At the very time where we have sent personnel to the U.S. to help with your fires over there, we actually need them over here.” Paradoxically, the partnership also works well because of the distance: Being in opposite hemispheres means Australia and the U.S. experience their worst wildfires at opposite times of the year. But as a warmer climate prolongs fire season on both sides of the equator, Lynne Tolmachoff, chief of public education at CAL-FIRE, told Earther resource sharing “is becoming more and more of a struggle.” A 2016 analysis by Climate Central found that fire season out West is already more than 100 days longer than it was in 1970, “approaching the point where the notion of a fire season will be made obsolete by the reality of year-round wildfires.” Australia faces a similar reality. Despite it currently being austral winter, bushfires have been flaring up by the dozens in New South Wales and Queensland, fueled by prolonged drought and mild temperatures that have turned the region into a tinderbox. In New South Wales, 14 local council areas have already declare bushfire season open, something that normally wouldn’t happen until October, according to Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council. She sees this as an ominous sign, one that’s in line with the findings of a recent Climate Council report (of which Hughes is a member) showing that bushfire season is intensifying the southwest and southeast, placing additional pressure on firefighting personnel and aircraft that are shared with other countries. “At the very time where we have sent personnel to the U.S. to help with your fires over there, we actually need them over here,” she told Earther. “That’s one of the problems with the climate changing—we see extension both at the beginning and end of the fire season as well as the severity ramping up.” David Bowman, a fire ecologist at the University of Tasmania, agreed that the sharing of wildfire resources would become harder as the climate becomes warmer and drier. “Our fire seasons have merged,” he told Earther. “This summer has just been a watershed moment.” He thinks we need accept the fact that the fiery future is upon us and start proactively addressing that through adaptation, whether that means more prescribed fires, stricter building codes, or managed retreat from the wildland-urban interface. Until we’ve figured out how to manage our new pyrotechnic reality, firefighters will find it harder to catch a break as they’re increasingly being flown across the world to battle blazes all year long.","As out-of-control wildfires raged across the West, U.S. firefighting authorities took a seemingly unusual step late last month: they called up Australia and New Zealand and asked for help.

Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the fire which has gutted Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art as ""heartbreaking"". Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at about 23:20 on Friday. The blaze spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". The renovated Mackintosh library had been due to reopen next year. Ms Sturgeon said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. ""My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" The Mackintosh library was destroyed in the blaze that ripped through the building in May 2014. It was being restored in a project estimated to cost up to £35m. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Peter Heath said the fire damage was ""exceptionally significant"". He said it was likely that all the restoration work carried out since the last fire had been destroyed. About 50 firefighters were still tackling Friday's blaze with nine fire engines and four-high reach appliances at the scene. A spokesman said the blaze had now been largely contained, however, a few pockets of fire remained.

An exhibition by graduating students took place at the nearby McLellan Galleries and the school of art's Reid Building. A statement from the school of art described the fire as ""devastating"". It added: ""The Glasgow School of Art's immediate focus is on our students, and on the continuing operation of the GSA to ensure minimum disruption to students and staff. ""The GSA and all of its buildings will remain closed for the next week, and we will provide updates as and when information is available."" Fire crews are concentrating efforts on all four sides of the buildings, from Dalhousie Street to Sauchiehall Street and into Renfrew Street. Nearby homes have been evacuated as a precaution. There are not thought to have been any injuries. At its height, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene. SFRS area manager David Young said: ""The fire has now largely been contained but this remains a protracted incident and our efforts very much continue at this stage to extinguish the fire and ensure the community is protected. ""There will be disruption around Dalhousie Street, Sauchiehall Street and Renfrew Street and I would advise the public to avoid these areas at this present time. Firefighters sent to the scene had been faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said earlier. All floors of the building were affected. Image copyright PA Firefighters used water from the River Clyde to tackle the blaze, resulting in a number of road closures in the area. Insp Catherine McNally, of Police Scotland, praised the response of both the public and nearby licensed premises which were asked to evacuate. The morning after Graham Fraser, BBC news website Image copyright Getty Images Parts of Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street look normal for a Saturday morning. The rain falls heavily on top of chip boxes, the remnants providing breakfast for many a hungry bird. But the presence of fire engines, police officers, bewildered passers-by and an acrid smell of smoke in the air indicate this is far from normal. Smoke still billows from the Glasgow School of Art, the Campus nightclub and the O2 ABC venue, with all the streets around the area closed. Once again, the people of Glasgow are watching on as one of its most famous buildings is on fire. Once again, the words ""so sad"" are heard on every corner. Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinderbox. It's quite shocking,"" he said. Media caption Glasgow School of Art 'extensively damaged' At the scene Aileen Clarke, BBC Scotland Water is still being pumped onto Glasgow School of art this morning, though firefighters now say they have contained the blaze which has so extensively ravaged the Mackintosh building there may still be pockets of fire flaring up. The operation on the ABC building next door they still describe as active firefighting, the fire spread to the roof of that building though it's smoke more than flames visible from the street, now. Deputy assistant chief fire officer Peter Heath says there is damage to every part of the Mackintosh building, and the fire had such a grip of the building when they arrived here just after 23:15 last night, that they don't know where it started let alone how. Initial impressions are that it seems unlikely that any of the restoration work carried out since fire ripped through the building four years ago, will have survived this latest blaze. Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away.

""Last weekend was a joyous occasion, we were celebrating Mackintosh's 150th birthday and the rebirth of the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, the Hill House in Helensburgh is about to have major restoration and we were looking forward to the reopening of this building after four years since the last fire."" 'Like a nightmare' Mr Robertson said he had been in the building a few weeks ago to look at how the restoration was progressing. He said the famous ""hen-run"" had been restored, work on the library was well under way and the studios ""looked amazing"". ""This is like a nightmare,"" he said.

Andrew Freedman,"Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes. The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, expanded from nothing to 31,000 acres in just a few hours thanks to fierce Santa Ana winds. The strong winds also caused power outages, plunging thousands of residents of Santa Barbara and Ventura into the dark as flames rushed in. SEE ALSO: 'We're just existing': What it was like to survive the deadly Northern California wildfires The fire has come close to downtown Ventura, a city of more than 100,000 people about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Social media images taken by evacuating residents show nightmarish scenes of onrushing flames. According to the Ventura County Fire Department, 27,000 people have evacuated. One of the structures that succumbed to the fast-moving flames was a large apartment complex. Santa Ana winds blow offshore, from east to west, tapping into warm and dry conditions inland. Close to the coast, these winds compress the air coming off the hills and mountains to the east, further warming and drying out the air mass, and helping to dry out already combustible vegetation. The fire threat had been anticipated, as the National Weather Service issued a rare ""critical"" fire outlook for Southern California on Tuesday due to the Santa Ana wind event. High wind warnings and red flag warnings were in effect for much of Southern California. The Thomas Fire was visible from space, via the Suomi-NPP satellite as well as other observing platforms. Heat signature from the Thomas Fire depicted from the Suomi-NPP satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: NOAA. Typically, the fire season in Southern California peaks in October, but it can occasionally flare up again in November and December. In this case, a strong area of high pressure has built in across the West, and the clockwise air circulation around that high pressure is responsible for triggering the Santa Ana wind event. The Storm Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service, issued a forecast discussion on Tuesday morning warning that fire weather conditions will further deteriorate during the day, as winds increase, humidity drops, and temperatures climb. The Weather Service has designated parts of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino, and Riverside counties as being in ""extremely critical"" fire weather risk, which is the highest category. These areas could see sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the Storm Prediction Center said, with gusts up to 80 miles per hour in hills and mountains. Relative humidity levels could drop to as low as 4 percent in these areas, the center stated. The immediate Los Angeles metropolitan area is included in the slightly less serious zone of ""critical"" fire danger. The October wildfires that killed more than 40 people and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in northern California also occurred during a period when strong, dry offshore winds were present. Such winds can allow a fire to spread quickly and erratically, including by spreading burning embers far out in front of the main blaze. This hampers firefighting efforts and can force hasty evacuations.","Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes.

Tom McKay,"Employees at a National Weather Service center in Maryland were randomly interrupted by a “message in Chinese” broadcast over the facility’s little-used intercom system on Wednesday, morningthe Washington Post reported. Bizarrely, it also reached “employees by phone” in the same complex. Officials with the agency seem to have no idea how the message was broadcast across the entire National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, with both the intercom message and the phone one coming separately and lasting about 45 seconds. The actual content of the message was fortunately not all that ominous, the Post wrote, with one anonymous employee saying it roughly translated to “You have a package from Amazon at the Chinese Embassy, press 1 for more details.” The Post wrote that though officials have no idea what happened, they are reassuring staff that there is no security risk as the phone system is not connected to any “Government IT controlled system”: “We are aware of the Chinese message that is propagating through the phone system and was [broadcast] over the building PA,” read an email from Doug Fenderson, the branch chief for infrastructure and Web services at the center, sent at 12:50 p.m. “We are engaging the Vendor AT&amp;T to alert them of the incident and get root cause. The phone [system] is not tied to any of the Government IT controlled systems in the building. Please do not be alarmed.” There’s no indication that this was necessarily anything nefarious, like foreign hackers. Since people are generally not alerted by phone to pick up Amazon packages at embassies, it instead seems like it is probably tied to a wave of phone scams targeting Chinese expats or immigrants in the U.S. and abroad. In April, the Chinese embassy issued a warning about the scams, which generally pose as government officials advising recipients to retrieve packages from embassies or threatening them with criminal prosecution before demanding they divulge sensitive financial information like banking or credit card credentials. The Federal Trade Commission also issued its own warnings that month, with the New York Police Department warning the scam had resulted in roughly $2.5 million in known losses to victims in NYC from December 2017 to April 2018. In other words, Occam’s Razor is that somehow the call was spam somehow routed over a building-wide comms system. The Post noted that two employees said they could only recall the intercom being used for shelter-in-place or fire-drills, so perhaps someone with little familiarity with the system accidentally redirected the call to an administrative phone line, or there’s a long-forgotten crossed wire which allows anyone to dial it directly. If that’s the case, here’s some advice for staff in the building, per the FTC : Regardless of who you are or who says they’re calling, never send money to anyone who calls and asks you to send it. Never give your Social Security number, your bank or credit card number, or other sensitive information to anyone who calls and asks for it. Same thing if they email or message you through a social media platform such as WeChat: just don’t respond. That’s a scam. And neither the real Chinese Consulates, nor the Chinese Embassy, will ever call you to ask for money. But who knows? Maybe the National Weather Service really does need to pick up a package. Or a dead drop for the deep state Illuminati agents secretly controlling the weather.

Mr. Tapper then turned to the camera, even as Mr. Miller was still speaking, and cut to a commercial. On Twitter, Mr. Trump said Mr. Miller had “destroyed” Mr. Tapper in the interview.

Vanessa Romo,"Firefighters work on the Ranch Fire, part of the Mendocino Complex Fire on Aug. 7. On Thursday Cal Fire asked state lawmakers for an additional $234 million in funding to continue battling wildfires through the end of the year. Noah Berger/AP As fall — usually California's busiest fire season — approaches, officials say the agency that oversees emergency fire responses is running out of money. Cal Fire's director, Ken Pimlott, asked lawmakers for an additional $234 million to be made available as soon as possible, in a letter to state lawmakers on Thursday. He wrote that fires caused by ""climate change driven extreme weather conditions"" have triggered massive spending across the state. As a result of the record-breaking ""intense and large"" wildfires in July and August, including the Carr Fire's deadly tornado of flame, Pimlott said less than $11 million of the agency's 2018 $442.8 million budget remains. Additionally, he noted, more resources have been deployed to several new blazes in recent days, including the Sliger Fire in El Dorado County, which by Thursday that had consumed 104 acres and was at 45 percent containment. Cal Fire continues to battle the Ranch Fire, which has ravaged 410,203 acres — an area larger than Los Angeles — and is 98 percent contained. It is one of the two parts of the Mendocino Complex Fire that grew to become the state's largest recorded wildfire in history. The additional funding would ""ensure sufficient authority exists to respond to wildfire activity that occurs between September and November,"" Pimlott explained. Over the last five years, the agency has spent an average of $156 million during those months. The remaining $78 million would be used to buy additional helicopters and o hire more firefighters. The AP reported that Cal Fire has requested additional funding in seven of the past 10 years. But it is first time the appeal has been made so early in the year.","As fall — usually California's busiest fire season — approaches, officials say the agency that oversees emergency fire responses is running out of money.",2018-09-07T01:39:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",California Firefighting Agency Requests Another $234 Million For 2018,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645412605/california-firefighting-agency-requests-another-234-million-for-2018,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/06/ap_18220312355616_wide-b77157bffdbbf874f7ad1b3d2382149361a58cbb.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Complex fire,1
RICHARD FAUSSET,"“I’m the one pushing for it,” Ms. Chassagne said of the band’s focus on Haiti, “and I’m pushing for it because it’s the story of my parents, and the culture. Their culture is what made me who I am.” Some in New Orleans say the same could be said for the city. “There’s this huge connection between the cultures that hasn’t really been explored,” said Branden Lewis, 30, a trumpeter with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. “My existence is testament to that fact, and I don’t really know anything about Haiti.” Mr. Lewis grew up in Southern California, but his family members are Louisiana Creoles who trace their roots to people of African descent who came to Louisiana from Haiti in the 19th century. It is a common New Orleans story. In 1809 and 1810, the population of the city roughly doubled when more than 10,000 French speakers from the colony of St. Domingue — whites, slaves and free people of color — arrived from eastern Cuba, according to Ned Sublette, the author of the 2008 book “ The World That Made New Orleans.” They had gone to Cuba from what is now Haiti amid the tumult of the Haitian revolution, but were subsequently expelled by the Spanish. The new arrivals made a profound mark on New Orleans, influencing its legal profession, cuisine, journalism, politics and music. In the book, Mr. Sublette argues that they delayed the Americanization of the city “for perhaps two generations.” But Americanization eventually won out, and the French language faded. And while family names familiar to any Haitian — Dumas, Toussaint, Barthelemy — remain common in New Orleans, the Haitian influence has become so prevalent, so deeply mixed into the city’s complex cultural stew, that it can be difficult to pick out. “Haiti definitely had an influence on New Orleans, but it’s hard to see if you’re not looking,” said Donald Link, a local chef who has been researching the city’s culinary ties to the Caribbean world. The idea of outsider rock stars making a mark on Mardi Gras has prompted some grumbling in a city that fiercely guards its cultural traditions. Mr. Lewis said some locals had criticized the Krewe du Kanaval as an act of cultural appropriation. It would not be the first time such charges have been made against Ms. Chassagne or her band, whose other members are white and which has come under fire before for adopting Haitian influences and iconography. In 2016, they set off an intense online debate among New Orleanians when they joined with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band for a New Orleans-style parade for David Bowie, who died in January of that year. Photo Ms. Chassagne and her husband, Win Butler, Arcade Fire’s frontman, have lived in New Orleans for about three years. Credit William Widmer for The New York Times “Shouldn’t you have at least some tie to New Orleans to get a second line?” one comment er said, referring to the city’s tradition of jazz funeral parades. Mr. Butler shrugged off the complaints on a recent evening while sipping rum on his back porch with Ben Jaffe, Preservation Hall’s creative director. Thousands turned out for the Bowie parade, Mr. Butler said. Thousands were moved. “There’s not even one part of me that’s like, that was a bad idea — like, ‘Oh no, we’ve ruined New Orleans,’” he said. Mr. Jaffe, a New Orleans native, agreed, arguing that the city has always made room for respectful newcomers looking to make a mark on the culture. His parents, Allan and Sandra Jaffe, were music fans from Philadelphia who stumbled into New Orleans’s traditional jazz scene while on their honeymoon in 1960. The next year, they opened Preservation Hall, playing a major role in the traditional jazz revival in the city. “That was one of the reasons they came down here — to sort of absorb that thing that they were attracted to,” he said. “Isn’t that what New Orleans has always been, though?” Ms. Chassagne’s attraction to the Caribbean world feels like an effort to reclaim a heritage that history tried to rob from her. Her parents fled, separately, from Haiti in the 1960s, amid the violence imposed by supporters of the Haitian dictator François Duvalier. Several of her mother’s relatives were killed in a 1964 massacre in the town of Jérémie, and her mother, traumatized, never returned. Ms. Chassagne would not visit the island until after the band became famous. She describes a Montreal childhood absorbing wisps of Haiti: her parents chatting in Creole, the way her mother danced in the kitchen, the Christmas parties with kompa music on the stereo. A fair-skinned member of a family of many hues, Ms. Chassagne also remembers listening as darker-skinned relatives talked about the way white people would treat them. Now, she and Mr. Butler stand out in other ways. New Orleans is still adapting to having the famous indie-rock couple in its midst: One city government official recalled seeing the pair on the street at Halloween, and mistaking them for local residents in really convincing Arcade Fire costumes. In the past few days, Ms. Chassagne and Mr. Butler have been scrambling with last-minute details. They have corralled into their Carnival project Haitian-Americans including Leyla McCalla, an unclassifiable multi-instrumentalist who performs some songs in Creole, and Charly Pierre, a chef and a winner of the Food Network’s “Chopped” contest, who will be providing some of the food. The couple has also been reaching out to the Haitian immigrant community. On Jan. 11, Ms. Chassagne and Mr. Jaffe promoted the festivities on Radio Gonbo Kreyol, a New Orleans internet radio station that serves Creole speakers, as stories began to circulate that President Trump had crudely disparaged Haiti in a White House meeting. The Census Bureau estimates that fewer than 500 people in metropolitan New Orleans claim Haitian ancestry, but Barthelemy Jolly, a Haitian native and vice president of the radio station, believes the Haitian immigrant community is thousands strong. Many of them are taxi drivers and hotel maids, he said, and they have tended, over the years, to keep a low profile. But Mr. Trump’s comments prompted scores of Haitians to march together at the Women’s March on Jan. 20, which passed through the city’s central business district and the French Quarter, bearing Haitian flags. Mr. Jolly said that he expected many more to come to the Krewe du Kanaval party. “The Haitian community, they’re going to be out there,” he said. So the possibility looms of a party where second-line rhythms bleed into Haitian mizik rasin, where the vestiges of Caribbean roots mingle with the new. If nothing else, it will probably be a good time, though Ms. Chassagne hopes it will be something more. “If we want things to move forward we need to experience each other’s company,” she said. “You can’t just retract in your corner.” A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2018, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Whispers of Haiti Become a Brassy Mardi Gras Shout.

Mark Kaufman,"It should come as no surprise that California is burning. On Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that July was California's hottest month since record keeping began in 1895. Those scorching temperatures withered the land, creating profoundly parched forests primed to catch fire with just a spark. SEE ALSO: Engineering Earth's climate might quell global warming, but it could come with a cost Major wildfires are propelled by weather, notably strong winds, but they're also enhanced by overall rising global temperatures due to human-caused climate change, say scientists. This is a particularly stark reality in California, where even in early July, fire scientists noted that the state's vegetation reached near-record dryness. On Monday, the Mendocino Complex Fire became the largest blaze in state history, easily outpacing the Thomas Fire, which broke the record just this past winter. Nearly the entire Golden State experienced either record heat or temperatures ""much above average"" in July, said NOAA. However, California wasn't alone in experiencing scorching temperatures and multiple heat waves. Most of the West was abnormally warm, and in the contiguous U.S., May through July temperatures were also the warmest on record, eclipsing the previous record set in 1934. Image: noaa As climate and environmental scientists are quick to point out, individual temperature records are not too meaningful — it's the long-term trends that matter. And California's summer heat is certainly a continuation of accelerating warming trends in both the U.S. and around the globe. Heat waves and longer warming spells will certainly happen, regardless of what the climate is doing, as big blobs of warm air can settle over areas, like California or Europe, for extended periods of time. But the climate is simply warmer that it was a half century ago, giving hot temperatures an extra boost — which can mean vast swathes of land are turned to fire-ready tinder. Yet another heat wave continues this week in portions of California, like Los Angeles. As might be expected, this doesn't bode well for the already dry vegetation in the region. Southern California's Holly Fire is now actively growing near suburban neighborhoods. Relieving rains aren't expected in much of the state for months. California, like recently scorched Greece, experiences the dry, warm summers defined by the Mediterranean climate. Historically, fires happen during this time of year. But now — just like heat waves around the world — they're getting worse. And the consequences are plainly visible.","It should come as no surprise that California is burning.

Brian Heater,"In a world overflowing with smart devices, connected running shoes aren’t the craziest idea. Hell, fitness tracking is the number one use for smartphones, so why just skip straight to the source and embed that technology right into a pair of sneakers? Under Armour really jumped at the idea this time last year, when it launched three new pairs at CES. The sportswear giant must have found some success with the new category, because now it’s back with two more, the Hovr Phantom and Hovr Sonic. They’re a strange and flashy kicks, but that’s just comes with the territory the world of running shoes. The Phantom are the stranger looking of the two pairs, particularly in their signature bright red coloring. The tops of the shoes are made out of a 3D sculpted, perforated chamois leather that meets a knitting “collar” at the top. It looks a bit like the top of a sock, honestly. The Sonic, which is designed for distance runners, features a more straightforward knit top. The real secret magic happens inside the foam soles, where all of the gadgetry is embedded. There’s a bluetooth module, accelerometer and gyroscope inside. According to the company, the on-board battery should last about the the tenth of the the shoe’s stated running shelf-life. The modules fire up when the system detects movement, syncing with a connected handset. There’s also some on-board storage, meaning you can go for a run without the phone and everything will sync up to the Under Armour MapMyRun app when you get back. The shoes track standard things like distance, along with more complex stats like stride length and cadence, so you can attempt to correct them over time. The tracking is less complex than the Altra Torin IQ pair I tried out a while back. Those offered a fuller picture of things like foot placement and heel strikes, potentially helping runners correct for common running issues like pronation. I held onto those shoes for a while, and I have to say, I ultimately ended up ignoring the smart functionality and just using them as regular old running shoes, which I suspect is pretty common with these sorts of products. That said, the new Hovrs are actually pretty reasonably priced as far as running shoes go, so no big deal if the whole smart bit doesn’t work out for you. The Phantoms run $140 and the Sonics are $110.

Jonathan Shieber,"Silicon Valley is currently, and correctly, under fire for the failure of leading platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter to protect against the spread of disinformation, hate speech and efforts to disrupt our elections. I dont know why these companies behaved as they did. But whatever the reason naiveté, excessive focus on near-term profits, or simply a lack of proper attention on mind-numbingly complex problems its clear they have to do a better job of making sure technology makes our world safer, freer and more stable rather than the opposite. But its not just these big companies that need to up their game. As venture capitalists, we need to do more to find, fund and help a new generation of technology companies that build the infrastructure and applications to deal with technology-based threats to stability and security. Yes, Facebook and Twitter must deal with unintended consequences of their massive platforms. But if history is any guide, it will be new companies that come up with the bold new visions and business models to address fundamental, once-in-a-generation challenges. I dont use the word fundamental lightly. Just think about all security failures you now take for granted, that once would have been unthinkable. Our PCs and other devices are patched every few hours or days, rather than every few months. We are routinely warned by merchantssometimes even credit agencies!to change our passwords because theyve been hacked. We are relieved, rather than annoyed, when the credit card company calls to verify our recent purchases. We feel abused when we read how our online identity has been monetized without our knowledge or used to micro-target us with ads by groups seeking to polarize our politics. And there are deeper-seated concerns, like the nagging fear of a terror attack or a lone-wolf gunman when we enter an airport or let our teenage kid go to a concert. Our physical and cyber selves feel threatened on a regular basis. Like it or not, we are too often under attack, as individuals, consumers and as citizens. But like the proverbial frog in a pot, we dont seem to notice the rising water temperature. If we stick with the status quo, that water is only going to get hotter. We already know the Russians (and the Iranians, and the North Koreans) are again targeting U.S. voting systems in advance of the midterm elections, and the Russians also have the ability to shut down large parts of our electric grid. It hasnt happened yet, but will Americans start worrying about congregating in public spaces, whether it is to protest, attend large rallies, or go to concerts? I grew up in Pakistan, where horrific gun and bomb attacks on civilians are more common. I cant help fear the same scourge will come to our shores. If this sounds like scare-mongering, so be it. There is no getting around the fact that more people have more ways to do large-scale damage than ever before. Thankfully there are technologists and entrepreneurs working diligently to find ways to defend us from such harm. Our portfolio company Evolv Technology, for example, is using advanced sensors and AI in weapons detection systems that can screen hundreds of people per hour without making them slow down or empty their pockets and purses. Companies like ShieldAI, Convexxum, Echodyne and others are using machine vision and advanced radars/lidar technologies to prevent people from being put in harms way by drone-type attacks. A drone flying and filming over Dubai Funding such companies can be different than the deals Silicon Valley VCs are used to. In most cases, these firms must collaborate with trusted government actors, intelligence agencies and enforcement organizations–not to mention comply with their regulations. To be successful, they need to share information with other companies, including competitors. But Im betting the trouble will be well worth it. History tells us that companies that overcome big obstacles to create new markets often enjoy years of rapid growth, and few competitors. Most of all, I believe a nervous world is ready to reward companies that make it feel safer. Just as Uber and Airbnb caught the front edge of the sharing economy boom, companies whose mission is aligned with a change in the societal zeitgeist can create huge value. Investors are already doing their part. DCVC recently invested in Fortem Technologies, and Shasta Ventures in AirSpace, which make Star Wars-ish systems of AI-based drones whose only role is to automatically detect, identify, and slam into drones that wander into unauthorized airspace — say, over a private estate, or a factory. General Catalyst invested in Mark43, which makes a cloud platform to help police departments and their detectives investigate crimes more quickly and effectively. While these mission-oriented companies may not provide the fastest or steepest ramp to riches, the best of these mission-oriented companies will create technology that affects each of us every day, and businesses that will be resilient to economic cycles, fads and fashion. For investors, its a twofer of enlightened self-interest — both as investors, and as citizens. To paraphrase JFK, we should invest in such companies not because it is easy, but because it is hard.","Bilal Zuberi Contributor Share on Twitter Bilal Zuberi is a partner at Lux Capital, and is on the boards of Evolv Technology, CyPhy Technologies, and Nozomi Networks, among others.

Alex Cranz,"“AI is one of the most important things humanity is working on. It is more profound than, I dunno, electricity or fire.” Those words were not uttered from the lips of a stoned Gizmodo staffer but said on a stage at a Recode- and NBC-sponsored “ town hall ” in San Francisco last month by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai loves him some artificial intelligence. As moderator Kara Swisher noted during the event, Google employs the most AI researchers in the world. It’s at the heart of Google’s business. When Pichai announced the Pixel phone in 2016 and the Pixel 2 in 2017, a big part of the pitch was how AI “empowered” those phones. But saying, in 2018, that AI is more profound than electricity or fire—both of which are necessary for powering the servers that house the AI—is pretty damn absurd. That did not stop Pichai from saying it, or from doubling down when moderator Kara Swisher said, “Fire? Fire is pretty good.” Pichai responded with “Well, it kills people, too. We have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity, but we had to overcome its downsides, too. So my point is, AI is really important, but we have to be concerned about it.” Pichai was trying to explain how profound an effect—both positive and negative—AI could have on humanity. And if you’ve cracked open a sci-fi book in the last 6o or 70 years, you’re probably aware of this. AI, and its potential to consume humanity, is one of the primary fears fed in science fiction. HAL, Skynet, and those weird-ass robots in The Matrix are all the results of humans seeking to do less by creating a virtual sentient slave that could do more. But Pichai sounds a little ridiculous saying he’s mindful of the potential even as his company works to create faster and smarter AI. You sound pretty stupid saying, “Sure, AI could one day usher in a nuclear winter, but this early version lets you google ‘kittens hugging’ and actually shows you pictures of kittens hugging.” Bro, you’re still contributing to the eventual nuclear winter. The fact is, AI is still in its infancy. Its potential, to damn us or save us, is still so far from being realized as to reside firmly in the realm of fantasy. Saying it is as profound as electricity or fire—products of our natural world that were harnessed, not fabricated in Mountain View office complex by some guys fat on Del Taco—is an obscenely arrogant thing to say. But it’s just one of the many headscratchers uttered by Pichai and his fellow guest, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. The hour-long conversation is surprisingly frank. These are wildly rich and intelligent people proudly talking about their hopes and accomplishments without a filter. There’s no PR person to step in and tell them to stop talking. So you get gems like Pichai’s one above. You also get Wojcicki saying the reason there aren’t more women in Silicon Valley is because not enough women are in the educational pipeline, which she thinks “has to do with this perception that the computer industry is a geeky, not very interesting, not social industry.” This is one of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley saying the problems with systemic sexism stems from girls finding computers nerdy. Yikes. You can watch the whole town hall, and feel concerned about the dumb-dumbs leading one of the most powerful entities on the planet, below.

Firefighters have 30% of the blaze contained, officials told The Los Angeles Times on Monday. The fire increased as dry winds and triple-digit weather combined two smaller blazes, the Ranch Fire and the River Fire. It's now on track to become the largest in the state's history, according to The LA Times. The Mendocino fire has spurred evacuations in Lake County, though no one has been injured in the blaze so far. That's on top of 17 other fires that firefighters are battling throughout California, including the Carr Fire, which hit the city of Redding and has claimed seven victims so far.

12 News,"PHOENIX - Police officers found a woman shot outside an apartment complex near Highland Avenue and 16th Street in Phoenix Monday afternoon. According to a police spokesperson, a male suspect was inside one of the apartments, possibly with two children. Police were communicating with him when a flurry of action and believed bullets rang out around 10:15 p.m. It's not clear what came of that situation -- whether police arrested or shot the suspect, or if he was still barricaded inside the apartment. An ambulance and fire truck came to the scene around that time. ""We don't know what's going on,"" said Sierra Scott. Her mom lives inside The Highland apartment complex. Scott was celebrating Christmas with family elsewhere when she got a frantic call from her mother. ""We were at Christmas dinner with my other family and she called me hysterical saying that she heard over 15 shots,"" said Scott. Scott rushed to the scene only to find dozens of police cars, armored trucks and fire engines. The streets surrounding the complex were completely shut down and her mom was unable to get out. ""My mom said everything's going on four doors down from the apartment,"" Scott explained. ""It just, it sucks even talking about it. It gives me goosebumps but I hope half of it isn't true,"" said Gibson Daoud. Daoud and his family live in the apartment complex. Like many others, they were out at the time of the apparent shooting and were unable to return home for Christmas. ""I just can't believe that this would happen period, let alone on Christmas,"" said resident Kristen Alexander. Officers believe the shooting is likely related to domestic violence.

By Sophie Haigney,"The Thomas Fire, the behemoth wildland blaze that’s been burning in Southern California for 17 days, is now the second-largest inferno in modern state history, and powerful northerly winds are in the forecast that may soon make it the largest. Containment of the fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties reached 60 percent Wednesday, up from 55 percent the day before, officials said. The blaze, which began Dec. 4 near Santa Paula in Ventura County, is being fueled by extremely dry conditions and ferocious Santa Ana winds.

It continues to threaten 18,000 buildings. The conflagration is second in size only to the 2003 Cedar Fire, which burned 272,246 acres in San Diego County, according to Cal Fire records dating to 1932. Winds are expected to kick up again Thursday morning, dealing yet another challenge to the thousands of firefighters working to control flames devouring wildlands and residential areas near Santa Barbara. The National Weather Service expects northerly winds with gusts up to 50 mph into Friday. “With the introduction of these winds, critically dry fuels will be receptive to fire spread,” Cal Fire said in a statement. “Montecito will continue to be an area of concern, where north winds are funneled through the Santa Ynez Range.” Montecito is a wealthy enclave where multimillion-dollar homes have been threatened since the fire moved into Santa Barbara County. Thousands of people remain evacuated due to the fire, as does a baby anteater, which had to be taken from the Santa Barbara Zoo to the Fresno Zoo for safety.

"Pat Collins, Andrea Swalec","What to Know A 74-year-old man was found Monday in the Navy Yard apartment building for seniors where there was a devastating fire Wednesday. The man is believed to have been in his apartment since the fire. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday that officials and apartment management believed all residents were accounted for. A 74-year-old man spent five days trapped inside his apartment in a collapsed seniors home after a devastating fire ripped through the Southeast D.C. building. Workers searching the building found the injured senior citizen Monday morning inside his apartment in the Arthur Capper Senior Apartments in the Navy Yard neighborhood, Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference Monday afternoon. The man is believed to have been inside his apartment from when the fire broke out Wednesday afternoon to when a crew found him Monday morning. ""It appears, based on the report that I got from the building workers, that he was sitting in his apartment,"" Bowser said. ""The workers helped him into a chair and out of the building."" The man, who officials did not identify, was rushed to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Structural engineer Allyn Kilsheimer was one of the people who found the man. He and others were going through the building unit by unit to try to determine if the apartments were safe to re-enter. As they used a crowbar to pry open an apartment door on the second floor, a man came to the door. Stunned, Kilsheimer said he would help the man get out. ""I'm not going anyplace,"" Kilsheimer recalled the man saying. Though the man had no electricity and was confined to his apartment because the door was jammed, he was in good spirits, Kilsheimer said. ""For somebody who's been in that situation for as long as this, he seemed incredibly in good shape, from my perspective,"" he said. The man wanted to walk outside using a cane, but the workers made him sit in a kitchen chair and get carried out. Bowser said Wednesday, in the hours after the blaze, that building management firm Edgewood Management called the tenants after the fire and each person was accounted for. The mayor said she was not aware of any family members looking for the man. City officials said they didn't know yet why Edgewood Management apparently had considered him to be safe, or why rescuers didn't find the man during their response. ""They may have missed the apartment,"" D.C. fire chief Gregory Dean said, referring to fire and EMS crews. Dean defended his crews. ""You have people, human people, just like the rest of us, trying to accomplish a very difficult job in trying circumstances,"" he said. Crews searched the building inch by inch on Monday to make sure no one else was there. Multiple residents of the apartments said they heard no alarms after a powerful fire broke out about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, injuring 10 people and sending a huge plume of black smoke into the air. Instead, residents were alerted by U.S. Marines and neighbors who banged on their doors. Dean told News4 that he heard multiple reports that wall-mounted fire alarms did not work when pulled. ""No one heard any horns. That's the early notification. That's really what was missing on this building,"" he said. Neighborhood advocate Bruce DarConte ran into the building in the 900 block of 5th Street SE to help his neighbors get out. He said he and others pulled wall-mounted fire alarms in the hallways, but nothing happened. ""As we saw the fire alarms, we were pulling them — nothing. So we just kept going. It didn't pay for us to stand there,"" he said. The fire chief said Thursday that smoke detectors inside apartments are believed to have worked. On lower floors of the four-story building, smoke alarms and the sprinkler system did not activate because they were not exposed to smoke or flames, Dean said. It wasn't clear if alarms or sprinklers activated on upper floors. The fire is believed to have started in the attic, fire officials said. The building was inspected by the fire department last year, and the alarm system was checked three times in the past year, most recently in April, Dean said.

Timothy J. Seppala,"If you've played SotN or any of its contemporaries like Axiom Verge or Shadow Complex you know what to expect. Controls should be mostly familiar too. Using an Xbox-style gamepad for my demo, X handled attacks and A was for jumping, while magic attacks were mapped to Y and the right trigger. My admittedly brief demo took place on a boat infested by all manner of ghastly creatures. I went from room to room as protagonist Miriam; clearing out harpy-like creatures and hulking, headless suits of armor on the main deck with edged weapons and fisticuffs. I then jumped downward through platforms and took the fight to jellyfish and barnacle-covered cannons below decks. It's worth noting that I didn't encounter any of the ""get skill to unlock new area"" tropes the genre is known for. But with each new area I entered, the mini-map in the upper right corner of the screen filled in. Once or twice, it showed doorways that weren't visible in the game with my current loadout, a coy tease that there were plenty of secrets tucked away in the haunted ship. I leveled up a handful of times and found a bunch of new gear (including a pair of ""kung-fu boots"" that increased my kicking damage), too. When it comes to magic, spells are called ""Shards"" in Bloodstained parlance, and I unlocked both fire and ice incantations. Combat is light and quick, and the aforementioned ice magic attack can counter the possessed cannon's salvos. My only gripe is that I couldn't quite get the timing right to successfully evade incoming attacks. That the evade command (a quick jump backward) was awkwardly mapped to the left bumper button didn't help either. The placement is even more perplexing considering the B button doesn't have a function assigned to it. For run-of-the-mill enemy encounters it wasn't too big of a deal. Once I found a weapon that worked for my play style -- a rapier -- I didn't take much damage. Its longer range meant I didn't have to be nearly as close while attacking enemies, and thus, offered a bit of protection compared to attacking bare-handed. And, unlike the claymore which covered even more range and did more damage, the comparatively smaller sword wasn't slow to swing.","Castlevania: Symphony of the Night ( SotN ) is one of the most influential games ever made.

Shayanne Gal and Jeremy Berke,"The Carr Fire tears through Shasta, Calif., Thursday, July 26, 2018. Fueled by high temperatures, wind and low humidity, the blaze destroyed multiple homes and at least one historic building AP Photo/Noah Berger The wildfires tearing through California have scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of land, destroyed thousands of structures, and forced evacuations across the state. The Carr Fire, which took seven lives near the city of Redding, was first ignited on July 23 after a trailer's tire blew out and the rim made contact with the pavement. ""It is an Armageddon-like feel up here,"" a local resident told The Sacramento Bee in July. ""Heavy smoke. Gas stations are jam-packed. It is unlike anything I've ever experienced."" While firefighters mostly have the blaze contained, it's already considered the sixth most destructive fire in the state's history, according to Cal Fire, the state's fire and disaster-relief agency. That cost may increase as the damage is assessed. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency to assist with fighting the fires. The Mendocino Complex Fire, currently burning in northern California, is the largest in the state's history. The fire has burned over 283,000 acres — almost 440 square miles — as of Wednesday, and firefighters have less than half of the blaze contained, according to Cal Fire. The fire's size may increase in coming days, officials warned. Shayanne Gal/Business Insider Driven by triple-digit temperatures and high winds, the Mendocino Complex Fire was created when two smaller fires, the Ranch Fire, and the River Fire, merged: Shayanne Gal/Business Insider And though the Mendocino Complex and Carr fires are the two largest burning, there are 17 other active fires across the state of California: Shayanne Gal/Business Insider Cal Fire, short for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, handles the largest, most dangerous fires burning in the state along with federal officials. Smaller fires — or those not located near populated areas — are handled by local firefighting teams. The fires in California are part of a worsening trend that's driven by climate change. Because of rising temperatures and increasing drought, the average wildfire season now lasts at least 2 1/2 months longer than it did in the early 1970s. The amount of land that has burned in the western US since 1984 is double what would have been expected without the effects of climate change. California spent a total of $505 million fighting fires across the state in 2017 — a number that may be even larger in 2018. For comparison, in 1997, the state spent only $47 million, according to an analysis from Climate Nexus, a nonprofit group.","Wildfires are tearing through California, driven by dry winds and triple-digit temperatures.

Rachel Kraus,"The wildfire-prone Santa Monica Mountains might sound like a terrible location for a billion dollar museum containing priceless works of art. But when Los Angeles' Getty Center was conceived by its board in the late 1980's, they were well aware of the risk. In fact, the fire currently raging across the highway from the Getty as of Wednesday is exactly the scenario the museum was built to withstand since it first opened its doors in 1997. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying The center uses a variety of architectural and design techniques to mitigate the adverse affects of wildfires. ""When the Getty was designed and built 20 years ago, it was designed in such a way to actually protect the collection from disasters, like a fire,"" said Ron Hartwig, the Getty's vice president of communications. The Getty Center is closed to the public today. The fire is northeast of the Getty Center and east of the San Diego Freeway. Air filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke. We continue to monitor the situation and will issue updates as we have them. — J. Paul Getty Museum (@GettyMuseum) December 6, 2017 Early Wednesday morning, a brush fire in West Los Angeles quickly grew to over 50 acres, prompting the shut down of the 405 freeway, and threatening the wealthy neighborhood of Bel-Air, as well as other nearby communities like Brentwood and Westwood. The latest figures from the LA fire department put the blaze at 150 acres. The fire is raging on the east side of the freeway, where Bel-Air residents have been told to evacuate. According to the LA Times, several homes in the area have already succumbed to fire. The Getty Center is a 940,000-square-foot complex that fills 24 acres of the 110-acre Santa Monica Mountains site. It's also on the freeway's west side. But 10 lanes of concrete doesn't mean the museum is safe - all it would take is one ember blown from the adjacent hillside to set aflame the western hills on which the Getty sits. But even in that scenario, thanks largely to architect Richard Meier, the art at The Getty - including Van Gogh's ""Irises"" - is surprisingly secure. ""Meier was sensitive to the fact of where the Getty was being built,"" Hartwig said. ""And of course, very, very sensitive to the fact that it would contain world class art that had to be protected."" Vincent Van Gogh's 'Irises' is part of The Getty's permanent collection. Image: The Getty center The Getty Museum is essentially a fortress specifically designed to protect itself and the art it houses from fire damage. That's because its founders were well aware that the low-moisture vegetation growing on the mountains make for ""volatile fire risk,"" according to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The museum is built of non-flammable materials including travertine and aluminum panels. And landscapers placed fire-resistant plants with high water content around the compound's perimeter. Inside the building itself, a ""sophisticated"" air filtration system pushes air out of the galleries, and seals them off from smoke and fire. The Getty closed the museum to visitors on Tuesday, before the Wednesday fire, to protect the art from smoke that had reached West Los Angeles from the Thomas, Creek, and Rye fires to its north. Due to continuing smoke from fires in the region, the Getty Center and Getty Villa will remain closed to visitors tomorrow, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. pic.twitter.com/rAxpPYx0GT — J. Paul Getty Museum (@GettyMuseum) December 5, 2017 Protecting the priceless The Getty Center itself cost over one billion dollars to construct between 1987 and its 1997 opening. That doesn't even take into account its contents, which include, just to name a few, a Manet painting that the museum purchased in 2014 for $65.1 million, and a collection of 16 drawings and a painting by artists including Michelangelo, Parmigianino and Watteau that the museum recently purchased for $100 milion this year. ""It would be hard to put any kind of an estimate on it,"" Hartwig said, ""simply because some of the works are priceless."" The Getty purchased Édouard Manet's 'Jeanne (Spring)' in 2014 for over $65 million. Image: The Getty museum The Getty's security team is in communication with the fire department, and monitoring the situation. But that's par for the course for the museum, which Hartwig says consistently works closely with the LA fire department and police department to ensure the building's security. Because of the smoke, the Getty was already closed to the public the day the fire broke out. But the museum faced a more unexpected wildfire scenario in 2015. During that year's Sepulveda Pass fire, the Getty had to evacuate visitors from its premises before it could put the air filtration safeguards in place. In 2015, The Getty had to evacuate visitors during the 'Sepulveda Pass Fire.' Image: Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Still, Getty employees worry about the risks should the fire travel across the 405. The forecast for stronger winds overnight and Thursday adds to that concern. ""Whenever there's a situation like this, until it's finally resolved, and until all the fire is out, we're on constant alert, and always concerned about anything that could happen that we haven't thought about,"" Hartwig said. ""But at this moment in time, with the exception of our deep concern for our neighbors, everything at the Getty is going according to plan."" ""Whatever can be done to protect the Getty center from danger,"" he added, ""has been done.""","The wildfire-prone Santa Monica Mountains might sound like a terrible location for a billion dollar museum containing priceless works of art.

Jennifer Calfas,"Astronauts aboard the International Space Station shared images of the plumes of smoke billowing from the wildfires in California, giving a global perspective to the size of the aggressive infernos. Richard Arnold II, a NASA astronaut aboard the ISS, posted images Monday above California that showed plumes of smoke traveling eastward as at least 16 major fires burned across the state. Several days earlier, Alexander Gerst, a European Space Agency astronaut also aboard the ISS, shared photos of the smoke as well. His pictures showed the Bay Area and Northern California, where major fires like the Carr Fire and Mendocino Complex Fire continue to burn. The photos shared by the astronauts shed light on the massive amounts of smoke filling the air in the Golden State as more than a dozen wildfires burn through dry vegetation and threaten thousands of homes. Significant portions of the state — particularly across the Sacramento Valley and much of Northern California — have been chocked by unhealthy air as the wildfires continue to burn. In Northern California, a number of fires have broken state records, destroyed more than 1,000 homes, and displaced tens of thousands of people who had to flee their homes for safety. The Mendocino Complex Fire, created by two neighboring fires in Lake County and Mendocino County, became the largest wildfire in state history when it ballooned to more than 283,00 acres Monday, officials from the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The fire has destroyed 75 homes and 68 other buildings – and continues to threaten 11,300 more. North of that fire, the Carr Fire continues to burn with just 47% contained. That fire destroyed 1,080 homes in Shasta County, and at least seven people have died as a result. Before the Carr Fire took off, the Ferguson Fire sparked near Yosemite National Park in Mariposa County. It has taken two lives. The roaring fire caused National Park officials to close popular portions of the park like Yosemite Valley for the first time in 20 years — and during peak tourism season. It’s just the beginning of what is typically considered fire season in California. Record-breaking temperatures in July helped fuel many of these fast-moving fires, and officials anticipate that the worst is yet to come.",The Mendocino Complex Fire is the largest wildfire in state history,2018-08-07T12:08:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Here’s What the California Wildfires Look Like From the International Space Station,http://time.com/5359622/california-wildfires-photos-international-space-station/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/california-fire.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Complex fire,1
"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","While visiting California this weekend, President Donald Trump said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto told him that raking was part of the countrys forest management before insinuating that its something the United States should be doing to mitigate wildfires. The remark was bizarre, to be sure. But now, Niinisto says that no such conversation ever happened. Answering questions from reporters with California officials about the states wildfires on Saturday, Trump said that management of the floors of the forest was important for avoiding future environmental catastrophes like the Camp Fire, which has become the states deadliest and most destructive fire in its history. He then pointed to a conversation he claimed he had with Niinisto. You look at other countries where they do it differently and its a whole different story, he said. I was with the president of Finland and he said, Were a forest nation. He called it a forest nation. And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they dont have any problem. And when it is, its a very small problem. It now appears that the conversation never happened. Asked about the remark by Finish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, Niinisto said he didnt recall a discussion about raking, though he did recall telling the president that we take care of our forests. Beyond the fact that Finlands president insinuated this conversation about raking happened exclusively in Trumps mind, perhaps at the very moment the words fell out of his mouth, it is not the first time Trump has mentioned raking in relation to Californias fires. Just one day before visiting Paradise, the California town that was essentially burned to the ground by the Camp Fire, Trump again mentioned raking. As it appears that his cited source now denies any such conversation ever happened, its unclear how or why the president has latched onto this bizarre and vastly oversimplified solution to a complex problem.

Adam Rogers,"This past year, 2017, was the worst fire season in American history. Over 9.5 million acres burned across North America. Firefighting efforts cost $2 billion. This past year, 2017, was the seventh-worst Atlantic hurricane season on record and the worst since 2005. There were six major storms. Early estimates put the costs at more than $180 billion. As the preventable disease hepatitis A spread through homeless populations in California cities in 2017, 1 million Yemenis contracted cholera amid a famine. Diphtheria killed 21 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, on the run from a genocide. Disaster, Pestilence, War, and Famine are riding as horsemen of a particular apocalypse. In 2016, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere reached 403 parts per million, higher than it has been since at least the last ice age. By the end of 2017, the United States was on track to have the most billion-dollar weather- and climate-related disasters since the government started counting in 1980. We did that. Transnational corporations and the most powerful militaries on Earth are already building to prepare for higher sea levels and more extreme weather. The FIRE complex—finance, insurance, and real estate—knows exactly what 2017 cost them ( natural and human-made disasters : $306 billion and 11,000 lives), and can calculate more of the same in 2018. They know that the radical alteration of Earth’s climate isn’t just something that’s going to happen in 100 years if we’re not careful, or in 50 years if we don’t change our economy and moonshot the crap out of science and technology. It’s here. Now. It happened. Look behind you. Let me rephrase: Absent any changes, by 2050 Earth will be a couple degrees hotter overall. Sea levels will be a foot higher. Now, 2050 seems as impossibly far away to me as 2017 did when I was 12 years old. I live in the future! And I like a lot of it. I like the magic glass slab in my pocket and the gene therapy and the robots. I mention this because in 2050, my oldest child will be the same age I am today, and I have given him a broken world. I don’t want that. So 2017 taught a lesson, at last, that scientists and futurists have been screaming about. Humanity has to reduce the amount of carbon it’s pumping into the air. Radically. Or every year will be worse from here on out. But 2017 also made plain the shape of the overall disaster. All those fires and floods and outbreaks are symptoms of the same problem, and it’s time to start dealing with that in a clear-eyed way. It’s also time to start building differently—to start making policies that understand that the American coastline is going to be redrawn by the sea, and that people can’t keep building single-family homes anywhere they can grade a flat pad. The wildland-urban interface can’t keep spreading at will. People can’t keep pumping fresh water out of aquifers without restoring them. Infrastructure for water and power has to be hardened against more frequent, more intense storms, backed up and reinforced so hundreds of thousands of people don’t go without electricity as they are in post-hurricane Puerto Rico. In short: Change, but also adapt. Fire season in the West is now a permanent condition; don’t build buildings that burn so easily in places that burn every year. Hurricanes and storm surges are going to continue to walk up the Caribbean and onto the Gulf Coast, or maybe along the seaboard. Don’t put houses on top of the wetlands that absorb those storms. Don’t insure the people who do. Build ways for people to get around without cars. Create a power grid that pulls everything it can from renewable sources like wind and solar. Keep funding public health research, surveillance, and ways to deal with mosquito-borne diseases that thrive in a hotter world. And the next time someone in a city planning meeting says that new housing shouldn’t get built in a residential area because it’s not in keeping with the sense of the community and might disrupt parking, tell them what that means: that they want young people to have lesser lives, that they don’t want poor people and people of color to have the same opportunities they did, and that they’d rather the planet’s environment get crushed by letting bad buildings spread to inhospitable places than increasing density in cities. This apocalypse doesn't hurt everyone. Some people benefit. It’s not a coincidence that the FIRE industries also donate the most money to federal political campaigns. Rich people living behind walls they think can’t be breached by any rising tide, literal or metaphoric, made this disaster. And then they gaslighted the vulnerable into distrusting anyone raising the alarm. The people who benefit have made it seem as if this dark timeline was all perfectly fine. It isn’t. And that’s why it’ll change. In 1957 Charles Fritz and Harry Williams, the research associate and technical director, respectively, of the National Academy of Sciences’ Disaster Studies Committee, wrote a paper that sparked the field of disaster sociology. Their findings were counterintuitive then, and somehow remain so. People in disasters, they said, don’t loot and riot. They help each other. “The net result of most disasters is a dramatic increase in social solidarity among the affected populace during the emergency and immediate post-emergency periods,” they wrote. “The sharing of a common threat to survival and the common suffering produced by the disaster tend to produce a breakdown of pre-existing social distinctions and a great outpouring of love, generosity, and altruism.” In a disaster, we help each other. The trick is recognizing the disaster. Through that lens, fixing the problem and protecting one another against its consequences isn’t merely inarguable. It’s human nature. We’re all in this together.","The past year was one of the worst on record for natural disasters.

""Dr. Fitzgerald owns certain complex financial interests that have imposed a broad recusal limiting her ability to complete all of her duties as the CDC Director,"" according to a statement issued by Matt Lloyd, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services. ""Due to the nature of these financial interests, Dr. Fitzgerald could not divest from them in a definitive time period."" A report in Politico published Tuesday revealed documents showing several new investments Fitzgerald made after she took over the agency's top job. The CDC is a lead federal agency in preventing smoking and tobacco-related diseases. Fitzgerald had come under fire on Capitol Hill for not divesting financial interests in other companies that present potential conflicts of interest, including drug maker Merck, health insurer Humana and US Food Holding Co. The Politico report, relying on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, shows that one day after Fitzgerald purchased stock in Japan Tobacco, she toured the CDC's Tobacco Laboratory, which studies tobacco's toxic effects.

MATT STEVENS,"“That’s when we decided to start our plans to make entry and try to rescue the rest of the children,” Chief Mina said, adding that the episode had “a very tragic and sad ending.” Gary Lindsey Jr., who the police say shot an officer early Monday, is believed to have killed four children during a hostage standoff, then himself. Credit Volusia County Corrections “Our hearts go out to the families of those four children.” Chief Mina continued. The episode began about 11:45 p.m. Sunday when Orlando police officers responded to a call at an apartment complex just two miles north of Universal Studios Florida. A woman had contacted officers from elsewhere, telling them that her boyfriend, Mr. Lindsey, had battered her after an argument, the authorities said. When officers confronted Mr. Lindsey, he opened fire, striking Officer Kevin Valencia, who suffered what Chief Mina called a “very serious and significant injury.” At least one officer fired back. As of early Tuesday, Officer Valencia, who has been with the department since 2016 and is in his late 20s, remained in critical condition, Chief Mina said. Mr. Lindsey then barricaded himself in his apartment along with the four children. Over the next 21 hours, the authorities urged Mr. Lindsey to release the children. Negotiators spoke with him several times throughout the standoff, and had made contact with him as late as about 8:30 p.m. on Monday, just before SWAT officers entered the apartment.","The police at the scene of a standoff in Orlando, Fla., that began after a man suspected of battering his girlfriend shot a police officer and barricaded himself in an apartment, the authorities said.",2018-06-12T05:46:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Florida Man Kills 4 Children and Himself, Ending 21-Hour Hostage Standoff",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/us/orlando-hostage-children-dead.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/us/13xp-orlando1/12xp-orlando1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Complex fire,1
LISA FRIEDMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. So did the president capture the causes of the California wildfires accurately? Lisa: The president’s tweet said that the California wildfires were worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Virtually every scientist and forest management expert agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweet was scientifically and factually inaccurate. Mr. Trump’s other admonition that California “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” raised fewer objections. But, state officials pointed out, California devoted more than $250 million in state funds this year alone on efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires. How about the president’s point about water policy? How is that related to wildfire management and firefighting? Is there any connection, as the president suggested?","Wednesday: Hazardous air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, accusations of slogan-stealing in the 10th district, and LeBron James excites bike activists.",2018-08-08T13:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Your Questions About Fires and Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/california-today-fires-and-climate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/us/07CALTODAY-01/merlin_142056570_ff8f2de5-3943-43a0-894e-84c0995be321-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Complex fire,1
"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Roughly 1,000 people sought treatment at a pop-up treatment center for symptoms including nausea, headaches, and respiratory problems after Intercontinental Terminals Co.s (ITC) chemical storage facility in Deer Park, Houston caught fire this week, Bloomberg reported on Friday, with at least 15 cases dubbed serious enough to warrant a transfer to local emergency rooms.
The massive fire broke out on March 17, releasing over 9 million pounds of pollutants into the region, and was eventually extinguished on March 20. The catastrophe also released large amounts of benzene, a carcinogenic chemical, in the form of vapor after the fire was put out. On Thursday, benzene levels detected near the facility spiked to 190.68 parts per billion, exceeding Texas Commission on Environmental Quality one-hour maximum safe exposure limits of 180 parts per billion. (The TCEQ wrote that level of exposure would cause no lasting effects.)
On Friday, Bloomberg reported, a wall at the facility collapsed amid another blaze, resulting in contamination of and a temporary shutdown of the busy Houston Ship Channel:
The U.S. Coast Guard is forbidding vessel traffic on a stretch of the key industrial shipping route after a wall collapse and fire at Intercontinental Terminals Co.s already-damaged chemical storage complex on Friday. A mix of toxic gasoline ingredients, firefighting foam and dirty water flowed from the site into the channel, and a benzene plume above the water poses a threat to ship crews, said Coast Guard Capt. Kevin Oditt.
... Since the initial blaze was squelched earlier in the week, ITC made two unsuccessful attempts to drain a charred tank thats holding pygas, a petroleum derivative composed largely of benzene. Early on Friday, ITC executives estimated they would have that tank emptied in about 12 hours; then the wall failed and flames erupted nearby.
Jerry Mouton, mayor of nearby Deer Park, told media on Saturday that Its been a never-ending, re-occurring case of things not working out as planned, Bloomberg wrote. The news agency added that while ITC said approximately 2.52 million gallons of hazardous chemicals remained within the damaged facility as of Friday, on Saturday it said it could not produce a reliable estimate.
ITC said no worker injuries were reported during the second fire, according to Reuters, though the company did have to request the third shelter-in-place order for local communities of the week. At the time of the repeat incident, an ITC spokesman said the company and authorities were working on a plan to contain the spread of contaminated chemicals, Reuters wrote.
People are scared. Im scared, Pasadena resident Jennifer Tijerina told the Houston Chronicle. Just information and reassurance wouldve been nice.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against ITC, saying the company violated state clean air ordinances, NPR reported.
As Earther previously reported, Environmental Protection Agency National Air Toxics Assessment data shows the communities surrounding the ITC facility in Deer Park such as Manchester, Harrisburg, Meadowbrook, and Allendale already face some of the highest cancer risks in Houston from ethylene oxide emissions. The ITC facility in question has, since 2003, usually experienced at least three unauthorized emissions of air contaminants a year.
The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report in 2016 warning that Manchester (98 percent minority and 65 percent low-income) is frequently exposed to toxic chemicals including 1,3-butadiene, benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, toluene, and xylene.
Though evidence shows low-income communities of color face disparate levels of exposure to toxic chemicals, the burden of proving these chemicals are harming residents health continues to rest on the communities themselves, the researchers wrote. It should be the polluters who are expected to prove that exposure to their chemicals poses no harm.
As Earther noted in its prior report, environmental groups say that Texas air pollution laws are rarely enforced, while Donald Trumps administration is simultaneously attempting to roll back regulations designed to help prevent such accidents from occurring:
In January 2017, former President Barack Obama finalized an updated Risk Management Program Rule to help prevent these types of accidents and improve emergency responses when they do happen. However, the EPA under President Trump was quick to delay the rule, just a few months after it finalized. A court reversed that move, but the agency is still proposing a replacement.
While the containment wall damaged in the original fire at the ITC facility has been rebuilt, according to Bloomberg, but the wall must be reinforced before further attempts to pump remaining chemicals out of the facility can resume.

The slain woman and the suspect “had these two children in common,” Howard said, adding that police were still working to determine the nature of their relationship. The other child who was killed was 11 years old. Children taken hostage Police responded Monday around 3:45 p.m. to the Highland Apartments in Phoenix and found a woman dead in a parking lot, Howard said. Neighbors said a man had taken two children hostage in an apartment, and officers launched into negotiations with him, Howard said. During the talks, the man indicated he had killed the children and threatened officers, he said. After nearly six hours, officers spotted the baby dead inside the unit, Howard said. Moments later, the suspect began shooting at police, he said. Injured officer in stable condition Officers managed to get into the apartment and apprehend the suspect, Howard said. They found the 11-year-old dead inside the home. One officer who was injured in the shootout was in stable condition at a local hospital, Howard said.

Matt Novak,"Kristina Howato, a 39-year-old driver for the transportation company Lyft, was murdered by one of her passengers in Tempe, Arizona on Sunday. Authorities believe Howato was stabbed to death by 20-year-old Fabian Durazo with a kitchen knife. Durazo has reportedly admitted to the crime but hasnt given any motive.
Howato was still in her vehicle when Durazo allegedly started attacking her, according to local police. Howato, who was in the third trimester of her pregnancy, was able to get out of the vehicle but the attack continued. She reportedly made her way to a nearby apartment complex where locals heard her screaming for help. The people in the apartment complex tried to administer first aid and asked her where she was stabbed. She replied, all over. 
Howato reportedly described her attacker to witnesses before going unconscious at the apartment complex. She and her unborn baby were pronounced dead at the hospital.
Durazo is alleged to have left the area by driving Howatos SUV, leaving the pregnant woman bleeding at the scene. Officers from the Tempe Police Department were able to locate the vehicle using the cars GPS and Durazo was apprehended without incident.
Durazo has refused to give a motive for his alleged murder of the mother-to-be, but police currently believe that he hailed the Lyft with the desire to steal a vehicle. Local news reports show a pool of blood at the scene, presumably from Howatos injuries.
Throughout our careers as officers, we have incidents that really, really touch our hearts and stay with you throughout your careers, Sgt. Ron Elcock from the Tempe Police Department said at a press conference yesterday. This is definitely one of those incidents that really is going to affect the police department for a long time, and the community will think about this for a long time.
Howatos two children, a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old, are staying with family members, according to the Arizona Family news outlet.
So called ridesharing companies have come under fire since their inception over safety concerns, but those concerns have largely centered around the safety of passengers, especially since an Uber driver went on a killing spree murdering six people while picking up passengers in Michigan in 2016. The safety of drivers always seems to be a secondary thought, but they really shouldnt be when these kinds of incidents in Arizona prove that being a driver for companies like Uber and Lyft can be a very dangerous job.

Shannon Liao,"It turns out that even robots are having a tough time holding down a job. Japan’s Henn-na “Strange” Hotel has laid off half its 243 robots after they created more problems than they could solve, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal. One of the layoffs included a doll-shaped assistant in each hotel room called Churi. Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa can answer questions about local businesses’ opening and closing times, but Churi couldn’t. When hotel guests asked Churi “What time does the theme park open?” it didn’t have a good answer. That was a problem because Churi was supposed to help ameliorate the Strange Hotel’s staff shortage by substituting in for human workers. Image: Henn-na Hotel Others on the chopping block: Two velociraptor robots positioned at check-in were also decommissioned because human workers essentially had to do their jobs for them and photocopy guests’ passports manually. Two robot luggage carriers could only reach about 24 of the over 100 rooms in the hotel and failed in rain or snow. They would also often get stuck trying to pass by each other. The hotel’s main concierge robot also didn’t know how to answer questions about flight schedules and nearby tourist attractions. It has since been replaced by a human. Many of the robots that have been retired were in service for years, making them outdated. The hotel decided it was easier to fire them than to replace them, citing high costs. And in the end, a lot of the work had to be left to humans anyway, especially when it came to asking more complex questions.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Between your ears sits perhaps the most complex piece of biological machinery on the planet: an all-in-one computer, simulator, and creation device that operates out of a squishy, folded gray mass. And scientists arent quite sure how it works.
Gül Dölen, assistant professor of neuroscience at the Brain Science Institute at Johns Hopkins, thinks that neuroscientists might need take a step back in order to better understand this organ, which evolved in various forms in nearly every species of animal on Earth. Slicing a few brains apart or taking a few MRIs wont be enough to get to the bottom of how these organs function. Instead, it might require a comparative approach; the most advanced catalog ever created. Dölen, who recently made headlines for her work giving MDMA to octopuses, would love to see neuroscientists band together to create a periodic table of the brain. And not just the human brain, but all brains.
She explained her ambitious experiment idea to Gizmodo:
The periodic table of elements is remarkable. Whenever I look at it, I am amazed and awestruck all over again! Think of it: Just by knowing the number of electrons in the outer shell of an atom, you can deduce physical properties of the element, like is it a gas or a metal, and whats more, you can use this information to make predictions about unknown properties of elements, and even predict the existence of elements that have yet to be found on Earth. Having the periodic table doesnt solve all of the puzzles of chemistry, but it certainly gives us the outer border of the puzzle. In neuroscience we dont have anything like that.
Dölen compared present-day neuroscience to somewhere between the ancient Greeks recognition of four elements and the medieval alchemists trying to change lead into gold. 
Does that sound like hyperbole? Well, consider that neuroscientists cant even agree on the brains most basic information-carrying unit. Perhaps its the average electrical field, or maybe its action potentialsthe electrical output of single brain cells, or neurons. Maybe its the combined electrical activity that neurons collect from the other neurons, which they use to determine whether to fire or not. Or maybe its chemicals inside the cells. All of these ideas require different kinds of measurement, like blood-flow monitoring fMRI machines, action potential-detecting electrodes, voltage sensors for measuring the electrical activity before a neuron fires, and protein-detecting systems. Then theres the blossoming field of genetics, which is also helping determine how the brain might work.
But perhaps each of these different measurements are just part of the many properties that brains have that must be catalogued. Theyre equivalent to properties like whether an element is a solid or gas at room temperature, how much energy the atom needs to lose an electron, its radius, atomic weight, and configuration of electrons. But there are many kinds of brains out there. Right now, our focus on just 5 species (humans, mice, fish, flies, and worms) really limits our ability to see the patterns, she said. Its as if you were trying to figure out the organization of the periodic table by just looking at hydrogen, carbon, helium, oxygen, and gold.
Attempts to create general rules for how certain brain properties can predict intelligence often fall apart, Dölen explained. We once thought that brain size could predict intelligencebut sperm whales have much larger brains than humans. Then, we thought ratio of brain size to body weight would predict intelligencebut tree shrews have a larger size-to-weight ratio than people. She pointed out that massive datasets have allowed scientists to create a more accurate picture. For example: 
Suzanna Herculano-Houzels lab actually developed a systematic method to count the neurons across over 500 species all across the tree of life. What they found is that, broadly speaking, the number of neurons scales with intelligence, and that across different evolutionary lineages, the size of the brain is related either to the size of the neurons or to the number of neurons. So, for example, comparing the human brain to other primates, as the brain gets bigger, the number of neurons increases. But for rodents like mice and rats, as the brain gets bigger, the size of the neurons gets bigger. This huge data set also allows them to look at relationships between neuron number and intelligence, longevity, senility, sociality, etc.
Dölen compared these insights to the comparative approaches behind the periodic tableonce you find the proper patterns and line everything up, the table itself can make predictions. That was perhaps the periodic tables most profound use: By simply arranging the atoms in a specific way based on their properties, chemist Dmitri Mendeleev was able to accurately the predict the existence and properties of three undiscovered elements based on the holes in his table. Dölen hopes a massive catalog of the properties of as many brains from as many species as possible, arranged in some pre-determined order, will reveal revolutionary insights about how brains work.
Ultimately, our understanding of brains is limited by our own humanity. Because we can build cellphones but mice cant, we define mice as less intelligent, said Dölen. However, compared to mice, humans are morons when it comes to smell intelligence (indeed mice have about 2,000 extra genes for detecting smell compared to humans). Similarly, mantis shrimp have 14 photoreceptors compared to our three, and so are likely to have much greater visual intelligence than we do.
Maybe its things that humans dont always associate with smarts, like sociality, that actually lead to intelligence as we understand it. And maybe it will take lining all these brains up and looking for patterns to make universal rules about how they work. 
Such a project would be a huge undertaking, requiring neuroscientists around the world to take a standardized approach to measuring as many details as possible from as many brains as possible. Aside from mass organization and the incredible amount of grunt work, we have many of the needed techniques alreadybut, said Dölen, scientists might not even know what measurements are important for creating such a table. Perhaps new insights from compiling the catalog would lead to new measurement techniques for more specific neural properties. Maybe scientists could even use genetic engineering to genetically modify brains in order to test out hypotheses that arise from the table.
And in an ideal world, the table would even include alien brains to see just how universal those rules can get, said Dölen. 
If there really are universal rules guiding how brains develop and function, it will take more than a few measurements of human brains to figure them out. It will take the largest table ever compiled. The impact could be extraordinary, from revolutionizing AI to curing brain diseases. If we had the rules, I cant even imagine what games we would be able to play, said Dölen.","Between your ears sits perhaps the most complex piece of biological machinery on the planet: an all-in-one computer, simulator, and creation device that operates out of a squishy, folded gray mass.

"JEREMY W. PETERS, MICHAEL TACKETT and NOAH WEILAND","Mr. Miller also pushed back against the perception that Mr. Bannon, whose harsh criticism of Mr. Trump and his family in the book has caused a sharp falling-out with the president, had ever played a Svengali-like role as chief strategist in the White House and on the presidential campaign. He said Mr. Bannon’s role had been “greatly exaggerated,” even as the CNN host Jake Tapper ticked off a long list of policies he said Mr. Bannon had played a key role in formulating. In the book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by Michael Wolff, Mr. Bannon said Mr. Trump had “lost his stuff,” and he described the meeting with Russians attended by Donald Trump Jr. and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as potentially treasonous. Mr. Miller, in his defense of the president, called him a “political genius” who could rattle off complete paragraphs on the fly in response to news events and then deliver them “flawlessly” to a campaign audience. On Saturday, the president, responding to the book’s depiction of his actions in office as erratic, had called himself a “very stable genius.” The interview, on the CNN program “State of the Union,” quickly grew heated as Mr. Tapper accused Mr. Miller of being “obsequious” and speaking to an “audience of one.” Before it ended, Mr. Tapper told Mr. Miller, who is known for his hard-edge attacks on political opponents and the news media, that he was wasting his audience’s time. Mr. Tapper then turned to the camera, even as Mr. Miller was still speaking, and cut to a commercial. On Twitter, Mr. Trump said Mr. Miller had “destroyed” Mr. Tapper in the interview. Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 7, 2018 In addition to assailing Mr. Bannon, Mr. Miller sharply criticized Mr. Wolff and his book, saying it “is best understood as a work of very poorly written fiction.” The president, who was returning from Camp David, where he had met with Republican congressional leaders and cabinet officials about the 2018 legislative agenda, weighed in with his own criticism. I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President. Now I have to put up with a Fake Book, written by a totally discredited author. Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Jan. 7, 2018 Mr. Wolff, appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” defended the accuracy of his book and contradicted the White House account of how often he had talked to the president. White House officials said their records showed that Mr. Wolff had last talked to the president in February, but Mr. Wolff said he had talked to the president several times after that. In all, Mr. Wolff said, he talked to the president for about three hours, including interviews during the campaign. He said that Mr. Trump had initially flattered him about the project, and that he had told interview subjects that “the president said he likes this idea” of a book. Mr. Wolff also repeated an assertion in the book that many in the White House had talked about the possible invocation of the 25th Amendment, a constitutional provision that permits a president’s powers to be transferred to the vice president when the vice president and a majority of the cabinet or a body created by Congress conclude that the president is incapable of performing his duties. “This is alarming in every way,” Mr. Wolff said, adding, “This is worse than everybody thought.” Appearing on Sunday talk shows, others in Mr. Trump’s inner circle dismissed any such worries. Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, said that he had no concerns about Mr. Trump’s ability to receive and process the kind of intelligence typically presented to presidents, and that Mr. Wolff’s descriptions of Mr. Trump’s mental state were “pure fantasy.” “I’m with him almost every day,” Mr. Pompeo said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We talk about some of the most serious matters facing America and the world, complex issues.

Nina Golgowski,"A combination of wildfires raging north of San Francisco, which already has consumed an area almost as big as Los Angeles, is on pace to become the largest in California history, fire officials said. The Mendocino Complex fire, which includes two blazes along the Mendocino National Forest, had chewed through more than 273,600 acres as of Monday morning, and is now the second-largest ever recorded in the state. Just 30 percent of the blaze is contained, Cal Fire’s Mendocino unit said. Last year’s Thomas fire, which consumed 281,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, remains the state’s largest on record. The Cedar fire in 2003, now the third-largest, devoured 273,246 acres in San Diego County, according to Cal Fire records. The city of Los Angeles, by comparison, is about 300,000 acres. Firefighters predict they’ll fully contain the Mendocino Complex fire by Aug. 15. Elsewhere across the state, firefighters are working to put out more than a dozen other fires that have killed several people, ravaged thousands of acres, and sparked air quality alerts. The deadly Carr Fire, burning north of Mendocino in and around the city of Redding, claimed its seventh fatality, a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric worker, on Saturday. That follows the deaths of two firefighters and four civilians. As of Monday, the Carr Fire had consumed 163,207 acres and was 45 percent contained. It was listed as the sixth most-destructive in state history, having destroyed more than 1,600 structures, according to Cal Fire. The Mendocino Complex fire, though nearly twice as large, had destroyed 75 residences and damaged 12. Ken Pimlott, Cal Fire director, warned on Saturday that “fire season is really just beginning.” “What seems like we should be in the peak of fire season, historically, is really now the kind of conditions we’re seeing really at the beginning,” Pimlott said at a news conference. Cal Fire online records show a growing number of wildfires in recent years. Through July 29, the agency said it responded to 3,770 fires across 292,455 acres. That’s higher than the five-year average for the same seven-month period ― 3,405 fires over 118,811 acres. In 2017, there were 3,440 fires across 219,369 acres during the period. Nationally, wildfires have burned about 5.1 million acres this year, about 1.1 million acres above the 10-year average for the seven-month period, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. President Donald Trump on Sunday approved California Gov. Jerry Brown’s (D) request for a major disaster declaration, which makes additional federal funding available for fire response and provides assistance to evacuees in Shasta County. Brown has called the wildfires “the new normal.” Trump, in a tweet on Sunday evening, blamed the intensifying fires on “bad environmental laws” that he said divert water resources into the Pacific Ocean. He also encouraged the clearing of trees to stop the fires from spreading. Cal Fire Division Chief Chris Anthony, who has been working on the Carr Fire since late last month, stressed the impact that changes to the environment and climate have caused. “It is hard to find the right words to describe how explosive conditions are throughout the state,” Anthony told HuffPost on Monday. “It is clear to me that firefighters are on the front lines of climate change.” Chris D’Angelo contributed reporting.","The Mendocino Complex fire has grown to more than 273,600 acres.",2018-08-06T17:57:06Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",California’s Mendocino Wildfire Is Now The 2nd-Largest In State History,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-wildfire-now-2nd-largest_us_5b684847e4b0fd5c73dbab6a,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b684e891900002b0150131f.jpeg?cache=iklntxe1gb&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Complex fire,1
"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","California is burning. The state’s wild-ass wildfires are becoming the norm, but this change is something many communities in California can’t afford. These wildfires degrade the air quality—and towns near and far are feeling it. Right now, nearly 20 fires are ablaze in the state. The Mendocino Complex Fire has quickly risen to the state’s second-largest wildfire in modern history. The still-raging Carr Fire, meanwhile, is the state’s sixth most destructive. Hell, even Yosemite National Park is on fire due to the Ferguson Fire, which has been burning for 24 days and counting. “If you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” The smoke billowing out of these fires has been on the move, posing health threats to communities that might’ve not been worried about the fires at all. Smoke from the Ferguson Fire has traveled about 100 miles to Reno, Nevada, where air quality advisories are on. The smoke created when flames ignite trees and organic matter is nasty stuff full of particulate matter that can lodge itself in people’s lungs and eventually make its way to the heart. Once in our bodies, it can cause lung disease, lung cancer, and heart disease. And the toxic compounds in these particles are worse than the smoke spewing out of cars, said Greg Huey, the chair of Georgia Tech University’s Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department who’s researched the topic. “Car ignitions have a lot of emissions controls on them,” he told Earther. “Even a coal-fired power plant, which we might normally think of as dirty has quite a bit of emission control compared to wildfires. You have a lot of smoldering fires. You can see a lot of brown and black smoke, so you can see quite a range of products that come out of fires. It’s just a much dirtier combustion.” That smoke moves quickly as winds shift, and the people who lie in its path bear the consequence, said Tom Flannigan, a spokesperson with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. “Our mountains and our microclimates are such that some areas might not be feeling any of the impact at all while others are disproportionately impacted,” he told Earther, “That is very well due to the topography of our state, but most of what we see is that if you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” Much of the air throughout the state, as well as neighboring states like Nevada and Oregon, is currently in the “unhealthy for sensitive groups” range. Where the fires have concentrated, southeast of Sacramento near the Nevada state border, the air quality is straight up unhealthy and even hazardous in some areas—for everyone. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have.” California cities already deal with some of the highest levels of air pollution in the country, especially in the state’s Central Valley, where many of its oil refineries are located. The people poised to suffer the most are the low-income families and communities of color that already deal with poor air quality on the daily due to their vicinity to industry. These fires aren’t helping. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have, so we work to let people know that they should do what they can to limit their exposure,” Flannigan said. A study published last month found that extreme air pollution days have gotten worse in the last 30 years for states from Nevada to Montana, and wildfires are largely to blame. And the situation will continue to get worse in the face of climate change. While California used to have a distinct fire season, today it’s more of a year-round thing, Flannigan said. That’s bad news for human health, Huey at Georgia Tech emphasized. “The more fires you have, the more acreages burned, the more emissions you have,” Huey said. “You’re going to raise the levels [of particulate matter] that people can be exposed to.”","California is burning.

John Walsh,"A firefighter lost his life battling the largest fire in California history last month in a series of events that began when an air tanker dropped thousands of gallons of flame-suppressant over some treetops, a report from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The Boeing 747 air tanker mistakenly flew too close to the ground. The fire-suppressant that it dropped hit some trees beneath it with such tremendous force that it uprooted an 87-foot tree, which landed on 42-year-old Matthew Burchett, a fire battlion chief from Utah, the report found. Another large tree fell over from the impact of nearly 20,000 gallons of liquid, injuring three other firemen from Burchett's crew, The Associated Press reported Friday. Burchett and the other firefighters were assigned to create a boundary designed to prevent the fire from spreading when the air-drop was announced over a radio, telling firefighters to ""Clear the area out."" No one from Burchett's crew responded to the warning, though the report says that ""when personnel are working under a tree canopy, supervisors must ensure the drop path is cleared."" When battling a large fire, bulldozers and hand crews are often tasked with clearing trees in surrounding areas so there's no grass or fuel to feed the flames. Dropping retardant on these areas makes it harder for the fire to spread. The pilot of the 747 mistakenly released the fire-suppressant too close to the ground because the thick trees and dense brush prevented the pilot from noticing that the plane was flying over a hill. ""The rise in elevation resulted in the retardant drop only being approximately 100 feet above the treetops at the accident site,"" the report notes.

Jon Brodkin,"Enlarge / A West Covina firefighter pulls hose away from a horse barn that burns as the Mendocino Complex Fire moves through the area on July 31, 2018 in Lakeport, California. reader comments 10 A fire department whose data was throttled by Verizon Wireless while it was fighting California's largest-ever wildfire has rejected Verizon's claim that the throttling was just a customer service error and ""has nothing to do with net neutrality."" The throttling ""has everything to do with net neutrality,"" a Santa Clara County official said. Verizon yesterday acknowledged that it shouldn't have continued throttling Santa Clara County Fire Department's ""unlimited"" data service while the department was battling the Mendocino Complex Fire. Verizon said the department had chosen an unlimited data plan that gets throttled to speeds of 200kbps or 600kbps after using 25GB a month but that Verizon failed to follow its policy of ""remov[ing] data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations."" ""This was a customer support mistake"" and not a net neutrality issue, Verizon said. “Everything to do with net neutrality” Santa Clara County disputed Verizon's characterization of the problem in a press release last night. ""Verizon's throttling has everything to do with net neutrality—it shows that the ISPs will act in their economic interests, even at the expense of public safety,"" County Counsel James Williams said on behalf of the county and fire department. ""That is exactly what the Trump Administration's repeal of net neutrality allows and encourages."" Santa Clara County and the Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District are among two dozen local or state government agencies that sued the Federal Communications Commission in a bid to overturn the repeal of net neutrality rules that outlawed throttling and blocking. Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara fire department was described in detail in court documents filed as evidence in the case. ""In repealing net neutrality rules, the Trump Administration failed to consider public safety threats as required by law,"" Williams said. ""For this reason alone, the repeal of net neutrality is illegal and must be overturned."" Verizon doesn't think its throttling of the fire department's unlimited plan should be part of the lawsuit that seeks to restore net neutrality. ""This situation has nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court,"" Verizon said. The throttling affected a device on a fire department vehicle that is ""deployed to large incidents as a command and control resource"" and is used to ""track, organize, and prioritize routing of resources from around the state and country to the sites where they are most needed,"" Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a court declaration. Internet access is crucial ""for events like large fires which require the rapid deployment and organization of thousands of personnel and hundreds of fire engines, aircraft, and bulldozers,"" he wrote. Throttling could also affect how quickly the department issues warnings to the public, Santa Clara Capt. Bill Murphy told Fox 29. ""We're sending time-sensitive critical information, 'evacuate this area now,'"" Murphy said. ""If the public can't receive those notices in a timely fashion, that certainly could impact their ability to [quickly] get out of an area that we've determined is dangerous."" To lift the throttling, Verizon told the fire department to upgrade from a $37.99 plan to one that costs $99.99 for the first 20GB and $8 per gigabyte thereafter. ""While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan,"" Bowden wrote. Net neutrality rules and throttling Whether Verizon could have been punished for the throttling under the now-repealed net neutrality rules is debatable. The rules banned throttling but had an exception for ""reasonable network management."" All major carriers reserve the right to throttle unlimited data plans after customers use a certain amount each month. But the throttling generally only applies when a customer has exceeded the threshold and tries to use data in an area where the network is congested. By contrast, the fire department's plan was apparently throttled at all times regardless of whether the network was congested. If there had been a formal FCC proceeding, that might have made it difficult for Verizon to argue that the throttling was necessary to manage its network. The FCC never ruled on whether throttling in this type of scenario violated net neutrality rules. But it's conceivable that an aggressive FCC chair could have tried to stop it. In 2014, then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told Verizon that he was ""deeply troubled"" by Verizon's plan to throttle 4G users with unlimited data plans. Wheeler told Verizon that ""'reasonable network management' concerns the technical management of your network; it is not a loophole designed to enhance your revenue streams."" Wheeler rejected the ""reasonable network management"" explanation in that instance even though Verizon said it would only throttle its heaviest data users when they connect to congested cell sites. Verizon caved to Wheeler in October 2014, halting the plan to throttle LTE users on grandfathered unlimited data plans. Verizon also stopped throttling 3G network users in 2015, shortly after Wheeler's net neutrality rules were implemented. The ban on throttling wasn't the only aspect of net neutrality rules that could have gotten Verizon into trouble. The rules allowed Internet users to file complaints with the FCC about any unjust or unreasonable rates and practices, which could stop anti-consumer behavior that wasn't specifically prohibited. Current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's decision to deregulate the broadband industry eliminated that complaint option this year and also limited consumers' rights to sue Internet providers over unjust or unreasonable behavior. Verizon had stopped selling unlimited data to new customers in 2011 but re-introduced unlimited data plans with potential throttling in February 2017, shortly after Wheeler was replaced as FCC chairman by Pai. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission since 2014 has been trying to get refunds for AT&amp;T customers who were throttled despite paying for unlimited data.","County disputes Verizon claim that throttling ""has nothing to do with net neutrality.""",2018-08-22T16:15:31Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Fire dep’t rejects Verizon’s “customer support mistake” excuse for throttling,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/fire-dept-rejects-verizons-customer-support-mistake-excuse-for-throttling/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mendocino-firefighter-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,Complex fire,1
Ed Cara,"A team of Russian scientists is lining themselves up to be the opening cast of a John Carpenter film. Earlier this month, in the journal Doklady Biological Sciences, they announced they had apparently discovered ancient nematode worms that were able to resurrect themselves after spending at least 32,000 years buried in permafrost. The discovery, if legitimate, would represent the longest-surviving return from the cold ever seen in a complex, multi-celled organism, dwarfing even the tardigrade. The worms were found among more than 300 samples of frozen soil pulled from the Kolyma River Lowlands in Northeastern Siberia by the researchers. Two of the samples held the worms, with one from a buried squirrel burrow dating back 32,000 years and one from a glacier dating back 40,000 years. After isolating intact nematodes, the scientists kept the samples at 68 degrees Fahrenheit and left them surrounded by food in a petri dish, just to see what would happen. Over the next few weeks, they gradually spotted flickers of life as the worms ate the food and even cloned new family members. These cloned worms were then cultured separately, and they too thrived. It’s definitely not out of the question that these worms could have been revived after so long, according to Robin M. Giblin-Davis, a nematologist and acting director of the Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center at the University of Florida. “Theoretically, it is possible that if the organisms are protected from physical damage that would compromise their structural integrity during their frozen internment, they should be able to revive upon thawing/rehydration for very long periods of time,” he told Gizmodo via email. At the same time, the team’s findings could still be a dud. “The biggest issue is the potential for contamination of ‘ancient samples’ with ‘contemporary’ organisms,” he said. While the researchers do admit the possibility of contamination in the paper, they say it’s unlikely. They cited strict procedures to ensure complete sterility. And given that the ice samples were buried 100 feet and 15 feet down, respectively, they argue it’s implausible modern day nematodes could have wormed their way that deep. The researchers identified some of the worms in the 32,000-year-old sample as belonging to the genus Panagrolaimus, and some of the worms in the 40,000-year-old as part of the genus Plectus. Byron J. Adams, a nematologist at the University of Florida who has studied nematode species capable of surviving extreme conditions, said the researchers’ claims seem credible, based on what we know about the biology of some modern-day nematodes. “I’d love for it to be true,” Adams told Gizmodo. “We see what we think are prolonged stasis in Plectus and Panagrolaimus in Antarctica but have difficulty carbon dating them.” The discovery of such long-lived creatures would be an astounding record-breaker. Ancient bacteria buried in salt crystals over 250 million years ago supposedly have been brought back to life, but the oldest thawed-out animals only date back decades at most, such as a group of tardigrades, otherwise known as the water bear, that were resurrected after 30 years on ice. The more complex nature of these allegedly ancient nematodes could reveal more insights about the feasibility of cryostasis or how to survive in extreme conditions like space, the researchers speculated. And at the very least, they might provide clues as how these worms have evolved over time. “After 40 thousand years, we should expect to detect significant differences in evolutionary divergence between ancient and contemporary populations,” Adams said. Adams was careful to point out that because we know so little about the genetics of these modern cold-loving worms, even a genetic comparison that finds substantial differences between the thawed-out worms and other present-day populations wouldn’t necessarily confirm their longevity. He believes it will take very sophisticated tests, akin to those that confirmed the existence of nematode species that can survive deep inside the crust of the Earth, to know whether these worms are actually ancient. As far as the horror movie scenario goes, there’s no indication these worms would present any danger to people (though some species of nematode can make us sick). Still, if you’re studying long-ago frozen creatures in the Arctic, it’s probably worth stocking a fire-thrower or two.

Mark Kaufman,"Newly-born fires torched bone-dry Northern and Southern California throughout the night of November 8. One deadly blaze in particular, the Camp Fire, ripped through 70,000 acres in just 24 hours. ""It's incredible,"" Michael Gollner, a fire scientist at the University of Maryland, said of the uncontrollable Northern California wildfire. ""I dont know if I want to say unprecedented but it's getting close to that. It's incredibly rare."" ""That blows your mind,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, said in an interview. "" That impresses us in the industry."" While the Camp Fire nearly burned the entire town of Paradise to the ground, residents in heavily-populated Southern California documented their nighttime escapes from falling embers and glowing hillsides. The Woolsey and Hill fires have now burned through 14,000 acres, with thousands of residents receiving urgent nighttime evacuation messages via text. In both the north and south of the parched Golden State, the rapidly-evolving circumstances are similar: profoundly dried-out land with the arrival of persistently dry, gusty winds. ""Then all you need is a spark,"" said Belongie. Clouds of smoke seen from Hermosa Beach, California. Image: susan kaufman Although fires are complex environmental phenomena driven (and exacerbated) by weather, U.S. fires in the last couple decades have been burning at least twice as much land than in the early 1980s, and they've been burning for weeks not days longer. A warmer climate means more dry, flame-susceptible vegetation. ""These fires are going to be happening more often,"" noted Gollner. ""That blows your mind"" The California fire season should be nearing its end. Typically, by mid-October the season dies down as the first rains will make the grasses and forests less likely to burn particularly in Northern California. But not this year. ""We are still very much in fire season,"" said Belongie. ""It's just one fire after another."" The Camp Fire, barely contained as of Friday morning, is the continuation of a historic fire season in the heavily-forested northern part of the state. In July, the Carr Fire after jumping the Sacramento River grew into a towering, spinning vortex of flame. SEE ALSO: The EPA completely axed its climate change websites. But why are NASA's still live? Northern California has now seen a record number of acres burned during a fire season, Belongie said. That's around 150 percent of the previous record, she noted. The now-raging Camp Fire has exploited exceptionally dried-out forests and grasses. In some portions of Northern California, forests are now as dry as they were during the peak summer fire season, when temperatures were in the triple digits. It's now well into November, and parched forests are at their seasonal records for dryness, with some setting new records. ""This is a huge deal,"" said Belongie. For a few weeks now, California forests have been increasingly dried-out by strong, dry winds, blowing from the north and east so fire experts expected flames. And through the night, east-blowing winds blew persistent gusts through much of the state. The dry stage was set. ""Unfortunately, it's not unexpected,"" said Gollner. And Westerners can expect similar circumstances in the future. Once these large fires start, there's little that can be done to stop them even our massive fire-retardant dropping aircraft have little effect. ""The airplanes arent going to do very much once the fire grows to this enormous size,"" said Gollner. With this modern reality, society needs to prepare, emphasized Gollner. For instance, it's now imperative that flame-vulnerable communities reduce vegetation near their homes, so communities aren't met with 100-foot tall walls of flame. We can't stop the flames but we can make them manageable. ""It's not about making it a black-top all around,"" said Gollner. ""It's about reducing the fuel over the land so we dont have this really high risk next to our homes."" But for now, fire managers just want this particular season to just end. ""This is an endless fire season,"" said Belongie.","Newly-born fires torched bone-dry Northern and Southern California throughout the night of November 8.

Parker says 52 vessels are waiting to move, but the channel won't reopen until air and water quality has improved.

Wall Street Journal,"Your editorial “ Fire and Water in California ” (Aug. 8) on California’s wildfires illustrates the need for policy makers to re-examine the shortcomings of the nation’s outdated forestry practices and initiate better policies to mitigate future disasters. Poor land management marked by bureaucratic red tape and excessive litigation during the past 30 years has led to the declining health of our national forests. The result is a marked increase in acreage ravaged by insects, disease and fire, fewer jobs and productivity in the forestry sector and a reduced amount of domestically produced lumber entering the market. Failure to properly maintain forests through prudent timber extraction has resulted in an overstocking of trees that has provided fuel for more and larger deadly fires on U.S. Forest Service (USFS) lands. The evidence clearly shows that the hands-off approach to management practices adopted in the 1990s has failed the public and only worsened the impact and severity of fires on federal lands in the ensuing years. The growing scientific consensus is that active management practices decrease the number and severity of forest fires. Moreover, this is an important safety issue. The Resilient Federal Forest Act of 2017, which has been approved by the House, would address the resiliency of our national forests by significantly reducing the red tape that has prevented the USFS from better managing its timber lands and increasing the delivery of domestic timber products into the market. By striking a more appropriate balance in how we manage our national forest system, this bill will rejuvenate a great natural resource and help reinvigorate the forestry and housing industries by increasing domestic lumber supplies. Randy Noel Chairman, National Association of Home Builders Washington California has become very antilogging. We had an active logging industry in El Dorado County that supported a large lumber of jobs at a mill near Pollock Pines, Calif., in the 1960s. Today, all of this is closed down. Of course not all fire issues are related to trees, as a lot fires involve grass and brush, but there are millions of dead or dying trees in California that need to be logged and turned into something useful. Unfortunately, all our politicians seem to do is talk about doing something, and how much it would cost. The cost would be minimal if California and the feds would allow commercial logging again. Gary Oetting King City, Calif. Each year my property is inspected in the late spring to ensure that I have reduced fire danger from the brush-covered hill behind my backyard. If the inspection fails, the city sends a crew to clear the brush and sends me the bill. If the same attention were paid to government-owned land or if the government would even allow private interests to take out the dead trees for commercial purposes, we would be better able to control the wildfires which annually ravage the state. Virgil Weatherford Woodland Hills, Calif. California’s wildfires are now polluting the other lower 48 states, as reported by Scott Bachmeier, a research meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: “much of the smoke is being ejected to high altitudes and transported eastward across the lower 48 states.” On behalf of the other lower 48 states, we call on the Environmental Protection Agency to file suit against the state of California for its failure to prevent this air pollution and the contribution to climate change that California is now causing.

JILL COWAN,"Good morning.
(If you dont already get California Today by email, heres the sign-up.)
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has faced increased heat from regulators and outrage from consumers who have watched the states largest utility file for bankruptcy protection, then say that its equipment probably started the deadly Camp Fire. 
 San Francisco is exploring a public takeover, and various financial stakeholders in the company have circled as complex bankruptcy negotiations start. But how did PG&amp;E get here? 
This week, my colleagues published a piece detailing how the company has overlooked risks in favor of its bottom line over the years. And nothing explains it better than one very old tower in the Sierra Nevada foothills. I asked Ivan Penn, a business reporter based here in L.A., to explain how they got the story:
After the latest wave of wildfires in which Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has been implicated, Peter Eavis, James Glanz and I were assigned to take a deep look at a persistent question: What kind of safety culture has PG&amp;E built?
I am an energy reporter; Peter is a financial reporter in New York, and Jim is a veteran investigative reporter. Each of us brought pieces of the puzzle to the table, and one stood out: Tower 27/222, a 99-year-old transmission tower suspected of causing the 2018 Camp Fire, the worst wildfire in California history.

John Walsh,"Firefighters in Northern California struggled to get the upper hand on a three-day-old wildfire that scorched more than 30,000 acres as of Friday evening. Warm weather and winds amplified the danger as flames moves through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest region. The wildfire was growing ""incredibly fast"" after having burned 22,000 acres by Thursday, Shasta-Trinity Cal Fire Unit Chief Mike Hebrard told local reporters Friday. It was zero-percent contained. The Delta Fire was initially reported as three separate fires on Wednesday. But those combined into one and spread at a rate of one mile-per-hour at its height, Capt. Brandon Vaccaro, a fire spokesman, told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. Vaccaro said he believed the fire was human-caused, but the circumstances were not immediately clear. At least 300 people were forced to evacuate their homes in Shasta and Trinity counties. Some 1,600 residents in the town of Dunsmuir, about 280 miles north of Sacramento, were told to be prepared to evacuate. Two homes in small mountain communities were damaged by the fire as of Friday, according to another Los Angeles Times report Friday. The wildfire led to major traffic disruptions in the region when the flames threatened Interstate 5. A roughly 45-mile section of the freeway has been closed since Wednesday. California witnessed the worst wildfire in its history in July.

Beth Mole,"Enlarge / Nurses working with the World Health Organization administer the Ebola vaccine to a local doctor at the town hall of Mbandaka on May 21, 2018 during the launch of the Ebola vaccination campaign. reader comments 0 With more than 7,500 doses of an experimental vaccine against Ebola, health officials today began a vaccination campaign to try to thwart the latest outbreak of the deadly virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to the World Health Organization, the campaign will start with healthcare workers operating in areas affected by the outbreak. Then officials will focus on a “ ring vaccination ” strategy, which targets people who have had contact with someone with a confirmed case of Ebola, as well as people who have had contact with those contacts. (This creates rings of vaccination around each case, hence the name). These defensive social circles ensure that those most vulnerable to contracting the virus are protected while also preventing the spread of the virus from the most likely sources. The same strategy was critical during the campaign in the 1960s and ‘70s to eradicate smallpox —the only human disease that has ever been successfully wiped out. The Ebola-vaccination campaign will take place in the DRC’s northwestern Equator Province (Province de l’Équateur), where there have been 46 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases, including 26 deaths, as of May 18. Officials have already identified 600 contacts and contacts of contacts of cases. Nearly all cases and contacts have been in the remote town of Bikoro. But officials counted four confirmed cases in Mbandaka, a provincial capital with more than a million residents. This has raised concerns about the potential for the outbreak to explode. The more than 7,500 doses of vaccine already in the DRC are enough to cover approximately 50 rings of 150 people, the WHO notes. An additional 8,000 doses are on their way to the country, arriving in the next few days. The experimental vaccine—rVSVΔG-ZEBOV—has not been approved by relevant regulatory authorities, but the WHO has given it the greenlight under an expanded access/compassionate-use protocol. The organization has reason to be optimistic that the vaccine will squash the outbreak. The vaccine is a live, chimeric virus capable of replicating in cells. It has the backbone of the relatively harmless vesicular stomatitis virus, which tends to infect cattle and only causes mild disease in humans. This engineered virus also carries the code for Ebola’s glycoprotein. This is a protein that hangs on the outside of Ebola viruses and allows them to invade and infect human cells. On the vaccine virus, the protein can prompt the human immune system to develop protective responses against the real Ebola. In early work, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV protected mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and non-human primates from Ebola. In 2015, an international team of researchers conducted trials of ring vaccination in Guinea and Sierra Leone, vaccinating nearly 6,000 within 117 rings. The results suggested that the vaccine was generally safe and 100-percent effective at preventing Ebola. None of those vaccinated developed Ebola virus disease, whereas there were 23 cases among contacts in the trial who were either not vaccinated or received a delayed vaccination. Despite high hopes for the vaccine in this outbreak, the ring campaign won’t be easy to pull off in such a remote area of the DRC. “Implementing the Ebola ring vaccination is a complex procedure,” Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement. “The vaccines need to be stored at a temperature of minus 60 to minus 80 degrees centigrade, and so transporting them to and storing them in affected areas is a major challenge.” So far, WHO, local health authorities, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF aka Doctors Without Borders), and other partners have established an air bridge and have used helicopters and motorbikes to get around and deliver supplies. They’ve also transported the vaccine in containers that maintain sub-zero conditions for up to a week and have set up freezers in Bikoro and Mbandaka. As officials scramble, they hope the efforts are enough. “We need to act fast to stop the spread of Ebola by protecting people at risk of being infected with the Ebola virus, identifying and ending all transmission chains, and ensuring that all patients have rapid access to safe, high-quality care,” Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general for Emergency Preparedness and Response, added in a statement.","As Ebola outbreak flares, experimental vaccine gets trial by fire.",2018-05-21T20:01:18Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Vaccination method that wiped out smallpox gets unleashed today on Ebola,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/vaccination-method-that-wiped-out-smallpox-gets-unleashed-today-on-ebola/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-961020312-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,Complex fire,1
Benji Jones,"Its hard to imagine your housecat as a particularly savvy killer. Sure, it may swat at a shoelace dangled in its face, or bunny-kick its favorite fish toy when its in, you know, a mood. It may even catch a bug now and then. But your cat probably spends most of the day delicately curled up on the couch, seemingly content to do absolutely nothing. But dont let their delicate purrs deceive you: Cats are brilliant, cold-blooded assassins. And nowhere is this clearer than in Australia, where feral cats unleash utter mayhem on native fauna using a stunningly smart tactic: seeking out wildfires so they can slaughter vulnerable and disoriented prey. (Yes, everything really is more deadly in Australia.) Hugh McGregor, a biologist at the University of Tasmania whos been studying feral cats for years, has examined this cunning predation strategy. Cats can locate wildfires far off in the distance and then travel to the burn scars weeks later to feed on mammals whose homes just went up in flames, as McGregor discovered after reviewing data from 32 felines with GPS collars. Theyre so hyper-aware of the environment and their home range within the landscape, McGregor said. If theres a fire, they work out where it is, travel huge distances, and hunt there until theres nothing left. Then come back home. In one case, a cat traveled nearly eight miles to a fire scar. In another, its path was so direct that McGregor thought the tracking device had malfunctioned. But in all events, the reward was worth the journey: a bounty of prey with nowhere to hide. Hunting attempts in burn scars are three times more likely to end in a kill, said Sarah Legge, a biologist at the University of Queensland, who worked with McGregor on the project. Its a dire situation for animals who survive the smoke and flames. If youre a small mammal living in an area thats burnt by fire, your mortality goes up about 20 times, she said. Thats not because theyre harmed by the fire directlyits a result of heightened predation, she said. How exactly these cats pinpoint wildfires is still in question, but McGregor has some ideas. One theory is that cats will climb tall buildings and hills to scan the horizon for a glow. You could see it walk on to a hill, stay there for a few hours, and then walk directly to a fire scar, he said of one of the cats in his 2016 study. They spend a lot of time looking and watching the horizon. Its almost a bit like the Lion King at times. He also wondered if feral cats have some form of rudimentary communication. Not anything complex, but maybe a way of communicating something simple to close kin, such as where the nearest fire scar might be. That might explain how cats navigate so effectively, he said. Cats arent just attracted to recent fires. Downpours in the desert, for example, are often followed by a boom in small mammals, McGregor said, which wild kitties also seem to know about. After a big rain they appear in droves, he said, as if someone sent out a free food email complete with a map. These cats seem unstoppableor at least, highly adaptable, Legge said. Its not only mammals theyre hunting. According to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, feral cats kill more than a million birds and well over a million reptiles every day, amounting to a death toll of 2,000 native animals every minute. In fact, not even poisonous snakes stand in their way. They eat those, too. It proceeded for 10 minutes to chew the neck off, McGregor said, describing an observation of a cat eating a brown snake, one of Australias most deadly. It obviously knew if it digested the head it would die. And so the clever kitty severed the head and slurped the body down like spaghetti. With tactics like these, native species should be absolutely terrified of feral cats. And yet, theyre blithely unaware of the danger, since local animals didnt evolve alongside feline predators. Native wildlife doesnt respond to the cat smell, McGregor said. Theyre just not that scared of cats. Cats have been altering ecosystems Down Under ever since they were introduced to Australia in the 17th or 18th century by Europeans. Theyve established feral colonies that now cover more than 99 percent of the continent. And theyve been chewing on far more than shoe strings since they arrived. In just a few centuries, cats have been implicated in the extinction of more than 20 mammals, including the lesser bilby and the desert bandicoot, giving Australia the worst mammal extinction record in recent times, said Karl Vernes, a biologist at the University of New England in New South Wales. As these tiny terrors have done irrevocable damage to so many native critters, humans have had to intervene. Earlier this year, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy completed the worlds largest cat-proof fence, which encloses an area theyll stock with native species. And last year, the government announced a more dramatic approach: the culling of 2 million cats (which currently number between 2.1 million and 6.3 million ) by 2020. McGregor said conservationists should also find ways for feral cats and native wildlife to coexist. That might mean teaching small mammals to fear invasive predators or controlling the frequency of wildfires (which have seen an uptick following the introduction of grasses brought in for cattle grazing, Vernes noted). But you cant blame the catsa predator has gotta eat. So now, more than ever, is a great time to remind you to keep your pet cat indoors, lest it unleash its formidable hunting prowess on local wildlife.

An email chain included in court records showed that Verizon didn't increase data speeds until the department paid for a more expensive plan. A Verizon spokeswoman admitted a mistake, saying the company ""should have lifted the speed restriction"" during the emergency.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Cheryl Eddy to io9","The Mendocino Complex Fire just keeps setting records. Last week, the combination of the Ranch and River fires set the record as the state’s largest fire complex in history. But now the Ranch Fire alone is the biggest single fire to ever scar the state. Together, the Ranch and River fires have scorched 344,890 acres. But most of that has been driven by the Ranch Fire, which has burned much more vigorously. As of Monday morning, the fire had burned through 295,970 acres. That sets it 15,000 acres above the Thomas Fire, last year’s previous record-holding fire. It’s a sad footnote to what’s been a explosive summer of fires and smoke in Northern California. The Ranch Fire began on July 27, taking just 17 days to chew through an area more than 10 times the size of San Francisco. Elsewhere, the Carr Fire has left a trail of destruction in Redding and the Ferguson Fire forced Yosemite National Park to evacuate portions of the park last month. Data compiled by CAL FIRE, the state’s fire agency, shows that fires for the year-to-date have burned five times more acreage in California compared the five-year average. Add in fires on Forest Service land that’s burned and its nearly a sevenfold increase in acreage burned compared to normal. All told, the state is on track to see a million acres of land burned up before Labor Day. Then it’s time for fall wildfire season when Santa Ana and Diablo winds can whip up flames in Southern and Northern California respectively (see: last year ). And unfortunately, above normal fire activity is likely through November according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

Sure, you’ve seen the Minecraft Eiffel Tower and beamed aboard the Minecraft USS Enterprise, but have you considered where you might wait out the end of days? Well, not you exactly, but people more important than you. To draw attention to the escalating threat of global nuclear annihilation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), which works to “prevent catastrophic attacks with weapons of mass destruction and disruption—nuclear, biological, radiological, chemical and cyber,” has partnered with the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies to craft a virtual tour of the nuclear fallout facilities that Russian and/or American leadership will be whisked into on the advent of nuclear war. The team has really outdone itself with the Fallout -esque teaser video. As OTI explains: “Nothing better illustrates the continuing absurdity of plans to fight a nuclear war than the massive complex of underground bunkers that the United States and Russia have built to survive and fight on even after both societies have collapsed. To help explain the scale of these facilities, we have reconstructed two, Site R in rural Pennsylvania (also known as Raven Rock) and the Kosvinsky underground command facility in Russia, roughly to scale using the popular immersive gaming platform Minecraft.” For anyone with the game, you can fire up a multiplayer instance of Minecraft, select “direct connect” and put in server address 185.38.151.31:25566 to visit Raven Rock, the underground makeshift Pentagon located near Camp David, or 185.38.151.2:25566 to tool around Kosvinsky, “a survivable command post” that serves as Russia’s equivalent. OTI cautions that it only lets zombies out on the weekends. For anyone without Minecraft, you can take an in-browser virtual tour on OTI’s post about the project, which is also chock full of interesting nuclear bunker facts that put the existence of such underground facilities in an appropriately dark context. The tour is much clunkier outside the game, but the Minecraft experience actually looks pretty cool in that eerie we-definitely-won’t-survive-but-these-people-probably-will way.

Ominous, orange flames soon appeared on hills above the wooded community as the infamous Thomas Fire, burning for nearly two weeks at that point, lunged over the ridge and pushed into the enclave below. The odds weighed in the fire's favor: The winds picked up overnight, blowing 65 mph gusts in the direction of hundreds and hundreds of homes. But when the smoke and ash finally settled, the fire had lost for the most part, anyhow.

Since 1999, Montecito has spent a little over $1.6 million on becoming fire resistant. ""That's so small,"" said Kolden. The defensive campaign adopted an almost battle-like strategy. Montecito set out to defend the higher road system that cuts across the top of town, largely separating the sprawling Los Padres National Forest from Montecito. The intent was simple: Thin about 70 percent of vegetation along the high road system, and effectively create a line of resistance. Montecito's location, about a 2 hour drive north of Los Angeles. Image: google Not all the vegetation can be removed, of course. That would doom the unstable land during rains, enabling deadly landslides, and debris flows. ""If you go back 20 years, people wanted to run bulldozers behind the whole community,"" said Kerry Kellogg, a Montecito city wildland fire specialist. ""But that wasn't acceptable."" The intent isn't to keep all the fire out. But to hold wildfires in the hills by choking off their fuel supply. That makes defending the town manageable. ""Its the difference between living in a matchbox and a place thats more resistant"" ""The fire is going to come through, but it won't be a big, tall, fire front,"" Kellogg, who previously fought fires for 35 years, said. These changes are subtle, perhaps even imperceptible to the casual observer. Nearly all the flammable vegetation below a field of oak trees may be removed along the road but the trees remain amid the naked ground. Or, lines of cactus replace fire-prone trees. Cleared out ground vegetation along the high road. Image: Mark Kaufman These focused lines of defense proved valuable for firefighters during the approaching December 16 firestorm. ""The firemen said when they were in Montecito there was a comfort level,"" noted Kellogg. ""You feel like you could safely let the fire come to you."" The same cleared routes also allow people an improved means of escape if necessary. In rapidly-moving fires over the past year, both law enforcement and the public found themselves in ""tunnels of fire"" as flames incinerated the vegetation around them. Cleared vegetation on the right, with sparse vegetation on the hill above the road (distance). Image: Mark Kaufman ""If we remove vegetation on both sides of the road, that allows people to not have that tunnel of fire,"" said Kolden. The ability to safely flee on short notice is also critical because staying put simply isn't an option in the U.S. Folks in fire country don't have anywhere to seek refuge, like underground bunkers to hide away from the (fire)storm. SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change Sure, some homes may be fire resistant, but can't necessarily withstand an indomitable urban conflagration, like that in Paradise. ""I would say that unless somebody has an asphalt donut around their house and their house is made of concrete, that's [staying] not a great option,"" Alison Green, program coordinator for Project Wildfire, a government disaster organization in Deschutes County, Oregon, said in an interview. ""As much as we can, we like to move people out of the way,"" added Green. Raining embers Even before a large wildfire hits town, its embers will start raining down upon roofs and vegetation. It's how a fire effectively spreads, sometimes well in advance of the flames. It's what happened in Paradise. ""All it takes is one house,"" said Kolden. ""Once they start burning it's really tough to stop them."" But Montecito urges its residents to clear out their yards, put mesh screening over vents (to block embers), and harden their homes in other ways, such as non-flammable roofs. In fact, it's state law that homeowners in fire country maintain 100 feet of cleared out ""defensible space"" around their houses. That Montecito has professionals ensuring or promoting these defensive measures is critical to its fire resistance. ""What makes Montecito different is there's always been a wildfire specialist thats always been their job,"" said Kellogg, who watched the flames burning above town in December 2017. Falling embers are inevitable. So if all the houses in the neighborhood are resistant to catching fire, a big conflagration will have a difficult time igniting amid an unsuspecting, or still evacuating neighborhood. ""You need to have all the houses hardened against fire, so there's a herd immunity against fire,"" said Kolden. Montecito vs Paradise Paradise and Montecito are both situated in fire country, but they're quite different. Paradise is a working-class community surrounded by pine forest, whereas Montecito is one of the nation's wealthiest enclaves, settled amid Southern California's shrublands, gnarled oak trees, and the state's towering, ubiquitous weed, eucalyptus. The circumstances around the respective extreme fires were different, too. Montecito had been acutely aware of the Thomas Fire for weeks, and firefighters were prepared to make a stand. ""Fires never will be the same,"" noted Kellogg. But robust defensive fire lines and intelligent clearing of flammable brush a method of fire prevention Montecito takes seriously would almost certainly have helped the now-gutted town of Paradise. After sparking, the Camp Fire reached the mountain community of Paradise in just 3.5 hours. Once there, it raged right through, consuming wooden homes. It's velocity shocked fire scientists. People burned alive in their cars. ""It gives people the time they need to escape,"" said Kolden of Montecito's defensive efforts. ""I have to believe that would have made a huge difference in Paradise."" Because future megafires are inevitable, ever spurred on by a warming world and drying land, developing a Montecito-like fire-resistance may no longer be a choice. These modern infernos will undoubtedly come for other towns, like they did for Paradise. ""There are hundreds of Paradise communities out there,"" John Bailey, a fire ecologist at Oregon State University, said in an interview. Crippling the megafires Wildfires are complex beasts. Today's disastrous blazes are the confluence of weather, a warming climate, mismanaged forests, and development in fire country. Hazy-smoke skies, with wooded Montecito on left and a cleared out high road driveway on right. Image: Mark Kaufman Yet just as the potent role of climate change can't be ignored in parching the land and helping to produce record dryness, either can the role of long-suppressed wildfires in the U.S. Wildfires will always come to town, but they can arrive in less mighty forms. ""Part of the solution is not to suppress fires,"" said Oregon State's Bailey. For well over half a century, the U.S. government has quashed forest fires, which naturally thin out the forests. ""There are hundreds of Paradise communities out there"" ""Post World War ll we not only had a culture to suppress fires, but we had new technology for it,"" said Bailey, noting that the Interior Department established a well-organized system of lookout towers, air tankers, and trucks. There was also a slight cooling trend in the 1950s, 1960s, and into the 1970s, owing to large-scale shifts in the dominant Pacific Ocean (though this certainly didn't stop nor diminish today's longer-term warming trend). ""It was pretty easy to put fires out,"" said Bailey. ""I did it for three years Im guilty."" But today, on top of overgrown forests, is the reality of accelerated global warming. ""Now were in a climatic period where the fire seasons are getting longer and deeper, hotter and drier, and maybe even windier,"" he emphasized. Thinning out these forests, however, requires federal funding and commitment. And that commitment isn't there. Cleared land along Montecito's high road system. Image: Mark Kaufman Bailey cites the 400,000-some acres of ponderosa pine (a common, fire-vulnerable tree) areas in Oregon's greater Deschutes National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service only burns, or treats, around 2,000 acres a year, he said. ""Do the math on that,"" said Bailey. ""In a big fire event, it doesn't even slow it down."" But thinning forests won't slow every fire. The recent Woolsey Fire, south of Montecito, largely burned scrublands and grasslands. There were no overgrown forests to eliminate. It was just a bad fire, helped along by seasonal winds and increasingly dried-out land. This makes Montecito's defenses all the more relevant. The fires will continue coming, and these wild woodlands, which sustain life, water, and tranquility, are more susceptible to flame. ""Its a watershed, it's a walk in the woods, but its also fuel,"" said Bailey. ""And its going to burn.""","In the early hours of December 16, 2017, hot embers began raining down on the Southern California town of Montecito.

Kiona N. Smith,"Enlarge / The handle of a digging stick from Pogetti Vecchi. reader comments 0 A collection of broken wooden tools unearthed in southern Italy offers new evidence that Neanderthals used fire to shape wooden tools as early as the Middle Paleocene, about 171,000 years ago. The find sheds important new light on the earliest use of fire, and it reveals how sophisticated Neanderthal technology was. The tools, called digging sticks, are still in use today. If you’re a hunter-gatherer, the digging stick is your version of the Swiss Army knife for foraging: about a meter long, with one end rounded to offer a handle and the other tapered into a blunt almost-point. They’re useful for digging up roots and tubers, hunting burrowing animals, or pounding and grinding herbs. And the Neanderthals of Middle Pleistocene Italy created and used digging sticks that would be perfectly familiar to modern members of the Australian Bindibu people, the Hadza people of Tanzania, and the San people of southern Africa. Broken Tools Wood is a popular material for tools in modern hunter-gatherer societies, mostly because it’s available and relatively easy to work with. Archaeologists assume early humans, including Neanderthals, must have used it as well. “It could be supposed that simple wood or bone objects were the first artifacts created and used by early human ancestors, long before the earliest preserved artifacts, stone tools,” said archaeologist Biancamaria Arunguren. But we don’t have much actual evidence for how early humans used wood, because, unlike stone or bone, wood tends to decay after thousands of years in the ground. That’s what makes the new find so rare. Archaeologists unearthed pieces of several wooden digging sticks from a site in Tuscany called Poggetti Vecchi. The site is a plain at the foot of a low hill, near some warm springs. One hundred and seventy-one thousand years ago, grasslands and marshes surrounded the shore of a lake here, according to lake sediments and pollen analysis. Those grasslands were home to large grazing mammals, including straight-tusked elephants known to science as Palaeolaxodon antiquus, the bones of which litter the site. Artifacts here date to a period when Neanderthals roamed the hills of southern Italy. Archaeologists excavating the site in 2012 found 39 broken pieces of the sticks, along with an assortment of stone tools. Of the 39 fragments, only about four pointed tips and six rounded handles survived, along with 31 pieces of shafts. Four of the handles and all of the tips had been broken during the tools’ lifetimes. And the digging sticks weren’t well-preserved—microscopy showed that bacteria had eaten away at the cell walls of the wood, for instance. But poor preservation is better than no preservation, and the broken bits of wood had plenty to tell archaeologists. Shaped by Fire Researchers noticed that one of the digging sticks had a 1mm-thick layer of black film on its shaft, and its surface was fractured in a square-like pattern reminiscent of charring. Chemical testing revealed that the wood had, in fact, been charred, and so had 11 of the other finds. This must have been deliberate, because they were all charred evenly, with a thin film, and on the same part of the stick. That implies carefully controlled exposure to a flame. Archaeologists say that the Neanderthals probably used fire to char the surface of the wood to make it easier to scrape off the bark and shape the ends. Boxwood is one of the strongest European hardwoods, which makes it perfect for a durable tool like a digging stick, but it’s also hard to whittle into shape with stone tools. Fire would have softened an outer layer and made it easier to work. When Aranguren and her colleagues tried working some boxwood branches, they found that they couldn’t shape the rounded handles and blunt points without charring the wood first. Modern hunter-gatherers use the same method today, but we’ve never found evidence of the technique being used so early. Some archaeologists think that Homo heidelbergensis, an ancestor of Neanderthals, may have used a similar method to shape spears in a 300,000-year-old site in Germany. The German tips come to much sharper points than the digging sticks at Poggetti Vecchi, but there’s no physical evidence for the use of flame. That makes the Poggetti Vecchi digging sticks the earliest clear examples of wooden tools shaped with fire. They show that even early Neanderthals knew enough to choose the best wood for the tool—not just pick up whatever sticks happened to be lying around or easy to work with—and then utilize both fire and stone tools in order to produce a finished tool. It takes a lot of planning, specific knowledge, and painstaking, precise work to pull that off, which demonstrates the sophistication of Neanderthal tool-making abilities. A Look at Prehistoric Women’s Lives And the Italian find also adds a chapter to the story of how humanity adopted and tamed fire. Archaeologists still aren’t sure exactly when, or how, humans first learned to use and control fire and then to create it at their convenience. “Most recent studies suppose during the Middle Pleistocene, a regular use of natural fire sources with perhaps the occasional development of fire-making technology,” said Arunguren. If by 171,000 years ago, Neanderthals were using fire in very precise, complex ways, that’s either an indication of how quickly our collective fire-handling skills advanced or a hint that fire use may be older than the first evidence we have for it so far. The Poggetti Vecchi digging sticks may also be some of the earliest known tools used specifically by women. In most modern hunter-gatherer cultures, digging sticks are women’s tools. “Digging sticks are mostly used by women and regarded as women’s personal property, in the same way that spears are regarded as men’s personal property,” wrote Aranguren and her colleagues. These artifacts may offer new insight into Neanderthal women’s lives and work. And they’re also an indication that a whole Neanderthal community, not just an all-male hunting party, may have spent time on the rich lakeside hunting grounds of Poggetti Vecchi. PNAS, 2017.

Marcus Gilmer,"President Donald Trump rode political conspiracy theories all the way to the White House, and now he now finds himself at the center of one. SEE ALSO: Mueller reportedly wants to question Trump about his Tweets By now, you've probably heard about QAnon, the online conspiracy theory figure whose following makes the Illuminati look like the burglars from Home Alone. Supporters of the conspiracy showed up at Trump's rally in Tampa on Tuesday and have even targeted Tom Hanks on YouTube, making their presence known in the mainstream. Trump has helped feed the beast, whether he knows it or not. The followers of ""Q"" are always on the lookout for clues anywhere, anything that reinforces their absurdly detailed, multi-layered mega-conspiracy — an umbrella that connects everything from the Mueller probe to Pizzagate to the 1999 death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Even as the White House has tried to condemn these conspiracies, Trump's own words and actions have only hardened the resolve of the #QAnon crowd. Okay, what the hell is QAnon? While the QAnon conspiracy has been growing larger and larger, getting boosts from far-right celebs like Roseanne Barr and former MLB pitcher Curt Schilling, it didn't really hit the spotlight until Tuesday night. Since then, you can take your pick of explainers of the vast web of theories and how ""EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED."" It's such an incredibly, ever-evolving mess that, just like snowflakes, no two explainers are alike. You could delve into any number of them, from Vox to the New York Times to the Washington Post to Buzzfeed, and still not fully grasp the breadth of QAnon. At its core, the QAnon crowd believe a person with high intelligence clearance, named ""Q,"" has been posting clues (or ""drops"" or ""bread crumbs"") about how Trump is actually working to flush out enemies of the state on the anonymous image boards 4chan and 8chan. For instance, according to QAnon, the Mueller probe is actually Trump and Robert Mueller working together to bring down Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama who were actually the ones compromised by Vladimir Putin. And, along the way, Trump has, inadvertently or not, helped give the QAnon followers what they've been looking for: a ""storm"" that will cleanse the federal government for all good patriots. ""The calm before the storm"" Trump himself kicked off this whole mess with what, at the time, seemed like innocuous Trump bluster, violent bravado that was very much in line with previous comments he had made. During an October 2017 photo op with military staff, Trump said, “You guys know what this represents? Maybe it’s the calm before the storm.” TRUMP: ""Maybe it's the calm before the storm.""... REPORTER: ""What storm Mr. President?"" TRUMP: ""You'll find out."" (via Satellite News) pic.twitter.com/bWMzGrDPNa — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) October 5, 2017 Trump being Trump, he refused to elaborate on the comment, leading to speculation it could be a hint at forthcoming military operations. But the phrase ""the storm"" came to be the central point of a growing conspiracy that Trump was actually that major agent of change who had ascended to the White House to flush out members of the Deep State, Obama loyalists, and other ""enemies of the state."" It had conspiracy theorists already primed for when, three weeks later, the first ""drop"" from the mysterious ""Q"" was made on 4chan. The number 17 Perhaps the biggest QAnon clue that Trump repeatedly references, whether he knows it or not, is the number 17. Q is the 17th letter in the alphabet so it goes to follow that the number 17 holds a lot of significance for the QAnon believers. And those following the developments from this week raised a collective eyebrow when, on Wednesday morning following the rally where the QAnon supporters were spotted, Trump dashed out a tweet with the number 17 in it...This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2018 Now, Trump has tweeted the number 17 plenty of times before and had even explained his changing of his ""13 Angry Democrats"" phrase to ""17 Angry Democrats"" on Sunday, a fairly reasonable explanation, right? Nope. The number was out there, catching the attention of those over at Reddit's QAnon hub, r/greatawakening. r/greatawakening Image: mashable screenshot It even cropped up after Trump's call on Wednesday to Rush Limbaugh's show, he got flagged by the Reddit QAnon followers for saying he'd visited Washington 17 times before his election, echoing what he said at his Tuesday rally in Tampa. They believe Trump was sending them a message. And, if you want one more example of how deep the belief in ""17"" goes, consider that when Trump was given a jersey by the University of Alabama college football championship team that had the number 17 on it, the QAnon crowd went nuts (via the New York Times ). Of course, the number could refer to the fact that Alabama was champion of the 2017 season or that it was, according to Alabama, their 17th national championship. This seems pretty easy to explain away. But not to QAnon. To them, all of these were secret messages from the president, little winks to let them know he knows they know. Looking for anything And that's the thing about the QAnon crowd: the messages are often so cryptic and vague, you could warp just about anything to make it seem like it's connected, a benchmark of many conspiracy theories. When Trump dropped a few tweets with typos in them on Wednesday — again, a very normal Trump thing to do — QAnon followers went deep looking for hidden messages from Trump, noting his misspelling of ""smoking"" as ""smocking"" had a conspiratorial meaning and that multiple typos added up to a hidden message about, of course, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Another example of grasping for straws: an otherwise harmless tweet from Trump promoting ""Small Business Saturday."" From The Washington Post : Q once posted in entirety: _Conf_goTWIT_P_act-small#_ RED1_RED2_ Q Nonsense? Probably, but later that same afternoon in November, Trump tweeted, “Happy #SmallBusinessSaturday ” Small and small. To devotees, it’s proof that Trump really is working with Q. It's either a very, very deep and complex conspiracy Trump is working here or it's just one big game of Calvinball, where the rules and connections are made up as we go along. Everything Trump says and does can be twisted to meet QAnon's needs, a dangerous possibility considering Trump has never been one to reflect and choose his words carefully. Trump's conspiracy history Finally, the reason so many people are willing to embrace Trump as being at the center of such a sprawling conspiracy is because the president has himself embraced several baseless conspiracies. Whether it was the Obama "" birther"" theory that he helped spread, questioning Vince Foster's suicide, or suggesting Supreme Court justice Anton Scalia was murdered, Trump has been the poster child for conspiracy theorists. By even giving these theories (and more) a mere public nod, he's legitimized them in the minds of those who believe them, making it easier for them to believe he's at the center of QAnon's fantastical web. Where does it end? It's become serious enough that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about it on Wednesday during a press briefing. Sanders distanced the White House from QAnon by saying the president ""condemns and denounces any group that would incite violence against another individual."" But we've already seen what can happen when conspiracy theories can spill into real life violence, both with Pizzagate and, thanks to an incident a few weeks ago at the Hoover Dam, even QAnon. Whether QAnon leads to more violence remains to be seen.","President Donald Trump rode political conspiracy theories all the way to the White House, and now he now finds himself at the center of one.

Lewin Day,"3D printing makes it easy to produce complex geometries, but the fused deposition methods generally create parts with poor surface finish, largely due to the layers being highly visible in the finished part. There are a wide variety of ways to deal with this, often involving sanding parts after production, or the use of fillers and paints. [XerotoLabs] has another solution. (YouTube, video below the break.) To smooth the parts, a butane torch is pressed into service. The flame temperature is kept fairly low, and the torch is used almost like a brush to evenly apply heat to the surface of the part. As the PLA reaches its melting temperature, surface tension helps to smooth the part out. This is very similar to flame polishing which is commonly used in the fabrication of acrylic plastics. It is a technique that requires some finesse – too much heat or focus on a single area, and you’re liable to end up with a molten plastic blob instead of a nice shiny finished part. Precautions must also be taken to avoid burning yourself or your workshop to the ground. But it’s a useful tool to have in your kit when you’re producing PLA parts that you want to look their best. We’ve seen other techniques for smoothing PLA, too – the solvent method is particularly interesting.","3D printing makes it easy to produce complex geometries, but the fused deposition methods generally create parts with poor surface finish, largely due to the layers being highly visible in the finished part.

Vanessa Romo,"A fire helicopter takes off through smoke rising to make a drop on active fires in Yosemite National Park last week after the park reopened following a three-week closure. Gary Kazanjian/AP Firefighters continue to battle the largest fire in California history even as another large blaze has been contained. The Ranch Fire, one of the two wildfires that make up the Mendocino Complex, has burned through 341,047 acres — or 533 square miles — and is at 76 percent containment, Cal Fires reported on Sunday. Daron Wyatt, a public information officer, said challenging weather conditions and ""steep, inaccessible terrain,"" have made progress against the fire especially difficult, according to The Press Democrat. The newspaper reported, ""Wyatt said he has seen recent photos of some of the 3,500 firefighters assigned to the fire scrambling along hillsides with 60 percent slopes, so steep they needed to pull themselves up by their fire hoses."" By late Sunday the fire had gained another 6,000 acres. After raging for 17 days, the River Fire was contained on Aug. 13., but not before flames tore through 48,920 acres. The total acreage consumed by the twin fires is 389,967 since they first broke out on July 27, with a combined containment of 79 percent. In all, 157 homes and some 120 structures have been destroyed. Matt Burchett, a veteran firefighter and battalion chief with the Draper Fire Department in Utah, was killed in the intense fight against the fire Ranch fire on Aug. 13. The Deseret News reported his body was returned home with a ""solemn escort, without lights or sirens"" on Friday. He was accompanied by the Utah firefighters who also helped combat the fire. Despite the difficulties, officials say full containment is still expected by Sept. 1. Crews continue making progress on the devastating Carr Fire that is raging further north in the Redding area. Cal Fire reported that the Shasta County fire, set off by sparks from the rim of a flat tire scraping along Highway 299, is now 83 percent contained. So far, it has charred more than 227,098 acres and is by far the most destructive of the state's fires. It has decimated 1,079 residences, 22 commercial structures and 503 other buildings. At least seven people have been killed in the fire, started July 23, including three firefighting personnel and a great-grandmother and two children. It took firefighters a few days longer than they had hoped, but the Ferguson Fire, which shut down swaths of Yosemite National Park and scorched more than 96,000 acres, was fully contained on Saturday night. Achieving 100 percent containment means officials have stopped it from spreading but it does not mean it is completely out. As Ferguson Fire Information Officer Brendan Halle told Ryan Levi of the public radio show The California Report, ""It's not controlled."" ""Controlled would be after there are no more hot spots or smoking areas, and there are still interior pockets of unburned fuel in that containment line that are probably going to smoke for a while until they have the first really good storm or wetting rain up in this region, and that will probably lead to the whole thing being controlled,"" Halle said. The Ferguson Fire burned for more than a month — 36 days — killed two firefighters, and has had a calamitous impact on what is traditionally the peak tourist season in and round Yosemite National Park. Levi says that park closures have resulted in about $50 million in lost revenue. According to Levi, ""Park officials closed the popular Yosemite Valley to the public on July 25, and the following week, the fire burned into the park for the first time, leading the National Park Service to close a large portion of the park indefinitely on August 5.

Mariella Moon,"One of the biggest safety threats Boeing and SpaceX had to address was space debris. Both have to make sure their capsules are sufficiently protected from orbital debris, tiny meteors and other particles hurtling through space that could cause serious damage. Boeing plans to use 3D-printed plastic components that can endure extremely harsh environmental conditions better than other materials can. According to The Wall Street Journal's report, it also plans to fit Starliner with some Kevlar. SpaceX said it worked with NASA to define the orbital-debris environment in Low Earth Orbit and to conjure up a Dragon design that mitigates risks brought about by being pummeled with flying space rocks. If NASA itself had concerns about safety, it certainly did its best to hide them: The agency showed tremendous confidence and trust in the program and its participants this year. It promised to award both companies four more contracts after they successfully demonstrate that their vehicles can safely carry humans to orbit. In March, ISS crew members even installed a second dock that space taxis can use when they finally start ferrying astronauts to the space station. That said, the agency is thinking up ways to ensure Crew Dragon and Starliner stay in top shape. According to Tabatha Thompson, NASA Commercial Space Program's communications lead, the agency is evaluating the use of in-orbit inspections for the capsules. Outside of safety-related tests and regulations for their vehicles, Boeing and SpaceX both showed off their spacesuit designs this year. Between the two, Boeing's blue suit bears more resemblance to astronauts' current fashion choices, though it's 40 percent lighter than NASA's bulky suits and can keep their wearers much cooler. (Here's a little trivia: The suit was modeled by Christopher Ferguson, the last space-shuttle mission's commander and the one who left that historic American flag aboard the ISS. He's now the director of Crew and Mission Operations for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program.) SpaceX's, on the other hand, is far removed from typical astronaut wear and has a much slimmer silhouette. That's because it's meant to be worn only inside the Dragon and other pressurized environments. It also wouldn't look out of place at a Daft Punk concert. 2018: What's next? Unsurprisingly, before they can get their first flights off the ground, both companies have to put their vehicles through even more grueling tests. In the first quarter of 2018, Boeing will put the spotlight on Starliner's propulsion systems needed to maneuver the spacecraft during its journey. The company will follow that up with a pad-abort test. It will fire Starliner's four launch-abort engines, taking the capsule a mile up and a mile out before it parachutes into the desert. SpaceX is already making custom-fit suits for the Crew Program astronauts and will continue the suits' qualification and validation testing next year. In addition, it intends to ramp up the testing of the engines that will provide the power that Falcon 9's first and second stages need to be able to reach the ISS. Because it plans to take off from launch pad 39A, the same historic complex NASA used to launch space shuttles, it'll also complete the installation of a crew-access arm at the site. After they fly astronauts to the ISS for the first time, the companies can start realizing plans outside of their work with NASA. SpaceX, as mentioned earlier, will take private citizens around the moon aboard Crew Dragon and will fly more privately crewed flights in the future. Boeing also plans to sell Starliner's fifth seat to paying customers, whether they're wealthy space fans or researchers sent by their institutions. It sees a long-term strategy in turning the Starliner into a Low-Earth Orbit liner, regularly taking passengers to space and back.","Aboard the International Space Station, an A4-size flag of the United States hangs next to a 1:100 model of a space shuttle.

George Obulutsa,"Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, Kenya, Jan. 15, 2019.
THOMAS MUKOYA/Reuters
Gunmen blasted their way into a hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital on Tuesday, sending workers fleeing for their lives as others cowered under their desks from an attack claimed by Somali Islamists al Shabaab.
At least one person was killed and eight wounded, hospital officials said. Police warned the terror attack may still be ongoing, with the assailants still inside the upscale 14 Riverside Drive complex.
The main door of the hotel was blown open and there was a human arm in the street severed from the shoulder, said Serge Medic, the Swiss owner of a security company who ran to the scene to help civilians when he heard of the attack from his taxi driver.

Medic, who was armed, entered the building with a policeman and two soldiers, he said, but they came under fire and retreated. An unexploded grenade lay in the lobby, he said.
One man said he saw two armed men with scarves on their head and bandoliers of bullets, Medic told Reuters, as gunfire echoed in the background, more than two hours after the attack began.
A woman shot in the leg was carried out and three men emerged covered in blood. Some office workers climbed out of windows. Many told Reuters that they had had to leave colleagues behind, still huddled under their desks.
Theres a grenade in the bathroom, one officer yelled as police rushed out from one building.
We heard a loud bang from something that was thrown inside. Then I saw shattered glass, Geoffrey Otieno, who works at a beauty salon in the complex, told Reuters. We hid until we were rescued.
Kenya has often been targeted by al Shabaab, who killed dozens of people in a shopping center in 2013 and nearly 150 students at a university in 2015.
We are behind the attack in Nairobi. The operation is going on, said Abdiasis Abu Musab, the groups military operations spokesman.

According to its website, 14 Riverside is home to the local offices of international companies including BASF, Colgate Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser, Pernod Ricard, Dow Chemical and SAP, as well as the dusitD2 hotel, part of the Thai hotel group Dusit Thani.
The Australia embassy is across the road from the compound. Kenya is an expatriate hub for diplomats, aid workers, businessmen and others operating around east Africa.
I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives, a woman working in a bank in the complex said, adding she had heard two explosions.
Kenyan television featured appeals for blood from local hospitals and showed police cordoning off the route to ensure vehicles could move quickly. Red Cross ambulances ferried victims away.
Al Shabaab says its attacks in Kenya are revenge for Kenyan troops stationed inside Somalia which has been riven by civil war since 1991.
The Kenyan troops, concentrated in the south, originally went into Somalia to try to create a buffer zone along the border. They are now part of an African Union peacekeeping force supporting the weak U.N.-backed central government.","Gunmen storm Nairobi hotel compound in deadly attack claimed by al-Shabab The Globe and Mail Extremists attack hotel in Nairobi; al-Shabab claims role CTV News Kenya hotel complex under attack, al-Shabaab claims responsibility CBC.ca Gunfire, explosions erupt…",2019-01-15T13:31:43Z,"{'id': 'the-globe-and-mail', 'name': 'The Globe And Mail'}",Gunmen storm Nairobi hotel compound in deadly attack claimed by al-Shabab - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-gunshots-heard-at-hotel-office-complex-in-kenyan-capital/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/JM317SyckmZ0E3Q9Lw2xe9LfO3c=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKCWHTUIU5GCPFP33NWVQIUDBE.JPG,the-globe-and-mail,The Globe And Mail,Complex fire,1

Noreen Jazul,"By Antonio L. Colina IV
DAVAO CITY A mix of iconic medium and high-rise buildings, inspired by some exotic and endemic plants of Mindanao, will rise within the 9.6-hectare property of the Victoria Plaza mall complex, an official of the Hong Kong-based design company said.
(Google Maps / MANILA BULLETIN)
Walter V. Melicor, chief financial officer of the Elements Habitare, said that the development would have five phases.
The Lim family, which operates the homegrown New City Commercial Corporation (NCCC), took over the mall management on Wednesday after announcing its acquisition on March 12 at an undisclosed amount.
He discussed that the first two phases would have five-star hotel, condominium, and serviced apartments; a twin-tower in phase 3; NCCC headquarters in phase 4; and four-story mall in phase 5.
The designs of the most iconic components of the 9.6-hectare development, such as twin-tower, NCCC corporate building, and mall took inspiration from the exotic plants of Mindanao, according to Melicor.
He said the design of the twin tower would be inspired by the pitcher plant, a carnivorous plant endemic to Mt. Hamiguitan, Davao Oriental province; the corporate building by the exotic mangosteen fruit; and the mall by the petals of the waling-waling plant endemic to Mindanao.
Melicors team designed some of the worlds iconic buildings, among them Marina Bay Sands of Singapore, Galaxy Macau, a casino resort in Macau, and Okada Manila, a luxury hotel casino in the Philippines.
Melicor said the Lim family would decide if it wants to retain the old structure of the mall, but added the current conceptual design might require a total demolition of the old structure to give way for the construction of the new mall.
He said the current structure might not support the proposed expansion of the mall.
We are moving forward to the future. The sentimentality will always be there, in the place but not in the building. I think the building — we have to enhance and make it iconic building at par with the world, he said.
But NCCC  President Sharlene A. Lim assured the old mall building would be retained, and that it would only need a facelift.
She said the company plans to proceed with a phase-by-phase development of the old Victoria Plaza Mall as it did for its NCCC Mall in Maa before a massive fire destroyed it on December 23, 2017. The fire incident killed the malls key custodian and 37 call center agents of Survey Sampling International (SSI).
Lim added the company plans to develop dilapidated cinemas into a family entertainment center, where the restaurants located at the periphery of the malls parking space will be relocated.
The mall tenants, including ukay-ukay vendors, would be provided a space, she said.
She said NCCC Department Store and Supermarket would eventually take over the department and supermarket of the Victoria Plaza.
She said the Victoria Plaza has over 300 tenants at present.
Inaugurated on March 16, 1993, the Davao Sunrise Investment &amp; Development Corporation of the Limso family previously managed the Victoria Plaza, a premier mall of the Dabawenyos in the 1990s.
On the start of the development, Lim added her family plans to get this running sooner.
She said NCCC welcomes players to invest in the mixed-use development.","<p>DAVAO CITY – A mix of “iconic” medium and high-rise buildings, inspired by some exotic and endemic plants of Mindanao, will rise within the 9.6-hectare property of the Victoria Plaza mall complex, an official of the Hong Kong-based design company said.</p>",2019-03-28T07:43:14Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mb.com.ph'}",Buildings inspired by exotic Mindanao plants to rise in Victoria Plaza complex - Manila Bulletin,https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/03/28/buildings-inspired-by-exotic-mindanao-plants-to-rise-in-victoria-plaza-complex/,https://news.mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/victoriaplazamall.jpg,,Mb.com.ph,Complex fire,1
Natasha Lomas,"It’s been hard to miss the scooter startup wars opening fresh, techno-fueled rifts in Valley society in recent months. Another flavor of ride-sharing steed which sprouted seemingly overnight to clutter up sidewalks — drawing rapid-fire ire from city regulators apparently far more forgiving of traffic congestion if it’s delivered in the traditional, car-shaped capsule. Even in their best, most-groomed PR shots, the dockless carelessness of these slimline electrified scooters hums with an air of insouciance and privilege. As if to say: Why yes, we turned a kids’ toy into a battery-powered kidult transporter — what u gonna do about it? An earlier batch of electric scooter sharing startups — offering full-fat, on-road mopeds that most definitely do need a license to ride (and, unless you’re crazy, a helmet for your head) — just can’t compete with that. Last mile does not haul. But a short-walk replacement tool that’s so seamlessly manhandled is also of course easily vandalized. Or misappropriated. Or both. And there have been a plethora of scooter dismemberment / kidnap horror stories coming out of California, judging by reports from the scooter wars front line. Hanging scooters in trees is presumably a protest thing. Scooter brand Lime struck an especially tone-deaf tech note trying to fix this problem after an update added a security alarm that bellowed robotic threats to call the cops on anyone who fumbled to unlock them. Safe to say, littering abusive scooters in public spaces isn’t a way to win friends and influence people. Even when functioning ‘correctly’, i.e. as intended, scooter rides can ooze a kind of brash entitlement. The sweatless convenience looks like it might be mostly enabling another advance in tech-fueled douche behavior as a t-shirt wearing alpha nerd zips past barking into AirPods and inhaling a takeaway latte while cutting up the patience of pedestrians. None of this fast-seeded societal friction has put the brakes on e-scooter startup momentum, though. Au contraire. They’ve been raising massive amounts of investment on rapidly inflating valuations ( $2BN is the latest valuation for Bird ). But buying lots of e-scooters and leaving them at the mercy of human whim is an expensive business to try scaling. Hence big funding rounds are necessary if you’re going to replace all the canal-dunked duds and keep scooting fast enough for the competition. At the same time, there isn’t a great deal to differentiate one e-scooter experience over another — beyond price and proximity. Branding might do it but then you have to scramble even harder and faster to create a slick experience and inflate a brand that sticks. (And it goes without saying that a scooter sticky with fecal-matter is absolutely not that.) The still fledgling startups are certainly scrambling to scale, with some also already pushing into international markets. Lime just scattered ~200 e-scooters in Paris, for example. It’s also been testing the waters more quietly in Zurich. While Bird has its beady eye on European territory too. The idea underpinning some very obese valuations for these fledgling startups is that scooters will be a key piece of a reworked, multi-modal transport mix for urban mobility, fueled by app-based convenience and city buy-in to greener transport options with emissions-free benefits. (Albeit scooters’ greenness depends on what they’re displacing; Great if it’s gas-guzzling cars, less compelling if it’s people walking or peddling.) And while investors are buying in to the vision that lots of city dwellers are going to be scooting the last mile in future, and betting big on sizable value being captured by a few plucky scooter startups — more than half a billion dollars has been funneled into just two of these slimline scooter brands, Bird and Lime, since February — there are skeptical notes being sounded too. Asking whether the scooter model really justifies such huge raises and heady valuations. Wondering if it isn’t a bit crazy for a fledgling Bird to be 2x a unicorn already. Shared bike and scooter fleets are paving the way to a revolution in urban mobility but will only capture little value in the long term. Investors are highly overestimating the virtue of these businesses. — Thibaud Elziere (@tiboel) June 18, 2018 The bear case for these slimline e-scooters says they’re really only fixing a pretty limited urban mobility problem. Too spindly and unsafe to go the distance, too sedate of pace (and challenged for sidewalk space) to feel worthwhile if you don’t have far to go anyway. And of course you’re not going to be able to cart your kids and/or much baggage on a stand-up two wheeler. So they’re useless for families. Meanwhile scooter invasions are illegal in some places and, where they are possible, are fast inviting public and regulatory frisson and friction — by contributing to congestion and peril on already crowded pavements. After taking one of Lime’s just-landed e-scooters for a spin in Paris this week, Willy Braun, VC at early stage European fund Daphni, came away unimpressed. “I didn’t feel I was really saving time in a short distance, since there is always many people in our narrow sidewalks,” he tells us. “And it isn’t comfortable enough for me to imagine a longer distance. Also it’s quite expensive ($1 per use and $.15/min). “Lastly: Before renting it I read two news media that told me I had to use it only on the sidewalks and they tell us that we should only use it on the road during the onboarding — and that wearing an helmet is mandatory without providing it). As a comparison, I’d rather use e-bikes (or emoto-bikes) for longer journey without hesitation.” “Give us Jump instead of Lime!” he adds, namechecking the electric bike startup that’s been lodged under Uber’s umbrella since April, adding a greener string to its urban mobility bow — and which is also heading over to Europe as part of the ride-hailing giant’s ongoing efforts to revitalize its regionally battered brand. “Uber stands ready to help address some of the biggest challenges facing German cities: tackling air pollution, reducing congestion and increasing access to cleaner transportation solutions,” said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wheeling a bright red Jump bike on stage at the Noah conference in Berlin earlier this month. Uber’s Jump e-bikes will launch in Germany this summer. E-bikes do seem to offer more urban mobility versatility than e-scooters. Though a scooter is arguably a more accessible type of wheeled steed vs a bike, given you can just stand on it and be moved. But in Europe’s dense and dynamic urban environments — which, unlike the US, tend to be replete with public transit options (typically at a spectrum of price-points) — individual transport choices tend to be based firstly on economics. After which it’s essentially a matter of personal taste and/or the weather. Urban transport horses for courses — depending on your risk, convenience and comfort thresholds, thanks to a publicly funded luxury of choice. So scooters have loads of already embedded competition. TechCrunch’s resident Parisienne, Romain Dillet — a regular user of on-demand bike services in the city (of which there are many), and prior to that the city’s own dock-based bike rental scheme — also went for a test spin on a Lime scooter this week. And also came away feeling underwhelmed. “This is bad,” he said after his ride. “It’s slow and you need to brake constantly. BUT the worst part is that it feels waaaaaay more dangerous than a bike. Basically you can’t brake abruptly because you’re just standing there.” Index Venture’s Martin Mignot was also in Paris this week and he took the chance to take a Lime scooter for a spin too — checking out the competition in his case, given the European VC firm is a Bird backer. So what did he think? “The experience is pretty cool. It’s slightly faster than a bike, there’s no sweating. The weather was just amazing and very hot in Paris so it was pretty amazing in terms of speed and lack of effort,” he says, rolling out the positively spun, vested view on scooter sharing. “Especially going up hill to go to Gare du Nord. “And the lack of friction — just to get on board and get started. So in general I think it’s a great experience and I think it feels a really interesting niche between walking and on-demand bikes… In Paris you’ve also got the mopeds. So that kind of ‘in between offering’. I think there’s a big market there. I think it’s going to work pretty well in Paris.” Mignot is a tad disparaging about the quality of Lime’s scooters vs the model being deployed by Bird — a scooter model he also personally owns. But again, as you’d expect given his vested interests. “Obviously I’m biased but I would say that the Xiaomi scooter/Ninebot scooter is higher quality than the one that Lime are using,” he tells us. “I thought that the Lime one, the handlebar is a little bit too high. The braking is a little bit too soft. Maybe it was the one I used, I don’t know.” Talking generally about scooter startups, he says investors’ excitement boils down to trip frequency — thanks exactly to journeys being these itty-bitty last mile links. But it’s also then about the potential for all that last mile hopping to be a shortcut for winning a prized slot on smartphone users’ homescreens — and thus the underlying game being played looks like a jockeying for prime position in the urban mobility race. Lime, for example, started out with bike rentals before jumping into scooters and going multi-modal. So scooter sharing starts to look like a strategy for mobility startups to scoot to the top of the attention foodchain — where they’re then positioned to offer a full mix and capture more value. So really scooters might mostly be a tool for catching people’s app attention. Think of that next time you see one lying on a sidewalk. “What’s very interesting if you look at the trip distribution, most of the trips are short. So the vast majority of trips if you’re walking, obviously, are less than three miles. So that’s actually where the bulk of the mobility happens. And scooters play really well in that field. So in terms of sheer number of trips I think it’s going to dwarf any other type of transportation. And especially ride-hailing,” says Mignot. “If you look at how often do people use Uber or Lyft or Taxify… it’s going to be much less frequent than the scooter users. And I think that’s what makes it such an interesting asset… The frequency will be much higher — and so the apps that power the scooters will tend to be on the homescreen. And kind of on top of the foodchain, so to speak. So I think that’s what makes it super interesting.” Scooters also get a big investor tick on merit of the lack of friction standing in the way of riding vs other available urban options such as bikes (or, well, non-electric scooters, skateboards, roller blades, public transport, and so on and on) — in both onboarding (getting going) and propulsion (i.e. the lack of sweat required to ride) terms. “That’s what’s so brilliant with these devices, you just snap the QR code and off you go,” he says. “The difference with bikes is that you don’t have to produce any effort. I think there are cases where obviously bikes are better. But I think there are a lot of cases where people will want something where you don’t sweat. “Where you don’t wrinkle your clothes. Which goes a little bit faster. Without going all the way to the moped experience where you need to put the helmet, which is a bit more dangerous, which a lot of people, especially women, are not super familiar with. So I think what’s exciting with scooters as a form factor is it’s actually very mainstream. “Anyone can ride them. It’s very simple to manoeuvre. It’s not super fast, it’s not too dangerous. It doesn’t require any muscular effort — so for older people or for people who just don’t want to sweat because they’re going to a meeting or something. It’s just a fantastic option.” Index has also invested in an e-bike startup ( Cowboy ) and the firm is fully signed up to the notion that urban mobility will be multimodal. So if e-scooters valuations are a bit overcooked Index is not going to be too concerned. People in cities are clearly going to be riding something. And backing a mix is a smart way to hedge the risk of any one option ending up more passing fad than staple urban steed. Mostly Index is betting that people will keep on riding robotic horses for urban courses. And whatever they ride it’s a fairly safe bet that an app is going to be involved in the process of finding (docklessness is therefore another attention play) or unlocking (scan that QR code!) the mobility device — opening up the possibility that a single app could house multiple mobility options and thus capture more overall value. “It’s not a one-size fits all. They’re all complementing each other,” says Mignot of the urban mobility options in play. “I would say e-bikes are probably a little bit more great for little bit longer trips because you’re sitting down. But again it takes a little bit longer, because you have to adjust the saddle, you need to start peddling. There’s a bit more friction both on the onboading and on the riding. But they’re a bit better for slightly longer distances. I would say for shorter distances there’s nothing better than the scooter.” He also points out that scooters are both cheaper and less bulky than e-bikes. And because they take up less street space they can — at least in theory — be more densely stacked, thereby generating the claimed convenience by having them sitting near enough to convince someone not to bother walking 10 minutes to the café or gym — and just scoot instead. So scooters’ slimline physique is also especially exciting to investors. (Even if, ironically, it’s being deployed to urge people to walk less.) “I think we will end up with more density of scooters. Which is super important,” he continues. “People will, in the end, tend to take the vehicle that they can find where they are. And I think it’s more likely, eventually, that they will get a scooter than an e-bike. Just simply because they take less space and they are less expensive.” But why wouldn’t people who do get won over to the sweatless perks of last mile scooting just buy and own their own ride — rather than shelling out on an ongoing basis to share? Unlike bikes, scooters are mobile enough to be picked up and moved around fairly easily. Which means they can go with you into your home, office, even a restaurant — disruptively reducing theft risk. Whereas talk to any bike owner and they’ll almost invariably have at least one tale of theft woe, which is a key part of what makes bike sharing so attractive: It erases theft worry. Add to that, you can find e-scooters on sale in European electronics shops for as little as €140. So if you’re going to be a regular scooterer, the purely economic argument to just own your own looks pretty compelling. And people zipping around on e-scooters is a pretty common sight in another dense European city, Barcelona, which has very scooter-friendly weather but no scooter startups (yet). But unless it’s a tourist weaving along the seafront most of these riders are not shared: People just popped into their local electronics shop and walked out with a scooter in a box. So the rides aren’t generating repeat revenue for anyone except the electricity companies. Asked why people who do want to scoot won’t just buy, rather than rent Mignot talks up the hassle of ownership — undermined slightly by the fact he is also a scooter owner (despite the claimed faff from problems such as frequent flat tires and the chore of the nightly charge). “The thing you notice very rapidly: There are two things, one is the maintenance,” he says. “The models that exist today are not super robust. Maybe in a very flat, very smooth roads, maybe Santa Monica, maybe it’s a little bit less true but I would say in Europe the maintenance that is required is fairly high… I have to do something on mine every week. “The other thing is it takes a little bit of space. If you have to bring it to a restaurant or whatever type of crowded place, a movie theatre or wherever you’re going, to an office, to a meeting room, it’s a little bit on the heavy side, and it’s a little bit inconvenient. So certainly some people will buy them… But I also think that there are a lot of cases where you’d rather have it just on-demand.” Unlike Mignot and Index, Tom Bradley, of UK focused VC firm Oxford Capital, is not so convinced by the on-demand scooter craze. The firm has not made any e-scooter investments itself, though mobility is a “core theme”, with the portfolio including an on-demand coach travel startup ( Sn-ap ), and technology plays such as Morpheus Labs (machine learning for driverless cars) and UltraSoc (complex circuits for automotive parts, which sells to the likes of Tesla). But it’s just not been sold on scooter startups. Bradley describes it as an “open question” whether scooters end up being “an important part of how people move around the cities of the future”. He also points to theft problems with dockless bike share schemes that have not played out well in the UK. “We’re not convinced that this is a fundamental part of the picture,” he says of scooter sharing. “It may be a part of the picture but I personally am not yet convinced that it’s as big a part of the picture that people seem to be prepared to pay for.” “I keep thinking of the Segway example,” he adds. “It’s an absolutely delightful product. It’s brilliant. It’s absolutely brilliant. In a way that these electric scooters are not. But obviously it was much more expensive. And it made people feel a bit weird. But it was supposed to be the answer — and it’s not the answer. Before its time, perhaps.” Of course he also accepts that capital is “being used as a weapon”, as he puts it, to scoot full-pelt towards a future where shared electric scooters are the norm on city streets by waging a “marketing war” to get there. “Venture capital valuations are what someone is prepared to pay. And in this case people are valuing potential rather than valuing the business… so the valuations [of Bird and Lime] are being driven more than anything by the amount of money being raised,” he says. “So you decide a rule of thumb about what is acceptable dilution, and if you’re going to raise $400M or whatever then the valuation’s got to be somewhere between $1.6BN and $2BN to make that sort of raise make sense — and leave enough equity for the previous investors and founders. So there’s an element of this where the valuations are being driven by the amount of capital being raised.” Oxford Capital’s bearish view on scooter sharing is also bounded by the fund only investing in UK-based startups. And while Bradley says it sees lots of local mobility strengths — especially in the automotive market — he admits it’s more of a mental leap to imagine a world leading scooter startup sprouting from the country’s green and pleasant lands. Not least because it’s not legal to use them on UK public roads or pavements. “If you look at places like Amsterdam, Berlin, they’re sort of built for bikes. London’s getting towards being built for bikes… Cycling’s been one of the big success stories in London. Is [scooter sharing] going to replace cycling? I don’t know. Not so convinced… It’s obviously easy for anyone to get on and off these things, young and old. So that’s good, it’s inclusive. But it feels a little bit like a solution looking for a problem, the sorts of journeys people talk about for these things — on campus, short urban journeys. A lot of these are walkable or cycle journeys in a lot of cities. So is there a mass need? “Is this Segway 2 or is this bike hire 2… it’s hard to tell. And we’re coming down on the former. We’re not convinced this is going to be a fundamental part of the transport space. It will be a feature but not a huge part.” But for Mignot the early days of the urban mobility attention wars mean there’s much to play for — and much that can be favorably reshaped to fit scooters into the mix. “The whole thing, even on-demand bikes, it’s a two year old phenomenon really,” he says. “So I think everyone is just trying to learn and figure out and adapt to this new reality, whether it’s users or companies or cities. I think it’s very similar to when cars were first introduced. There were no parking spaces at the time and there were no rules on the road. And fast forward 100 years and it looks very different. “If you look at the amount of infrastructure and effort and spend that has been put into making — and I would argue way more than should have — into making a city car-friendly, if you only do a 100th of the same amount of effort and spend into making some space for bicycles and light two-wheel vehicles I think we’ll be fine. “That’s the beauty of this model. If you compare the space of the tech and if you look at the efficiency of moving people around vs the space, the scooters are simply the most efficient because their footprint on the ground is just so small.” He even makes the case for scooters working well in London — arguing the sprawl of the city amps up the utility because there are so many tedious last mile trips that people have to make. Even more so than in denser European cities like Paris, where he admits that hopping on a scooter might just be more of a “nice to have”, given shorter distances and all the other available options. So, really, where urban mobility is concerned, it can actually be courses for horses. Yet, the reality is London is off-limits to the likes of Bird and Lime for now — thanks to UK laws barring this type of unlicensed personal electric vehicle from public roads and spaces. You can buy e-scooters for use on private land in the UK but any scooter startups that tried their usual playbook in London would be scooting straight for legal hot water. It’s not just the British weather that’s inclement. “I’m really hoping that TfL [Transport for London] and the Department for Transport are going to make it possible,” says Mignot on that. “I think any city should welcome this with open arms. Some cities are, by the way. And I think over time once they see the success stories in other parts of the world I think they all will. But I wish London was one of those cutting edge cities that would welcome new innovation with open arms. I think right now, unfortunately, it’s not there. “There’s a lot of talk about air quality, and so on, but actually, when push comes to shove… you have a lot of resistance and a lot of pushback… So it’s a little bit disappointing. But, you know, we’ll get there eventually.”","It’s been hard to miss the scooter startup wars opening fresh, techno-fueled rifts in Valley society in recent months.

ANDREW HIGGINS,"Such views mesh neatly with Russias own longstanding view that asbestos producers are the victim of an elaborate conspiracy driven by greedy, primarily American, lawyers who make money suing for asbestos-related damages and chemical companies that produce alternative fire retardant materials.
The city of Asbest, after more than 130 years of intensive mining, still has enough chrysotile asbestos buried in the ground to keep Uralasbest in business for at least another century, provided its customers, mostly in Asia and Africa, do not take flight.

Dell Cameron,"More than 100 emergency sirens blanket the City of San Francisco, ready to warn locals in the event of a flood, a fire, an earthquake, or terrorism. And while true emergencies are few and far between, everyone in the Bay Area knows the siren’s racket, even if they’ve trained their ears to tune it out. Redolent of an wartime air raid, the sirens wail precisely at noon each Tuesday, rising and falling, eerily and slowly. “This is a test,” a voice follows. “This is a test of the outdoor warning system. This is only a test.” And thus concludes the Tuesday midday siren tradition. What the residents don’t know is that their siren has long been vulnerable to attack. Triggering the sound for malicious or mischievous purposes isn’t stupid-easy, but for a person educated in radio-frequency security, who has $30 to blow at an electronics store, there’s virtually nothing to stop them from bathing the city in obnoxious tones for hours on end. Worst still, the same vulnerability might very well affect similar emergency systems in countless other cities, universities, and public utilities installations (read: nuclear power plants). Two years ago, a software engineer—originally from Australia—moved to San Francisco from South Bay and noticed the sirens everywhere he went. Perched atop poles, and often intentionally positioned so as not to “adversely affect residents by blocking their views,” most people wouldn’t give it a second thought. But the engineer, Balint Seeber, just happens to be obsessed with electromagnetic radiation—in particular, the range of frequencies most of us simply refer to as “radio.” Examining the sirens, installed by a company called Acoustic Technology, Inc, or ATI Systems, Seeber, the director of vulnerability research at Bastille Networks, deduced that all were triggered by RF (radio frequency). And of course they are. It would be incredibly inefficient to do it any other way. Why on earth would the city run miles and miles of electric cable to over a 100 points in the city when sweet, wireless radio is so cheap and easy to use? “Before customers panic too much, please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do.” With access to a specially licensed frequency, there’s virtually nothing to impede the signal sent once a week by the city’s emergency management department. What’s more, test signals, not intended to trigger the sirens, can be sent just as easily, ensuring that the system is on standby for when it is needed most. It’s nearly foolproof. Nearly. It’s not clear what possessed him to do it, but on one Tuesday, shortly before noon, Seeber connected a radio transceiver to his laptop and prepared to scan the airwaves for the siren system’s signal. As it blared, he searched the spectrum broadly, scanning for any activity that matched the siren’s call. Eventually, he hit pay dirt. ATI’s proprietary digital radio protocol, unfortunately, did not benefit from any security measures that would be useful in defending against malicious triggering, he found. “I was expecting some type of encryption might’ve been applied that would have yielded packets with random-looking data,” Seeber told Gizmodo. That wasn’t the case. “These particular activation packets, as they call them, have the same structure every week,” he said. “So it became quickly very apparent that you could forge these packets. It’s not as simple as a replay attack,” he said, meaning you can’t just record the sound and re-emit it. “There’s a little more complexity to them. But not much more.” What would it take then to actually trigger the sirens? Someone with an electrical engineering degree would be ideal. The most complex bit, of course, is finding someone to code the software needed to demodulate, replicate, and transmit the necessary RF signal. San Francisco’s sirens are activated by a manned central controller strategically placed within the city. When an emergency calls, the controller transmits digital activation packets to a repeater, which, according to Seebe, is located in Twin Peaks, the city’s second highest summit and geographical center. The repeater, having receiving the packets, in turn transmits the packets over a licensed frequency to the sirens, each of which contains a modem for demodulating the packets. Anyone who may intercept them, purposefully or by accident, will likely only hear what sounds like seemingly random tones firing in short bursts—a binary code unchanging week to week and the key to the siren’s annoying song. A person who understands this technology as Seeber does should be able to decipher the flow of ones and zeros and, if they’re an asshole, wake up the entire city. (Oh, and they need that $30 radio, too.) These signals can be scrambled, randomized, or in other words, encrypted, to stave off this type of malicious attacks. But according to Bastille, a firm that specializes in analyzing RF-based attacks—for banks, tech companies, as well as the government—many companies believe that merely developing their own radio protocol is security enough. Having confidence that you’re secure simply because no one knows what the hell you’re doing is sometime called “security through obscurity.” Picture a safe with a locking mechanism that no one has ever seen—does that make it unbreakable? As Seeber deftly demonstrated, the obscurity trick doesn’t always work so well. “What we find in our work in general is that in IoT and critical infrastructure and industrial control systems, a lot of companies decide that they’re going to implement a proprietary RF protocol—a radio frequency protocol—to communicate, and they may or may not add security to that,” Bastille’s chief revenue officer, Ivan O’Sullivan, told Gizmodo. Seeber’s research, which was conducted passively—meaning, he never actually attempted to trigger the alarms himself—demonstrated that ATI had not attempted to encrypt its activation sequence, likely because it assumed anyone who happened to find it would have no idea what it was for. “I do see now various forms of new packets that do look more random. And that makes me optimistic.” According to its website, ATI has a host of featured clients one might recognize, among them One World Trade Center and West Point Academy. But it’s unclear which systems at which locations are similarly affected by the vulnerability. Bastille was, however, able to test Seeber’s discovery at one other location. The problem, it seems, is not San Francisco’s alone. “[Seeber] went to the Midwest and proved it at a second location,” O’Sullivan said. “We know of at least two confirmed locations, and that’s what we’ve done so far, but we haven’t been able to travel to each of the locations.” The second location, Seeber informed Gizmodo, was in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Authorities there, he said, confirmed to Bastille that they’d been working with ATI to fix their problems as well. “What we want now is to make sure that ATI’s other customers are made aware of the vulnerability, communicate with ATI, and work with them to take—and, if necessary, customize—the patch and get it out there,” added O’Sullivan said. In a public statement Tuesday, ATI did not contest with Bastille’s findings. It did, however, urged its customers not to panic... too much. “Bastille Networks, a company that offers visibility into known and unknown mobile, wireless and IoT devices within an enterprise’s corporate airspace, reported that by monitoring one of our systems for months, they have largely deduced the command format of our packets,” ATI wrote, adding: “This is likely true.” It continued: “However, we wish to point out these are technically sophisticated people who have devoted significant time and effort to this task. Before customers panic too much, please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do. Spoofing our current protocol is still several orders of magnitude harder than spoofing a DTMF-based siren system.” (DTMF tones, such as those used on old landlines telephones, have been used in the past to activate emergency systems.) ATI confirmed that indeed it was issuing a patch to further safeguard its systems, at least ones not already protected from the vulnerability, which Seeber has named “ Siren Jack.” The sirens deployed by ATI on military bases, for instance, already use encrypted signals. The military’s equipment is considerably more expensive, however, and not every local government will be able to justify the expense, ATI said. Thanks to Bastille, a patch created by ATI against Siren Jack is now currently being tested, and the company plan to roll it out soon. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as it sounds. The sirens, ATI said, “are not mass market consumer items connected to the internet where you simply download a patch.” San Francisco, at least, may be able to rest easy. Changes have been apparent, says Seeber, who continues to monitor ATI’s protocols from his home with his laptop and Amazon-bought radio. “I do see now various forms of new packets that do look more random,” he says. “And that makes me optimistic.”","More than 100 emergency sirens blanket the City of San Francisco, ready to warn locals in the event of a flood, a fire, an earthquake, or terrorism.

Megan Cassidy,"For more than a half-century, a select group of California prisoners has worked shoulder-to-shoulder with wildland firefighters battling the state’s deadliest blazes. More than 3,000 inmate volunteer firefighters are performing the back-straining labor, according to Cal Fire. They’re clearing brush and digging lines for the Ferguson, Carr and Mendocino Complex fires, which have torched a combined 577,000 acres of California land in another historic season. It’s a tough gig and the pay is paltry — an average of $2 per day and $1 per hour when they’re fighting an active fire. But officials say it’s a coveted position among low-level offenders, male and female. “It’s not something that they’re forced to do,” said Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff. The work cuts time off sentences, pays more than other inmate jobs, and provides many with a sense of purpose, officials say. “With a lot of the guys we’ve spoken to, they feel like they’re giving back to the state, helping in that way,” she said. The practice has been blasted by some progressives like former Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who calls the work “tantamount to slave labor.” “At this point, they’re being paid $1 an hour for fighting these ferocious fires — that’s outrageous,” she said, adding that the inmates deserve a reasonable wage for risking their lives. But perhaps the most hotly disputed issue is the inmates’ narrow pathway to industry work after release. This year, a new parolee training program will help former inmates become more competitive in the field, but many advocates say the measure doesn’t go far enough. The problem lies with emergency medical technician licenses, said Katherine Katcher, founder and executive director of the re-entry advocacy group Root &amp; Rebound in Oakland. Most people leaving prison return to urban areas, Katcher said, and want to work for their local departments. But those agencies also require that people get an EMT certification — a condition that Katcher said blocks many ex-offenders. This year, the state budget includes $26.6 million to create a firefighter training and certification program for 80 ex-offenders annually. The 18-month program will take place at the Ventura Conservation Camp, and include life skills training and comprehensive firefighter courses and certification. To be eligible, participants must have served with Cal Fire while incarcerated. The center is expected to have its first cohort this fall. “Participants who successfully complete the program will be qualified to apply for entry-level firefighting jobs with local, state and federal firefighting agencies,” the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. “It’s a very exciting program,” said Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Vicky Waters. “We think it’s such an innovate thing, and we’re really looking forward to seeing what the impact is.” Cal Fire officials have said the volunteer crews save the state about $100 million annually and can account for up to 40 percent of the men and women battling the flames. The crews are chosen from a pool of applicants with “minimum custody” status, or those who have exhibited good behavior in prison. There are automatic disqualifiers. Inmates who have committed arson, murder or sex offenses, those with active warrants, a history of escape attempts or medical issues, or those with high-profile cases, among others, are ineligible. Waters said the inmates are treated no differently than Cal Fire firefighters. They receive the same training and perform the same duties, working on fire lines, clearing flood channels and storm drains and cutting brush to reduce fire danger. “They are wildland firefighters and they’re trained as such,” Waters said. Inmates have walked away from fire camps, but they’re always captured within 48 hours, Waters said. This mostly happens when it’s not active fire season, she said, and there’s a strong disincentive: Those caught escaping are sent back to the brick-and-mortar facility and are disqualified from the program. The work can be dangerous, too. An inmate firefighter died during a training hike in April, and by late 2017 there had been five inmate fatalities since the program began in the 1940s. Katcher said while she supports the parolee program, its impact is limited and does nothing to change the regulatory framework throughout the state. Root &amp; Rebound and other civil rights organizations pushed for a bill this year that would have mandated a framework for considering ex-offenders for the certifications, potentially opening the career path to more of them. “It was defining what was appropriate and fair consideration rather than blanket denials,” Katcher said. “Nowhere did the bill say that the (criminal) records would not be assessed.” AB2293 was turned into a study bill this year, but Katcher said she will be pushing for similar legislation in 2019. “This (parolee) program is going to impact 80 people in 18 months, compared to the 4,000 people who are actually fighting fires — those people will have no relief through this bill,” Katcher said. “I still don’t understand why it had to be an either-or situation.” Megan Cassidy is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Kyle Hyatt,"Tesla is having a rough month with unprecedented dips in stock prices fueled in part by Model 3 production delays and most recently by a fatal highway collision of a Model X that may have involved Autopilot, near Mountain View, California. The incident took place on Friday, March 23 on a well-traveled stretch of Highway 101 near Mountain View. While it hasn't been confirmed whether Autopilot had been engaged, it is known that the Model X drifted out of its lane and into a partial crash attenuator device and concrete K-rail at speed. The driver of the Model X was able to escape the vehicle before it was consumed by fire. Dean C. Smith via Twitter The damage to the vehicle was sufficient that the Tesla's battery pack caught fire (not uncommon in an electric vehicle crash), though thanks to the firewalls built into the battery pack, the occupant was able to escape the burning vehicle before eventually succumbing to his wounds at a local hospital. This incident has raised a great deal of discussion around electric vehicles' propensity for catching fire in the event of a crash. While there is currently no evidence to suggest that they are more likely to catch fire than an internal combustion vehicle, fighting the fires is slightly more complex. It's likely for this reason that Tesla dispatched a team of its engineers to the scene of the crash to assist in the removal of the battery pack once it was extinguished. Tesla dispatched a team of engineers to the crash site in Mountain View, California to assist in removing the vehicle's battery pack. Dean C. Smith via Twitter Tesla commented on the incident on its blog saying that this particular stretch of Highway 101 was regularly traveled using Autopilot, with 200 successful Autopilot trips being completed per day. It also mentioned that due to the extensive damage caused by the crash and subsequent fire, it had not yet been able to retrieve the vehicle's data log. If it turns out that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash, it would be yet another black mark on the system's record for safety. We've said in the past that a large problem with Autopilot is its somewhat misleading name, given that it is, at best, capable of Level 2 autonomy and isn't truly self-driving.","The incident, which occurred on Friday March 23, has raised further concerns about the safety of Autopilot.",2018-03-28T18:46:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Tesla Model X fatal crash and fire under investigation - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-x-autopilot-crash-fire/,https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/Z9O7GldhKIj-C5xz7lQl-iTHWzs=/2018/03/28/640a9f65-3a0b-4f30-b5d8-142a820a2a25/download-4.jpg,,Cnet.com,Complex fire,1
Patrick Allan,"Last night, CNN held a town hall discussion with those affected by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Florida officials, and an NRA rep. In attendance was Senator Marco Rubio, who had some things to say about the recently proposed and rejected assault weapons ban. He specifically mentioned “plastic handle grips” as loopholes that made the ban superfluous, but what was he talking about exactly? If you didn’t see the town hall, you can watch the whole thing in the YouTube video embedded above. Or, you can read the full transcript here. At one point early on, Fred Guttenberg, the father of one of the students murdered in the shooting, confronted Rubio for going against the proposed state ban on many semiautomatic guns and large capacity magazines. This ban included popular models like the Kalashnikov AK-47, Sig Sauer MCX, and several versions of the AR-15, the type of rifle used by Nikolas Cruz to kill 17 people last week. Here’s how Rubio responded : “But I want to explain to you for a moment the problem with the law that they call the Assault Weapon’s Ban. And if you’ll give me — and indulge me for a minute to explain to you the problem. First you have to define what it is. If you look at the law and it’s definition, it basically bans 200 models of gun - - about 220 specific models of gun... But it makes - - but it - - but it - - it allows legal 2,000 other types of gun that are identical. Identical, in the way that they function and how fast they fire and the type of caliber that they fire and the way they perform. They’re indistinguishable from the ones that become illegal (later he says they could do the exact same thing as the gun used Marjory Stoneman Douglas). And the only thing that separates the two types - - the only thing that separates the two types is, if you put a plastic handle grip on one it becomes banned, if it doesn’t have a plastic handle it does not become banned...” This drew boos and jeers from the crowd, but he’s not exactly wrong. Basically, Rubio said that while the ban would affect several types of popular assault weapons right from the get-go, it would only be the tip of the iceberg. Why? Because of gun mods and how easy they are to be added or removed from a rifle, and because of the gun industry itself. Rubio goes on to explain that similar assault weapon bans essentially failed in both New York and California. For example, the California assault weapons ban required owners of designated assault weapons to either give up their guns or register them with the state. But there’s a third secret option that completely goes around these laws entirely: removing the features that make the rifle an “assault weapon.” These features include: Pistol grips : A mod that alters traditional “straight” gun stocks and allows the operator to hold the rifle with their trigger hand in a forward, vertical orientation like a pistol. You see commonly see these on AR-15 and M16 rifles because they allow the operator to control the trigger, magazine release, and safety or fire mode switches with one hand. Vertical grips : Also known as “forward grips” or “front grips.” These mods sit under the front end of the barrel and below the rifle’s stock (kind of like a front pistol grip), and give the operator more control and stability. Flash suppressors : A device attached to the muzzle of a rifle that reduces the visibility, or flash, of a shot being fired by cooling and dispersing the burning gases escaping the barrel. Collapsible stocks : Exactly what it sounds like. This makes a rifle more compact and easier to store or transport. All a gun owner has to do is remove these things and make their AR-15 or similar rifle a “featureless” model and they can keep their gun without registering it. And manufacturers in the gun business usually find a way around legislation anyway. They’re always looking for ways to make new guns and mods that circumvent current laws and regulations with just a few minor tweaks. You can’t have your old modded AR-15, but you can buy that new AR-15 that does the exact same things in a different, technically legal way. On Wednesday, a gunman murdered 17 people in Parkland, Florida, which brings the country’s 2018… Read more Read Or you can just take your rifle to the gun shop and buy a part that’s pretty darn similar to an illegal mod but still is legal. Regarding previous ban attempts and the quick circumvention of them, Rubio said, “...took them 15 seconds to do it. They simply take the plastic tip off of it. They just take the plastic grip off of the front or the back...” The opening of this 1999 piece from the L.A. Times says it all: At a little gunsmith shop in a Santa Ana business and industrial complex, owner Shawn Tugwell removes the offending pistol grip from a semiautomatic rifle that California will soon outlaw as an assault weapon. In its place, Tugwell screws on a substitute grip of a high-strength plastic molded to conform to the gun’s original stock. Behold, what was a banned gun under California’s newly toughened assault weapon controls seemingly is reinvented into a more conventional sporting firearm for hunting or paper targets. If you’re wondering what is going to actually change in the wake of this tragedy, so is everybody else. Is a serious approach to gun control finally on the table? Certainly a proposed ban of only 220 gun models that can be easily worked around isn’t going to bring the major change proponents of gun control are seeking. That said, there are some things in the works. Next week, Congress is going to attempt a process known as “unanimous consent,” which is when there is no voting on a law, only objecting. As long as no senator objects, a new law will be passed to “fix” background checks for gun buyers. The idea being to make background checks include more information, be more universal from state to state, and make it so those who are considered “too dangerous to fly” can’t buy firearms of any kind. Congress is also likely to totally ban bump stocks, the gun mod used in the Las Vegas shooting, and they’ll also attempt to change the federal law regarding required age to purchase rifles. If it passes, one would need to be 21 years of age to buy such weapons instead of 18. The shooter who recently terrorized the Las Vegas strip, leaving 59 dead and hundreds injured, used … Read more Read Rubio also suggested he has a new stance on large capacity magazines; something he didn’t support looking into before this tragedy. He says smaller magazines may not prevent attacks like this in the future, but it may make them less lethal overall. So, are assault weapons going away? No, but, for now, Congress appears to be taking baby steps toward a system that makes schools safer and still allows citizens their second amendment rights.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Dozens of people have died in clashes between vigilantes and cattle rustlers in Zamfara in recent months (file photo) Cattle thieves have killed more than 20 people in Nigeria's northern state of Zamfara, officials say. The thieves arrived in the village of Zanoka on motorbikes, shooting at people and setting fire to their homes. Clashes between vigilantes and cattle rustlers in Zamfara have intensified in recent months. Violence related to cattle has been going on for years in Nigeria - even longer than the northern Islamist insurgency and southern oil militancy. It is now said to have killed more people than the Boko Haram conflict, although official statistics are hard to come by. The chairman of the local government area for Zanoka, Mustapha Muhammad, told the AFP news agency that people in the village had ""buried 23 people killed in the attack, including vigilantes who tried to fight off the bandits"". According to the Zamfara state government, more than 10,000 cattle have been stolen in the last seven years. Most of the violence involving cattle theft is in the country's Middle Belt where cattle-herders and settled farmers compete for ever-scarcer resources, says BBC World Service Africa Editor, Mary Harper. Some analysts say that it is a conflict between Muslim nomads and Christian farmers in this region. However, it is more complex than that, involving criminals and politicians, our correspondent says. Many people say poor governance lies at the root of the violence, she adds, with security forces regarded as ineffective or corrupt. Kidnappings for ransom have also been on the rise. In early May, about 100 people were abducted in just two days on a road near Kaduna's border with Zamfara state.",Cattle-related violence is now said to have killed more people than the country's Boko Haram conflict.,2018-06-03T11:59:38Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Nigeria: Dozens killed by cattle thieves in Zamfara state,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44347951,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DF61/production/_101858175_2733fe27-41ea-420d-8519-cb69e63675a6.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Complex fire,1
Makini Brice,"(Reuters) - A fast-growing California wildfire that has already forced thousands to flee their homes and shut down a large national park surged overnight into Saturday, as fatigued firefighters battled gusting winds. The blaze in Mendocino County, about 90 miles (145 km) north of San Francisco, had spread to cover a total of 201,471 acres (81,500 hectares) by early Saturday, after increasing more than 25 percent in size from Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. It was 34 percent contained. The Mendocino Complex Fire is now the state’s largest fire at more than two-thirds the size of sprawling Los Angeles, and has forced the evacuation of nearly 16,000 residents and destroyed more than 100 structures. It has swelled to become larger than the deadly Carr Fire, about 100 miles (160 km) to the northeast, which has killed at least six people and destroyed more than 1,500 homes, businesses and other structures. Firefighters have managed to contain 41 percent of that blaze and authorities are allowing some people who had evacuated to return, Cal Fire said. Both areas remained under a “red flag warning” issued by the National Weather Service for strong winds, low relative humidity and temperatures topping 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), all conditions that can drive the growth of wildfires. This year’s California wildfire season has been more destructive than in years past, burning about 290,000 acres (117,300 hectares), more than double the five-year average over that same period, according to Cal Fire. In total, 14 states are currently reporting large fires. Most are in other western states but wildfires have also struck Texas and Florida, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have blackened 4.9 million acres throughout the United States, significantly higher than the 10-year average, according to the center.

Juli Clover,"Verizon recently throttled the data used by a Santa Clara, California fire department that was in the midst of fighting wildfires, reports Ars Technica. Verizon's actions were outlined this week in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys challenging the recent repeal of net neutrality rules. According to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden, the fire department paid Verizon for ""unlimited"" data, but its data speeds were heavily throttled while it was combating the still-ongoing Mendocino Complex Fire until the department shelled out more money for an upgraded unlimited plan. Verizon's data throttling policies affected ""OES 5262,"" a fire vehicle with a Verizon SIM card that is responsible for acting as a ""command and control resource"" for ""the rapid deployment and organization of thousands of personnel and hundreds of fire engines, aircraft, and bulldozers."" Data speeds were reduced to 1/200, interfering with the vehicle's ability to ""function effectively."" Santa Clara Fire communicated with Verizon via email about the throttling and requested that it be ""immediately lifted for public safety purposes,"" but Verizon staff demanded the fire department update to a new plan before service could be restored. Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but, rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan. As Ars Technica points out, even when net neutrality rules were in effect, major carriers imposed throttling during times of network congestion. The fire department claims, however, that it was throttled at all times (not just at peak congestion) once the vehicle's 25GB data limit was exceeded. Net neutrality rules also allowed for Internet users to file complaints for unjust or unreasonable prices and practices, but the complaint option has been eliminated, giving Santa Clara no options for contacting the FCC over Verizon's practices. Bowden said that Verizon's throttling had a ""significant impact"" on the fire department's ability to provide emergency services. The Mendocino fire was also not the only time Verizon's throttling limited fire services, with other incidents occurring in December and June. According to Bowden, the Santa Clara Fire Department believes that Verizon is going to continue to use catastrophic events to force public agencies into higher-cost data plans. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher cost plans ultimately paying significantly more for mission critical service-even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. After a long series of emails ( PDF ) with Verizon, the Santa Clara Fire Department was ultimately required to purchase a data plan that costs $99.99 per month for the first 20GB of data usage and 8GB of data per gigabyte afterwards to avoid throttling during emergencies. Verizon has not yet responded to requests for comment on the Santa Clara Fire Department's addendum.

Gina Martinez,"Police have arrested and charged the man suspected of starting the “Holy Fire” that has destroyed up to 14 structures, Orange County District Attorney’s office said. Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, was charged with two counts of felony arson, one count of felony threat to terrorize, and one count of misdemeanor resisting arrest on Thursday. If convicted he faces up to life in prison. He is currently being held on $1 million bail. According to CNN reports, Clark texted Holy Jim Volunteer Fire Department Chief Mike Milligan two weeks ago saying “the place is going to burn”. The Holy Fire has already burned over 18,000 acres since it began at the Cleveland National Forest’s Trabuco Canyon, near Orange County, on Monday afternoon. The blaze has quickly spread to Riverside County and it remains only 5% contained, U.S. Forest Service officials said Friday. The fire has grown quickly because of high temperatures and the area’s steep terrain, according to the Cleveland National Forest. It has caused the evacuation of over 20,000 homes in Southern California. The Holy Fire is just one of the wildfires currently ravaging California.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Six large new wildfires have erupted in the United States that pushed the number of major active blazes nationwide to over 100, with more expected to break out over the weekend sparked by lightning strikes on bone-dry terrain, authorities said on Saturday. More than 30,000 personnel, including firefighters from across the United States and nearly 140 from Australia and New Zealand, were battling the blazes that have consumed more than 1.6 million acres (648,000 hectares), according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. “We are expecting that there will be more fire-starts today,” Jeremy Grams, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said in an interview on Saturday. He said dry thunderstorms, which produce lightning but little rain, are expected for parts of the Rocky Mountain region, while the U.S. northwest has critical fire weather conditions that include strong winds and low relative humidity. Firefighters were battling another day of extremely hot temperatures and strong winds on Saturday, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The fires have scorched states from Washington to New Mexico, with California among the hardest hit. A mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire near Redding in northern California was killed in a car crash on Thursday, the eighth person to die in that conflagration. The 181,000-acre (73,250-hectare) Carr Fire has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. About 100 miles (160 km) southwest of the Carr Fire, about 3,500 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 325,226 acres (131,614 hectares) as of Saturday and was the largest fire on record in California.

Tyler Cowen,"Some strategic games are too complex to be readily modeled, and when we see such games in the real world that’s exactly when we should be the most worried. That’s my immediate reaction to the situation in Syria and environs. Consider the distinct yet interrelated clashes going on. Not only did the U.S. strike early Saturday at Syria’s chemical weapons facilities after the regime used such weapons against its citizens in Douma. Tensions between Israel and Iran have been escalating. It seems that Israel recently bombed Syria to limit that country’s support of Iran-backed Hezbollah and to send a signal to Iran. There has also been talk that Hezbollah concentrations in Lebanon will lead to another conflict there. The situation in Gaza has heated up again, with Israeli fire against Palestinian demonstrators leading to significant casualties. As a sideshow to these struggles, U.S. President Donald Trump declined to certify that Iran was in compliance with its nuclear accord and may ditch the deal altogether. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu’s government faces significant corruption charges. QuickTake Syria’s Civil War The situation between Iran and Saudi Arabia has been worsening, and their proxy war in Yemen has assumed greater significance. Yemeni rebels have been firing missiles into Saudi Arabia, and a big hit may eventually get through the missile shield. Saudi Arabia has recently undergone a major shift in power, seeing some mix of a revolution, internal coup and crackdown on dissent. Other related stories involve a regionally active and untrustworthy Turkish regime, Saudi displeasure at the shift of Qatar into Iran’s orbit, and the possibility that Trump will use a Middle East conflict either to try to show he is tough with Russia or to distract attention from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. By the way, the U.S. is in the midst of restructuring its National Security Council, probably in a more hawkish direction, and there is no confirmed secretary of state. Toss in the recent Russian use of a nerve agent for an attempted assassination in the U.K. Some historical events are relatively easy to model with game theory: the Cuban Missile crisis, many of the Cold War proxy wars, the crisis over North Korean nuclear weapons. In those conflicts, the number of relevant parties is small and each typically has some degree of internal cohesion. To find a situation comparable to the Middle East today, with so many involved countries, and so many interrelationships between internal and external political issues, one has to go back to the First World War, not an entirely comforting thought. The situation right before that war had many distinct yet related moving parts, including the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the imperialist scramble for colonies, the prior Balkan Wars, a rising Germany seeking parity or superiority with Great Britain, an unstable alliance system, an unworkable Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the complex internal politics of Russia, which eventually led to the Bolshevik Revolution. What do we learn from the history of that time? Well, even if the chance of war was high by early 1914, it was far from obvious that the Central Powers attack on France, Belgium and Russia would be set off by a political assassination in the Balkans. Nonetheless, in sufficiently complex situations, chain reactions can cause small events to cascade into big changes. In World War I, one goal behind the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was to break off parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into a new Yugoslavia. The empire responded by making some demands on Serbia, which were not heeded, a declaration of war followed, and the alliance system activated broader conflicts across Europe. If you don’t quite follow how a single assassination, which was not even seen as so important the day it occurred, triggered the death of so many millions, and the destruction of so much of Europe, that is exactly the point. When there is no clear way for observers to model the situation, a single bad event can take on a very large significance and for reasons that are not entirely explicable. In today’s Middle East, we also have a broadly festering situation across multiple fronts, with many smaller players, lots of internal political struggles and unstable political units, and commitments from some major external powers, including the U.S., Russia, Iran and Turkey. I find that an uncomfortably close analogy with 1914. Optimists such as Steven Pinker might suggest that today’s situation in the Middle East is more likely to converge into peace, or only limited struggles, than a major war. But this is not just about the most likely outcome, it is also about the expected value of what will happen. Even a small chance of a major escalation probably makes this messy situation the No. 1 issue facing the world right now. And if you’re grumpy about the inability of social scientists or the news media to explain it to you in simple terms, that is exactly why the situation is so dangerous.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Marina Galperina to Gizmodo","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post. Punching in different keywordshurricane, wildfire, heat waveturned up photos from around the world. Eventually, I settled on Southern Californias Woolsey Fire bearing down on the mansions of Malibu, because it best encapsulates this moment in time. Its the perfect metaphor for 2018, the year when climate changes influence on our weather crystalized further, when it the flames showed up in our proverbial (and in some cases, literal) backyard. And the planet, our home, will go up in smoke if we dont act soon. It wasnt just fires either. Heat, winds, water, and other weather disasters created horrific damage all over. Here are all the ways the world burned in 2018, a catastrophe that will only get worse if we dont address climate change soon. Flames The Woolsey Fire was a $1.6-billion disaster that wouldve been the worst imaginable fire this year if not for what was happening in Northern California at the same time. The Camp Fire burned an entire town to the ground, left dozens dead, thousands without a home, and caused California to temporarily have the worst air quality on the planet. But Californias fire story doesnt even stop there. In August the Mendocino Complex became Californias largest in history, just a year after the Thomas Fire took the title. Oh, and of course there was the Carr Fire, which also cracked the list of most destructive fires in Californias history and spawned a massive firenado. And flames were hardly limited to California. British Columbia saw day turn into night thanks to wildfires. Sweden went up in smoke. So did Siberia. Even as winter has quashed the flames in the northern hemisphere, now its Australias turn to face unprecedented fire conditions. Heat You cant really have flames with heat. And in a warming world, theres heat in spades. This year will likely go down as the fourth-warmest on record for the globe. Next year could be even hotter. While only the Earth itself really experiences the global average temperature, the rest of us felt its rise in the form of heat waves. The aforementioned Scandinavian fires wouldve been impossible without record heat that seared the region this summer. In fact, much of Europe was gripped by heat, and weird things happened. The ice on top of Swedens tallest mountain shrunk so much, it lost the title of tallest mountain. Englands long-buried ancient villages emerged in the form of crop markings. Then there were the records. Temperatures rose above freezing at the worlds northernmost weather station in the dead of the dark, Arctic winter. Japan had its hottest day ever recorded. A heat wave led to the hottest day ever recorded in all of Africa. Pakistan saw the hottest April day ever recorded on Earth. Death Valley recorded the hottest month on Earth period. It was hot, yall. Waves, wind, and rain After 2017, you would think we could get a break with the hurricanes and typhoons and whatnot. But no. The U.S. saw record-setting Florence and Michael devastate North Carolina and Florida, respectively. Each storm is a multi-billion dollar disaster, marking a second straight year of multiple violent hurricanes hitting the U.S. A freak tropical storm also made landfall in the Great Lakes, because why not. Other cyclone basins also delivered punch after punch after punch. The eastern Pacific churned out multiple storms that underwent rapid intensification. In the central Pacific, Hurricane Lane brought torrential rain to Hawaii, while Walaka washed an entire island off the map. In the western Pacific, we saw a freaky annular typhoon with a huge eye as well as widespread destruction in the Marianas Islands thanks to Typhoon Yutu. The basin also spawned the strongest storm on Earth of 2018: Super Typhoon Mangkhut had winds reach 200 mph over the open ocean, though thankfully they quieted down by landfall. This list is hardly exhaustive, but then, wed be here for days if it were. The point is were seeing more catastrophic weather, climate change is in part behind it, and the time to address it is in short supply. The weather wont stop in 2019. There will be more records and losses and questions about how to rebuild or even if we should. But that doesnt mean were screwed. It means we need courage, and on that front there are some encouraging signs, including new members of Congress who actually get the monumental challenge we face and are willing to rise and meet it. Hopefully with their leadership, 2019 will look a little less bleak.","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post.

"https://www.facebook.com/kristineaguerra, https://www.facebook.com/sarah.kaplan.31","Two small blazes burning through Northern California have grown at breathtaking speed to form a massive inferno, quickly becoming the state’s largest active wildfire and setting a new mark for destruction. The twin wildfires, collectively known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, have together more than doubled in size in the past four days and burned through 283,800 acres, or 443 square miles, of parched land — an area almost the size of Los Angeles. By Monday, it had become the largest wildfire in California in nine decades, surpassing the Thomas Fire that burned nearly 282,000 acres of land in December 2017 in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties and the Cedar Fire that killed 15 people in 2003 in San Diego County. As wildfires ravaged the Golden State, President Trump weighed in with tweets that puzzled fire experts and seemed to point fingers, not at the toll of climate change, but at California’s environmental laws and use of water resources. As of Monday, the Mendocino Complex Fire shows little sign of slowing. Fueled by low humidity, triple-digit temperatures and winds blowing across wide swaths of tinder-dry vegetation, the conflagration has expanded to three counties, surrounded a river and parts of neighboring reservoirs, and destroyed and damaged nearly 170 homes and other structures. “There’s some challenges that firefighters are facing near the fire and in the area of the fire. We have strong, erratic winds, and what that’s doing is blowing embers, and it’s spreading the fire,” Capt. Thanh Nguyen, who’s acting as spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said Monday. “You got steep terrain that makes it difficult for firefighters.” Typically, temperatures dip and humidity rises overnight, giving crews a window to slow the fires’ spread. But Nguyen said these have not happened in the affected areas. [ As wildfires rage, California frets over a future of greater perils and higher costs ] The Mendocino Complex Fire began a little more than a week ago with two neighboring fires burning through 9,500 acres of land, then rapidly spreading — at one point, by nearly 30,000 acres within hours. The two fires have not merged, but officials are counting them as one. The Ranch Fire, the bigger of the two blazes, has continued to grow in multiple directions, threatening communities in its path, according to Cal Fire. It has burned through 235,000 acres. The smaller River Fire is more contained and grew by a few thousand acres over the weekend. Firefighters are unlikely to see some respite. Temperatures will slightly dip to the low 90s and high 80s this week, but no rain is in the forecast. “We’re experiencing the same thing every day, which is our afternoon winds and high winds in the area,” said Tricia Austin, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire. “Everything is still dry.” Seventeen wildfires are burning up and down California. In the Redding area, the Carr Fire, which is now 45 percent contained, has charred more than 163,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 homes. At least seven people have died in the Carr Fire, including two firefighters and a woman and her two great-grandchildren. The latest victim is a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. employee who was killed on Saturday. A spokeswoman for the utility company said the employee, Jairus Ayeta, “suffered a fatal injury from a vehicle accident” while working in a remote area on hazardous terrain. In one tweet, Trump said the wildfires are worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.” [ ‘Grandpa, come get me’: A 5-year-old boy’s last moments before Carr Fire engulfed family’s home ] “It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,” the president tweeted. “Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” Trump also tweeted that California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) “must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North” instead of “foolishly” diverting them into the Pacific Ocean. “Can be used for fires, farming and everything else,” the president tweeted. “Think of California with plenty of Water — Nice!” Several fire experts, however, said the comments don’t address the main factor in fire severity: human-caused climate change. “Extreme droughts and high winds are increasing as climate is warming,” said Monica Turner, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who has spent three decades researching fires at Yellowstone National Park. “That’s the ultimate driver behind what’s happening in California.” A 2016 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that climate change was responsible for more than half of the documented increases in fuel aridity in western forests and had doubled the amount of land burned since 1984. John Abatzoglou, a University of Idaho climatologist who was the lead author on that study, called the president’s statement “confusing, if not completely incoherent.” Water management is a long-standing issue in California. The diversion of water away from rivers and into agricultural lands has allowed the state’s farmers to flourish, but it also has destroyed critical habitat for salmon and other species. Water diversion also contributes to increased salinity of delta ecosystems. In July, California’s State Water Resources Control Board released a draft plan for an important watershed in the northern part of the state that would limit the amount of water used for agriculture. [ Carr Fire death toll climbs to six as crews ‘gain some ground’ against massive blaze ] But that’s “a totally separate issue” from fire management, said William Stewart, a forestry specialist at the University of California at Berkeley. The rivers and lakes from which fire crews get water to drop on fires are full. “There’s no shortage of water for firefighting.” Contrary to the president’s comments, water diversion refers to the redirection of water for agricultural purposes. Rivers naturally flow into the ocean. This part of Trump’s tweet — “Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” — seems to refer to the practice of thinning, by which land managers selectively cut down certain trees to improve the overall health of a forest. Thinning can help reduce fire severity by limiting fuel, Stewart said, but the president’s tweet misses important nuance. In a report published in the journal BioScience in January, Stewart and his colleagues found that thinning happens more frequently on private land — which falls under California’s jurisdiction — than on federal land, which is managed by the Forest Service. In addition, “the rates of mortality from fire, insects, and disease are about three times as high on national forest lands as they are on private lands regulated under California’s strict environmental laws,” he said. Responding to the president’s tweets, Cal Fire spokesman Mike Mohler said the state has plenty of water to fight wildfires. “Let’s be clear: It’s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires,” he said. Evan Westrup, Brown’s spokesman, said the president’s tweets do not “merit a response.” Brown’s office announced Saturday that the White House has approved a request for a presidential major disaster declaration that would help fire victims in Shasta County, which has been ravaged by the Carr Fire. The declaration would provide federal assistance, such as housing and food aid, counseling and medical services. More than 14,000 personnel from California and elsewhere in the country are fighting wildfires across the state. The Pentagon announced Monday that it will send about 200 soldiers from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state to help with the firefighting efforts. The troops will be trained and will undergo a certification process before they are deployed to California next weekend. They will work with experienced civilian firefighters, U.S. military officials said. Dan Lamothe contributed to this report.

Reuters Editorial,"KABUL (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded near Afghanistan’s interior ministry in Kabul on Wednesday and then gunmen exchanged fire with members of the security forces, police said, in what appeared to be the latest in a series of militant attacks in the capital. There was no immediate word on casualties, nor was there any claim of responsibility. Two loud explosions and gunfire were heard coming from the vicinity of the ministry compound and police officials inside said they believed it was a militant attack. A senior police official said a car bomb was detonated near the ministry’s entrance and then a gun battle between attackers and members of the security forces broke out. A series of deadly attacks in Kabul this year have killed and wounded hundreds of people. Security in and around Kabul has been on high alert in recent days with more checkpoints and patrols as the government warned of “complex attacks” by the Taliban on the government or foreign installations in coming weeks. Provincial cities have also been hit as the Taliban, seeking to reimpose hardline Islamic rule, have stepped up fighting across the country since they announced the beginning of their annual spring offensive in April. The latest violence coincided with a U.S. government report that found few signs of progress in Afghanistan this year, with fighting spreading and hundreds of casualties from militant attacks. Security officials say violence is expected to pick up as preparations continue for parliamentary elections scheduled for October.

Mark Kaufman,"The real Smokey Bear narrowly avoided death in the pine-filled Capitan Mountains of New Mexico, nearly 70 years ago. Just west of the town of Roswell, firefighters found the bear cub clutching to the upper reaches of a tree, with singed paws and legs. The stranded black bear would almost certainly have perished amid the ashy land, but foresters saved him, and ultimately brought the tiny omnivore to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Here, the newly named ""Smokey Bear"" lived out his domesticated life, well beyond the wild threats of the American West, where forests burn, and indomitable fires are king. Today, of course, Smokey Bear lives on as a 74-year-old message, the longest-serving public service campaign in U.S. history. He is stern, though approachable. Authoritative, yet gentle. He only says one thing, ever. ""Only you can prevent wildfires."" But as Smokey the campaign run by the U.S. Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters, and the non-profit advertiser the Ad Council approaches his 75-birthday, he has entered changing climes. Earth's temperature has been rising for over a century a rise that is indisputably caused by humans. But over the past four decades, this rate of warming has accelerated. A Smokey illustration in 1995, as he puts out a forgotten campfire. Image: Rudy Wendelin/U.S. department of Agriculture Though the nation's fire woes are a complex confluence of potent culprits, Smokey's modern world, parched by heat and dryness, is increasingly aflame, and climate change is making it worse. Wildfires are burning more than twice as much land as they were in the early 1980s (when modern record-keeping began), and these blazes are burning for weeks not just days longer. Yet Smokey's message though imperfect remains relevant in an increasingly fire-damaged nation. ""You can prevent wildfires thats a great message,"" Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at the University of Alberta, said in an interview. ""I like to think every human-caused fire is preventable."" Globally, humans are responsible for starting around 95 percent of fires, said Flannigan, whether by downed power lines, a sparking vehicle, or a campfire gone wrong. So, encouraging Americans to be careful in fire country by drowning campfires in water or not carelessly tossing cigarette butts into the woods is unquestionably valuable, if not critical. A Smokey PSA from 1947. Image: Ad Council, US Forest Service &amp; National Association of State Foresters But limited to five words, Smokey's famous adage while memorable and enduring comes with a catch. ""Smokey's other message is not as obvious,"" said Flannigan. ""It's 'Fire is bad'."" ""Smokey's other message is not as obvious"" But, emphasized Flannigan, ""Fire is not bad it's nature at work."" ""Smokey has a place,"" Stephen Pyne, a wildlife historian at Arizona State University, added in an interview. ""The problem is when Smokey's message gets generalized."" Smokey's modern message There are bad fires, and there are good fires. ""We want fires of the right sort,"" said Pyne. Wildfires improve the wilderness. They open up sunlight while removing dead brush. They fertilize the land and crack open pine cones, spreading seeds. And, critically, they thin the forests and woodlands, depriving large fires of the fuel they relish when growing into towering conflagrations. In a modern world besieged by fires, then, we also need fire. In fact, when it's possible, many fire experts promote intentionally and intelligently lighting fires to thin out forests that we've let become overgrown. This is called prescribed burning. ""Some fires we need to fight, and some we need to light,"" said Pyne. That's why Pyne suggests a mild alteration of Smokey's legendary message. ""Why not just have him say 'Help Smokey stop bad fires?"" wondered Pyne. Or, perhaps, it's time to let Smokey retire and hand over the reins to Smokey's cubs to carry the modern message, while leaving Smokey to walk into the sunset, with his furry head and iconic flat-hat held high. ""Let him retire with dignity,"" said Pyne. SEE ALSO: The EPA has lost its mind It's quite unlikely, however, that Smokey will be retired. He's not just a massive advertising success, perhaps one of the most successful in U.S. history who doesn't know Smokey Bear? His message, though oversimplified, remains important not because of his legend, but because of his relevance to the future. Because forests, especially in the Western U.S. and Canada, are growing more susceptible to flames. ""The climate is changing,"" said Flannigan. ""Were getting more extreme weather for fire, and there are more people on the landscape."" ""The climate is changing"" This is a recipe for catastrophic flames, which recently proved historically deadly in the California town of Paradise. Though this blaze might have been caused by flawed power lines, not poor campfire etiquette, the consequences of accidental fire can be identical: towering, unstoppable flames. A Smokey PSA from 1953. Image: Ad Council, US Forest Service &amp; National Association of State Foresters Thousands of years ago, before hundreds of millions of people had populated North America, lightning strikes likely started nearly every fire on Earth. Lightning however, is more limited in scope, in part because lightning has a season. ""But now with humans, as long as the fuels are dry and the weather is conducive, you can have a fire any time of the year,"" said Flannigan. After all, in the parched West, all it takes is a spark. Under the right conditions, once a fire reaches the crowns of trees, humans are generally powerless to stop the flames, noted Flannigan. Even massive 747 aircraft swooping over fires and dropping loads of crimson retardant has little effect. ""Dropping retardant makes a nice picture,"" said Flannigan, ""But you might as well be spitting on a campfire."" Smokey's survival Smokey has survived through 14 presidential administrations, largely immune to America's contemporary episodes of social unrest, warring, and economic tumult. Yet, how successful has Smokey been at stopping, or avoiding, wildfires? A smokey PSA from 2017. Image: Ad Council, US Forest Service &amp; National Association of State Foresters It's nearly impossible to say. As the Ad Council pointed out over email, ""there are difficulties measuring something that never happens."" What is understood, however, is that Smokey is well known. Of over 6,700 outdoor recreationists recently surveyed, 8 of 10 could identify Smokey, according to the Ad Council. So his message is likely being heard. And Smokey has evolved and changed his message, in a nuanced but relevant way. In 2001, his message shifted from ""Only you can prevent forest fires"" to ""Only you can prevent wildfires."" This was appropriate, as some of the America's largest wildfires don't occur in forests, but in scrublands and chaparral. Whatever Smokey's true success rate, the U.S. Forest Service still considers the anthropomorphized bear as one weapon in its battle to stop accidental fires. ""The objective of wildfire prevention strategies, whether engineering, enforcement, education, administration or the Smokey Bear campaign, is to prevent human-caused ignitions from starting,"" the federal agency said in a statement. ""Smokeys message is about preventing a wildfire from starting in the first place."" Although seasoned fire experts like Pyne, who grew up with Smokey think his message can be refined, it's hard to argue Smokey isn't an important part of the modern solution to climate change-enhanced infernos. After all, we're going to need all the help we can get. Money alone, to fight fires and treat the land (reducing fuels in heavily wooded forest) won't solve the problem. And the U.S. Forest Service knows it. In 1995, 16 percent of the agency's budget was devoted to fighting fire. Now, it's up to 50 percent. And by 2025, ""two out of every three dollars the Forest Service gets from Congress as part of its appropriated budget will be spent on fire programs,"" the agency concluded in a 2015 report. An illustration of Smokey reading his fan mail in 1979. Image: RUDY WENDELIN/U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ""Were seeing expenditures go up and up and up,"" said Flannigan. ""Despite how much we're spending, our area burned has more than doubled."" Solving the nation's modern wildfire woes doesn't have a silver bullet solution regardless of what leading politicians, like Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, contend. Yes, it will mean reducing overgrown vegetation, or fuels, in our historically ill-managed forests. It will mean dramatically lowering global societies reliance on carbon emitting fossil fuels. It will mean fortifying communities against fire. And it will mean not acting foolishly in fire country. That's where Smokey, with his unpretentious, chummy demeanor, comes in. ""The status quo is not an option for the future,"" said Flannigan. ""We cant spend, spend, and spend and continue to get our butts kicked. When you have a battle with a lion you lose."" ""Were losing.""","The real Smokey Bear narrowly avoided death in the pine-filled Capitan Mountains of New Mexico, nearly 70 years ago.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"August’s landmark observation of two colliding neutron stars was incredible for its immediate impact on astronomy. It answered questions, like “where did the universe’s gold come from” and “how fast is the universe expanding?” But it left behind mysteries, too. Like, “what the hell is going on with those gamma rays?” Even with the first announcement, scientists wondered why the collision’s gamma rays looked weaker than expected. They surmised that the collision released collimated jets of particles, and we just weren’t in the line of fire. But a few new papers have released further data on the collision’s radio waves and x-rays—and demonstrate that the story probably isn’t as cut-and-dry as that. On August 17, observatories across the world spotted GW170817, the result of two colliding stars, each a little heavier than the sun but only the size of a small city. They emitted gravitational waves, tiny ripples in spacetime, alongside all sorts of light, including infrared and ultraviolet, visible light, x-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves. It was immediately obvious that the gamma-ray signature was not from a jet of particles pointed directly at the Earth. Maybe it was a jet pointed elsewhere, or something more complex than that. Astronomy has entered a new era, one where light and gravity both play a role in understanding the… Read more Read But today, an international team is now reporting a brightening of GW170817's radio waves over time in the journal Nature. A second team recently put a paper on the arXiv, the physics preprint server, demonstrating the same brightening in the x-rays. Clearly something strange is occurring. The radio wave team felt their observations suggested that some sort of wide cocoon or cone of matter is choking the jet. The result would instead be a wide outflow of slower particles, and could potentially produce the radio and gamma ray emissions that they observed. But others aren’t convinced by the cocoon interpretation. What if there really is some nearly light-speed jet of matter shooting out in a different direction, but with a much more complex structure of particles and speeds? “The tension is between whether or not you can uniquely explain the observations using this cocooony thing, or whether you can still explain the observation just with a jet with more complexity built into the physics,” Daryl Haggard, assistant professor of physics at McGill University, told Gizmodo. “That is completely unresolved.” Haggard was still extremely impressed with the data provided by the radio wave observers. “The paper is really awesome,” she said. “There’s more complicated structure happening in the outflow causing some of the emission to get brighter where we expect it to get fainter. It teaches us all sorts of things that we’re struggling and working to understand.” But that’s just astrophysics for you. You can’t just perform an experiment to understand what happens. “This is the name of the game in science,” said Haggard. “We observe our system and back-engineer what’s going on. This is the first step in understanding what the observations show us.” [ Nature ]","August’s landmark observation of two colliding neutron stars was incredible for its immediate impact on astronomy.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Thousands more mountain residents were evacuated from the path of California’s biggest wildfire on Friday as fatigued firefighters battled gusting winds driving one of the state’s worst fire seasons in a decade. The Mendocino Complex Fire grew to 157,450 acres (63,700 hectares) late Friday, about half the size of Los Angeles, forcing nearly 16,000 homeowners to flee a blaze that has destroyed 88 structures about 93 miles (150 km) north of San Francisco, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). Its size overtook the deadly Carr Fire, about 100 miles (160 km) to the northeast, which is among 17 major blazes burning in tinder-dry forests and woodland peppered with dead trees from the state’s 2011-2017 drought. The Carr Fire spawned a “fire whirl” of flames and winds in excess of 143 mph (230 kph) on July 26 that had the strength of a severe tornado and uprooted trees and toppled power lines, according to a tweet by the National Weather Service. Fueled by triple-digit temperatures, the blazes have put California on track for its most destructive fire year since 2008, in terms of area burned, said Cal Fire Deputy Chief Scott McLean. “These fires are just unpredictable and extremely dangerous. They’ve killed, they’re killers,” said McLean. “It’s going to go through you, around you, over you.” Four wildland firefighters have died in California this year, twice as many as in all of 2017. They included a bulldozer operator whose vehicle nearly slipped off a mountain trail three times before it rolled into a ravine and crushed him at the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite National Park, a Cal Fire report said. The report called for better “risk assessment” among firefighters. Several days of light winds have helped teams control smaller blazes, but they faced a “red flag” warning for increasing winds and heightened fire danger going into the weekend. Firefighters from 16 states have rushed to California, and authorities were reinforcing 3,232 personnel on the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two blazes. The Carr Fire is 39-percent contained, but firefighters are widening fire breaks to prevent winds from causing it to flare up again. It has destroyed 1,567 homes and other structures and blackened 133,924 acres (54,197 hectares), making it the sixth most destructive California wildfire on record.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of firefighters were building barriers and constructing containment lines early on Friday to slow an approaching wildfire threatening to torch thousands of homes in a lakeside community southeast of Los Angeles. More than 21,000 people have been evacuated in and around Lake Elsinore where furious flames and billowing smoke rose into the sky at the edge of the city of 60,000 as the blaze, dubbed the Holy Fire, burned nearby in the Santa Ana Mountains. “It feels like a war zone,” Ana Tran told the Los Angeles Times as ash and flame retardant fell on her neighborhood. The fire, which was five percent contained, was being fueled by dry brush covering steep terrain and stoked by erratic wind gusts during the night, said Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for the incident said. “Strong down drafts is making the fire move aggressively downhill,” said Nguyen, noting that firefighters were working to build barriers and containment lines to protect more than 2,000 homes at risk from the fire. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries battling the relatively small blaze that consumed more than 10,200 acres (4,128 hectares) since it began on Tuesday, fire officials said. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the area on Thursday, freeing up additional resources to battle the blaze. Forrest Clark, 51, was charged with setting the fire, the Orange County District Attorney Office said. The Holy Fire was one of several fires burning in California that have displaced tens of thousands of people. Wildfires across the state and region could be further stoked by strong gusts, low humidity and hot weather on Friday and Saturday, forecasters warned. In Northern California, a mechanic helping to fight the Carr Fire burning around Redding was killed in a traffic collision on Thursday, bringing the death toll from that blaze to eight, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said. The 178,000-acre Carr Fire has killed two other firefighters along with three members of one family and has destroyed nearly 1,100 homes. It was 49 percent contained with firefighters struggling in steep terrain to control the blaze, CalFire said. More than 4,000 firefighters are battling the Mendocino Complex Fire, which has burned 305,200 acres in three counties north of San Francisco, CalFire said. Two firefighters were injured and 119 homes destroyed by that fire which now ranks as the largest fire on record in the state.

Steven Musil,"Firefighters monitor a back fire as they battle the Mendocino Complex fire earlier this month near Lodoga, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Verizon Wireless says a customer service error -- not a violation of net neutrality -- was responsible for the continued throttling of the wireless data service of a fire department vehicle during a recent battle of a California wildfire. But that hasn't stopped net neutrality supporters from pointing at the incident as an example of the kind of potential treatment that internet and wireless service providers can offer now that the rules for governing an open internet are stripped away. The issue cropped up on Monday after the Santa Clara Fire Department said in a court filing that while it was helping fight the Mendocino Complex fire -- the largest wildfire in the state's history -- the crew assigned to one of the department's trucks saw its service dramatically impeded. ""County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,"" Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in the filing, reported on earlier by Ars Technica. ""This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire's ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services."" While Verizon insists that this mistake had nothing to do with net neutrality, the incident has been linked to the issue. During a Wednesday discussion by a California state assembly committee of a proposed net neutrality bill, one of the assemblymen brought up the Verizon issue as a concern and one reason why he supported stronger regulations. The firefighter incident has sparked a lot of anger at Verizon, which makes it easy to link the issue with the emotionally charged debate over net neutrality. Ultimately, this isn't a net neutrality issue. This incident dealt with firefighters exceeding their limit of data, while net neutrality deals with how different kinds of traffic or content is treated. Verizon wasn't playing favorites when it came to the data that the firefighters received. It -- wrongly, by its own admission -- slowed down the connection because of the volume of data, not the specific type. Those nuances sometimes get lost in the heated argument over net neutrality. The fire department paid for an unlimited plan from Verizon but suffered heavy throttling until it agreed to pay more for another plan, according to an addendum to a legal brief filed by 22 state attorneys general that seeks to overturn the rollback of net neutrality rules earlier this year by the FCC. ""The Internet has become an essential tool in providing fire and emergency response, particularly for events like large fires which require the rapid deployment and organization of thousands of personnel and hundreds of fire engines, aircraft, and bulldozers,"" Bowden wrote. The throttling affected ""OES 5262,"" a command and control vehicle that helps track and deploy firefighter resources around the state and country where there's the greatest need, Bowden said. ""In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262 was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds,"" Bowden wrote. ""These reduced speeds severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively."" Bowden said his staff communicated with Verizon about the throttling but was told by representatives for the wireless carrier the throttling would continue until the unit switched to a new data plan that cost twice the previous plan. In a statement Tuesday, Verizon acknowledged it erred in continuing to throttle the unit's data service after the department requested restrictions be lifted, calling it a miscommunication unrelated to net neutrality. Verizon said in a statement: Like all customers, fire departments choose service plans that are best for them. This customer purchased a government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost. Under this plan, users get an unlimited amount of data but speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle. Regardless of the plan emergency responders choose, we have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations. We have done that many times, including for emergency personnel responding to these tragic fires. In this situation, we should have lifted the speed restriction when our customer reached out to us. This was a customer support mistake. We are reviewing the situation and will fix any issues going forward. Late Monday, attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia filed a brief urging a US Appeals Court to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's rollback of Obama-era rules governing an open internet. The wave of support underscores the notion that while the net neutrality rules are gone, the push to bring them back isn't.

Patrick Allan,"There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like “clip,” “casings,” and “semi-automatic.” But if you’re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head. This glossary of common gun lingo will help clear things up so you can be an informed part of the conversation. The shooter who recently terrorized the Las Vegas strip, leaving 59 dead and hundreds injured, used … Read more Read Obviously, this is a sensitive subject, especially in light of the many recent tragedies that have occurred. But knowledge on the subject of guns is important—no matter where you stand on the matter—since misinformation does nothing but cause more confusion and frustration for everyone. Real discussion can only occur when we all understand the basic facts. In alphabetical order, these are the gun terms you may not know: ACP : An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol. Designates various John Browning cartridge designs and calibers primarily used in Colt and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal semi-automatic pistols, like.45 ACP,.380 ACP, and.25 ACP. AK-47 : An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948. They are very reliable and cost very little to make so they’re the gun of choice for many military and revolutionary outfits. As of 2004, “Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s” Ammunition (ammo) : A package of components that includes gunpowder, a primer, and a projectile encased in a casing. Amount of ammunition is measured in rounds, which is the what’s loaded into a gun. Ammunition comes in hundreds of sizes, and must match the firearm in order for it to be used. AR-15 : Stands for ArmaLite Rifle-15, not “assault rifle.” It’s a lightweight semi-automatic rifle that comes in a wide variety of models. They are considered “modern sporting rifles” by some and “assault rifles” by others. Variants of the AR-15 have been used in many high-profile mass shootings in the U.S., including Sandy Hook, Aurora, San Bernardino, Sutherland Springs Church, the Las Vegas srip, the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and most recently the Waffle House shooting in Nashville, Tennessee. Assault rifle : A technical term for a selective-fire rifle, usually used by a military or police force, which fires reduced-power ammunition from a detachable magazine. It can fire in either semi-automatic or fully automatic modes. Examples include AK-47s and M16s. Assault weapon : A political term, not a technical term, that changes depending on who is using it. Connecticut defines assault weapons as “selective-fire firearms capable of fully automatic, semi-automatic, or burst fire at the options of the user.” Virgina defines it as any weapon with a magazine capacity greater than 20 rounds. The Federal Assault Weapon Ban, which was passed in 1994 but is now expired, had its own complex list of guidelines for defining assault weapons. Automatic : A gun that continuously fires bullets as long as the trigger is pressed or held down and there is still ammunition in the magazine. More commonly known as a “machine gun.” Ballistics : The science and study of cartridge discharge, and the launch, flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles (in this case bullets). Ballistics experts can determine where a bullet was fired, where it went, and what it did. Beretta : An Italian firearm manufacturing company— Fabbrica d’Armi Pietro Beretta. It’s the oldest active manufacturer of firearm components in the world. They make semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, submachine guns, machine pistols, and more. Blank : A round of ammunition loaded with black powder but no bullet. Commonly used in film, TV, theatre, military exercises, and for starting races. Bolt action : A type of rifle that fires one round at a time. Once a round is fired, the user must manually pull back a metal, cylindrical mechanism called the bolt to unload the empty shell and load another round into the chamber. Buckshot : Shotgun ammunition that contains medium or large-sized pellets (.24” in diameter or greater) that fire out of a shotgun shell all at once. Used for self-defense and hunting large game. Bullet : The projectile in a cartridge or round of ammunition. When the primer is struck, the gunpowder is ignited, and the bullet is propelled down the gun’s barrel and toward its target. Casings : The containing unit of a cartridge or round. It holds the gunpowder, the projectile(s), and has a built in primer (for igniting the gunpowder). Usually made of metal for rifles and handguns, plastic for shotguns. Sometimes called a “shell.” Caliber : The diameter of a gun’s bore (the inner diameter of the barrel) measured as fractions of an inch. It also determines the size of ammunition that can be fired by the gun. For example, “.22 cal” or “.45 caliber.” Caliber can also be measured in millimetres, like “9 mm,” but there is no decimal point and the word caliber is dropped. Clip : A popular, non-technical term for a magazine (see below). Cock : The action of manually drawing the hammer of a gun back, arming the hammer to be released at the pull of the trigger, which would fire the weapon. Many weapons, especially those with internal hammers, can be cocked automatically by pulling the trigger. This that action and sound you see and hear in movies and TV when a standoff escalates. Double tap : Simply two shots fired in rapid succession, usually without re-aiming the firearm between shots. Firearm : By federal definition, under the 1968 Gun Control Act, it’s a rifle, shotgun, or handgun using gunpowder as a propellant. Air guns and other devices that fire projectiles without combustion are not considered firearms. Flash suppressor : An attachment at the end of a firearm’s barrel that lets hot air and gas escape the barrel. It makes for a smaller flash of light when a round exits the barrel, improving visibility for the shooter. Folding stock : A rifle or shotgun stock that can be doubled over for compact storage. Gauge : This is the bore size (the width inside of the barrel) of a shotgun, similar to the way caliber is for rifles and handguns. It’s based on the number of round lead balls of bore diameter that equals a pound. Glock : A series of popular semi-automatic handguns designed and produced by Austrian company Glock Ges.m.b.H. (or GLOCK). Hair trigger : A trigger that can be pulled (or “breaks”) with little pressure and an extremely light touch. High-capacity magazine : In most jurisdictions, it’s any magazine that holds over 10 rounds. Some high-capacity magazines can hold as many as 100 rounds. Note: many modern semi-automatic pistols have magazines that hold between 15 and 18 rounds; modern semi-automatic rifles come standard with magazines holding between 20 and 30 rounds. Hollow-point : A bullet with a concave nose designed to increase expansion and fragment upon penetration of a solid target. Does more internal harm to the target, but is considered safer for innocent bystanders who might be otherwise struck with a bullet that passes through a target. Magazine : A container that holds cartridges or rounds under spring pressure to be fed into a gun’s chamber. Magazines are usually detachable and refillable. With a semi-automatic or automatic weapon, a full magazine is inserted into the gun, the hammer is cocked, and rounds are automatically loaded into the gun’s chamber from the magazine as it fires. Pistol : A type of handgun that fires bullets. It’s a small, portable, concealable firearm designed to be easily fired from one or two hands. They can be single shot, semi-automatic, or fully automatic in the form of a machine pistol. Glocks, revolvers, snubbies, and Desert Eagles are all pistols. Pistol grip : An extra handle attached to a rifle or shotgun behind the trigger like you’d find on a pistol. Point blank : The distance at which a firearm can be directly aimed at a target without worrying about trajectory. Believed to come from old bowmen terminology in England and France, referring to practice conducted with white bull skull targets. Point blank, or “point blanc,” meant the archer was standing very close to the target and could easily point their bow directly at the white of the bull’s skull. Private party transfer : A second-hand purchase of a firearm involving you exchanging cash for a gun from a private party, no questions asked, like at a gun show. Some states require records to kept for such purchases, but most of them don’t. Recoil : Often referred to as a gun’s “kick,” or the backward force the gun exerts when it’s fired. The heavier the bullet and the faster it leaves the barrel the more recoil there is. Revolver : A handgun or pistol with a multi-chambered cylinder (usually holding six to eight rounds) that rotates with each pull of the trigger. If you’ve ever seen a western, they’re all using revolvers. “Single action” revolvers require you to manually cock the hammer back before firing each round. Rifle : A gun with a long barrel that’s fired from the shoulder and used for precision shooting. The barrel has helical pattern grooves cut into the bore walls (the inside of the barrel), a process known as “rifling.” They come in many varieties, including bolt action, semi-automatic, and automatic. Round : A complete unit of ammunition (also known as a cartridge) that has a casing, a primer, a propellant, and a projectile. Safety : A mechanism on modern firearms that prevents a gun’s trigger from being pulled, thus preventing the gun from being fired. Typically, the safety should always be left on until a user is ready to fire their weapon. Saturday night special : A colloquial term used for any inexpensive handgun, especially a very small pistol that can easily be concealed in your pocket. They’ve also sometimes been called “suicide specials.” Sawed-off shotgun : A shotgun that has had its barrel shortened to less than 18” (often by sawing it off), or a shotgun with an overall length less than 26”. These types of guns are federally restricted. Scope : A magnifying tube attached to the top of a rifle, shotgun, or pistol that allows a shooter to see and aim at distant target more easily. Semi-automatic : A self-loading firearm. It fires one bullet each time the trigger is pulled, but also performs all necessary mechanical steps to prepare another bullet to be fired. Once a magazine is loaded into a semi-automatic gun and the gun is cocked, a user could pull the trigger over and over firing bullets until the magazine was empty. Shells : A popular, slang term for the leftover casing of a round. Also, sometimes used to describe shotgun ammunition. Shotgun : A firearm fires groups of small pellets or very large slugs instead of bullets. They’re designed for shooting fast moving targets, like birds, deer, or rabbits, at close range. Silencer : A slang term for a suppressor. This device is attached to the end of a gun’s barrel and reduces the sound of its discharge, or altering the sound’s characteristics so it’s less intense. They are tightly controlled under federal law. Snubby : Slang for a revolver with a very short barrel. They can be considered to be “Saturday Night Specials” (see above). Stopping power : A term often used to describe an ammunition’s ability to cause a human or animal to be incapacitated when shot with it. It’s an imprecise term, but basically, a cartridge or round with high stopping power is doing more damage per each shot than a round with less stopping power. Self-defense rounds are usually marketed as having high stopping power. Strawman purchase : When you have someone else purchase a gun for you, then they hand the gun over to you for a much lower price or small fee. It’s illegal, but it’s hard to stop in states where Private Party Transfers aren’t regulated. Waiting period : The legally mandated time between purchasing a firearm and receiving the firearm, anywhere from seven to 25 days. It’s designed to give law enforcement officials time to perform a background check on the purchaser, and provides a “cooling off” period to help prevent impulsive acts of violence and suicides.","There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like “clip,” “casings,” and “semi-automatic.” But if you’re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head.

Danny Crichton,"Online labor marketplaces have been around since the dawn of the internet. Post a task, select a worker, verify the work, and submit a payment. There are dozens of companies that broker labor services, and the rise of these marketplaces has been a large factor in encouraging as many as a third of American workers to become freelancers. While finding individual workers for simple tasks is now common online, finding and building teams to solve complex tasks is anything but. Diverse skill sets, complex relationships between tasks, and the need for institutional memory around a project have made team building on the internet a challenging subject for researchers and startup founders alike. Using research around a concept called flash teams, New York-based B12 is looking to solve the team-based labor marketplace challenge, all the while opening its core infrastructure to the public as an open source project known as Orchestra. The company, the brainchild of CEO Nitesh Banta and CTO Adam Marcus, is targeting website creation and management as its first vertical. The concept of flash teams originated in the work of a group of computer science researchers at the Stanford HCI Group. The goal of their original 2014 paper was to identify the challenges in using algorithms to build teams, including how to evaluate experts, construct teams with complementary skillsets, and handle organizational behavior to ensure that work was completed satisfactorily. As an example, consider building a new home. One needs architects to design it, engineers to evaluate the structure, and construction crews to build it. These are expert tasks — if an architect doesn’t know exactly what he or she is doing, it could spell disaster for the whole project. Adding to the complexity, tasks are not linear: the foundation of the home can be started before the full design of the kitchen is complete, for instance. There are a couple of insights at the heart of flash teams. First, experts with significant experience should evaluate other experts with less experience in their field of expertise. So a senior architect with dozens of projects under their belt is likely the best candidate to evaluate the quality of a new architect. Marcus explained that “You can’t review everything on the platform, but you can do analysis to determine what parts could most use another set of expert eyes, rather than arbitrarily.” Second, projects often follow similar patterns, and so a new project can start with a preexisting “scaffold” to get started. “One [benefit] is automating away as much of the project management as possible,” Marcus said. “The other is to automate as many parts of our designs as possible, so that [our workers] can focus on what they are experts at.” In other words, designers should be designers, not bureaucrats tracking paperwork. B12’s first mission was to take that Stanford research and turn it into a usable software library. Orchestra is designed to take a workflow of discrete steps and distribute work to a network of experts that have been evaluated through hierarchical review. As such, it is a flexible library that should be able to fit any complex work vertical. The company hired Daniela Retelny, the first author of the flash teams paper, to be its director of product. Given the rising concerns of algorithmic accountability and fear of a black box society, B12 decided to open source Orchestra, “so that anyone in the community can give us feedback,” Marcus explained. Next, B12 had to pick a vertical to launch its system, and landed on website creation and management. Banta and Marcus explained to me that web design has traditionally been a choice between an online do-it-yourself editor or a full-service consultancy, and they wanted to offer something more customizable but still retaining the price advantage of DIY systems. Banta felt that “we could kind of use this mix of AI and automation and smart staffing to try to redesign website creation end-to-end.” Using a set of preexisting scaffolds, B12 can start to construct a website as soon as a couple of basic questions about the business are answered. It uses entity detection to scan social media profiles and pull in existing assets, and it can use pre-existing designs based on the vertical of a particular business to kick-off the process. That cuts the most boring work significantly, allowing experts to focus on the creative aspects of their work. “As soon as you see your algorithmically generated website, [users] can tell us what they like and dislike about their website. Orchestra can then pull together a team of experts to work on your website for you,” Banta explained. So if a user wants a different design, or other functionality, Orchestra is designed to fire off tasks to the right kinds of experts to make those changes. Once a website is launched, B12 offers regular SEO updates based on its experts’ reviews of the site to maximize its traffic. Fully automated website design is free, and premium design is $29 a month and up. For experts, the benefits of this system are clear. Drudgery is replaced with algorithms, as is the complex coordination that required hours in Slack to figure out who is going to do what. Performance evaluations are also handled by other experts in your field — not generalist managers who have no particular expertise to analyze the quality of your work. Algorithms may well be the best boss you ever had. Joining the platform today requires working on a starter project which is then evaluated by another expert. That first project provides the initial seed reputation for a new expert, and from there, Orchestra can assign them progressively more difficult and interesting tasks as their reputation improves. Marcus noted that B12 has received more than 1000 expert applications, and has accepted roughly 3% of them. Today, the company is exclusively focused on building websites, but it is very aware of the possible extensions of its technology to nearby verticals. Ultimately, the company’s goal is to build software that allows humans to be humans. “The benefits of having something like Orchestra is building a community of people who don’t just enjoy working in an expert way, but also in a team-oriented way,” Marcus said. B12 has raised $12.4 million from General Catalyst, Breyer Capital, Founder Collective and SV Angel.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. But do I want it to? Amazon/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET It's all very well deciding to cut the cord. But what are you going to cut it with? Which of these little sticks and boxes will work for you: Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku Streaming Stick or Amazon Fire TV ? It's all quite confusing. Still, Amazon is desperate for you to put your hand into its Fire. It's just released not one, but 12 new ads to inspire you. They all have the same basic structure. You're watching a well-known TV show or video and then something happens that requires you to pause it and interact with Alexa, who lives in your Fire. Imagine, for example, that you're watching a smutty scene on "" Game Of Thrones."" Why might you want to chat to Alexa during it? Well... Or perhaps you enjoy something even more "" Shameless."" Yes, Alexa can even help you with parenting. Mind you, if you're a parent watching "" The Witch,"" Alexa can also save you from severe conniptions. So now you are persuaded, yes? In his review, CNET's David Katzmaier praised Fire TV as having best-in-class voice features. He was, however, concerned at how aggressively it tries to push Amazon's entertainment over, well, everything else. Deciding which streaming gadget is right for you involves, though, a lot of research and soul-searching. The fact that Amazon has released 12 ads perhaps hints at how complex the decision might be. It's so much worse at Christmas, isn't it? You have so many gifts to buy, but you also want to get something for your own entertainment.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","As residents of Malibu fled their seaside city in droves to escape a raging wildfire on Thursday, volcanologist Jess Phoenix hitched her two-horse trailer to her Ford F-250, hopped on the 101-freeway, and headed straight for the inferno. There were animals that needed rescuing. As a breeder and proud owner of two horses, Phoenix knows a thing or two about helping the animals out in difficult circumstances. As a scientist whos done field work around active volcanoes, she knows her way around a fiery disaster zone (although fires and volcanoes are different ). And as an Angeleno deeply embedded in Southern Californias equestrian community, she knew that some of the more than 100,000 people ordered to evacuate as the Woolsey and Hill fires tore through Malibu and surrounding areas on the night of November 8 had equine companions in need of help. In other words, driving into the smoldering heart of horse country as flames raced down the hillsides wasnt much of a choice. The fire was coming onto the highway, and cop cars were blowing past me with their lights on, Phoenix told Earther. It was insane. Phoenix is part of Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation, a 13,000 member-strong community of horse lovers who have space to shelter the animals or trailers to pick them up in, and wholl come to rescue when disaster strikes a community. On Thursday night, she evacuated four horses, starting in the city of Agoura Hills and then moving west into the rugged equestrian community of Hidden Valley in the Santa Monica Mountains. Those four pickups alone took all night. I would have done more, but the cell phones went down, she said. That really was a big problem. Fortunately, there were a number of folks out helping evacuate animals, including trained volunteers like Phoenix and professionals with Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control and Ventura County Animal Services. Along with horse owners who were able to evacuate their animals themselves, rescuers were soon flooding into designated animal shelters like Pierce College in the west San Fernando Valley. The college campus, which includes a 225-acre farm, has for years served as a shelter during the fires that so frequently plague the region, and its staff was ready. We have horse stables, corrals, people who understand equestrians, vets we can bring in, Pierce College public information officer Doreen Clay told Earther. Theres a lot of equestrian activities out on this west side of town. When Phoenix dropped off her first rescue horse at Pierce College on Thursday night, the shelter was nearing capacity. Soon it was overflowing with more than 250 rescue animals, Clay told Earther. In the days since the fire flared up many folks have taken their animals home, but as of yesterday morning, there were still 153 horses and 20 mini horses, along with donkeys, goats, sheep, chickens, and tortoises. The nearby Hansen Dam Equestrian Center, also a designated shelter, was similarly slammed. Northwest of the fires near Oxnard, the Ventura County Fairgrounds and the Humane Society of Ventura County started picking up some of the overflow. Greg Cooper, Director of Community Outreach at the Humane Society, said that his private non-profit jumped to 24/7 emergency services within an hour of the first fire, with equestrian teams heading out to rescue horses, donkeys, cows, and other livestock in the Malibu area. That included pulling animals from Zuma Beach, which became a temporary refuge for horses, llamas, and a now internet-famous pair of alpacas. Cooper told Earther that the Thomas Fire, which tore through Ventura County last year and became the largest fire in Californias history until the Mendocino Complex unseated it this summer, provided practice for the rescue teams. The Thomas fire taught us a lot of things, Cooper said. We thought we were prepared for intake. We have spent the entire year getting our property more organized and increasing capacity. As the influx came in [this time around] it was much easier to do intake. Cooper said the Humane Society would continue sheltering animals and providing 24/7 care as long as it takes. Randy Freeman, marketing manager at Ventura County Animal Services, echoed that sentiment regarding the temporary shelter at the county fairgrounds, which was sheltering 180 horses, ponies, and other large animals as of Tuesday night. The animals may need help a while longer. As of Tuesday, the Woolsey Fire had torched nearly 100,000 acres, destroyed an estimated 435 structures and claimed two lives, according to Cal Fire. Full containment is expected by November 18, but even as thousands of people start to return home, recovery will be a long, painful process for many residents and their animal companions. At least one ranchWhite Cloud Ranch in Malibu burned to the ground, although, thankfully, all 48 horses and ponies were evacuated. The bright spot amidst all the horror is how the community came together to help one another, and nowhere is that more evident than in the mass mobilization to rescue creatures that cannot rescue themselves. It will be everybodys turn sooner or later. I have to tell you, the community has been amazing, Clay said, recalling how volunteers with the animal welfare organization Operation Blankets of Love showed up with supplies and stayed on campus for three days to help the small animals. In addition to the local vet the school partners with, a volunteer vet showed up out of nowhere to lend a hand, too. Phoenix said that as designated shelters became full Thursday night, private barns across a wide area started making themselves available. People were driving these animals 70, 80 miles away from the fire, she said. She also made her home available for people and animalsthe calculus was simple. It will be everybodys turn sooner or later, Phoenix said.","As residents of Malibu fled their seaside city in droves to escape a raging wildfire on Thursday, volcanologist Jess Phoenix hitched her two-horse trailer to her Ford F-250, hopped on the 101-freeway, and headed straight for the inferno.

Associated Press,"CLEARLAKE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 4:15 p.m. Authorities are ordering residents along a Northern California lake to evacuate homes in the path of a growing wildfire amid concerns that hot, windy and dry weather conditions will persist throughout the weekend. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Jane LaBoa says a wildfire remains several miles from the communities along the eastern shore of Clear Lake, about 110 miles (175 kilometers) north of San Francisco. But LaBoa says its trajectory and the weather forecast prompted officials to evacuate the communities Friday out of an abundance of caution. The wildfire has grown to 175 square miles (280 square kilometers) and is a few miles from connecting with a second blaze that has grown to 64 square miles (105 square kilometers). The twin fires have destroyed 41 homes. ___ 11:50 a.m. A California bulldozer operator nearly slipped off a steep mountain trail three times before his vehicle finally rolled into a ravine and fatally crushed him. A Department of Forestry and Fire Protection preliminary report says each earlier slip alone qualified as a ""near miss"" warning that the century-old mining trail could collapse. The report says 36-year-old Braden Varney was working alone overnight July 14 fighting a wildfire sparked hours earlier outside Yosemite National Park. His assistant had gone to get a new hydraulic hose. Varney's radio wasn't communicating with headquarters, so his assistant relayed messages — until they lost contact. Varney was a 10-year veteran. The report says his death highlights the need for better risk assessment, communication and supervision. Varney became the first of four California firefighters to die this year. ___ 11:15 a.m. Experts say a deadly Northern California wildfire burned so hot at its peak that it created a cyclone of flames that reached 143 mph, ripping through the region with the force of a destructive Midwest tornado. National Weather Service meteorologist Duane Dykema said Friday that the blaze still burning near Redding created a fire whirl that uprooted trees and tore roofs from homes. Dykema says the whirl started when hot air from the exceptionally hot fire rose and twisted tightly, creating a powerful tornado of flames and wind. He says fire whirls are common, but not at the intensity recorded on July 26. The fire burning near Redding has grown to 206 square miles (533 square kilometers) and destroyed at least 1,060 homes. ___ 7:40 a.m. Increasing winds are expected in Northern California areas where deadly and destructive wildfires are burning. The National Weather Service has issued warnings for critical fire weather conditions Friday and Saturday as a series of dry low-pressure systems pass through the region, bringing gusts up to 35 mph (56 kph) in the afternoon.

Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES – An intentionally set wildfire grew perilously close to homes in Southern California on Thursday as evacuation orders expanded to more than 20,000 residents, though some homeowners stayed behind to fend off the flames themselves. Firefighters fought a desperate battle to stop the Holy Fire from reaching homes as the blaze surged through the Cleveland National Forest above the city of Lake Elsinore and its surrounding communities. They were trying to keep the flames from devouring neighborhoods and taking lives, as gigantic fires still burning in Northern California have done. ""Our main focus this afternoon was getting everyone out safely,"" said Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for the fire crews. As flames raged closer, some residents stood in driveways or on top of roofs and used garden hoses to keep their homes wet and to fight the flames as smoke billowed around them. Joe Rodriguez was using a power washer to wet down his patio in the McVicker Canyon Park neighborhood on Thursday morning. Although the neighborhood is under an evacuation order, the 38-year-old Rodriguez told the San Bernardino Sun that he decided to stay to help save his home. ""Until this thing is barking at my door, I'm going to stick with it,"" he said. He said a line of fire retardant dropped on the hill above his house has so far checked the fire's advance, along with helicopter water drops. Rodriguez's wife and two daughters evacuated. Fire crews worked in 100-plus-degree (38 Celsius) heat. Aircraft dumped bright pink lines of fire retardant to wall off the fire from homes. The 15-square-mile (39-sq. kilometer)blaze was only 5 percent contained. The fire is named for Holy Jim Canyon, where it erupted Monday and burned a dozen cabins. A resident of the canyon, 51-year-old Forrest Gordon Clark, was charged Thursday with arson and other crimes that could send him to prison for life. Clark refused to go to court Thursday and his arraignment was postponed to Friday. It's unclear whether he has an attorney. Winds gusting to nearly 20 mph (32 kph) at times drove the fire through dense chaparral on the foothill slopes and along ridgetops, sending up an enormous column of smoke that smeared the sky for miles around. The fire threatened communities near the inland resort of Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. Hot, dry weather, gusty winds and tinder-dry vegetation are the same conditions that caused wildfires in Northern California to explode into deadly conflagrations in the space of two weeks. North of San Francisco, fire crews continued progress in corralling the twin fires known as the Mendocino Complex. Since starting on July 27, the fires — which are being fought together as a single incident — have destroyed more than 100 homes near Clear Lake and become the largest fire in recorded state history. The area burned by the blaze is now larger than the cities of Los Angeles. The fires were 51 percent contained. In the Redding area, the year's deadliest fire was nearly half surrounded and was burning into remote and rugged forest land but grass, brush and trees there are so dry from years of drought and recent heat that the potential remained for the fire to grow, state fire officials said. The Carr Fire, as it's called, killed six people, including two firefighters, and burned more than 1,000 homes. Two other people — a state fire heavy equipment mechanic assigned to the fire and a utility worker trying to restore power near the fire— have died in car accidents. ___ Michael Balsamo and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this story.","Fox News Flames inch close to California homes as thousands evacuate Fox News LOS ANGELES – An intentionally set wildfire grew perilously close to homes in Southern California on Thursday as evacuation orders expanded to more than 20,000 residents, though som…",2018-08-10T01:00:30Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Flames inch close to California homes as thousands evacuate - Fox News,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/09/flames-inch-close-to-california-homes-as-thousands-evacuate.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/08/09/flames-inch-close-to-california-homes-as-thousands-evacuate/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.png/0/0/1533857872146.png?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,Complex fire,1
Mark Kaufman,"As thousands of firefighters battled uncontrolled flames in both Northern and Southern California on Saturday, President Trump tweeted out an ill-informed, distorted message about the cause of these deadly autumn infernos. But the firefighting community quickly rebutted the president's rash claims, wherein he blamed ""gross mismanagement of the forests,"" while also threatening to cut federal support to fire management efforts. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018 As firefighters, fire researchers, and climate scientists largely agree, mismanaged forests which generally means wooded areas that haven't been allowed to naturally burn and reduce vulnerable vegetation are just one part of a complex, growing wildfire problem in the U.S. Rather, today's historic wildfire woes are a confluence of weather events, human-building, climate change, and mismanaged forests. As the Pasadena Fire Association pointed out on Twitter, ""Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong."" Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong. The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts &amp; help the victims. Scott Austin, Pres IAFF 809. @IAFFNewsDesk https://t.co/d3jY0SeosF Pasadena Fire Assn. (@PFA809) November 10, 2018 In Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire (as of Nov. 10 at 8:30 p.m.) had burned over 83,000 acres and forced Hollywood stars and wildlife alike to flee to the beaches, mismanaged forests are not to blame. The affected areas aren't overgrown pine forests, but grasslands and other coastal or near-coastal shrublands, known as chaparral. There's nothing to log here, noted Crystal Kolden, a former wildland firefighter and associate professor in forest rangeland and fire sciences at the University of Idaho, countered on Twitter. Right. I'm sure that there is a long list of logging companies waiting to log chaparral shrublands and oak woodlands and grasslands. The most destructive and deadly fires in CA are NOT in forests. This is grossly irresponsible and uninformed. https://t.co/mjndBhCboA Dr. Crystal A. Kolden (@pyrogeog) November 10, 2018 A continuing problem in Southern California, like in many Western areas, is that populations have expanded into dry areas that naturally burn, known as the urban-wildlife interface. Deadly fires often burn through these communities, as they've repeatedly done in California jumping major freeways and torching suburban homes. This requires local and political solutions, such as intelligently reducing dry vegetation near these communities, or building fire-resistant homes, fire scientist Michael Gollner explained on Friday. SEE ALSO: How California erupted in flames overnight Exacerbating matters, fires everywhere are now burning more land, burning for longer, and becoming more destructive and climate change is a potent contributor. Simply put, hotter climes suck moisture out of the land, leaving profoundly dried out, tinder-ready grasslands and forests. Although fire season should be winding down in California, a vast swath of the state is still experiencing record dryness notably in Northern California where the Camp Fire burned people to death in their vehicles. ""This is a big deal,"" U.S. Forest Service meteorologist Brenda Belongie, referring the record dryness, said Friday. Wildfires are largely stoked by weather and gusty winds, but solving the growing problem doesn't have a quick forest management fix, as the president contends. For that reason, amid new fires that have killed at least 23 people, the firefighting community has found the president's ignorant fire-messaging to be repugnant. The International Association of Firefighters, of note, offered the Commander-in-Chief some stark words: Firefighters understand the complexity and influences of today's flames. But their mission now is to help subdue the blazes, so firefighters haven't tolerated President Trump's wrong-headed, oversimplified message. As the International Association of Firefighters said : ""To minimize the crucial, life-saving work being done and to make crass suggestions such as cutting off funding during a time of crisis shows a troubling lack of real comprehension about the disaster at hand and the dangerous job our fire fighters do.""","As thousands of firefighters battled uncontrolled flames in both Northern and Southern California on Saturday, President Trump tweeted out an ill-informed, distorted message about the cause of these deadly autumn infernos.

Sidney Fussell,"New York City will be among the first cities in the US to earnestly tackle black box algorithms, the automated decision-making systems that are rarely made public, but have greater and greater influence over lives. A bill passed by the city council this week orders the creation of a local task force to monitor and assess the effect of these algorithms on the public. Unless Mayor Bill de Blasio vetoes the bill, which he is not expected to, the task force will audit the city’s algorithms for disproportionate impacts on different communities and come up with ways to inform the public on the role of automation. In a city of 8 million people, decisions have to be made. In New York City, algorithms factor into nearly every part of municipal life, from school placement for students to deciding which suspects are released or kept in jail until trial. Even firefighters use them: The FDNY aims to inspect at least 10 percent of the city’s 300,000 buildings each year, so it uses an algorithmic tool to help decide which buildings are inspected and in what order. Such algorithms enable public agencies to process cases more quickly, but removing the human element means it’s difficult to hold anyone accountable, especially when most people don’t realize algorithms are the reason they’ve been denied a loan, detained in jail instead of being released, or haven’t had their building inspected for fire safety. “A part of this task force’s mission will be to determine how we can evaluate the outputs of automated systems and figure out if and when there is harm done,” Councilman James Vacca, chair of the City Council Committee on Technology and sponsor of the bill, told Gizmodo over email. “I do hope this task force evaluates how algorithmic tools impact school seat distribution, the policing of neighborhoods, the determination of fire safety resources, the allocation of benefits, and that it also brings up other use cases we aren’t already thinking about.” The bill has been submitted to Mayor de Blasio to sign, though it passes into law automatically unless he moves to veto it. Vacca has full confidence that he will not, meaning the task force will work with public agencies to determine if their “automated decision making processes” impact varying groups unfairly, what should be done if so, how to inform people they’ve been impacted. This issue of how to inform the public is key and distinguishes the bill passed on Monday from a previous version. The older version included a clause that would’ve required agencies to publicly disclose each algorithm’s source code (the combination of inputs and outputs that define it), a first for the nation. That clause didn’t make it into this version of the bill, though Vacca says he doesn’t rule out eventual source code disclosures. “In drafting and amending the legislation, we had to work through a number of complex things, from both a legal and technical stand-point,” he said. “The task force formed will examine the best ways to ensure algorithmic accountability and to mitigate algorithmic bias, and its recommendations will be public. These recommendations could be, and I expect they will be, considered by the administration and the next Council, and as of now, no measures are off the table.” A growing number of scholars have committed to researching issues of fairness and bias in algorithms, though few laws are actually on the books requiring transparency.","New York City will be among the first cities in the US to earnestly tackle black box algorithms, the automated decision-making systems that are rarely made public, but have greater and greater influence over lives.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - When Gary Martin came to work at the Henry Pratt valve manufacturing plant in Aurora, Illinois, on Friday, he was told he was being terminated from his job. Shortly thereafter, Martin pulled out his Smith &amp; Wesson revolver and opened fire. 
Aurora Police Chief Kristen Ziman said Martin shot six fellow employees, five of them fatally, at the sprawling warehouse where he had worked for 15 years, and wounded five police officers before he was slain by police 90 minutes later. 
She said police had yet to determine whether the shooting was an impulsive act or premeditated, and that investigators had not immediately ascertained why he had been fired. 
She said police were executed a search warrant at his residence to further their investigation of what she called a “workplace shooting.” 
Jeremy Sherman, a neighbor of Martin’s at Acorn Woods Condominium Complex in Aurora, about 40 miles west of Chicago, told Newsweek’s Daily Beast website that Martin could often be found outside playing with his remote-control toy cars and drones. 
Sherman described his neighbor as a loner with whom he sometimes chatted without ever learning anything about Martin’s work life or his past. Sherman said he never saw Martin with weapons - or with guests. 
“He kept to himself a lot, and he was always on his porch,” he told the Daily Beast. “Even when he wasn’t doing nothing, he’d be out there sitting. I’d be out there, sometimes one, two [o’clock] in the morning and he’d be there just sitting all in the dark, [in the] shadows.” 
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT 
Martin’s mother told the Chicago Sun-Times that her son had been “way too stressed out” recently. 
Public records showed Martin had a criminal past, a 1995 conviction for aggravated assault in Marshall County, Mississippi. 
Aurora Police Chief Ziman said authorities did not know if he had legally purchased the gun he used. Convicted felons are barred from buying firearms. 
A fellow employee and eyewitness John Probst told CNN that Martin fired his pistol with a green laser sight at fellow workers. “What I saw was the guy running down the aisle with a pistol with a laser on it,” he said. 
The shooting came a day after the one-year anniversary of the massacre of 17 people by a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

"Faith Karimi and Steve Almasy, CNN","(CNN) A woman who shot dead three people at a Rite Aid distribution center in Maryland was a disgruntled employee working there temporarily, authorities said. Snochia Moseley, 26, opened fire at the facility near Aberdeen on Thursday -- the latest mass shooting in the United States and the second workplace rampage in 24 hours. She killed three people and left three others wounded before turning the gun on herself, authorities said. A source close to the investigation said Moseley was a disgruntled employee at the facility roughly 30 miles northeast of Baltimore. She showed up to work at her normal rime Moseley showed up for work at the warehouse, where she was a temporary employee, at her normal time Thursday morning. She opened fire outside the building and on the warehouse floor, then fatally shot herself in the head with the same 9 mm Glock pistol. Deputies were dispatched at 9:09 a.m., Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler said. Within five minutes, he said, deputies were at the scene, along with the FBI, state police, first responders and other law enforcement authorities. ""You can't have enough police, and you can't have them fast enough, Gahler said. The sheriff declined to release details about the six victims or the shooter, saying their next of kin are still being notified. Police are still searching for a motive, he added. Mother texted daughter when gunfire broke out When the gunfire erupted, Alexie Scharmann got a series of text messages from her mother. ""I love you... more than you'll ever know,"" said her mother, who works at the facility near Aberdeen. ""There's a shooter in the building. I'm hiding. I love you,"" she texted, according to CNN affiliate WBAL. ""Be good and take care of dad (and) the pets if something should happen."" Scharmann's mother survived the shooting, and sent her the text message she was hoping for at 10:33 a.m. ""I am outside and safe. I love you,"" it said. Shooter was a former security guard Moseley was once a security guard at the facility where the shooting occurred, a law enforcement official said. She used a gun that she purchased legally, Gahler said, adding that no law enforcement officers fired shots during their response. Rite Aid spokeswoman Susan Henderson said roughly 1,000 employees work at the distribution center, where products are received and processed for delivery. ""The shooting happened adjacent to the primary building,"" she said. Colleen Hendrickson lives and works in the area, and was waiting for the bus when the shooting started. ""I, of course, thought it was far off or, that's like down the road or something, right?"" she told CNN affiliate WJZ. ""No, it's right outside. It's right on the doorstep."" She saw emergency vehicles, ambulances and helicopters rush to the scene. ""It's really just usually very calm, and this is the most chaotic I've ever seen it,"" she told the station.

FRANCES ROBLES,"The case before the court stemmed from the 2013 killing of a mentally ill computer engineer who was walking down a street in Oakland Park, north of Fort Lauderdale. The man, Jermaine McBean, 33, had an air rifle slung across his shoulders. As he walked into the apartment complex where he lived, screaming to himself, witnesses called the police. Three Broward County sheriffs deputies responded and called for Mr. McBean to drop his weapon. But Mr. McBean, who the investigation showed was listening to music with earbuds, apparently did not hear them. Peter A. Peraza, the deputy charged in the case, claimed that Mr. McBean had turned and pointed the weapon at the officers, in the vicinity of children in a swimming pool, so he fired three shots, killing him. Witnesses said Mr. McBean never pointed the weapon, and the two other officers did not fire their weapons. Two years later, after a New York Times examination of the case, Mr. Peraza was indicted, becoming the first law enforcement officer to be charged in an on-duty killing in Florida in decades. In court, Mr. Peraza asked for Stand Your Ground protection. He won, but the state appealed. The Fourth District Court of Appeal upheld the ruling, but because the decision conflicted with a prior appellate ruling, the case went to the Florida Supreme Court. In that earlier case, in 2012, the Second District Court of Appeal had rejected an officers attempt to use the law to avoid trial for stomping on a 63-year-old man. The officer, Juan Caamano, a former police officer in Haines City, south of Orlando, instead went to trial, but was acquitted.",The Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the state’s Stand Your Ground law can be invoked as a defense by police officers accused of wrongful killings.,2018-12-14T02:54:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ Law Applies to Police, Too, Court Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/florida-stand-your-ground-police.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/14/us/14standyourground-alt/14standyourground-alt-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Complex fire,1
Dan Whitcomb,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A massive, out-of-control Northern California wildfire that destroyed 68 homes and forced thousands to flee has become the fifth largest in state history, officials said on Sunday, as crews battled high temperatures and strong winds. The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged near Ukiah, north of Sacramento, exploded by 25 percent overnight and had blackened nearly 400 square miles as of Sunday morning, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. “The Mendocino Complex Fire has charred more than 254,000 acres, making it the fifth largest blaze in California’s history,” AccuWeather said on its website. “Firefighters will continue to face local gusty winds and building heat this week.” The Mendocino is one of 17 major wildfires burning across California that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to declare a “major disaster” in the state, ordering federal funding to be made available to help recovery efforts. “Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property loses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,” the White House said in a written statement. The PG&amp;E Corporation said on Sunday that a 21-year-old apprentice lineman, Jay Ayeta, had been killed when his vehicle crashed in western Shasta County as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain to battle the nearly two-week-old Carr Fire. Ayeta was the seventh person to die in that blaze, which has scorched more than 154,000 acres in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento, including two young children and their great-grandmother whose home was overrun by flames, a resident who authorities said refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders, and two firefighters. Firefighters had managed to contain 41 percent of the Carr blaze by Sunday, and authorities were letting some evacuees return. This year, California wildfires have burned more land earlier in the fire season than usual, Cal Fire director Ken Pimlott said during a news conference on Saturday. “Fire season is really just beginning. What seems like we should be in the peak of fire season, historically, is really now the kind of conditions we’re seeing really at the beginning,” he said. Through last week, California fires had torched about 290,000 acres (117,300 hectares), more than double the five-year average over that same period, according to Cal Fire.

Laignee Barron,"Visiting a Siberian shopping mall where one of Russia’s deadliest fires took at least 64 lives, President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday blamed the tragedy on “ criminal negligence,” Reuters reports. Officials investigating the Kemerovo shopping mall fire have allegedly found numerous safety code violations at the shopping complex, including blocked exits and a malfunctioning fire alarm system. Shoppers were reportedly not even warned to evacuate by the mall’s security. As the blaze erupted along the top floors of the Winter Cherry mall on Sunday, dozens of children, some as young as five, were believed to be among those trapped in the inferno. It’s unclear how many are still missing, but unofficial lists include more than 20 children. Rescuers have struggled to recover bodies after the top floor collapsed and have said identifications may have to be done via DNA, according to Reuters. Putin arrived on the scene fresh off of his re-election victory last week, and laid wreathes at a makeshift memorial. “What’s happening here?” he asked. “This isn’t war, it’s not a spontaneous methane outburst. People came to relax, children. We’re talking about demography and losing so many people.” “Why? Because of some criminal negligence, because of slovenliness. How could this ever happen?” Putin added during a meeting with officials in Kemerovo, Reuters reports. According to a health minister, 13 people remain hospitalized. Officials have arrested four people in connection to the tragedy, including two employees of a firm that was supposed to service the mall’s fire alarm.",The Kemerovo shopping mall fire claimed at least 64 lives,2018-03-27T08:18:39Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Vladimir Putin Blames ‘Criminal Negligence’ for Shopping Mall Fire That Claimed at Least 64 lives,http://time.com/5216601/vladimir-putin-visits-kemerovo-shopping-mall-fire/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-938510368.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Complex fire,1
Scott Jennings,"Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor, is a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and former campaign adviser to Sen. Mitch McConnell. He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) EPA Chief Scott Pruitt's fate is up in the air after a series of ethics allegations began swirling in the media. The latest parlor game is guessing if and when Pruitt might get the ax from President Donald Trump, having committed the sin of bringing embarrassment to the administration. Pruitt, no stranger to controversy, is now under fire for his decision to rent a room in the nation's capital from the family of an energy lobbyist. Much of the Trump-Hating Industrial Complex has already tried and convicted Pruitt on cable TV panels, appointing themselves experts in someone else's living arrangements to demand Pruitt's sacking. What lurks beneath, though, is not a concern for ethics or thrifty travel budgets (they might want to check EPA directors under Obama before they tee off on travel), but rather adherence to liberal environmental policy that borders on religious conviction. Many on the left love government regulations and hate anyone who tears them down, as Pruitt has successfully done at EPA. Having failed to incite a national panic last week over the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the Trump haters have moved on this week to destroying Pruitt. There's a good chance they will fail at this, too. Why? Losing Pruitt would rob the Trump administration of an effective operator who has done more than most to make good on the President's campaign promises. Pruitt has been effective. Unlike David Shulkin, who was recently jettisoned from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Pruitt has actually enacted President Trump's agenda. He's a recognized conservative warrior, with the Washington Post reporting that ""allies praise Pruitt for returning more power to individual states while scaling back what they see as the previous administration's regulatory excesses."" Pruitt might be the most successful Trump cabinet member, delivering win after win to President Trump. The White House may not want another confirmation battle right now. With nominees for Secretary of State, CIA director and the VA all sure to face bruising and time-consuming confirmation battles, the bandwidth may not exist for Senate Republicans to take on another. If Democrats succeed in taking the scalp of someone who has been effective at dismantling Barack Obama's legacy, you can bet they would make confirming a replacement about as much fun as using a hornet's nest as a speed bag. Salvaging Pruitt makes more sense than engaging in battle over a replacement. Pruitt is becoming a martyr. The people at the controls of the liberal outrage machine don't care about rent; they are just hopping mad that he's dismantling Obama's anti-business regulatory regime. As my friend Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeted : ""Ironically, the media blood-lusting for Scott Pruitt is insulating him a bit by gradually turning him into a conservative cause. Going to be tougher than they think to run him out over cheap rent."" The louder the extreme left screams, the more Trump will consider it music to his ears. Pruitt has powerful allies. The former Oklahoma attorney general has earned high praise from many people who have the president's ear, like Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin. ""The job creators in America (and this governor, among others) are grateful to @EPAScottPruitt for his efforts, and look forward to many more years of his bold, transformational leadership....Ignore the nattering nabobs of negativism and keep marching,"" Bevin tweeted. Pruitt's work has garnered approval from leaders like Bevin who represent states and industries that were hammered by Obama-era EPA overreach. As Trump visits West Virginia today, CNN is reporting that while Trump isn't pleased with Pruitt, he's hearing from many people who feel that what Pruitt is doing at EPA is ""far more important than draining the swamp."" Bottom line, Trump understands his allies in coal country and other energy-rich states would be unhappy if Pruitt were given the boot. Pruitt has advantages other Trump administration castoffs didn't have. That doesn't make him completely safe, but it does give him the cover and time to rectify his issues. Liberal environmental activists will not stop clawing at Pruitt no matter how long he holds the job. They view decapitating Trump's EPA as vital to stopping the Republican anti-regulatory agenda, and they are hoping to gain ground if Democrats wrest control of one or both chambers in Congress in the midterm elections. The smart path forward is for Pruitt to fully answer all questions, atone for any mistakes, implement transparent systems to prevent even the appearance of ethical impropriety and continue plowing forward with the good job he's done in taming one of the most out-of-control, anti-growth bureaucracies in Washington.","EPA Chief Scott Pruitt's fate is up in the air after a series of ethics allegations began swirling in the media.

"Molly Olmstead, Molly Olmstead","Firefighters battle the Ranch Fire, part of the Mendocino Complex Fire, burning near Clearlake Oaks, California, on Sunday. A pair of fires tearing through the Lake, Colusa, and Mendocino counties in Northern California, known jointly as the Mendocino Complex Fire, became on Monday the largest wildfire ever recorded in California after burning through 283,000 acres in just 11 days. It topped a record established just eight months ago by the Thomas Fire, which consumed roughly 282,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The Thomas Fire raged uncontrolled for about five weeks and destroyed about 1,000 homes and buildings. The Mendocino Complex Fire, on the other hand, has mostly burned forested land and only destroyed about 140 structures. But it is moving fast, fed by extreme heat and hazardous winds scouring the brittle dry land. It was only 30 percent contained by Monday night, according to Cal Fire. The Mendocino Complex Fire—actually a combination of the Ranch and River fires that broke out within an hour of each other and just a few miles apart and considered a single fire by officials—is one of a dozen wildfires across the state. The most dangerous in recent days has been the Carr fire in Redding, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes and caused the deaths of seven people. The fire is beginning to slow, however, and was at nearly 50 percent contained Monday night, according to Cal Fire. Some 14,000 firefighters are battling fires around the state, according to the Los Angeles Times, and smoke and triple-digit temperatures are plaguing large sections of the state. The past year has been a devastating one for California, as thousands of homes were destroyed and more than 40 people killed in wine country in October. The Thomas fire broke out not too long after and was followed in late June by the most recent outbreak of wildfires. Four of the five largest wildfires in California’s modern history have occurred since 2012, according to the Times. It is still the middle of fire season, and the worst fires often break out later in the year.","A pair of fires tearing through the Lake, Colusa, and Mendocino counties in Northern California, known jointly as the Mendocino Complex Fire, became on Monday the largest wildfire ever recorded in California after burning through 283,000 acres in just 11 days.",2018-08-07T14:17:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",The Mendocino Complex Fire Is Now The Largest in California History,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/08/mendocino-complex-fire-becomes-largest-in-california-history.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/496d11be-5971-4c35-bd6b-9d0e49cc211b.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=5464x3643&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,Complex fire,1

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Ms. Mahoney, 25, was eight months pregnant when Irma ripped away their doors and windows, allowing the blast of rain into their old apartment. It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside, and left it running for hours, she said; two weeks later, Maria turned the hose on again. They have replaced or boarded over the openings, but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch,” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold, greenish and bluish, coming out of the walls.” Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment, in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community, shifted in one of the storms, so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire, and with no refrigeration, they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands, mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage, and like many people, Ms. Mahoney, unable to close her home to the elements, worries about a disease outbreak. Now, she has an added worry, an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin, born in a hospital on Oct. 19. The baby’s arrival helped persuade the parents that they had to move, Ms. Mahoney said, “because it’s not sanitary.” But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls, so that their furniture literally blew away. With many homes destroyed, their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex, a public housing project — but that is as it should be, Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery, but to her surprise, it runs. She used to work at a hotel, but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks, roads were cleared and some cell service returned, so her husband, a painter, was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects. “It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress,” she said. “But it’s still such a long, long way to go.” _____ Continue reading the main story","More than two months after the disaster on the U.S. Virgin Islands began, we checked back on some spots that we visited and photographed not long after the storms hit.",2017-11-10T10:00:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",After Irma and Maria: How 3 Spots on the U.S. Virgin Islands Are Faring,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/virgin-islands-hurricanes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/00USVI-top2/00USVI-top2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Complex fire,1
"Associated Press, Associated Press","Flames leap above a vehicle on High Valley Rd. as the Ranch Fire, part of the Mendocino Complex Fire, burns near Clearlake Oaks, Calif., on Aug. 5, 2018. (Photo: NOAH BERGER, AFP/Getty Images) LAKEPORT, Calif. – Twin Northern California blazes fueled by dry vegetation and hot, windy weather grew Monday to become the largest wildfire in state history, becoming the norm as climate change makes the fire season longer and more severe. The two fires burning a few miles apart and known as the Mendocino Complex are being treated as one incident. It has scorched 283,800 acres (443.4 square miles or 1,148.4 square kilometers), fire officials said Monday. The fires, north of San Francisco, have burned 75 homes and is only 30 percent contained. The size of the fires surpasses a blaze last December in Southern California that burned 281,893 acres (440.5 square miles or 1,140.8 kilometers). It killed two people, including a firefighter, and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings before being fully contained on Jan. 12. Hotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts say. But they also blame cities and towns that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling over a dozen major blazes throughout California, state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said. “I can remember a couple of years ago when we saw 10 to 12,000 firefighters in the states of California, Oregon and Washington and never the 14,000 we see now,” he said. Crews did make progress over the weekend against one of the two blazes in the Mendocino Complex with help from water-dropping aircraft, Cal Fire operations chief Charlie Blankenheim said in a video on Facebook. But the other one is growing after spreading into the Mendocino National Forest. More: California firefighters battle an enemy they can't beat Related: Amid 'apocalyptic' Carr Fire, local newspaper informs Redding community The complex of fire has been less destructive to property than some of the other wildfires in the state because it is mostly raging in remote areas. But officials say the twin fires threaten 11,300 buildings and some new evacuations were ordered over the weekend as the flames spread. Farther north, crews gained ground against a deadly blaze that has destroyed more than 1,000 homes in and around Redding. It was nearly halfway contained, Cal Fire said. The wildfire about 225 miles (360 kilometers) north of San Francisco started more than two weeks ago by sparks from the steel wheel of a towed-trailer’s flat tire. It killed two firefighters and four residents and displaced more than 38,000 people. Officials began allowing some residents to return to their neighborhoods. But tens of thousands of others were still evacuated. The fires in Northern California have created such a haze of smoke in the Central Valley that Sacramento County health officials advised residents to avoid outdoor activities for the entire week. Another blaze that ignited last week has damaged a historic Northern California resort in the Stanislaus National Forest. The nearly century-old Dardanelle Resort has sustained massive structural damage, though the details were unclear, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported. The rustic lodge 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of San Francisco is nestled in the Sierra Nevada mountains and offers cabin and motel rentals along with RV sites, a store and restaurant. The U.S. Forest Service reported that the fire crossed a highway Sunday evening, forcing crews to retreat from the fire’s edge. The resort owners said in a Facebook post that “at this point it has been confirmed that there is ‘massive structural damage.’ We are heartbroken and struggling with this news.” Last Slide Next Slide Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ngtgVp","The Mendocino Complex fire, fueled by dry vegetation and hot, windy weather grew to become the largest wildfire in state history, authorities said on Monday.",2018-08-07T03:14:19Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}","Mendocino Complex fire becomes California's largest wildfire in history, authorities say",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/08/06/mendocino-complex-fire-california-history/920994002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d0ad201236043dcd2888763b668715aac5c3483/c=0-445-4343-2899/local/-/media/2018/08/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636691794654093397-axx-wildfire-0807.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop,usa-today,USA Today,Complex fire,1
Associated Press,"LAKEPORT, Calif. – Jack Hattendorf steers his road grader back and forth across a dirt path cutting through blackened earth. With each pass, he smooths and tamps down the soil to remake a dirt road that fire crews tore apart days earlier to stop flames that would become part of the largest wildfire on record in California. Even as flames chew through forestland nearby, Hattendorf and others are working to repair the damage caused not by flames but by firefighters trying to stop them. They seek to restore private lands, protect the environment and water supply, and prevent erosion that can lead to mudslides like the one that tour though a community outside Santa Barbara in January, killing nearly two dozen people. ""Suppression repair"" begins almost as soon as the fire moves through and the ground cools off — a massive but often overlooked part of firefighting. ""We just follow behind when it's all done and controlled and fix everything that we can,"" said Tim Meyers, a forester for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection who is overseeing suppression repair at the twin fires known as the Mendocino Complex. Crews control wildland blazes by corralling them inside containment lines, built as quickly as possible by bulldozers and hand tools to clear flammable brush and slow or stop the spread of fire by eliminating its fuel. When the fire is extinguished in one area, a team with an array of heavy equipment goes in looking for things to repair. They replace barbed-wire cattle fences, gates and crushed culverts; smooth out dirt roads torn apart by heavy equipment; flatten the berms created by bulldozers and put hiking trails back in shape. When necessary, they work with Native American tribes to repair damage to archaeological sites or clean the pink liquid that suppresses flames out of waterways. If there's something they can't fix — say, a bulldozer plowed through an ornate gate outside someone's driveway — the property owner can file a claim for compensation. One day late last week, 19 bulldozers, four road graders, six excavators and about a dozen water tenders were assigned to make repairs at the Mendocino Complex Fire, Meyers said. Suppression repair is mainly led by foresters and other Cal Fire officials with a background in managing natural resources. They also train seasonal and permanent firefighters, Meyers said, and get help from dozens of contractors operating heavy equipment. ""Some of it's not as glamorous as the firefighting, but it's just as needed,"" Meyers said. Dawn Bodley didn't mind that bulldozers carved a containment line through her backyard. The fire swept through her property, but thanks to firefighters who stayed and fought, her home and garden were spared. ""I think those are special people,"" said Bodley, 62, who lives on a former ranch outside the city of Lakeport. ""I don't know how they do it. They run into fire to protect other people's property, not even their own."" Not everyone is pleased with how the firefighters went about their work. One rancher said bulldozers tore apart grazing land and knocked over trees with no apparent strategy. The rancher who refused to give his name because he didn't want to be identified criticizing firefighters said the repair crews have done good work, which he appreciates, but was irritated so much damage was done in the first place. Full containment of the largest-ever California wildfire that's burning about 120 miles (264 kilometers) north of San Francisco still is weeks away, but suppression work is in full gear and could last months. Among the most important tasks: building dirt humps across bulldozer scars to direct water away from the bare, dusty path. That prevents sediment from clouding streams and rivers, which is harmful to endangered fish. It also helps to control erosion — a serious concern after fire wipes out the vegetation that holds soils together. The mudslides that buried parts of the wealthy community of Montecito in January were triggered by rainfall that came quickly after the fire and before suppression repairs were done. The work can't prevent that kind of erosion, Meyers said, but it might slow it down. With California facing larger and more destructive wildfires because of heat and drought blamed on climate change, repair work is beginning earlier to ensure more manpower and equipment are available, he said. Keith and Melissa Barnhart, who manage a mobile home park that firefighters used as a base, said they were impressed with how well the crews cleaned up. The main evidence of the effort is pink liquid dropped by planes to slow flames that coats the trailers and buildings. ""It's pink, but we're happy,"" Keith Barnhart said. ""We'd rather see pink than black.""","Fox News Firefighting mars the earth.

Adam Clark Estes,"It looks like we may have a winner in America’s great internet space race. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just authorized SpaceX to launch its broadband satellite service, Starlink. That means Americans could be accessing the internet from space as early as 2019. We’ll literally just be pointing our phones at the sky and going online. Just kidding, you don’t actually have to point your phone at the sky to enjoy space internet. The Starlink service will work a lot like wi-fi, except instead of needing to find a hot spot, entire sections of the country could get internet access. The proposed system will include 4,425 low-orbit satellites that will beam connectivity with frequencies in the Ka and Ku bands. It actually works exactly like the wireless service on many airplanes, except SpaceX promises fiber-fast speeds. The system is expected to go online next year, after SpaceX gets at least 800 satellites in orbit. “We appreciate the FCC’s thorough review and approval of SpaceX’s constellation license,” said Gwynne Shotwell, President and Chief Operating Officer at SpaceX. “Although we still have much to do with this complex undertaking, this is an important step toward SpaceX building a next-generation satellite network that can link the globe with reliable and affordable broadband service, especially reaching those who are not yet connected.” Even though everybody loves fast wi-fi, Shotwell really highlights what’s most exciting about this new space internet. It’s going to make connectivity possible in places that might not even get dialup service. According to the FCC, some 34.5 million Americans don’t have access to fixed and mobile broadband where they live. This includes rural areas as well as parts of cities that have been neglected by the Comcasts and Charters of the world. Starlink also stands to increase competition in the historically monopoly-driven internet business. After all, the majority of Americans only have one choice for an internet provider. The new SpaceX system could fix this. Of course, all of this is somewhat speculative. We know that space internet is a thing that can work. It is also, however, a very futuristic undertaking that’s practically without precedent. Will Starlink be as fast as SpaceX says it will be? Will it reach all the people who need it? We’ll have to wait until Elon Musk and friends fire a few more rockets into the heavens to find out. [ CNBC ]","It looks like we may have a winner in America’s great internet space race.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / Cal Fire firefighters monitor a back fire while battling the Medocino Complex fire on August 7, 2018 near Lodoga, California. reader comments 0 Verizon officials were contrite and apologetic during a California State Assembly committee hearing that was convened Friday to examine mobile Internet throttling experienced by firefighters during recent blazes. ""We all make mistakes from time to time, the true measure of leadership is how soon we admit it, own it,"" Rudy Reyes told the Select Committee on Natural Disaster, Response, Recovery, and Rebuilding after reading from a statement that the company released hours earlier. In that statement, Verizon said it would be introducing a ""new plan"" with truly unlimited data and ""priority access"" for first responders nationwide. ""As of yesterday, we removed all speed cap restrictions for first responders on the west coast and in Hawaii to support current firefighting and Hurricane Lane efforts,"" the company said. ""Further, in the event of another disaster, Verizon will lift restrictions on public safety customers, providing full network access."" The executives spoke shortly after hearing from Santa Clara County Fire Chief Tony Bowden who said that his agency had experienced similar throttling in December 2017. The Santa Clara department had tried to address it with the Verizon accounts manager at the time. However, more recently, when county fire officials were responding to the Mendocino Complex fire (which is still ongoing) and the agency had its bandwidth substantially reduced on a mobile command center before the caps were briefly lifted, it was hit with throttling yet again. This problem is best illustrated in a June 2018 email from Captain Justin Stockman to Deputy Chief Steve Prziborowski, which was made public recently in a federal court filing. In that message, Stockman explained throttling as being when ""the device that can normally act like a modern broadband internet connection is slowed to the point of acting more like an AOL dial up modem from 1995."" He continued: This is not the first time we have had this issue. In December of 2017 while deployed to the Prado Mobilization Center supporting a series of large wildfires we had the same device with the same sim card also throttled. I was able to work through Eric Prosser at the time to have service to the device restored and Eric communicated that Verizon had properly re-categorized the device as truly ""unlimited"". In the email below Verizon is stating that they can restore the device for an extra $2/month. I obviously lack the authority to make such an approval. If we could get Verizon that approval I would appreciate it. During the Friday hearing, Bowden specifically said that his staff was still unable to reach this accounts manager, and they had to call the ordinary customer support line. So, rather than wait for Verizon to get its act together, he said, they came up with an alternative. ""We overnight shipped another unit’s cards and were able to get that up and running by the next day,"" he said. ""They are continually able to use that redundant device today."" Later, he expressed his polite frustration to Verizon officials, who were in the room. ""I can tell you how to run a fire department, but I can’t tell you how to run an Internet service provider,"" he said. Reyes also reiterated the company’s position that this throttling had nothing to do with net neutrality—he emphasized that net neutrality had to do with content prioritization or de-prioritization, not data caps. ""We’ve made it clear that we do not do that, that the industry does not do that,"" he said. ""This situation is not that."" In court filings, Santa Clara County officials have previously disputed that assertion. As Ars reported previously, Santa Clara County and the Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District are among two dozen local or state government agencies that sued the Federal Communications Commission in a bid to overturn the repeal of net neutrality rules that outlawed throttling and blocking. Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara fire department was described in detail in court documents filed as evidence in the case. No other mobile providers agreed to testify before the Natural Disaster Committee.","Firefighters don't like their mobile hotspots slowed to a ""dial up modem from 1995.""",2018-08-24T20:36:06Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Verizon tries to douse criticism, touts “priority access” for first responders",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-tries-to-douse-criticism-touts-priority-access-for-first-responders/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-1013042908-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,Complex fire,1
Briana Harper,"CINCINNATI – Charles Adams went on a rampage before he died in police custody Wednesday, acting wildly and damaging residents’ property at a Westwood apartment complex, according to a resident and 911 callers. ""It was bizarre, so bizarre,"" India Lavender told Scripps station WCPO in Cincinnati. Lavender said the 36-year-old Adams jumped on her car and then jumped into her neighbor’s window. ""(Somebody) came and knocked on my door and told me there was a man standing on top of my car,"" Lavender said. “I came out. He yelled at me and told me to call the police, somebody was chasing him, and he literally jumped off my car into my neighbor's window."" Adams damaged at least five others cars while calling out for help as he went along, residents said. “It definitely seemed as if he was hallucinating,” Lavender said. “In his mind, someone really was chasing him, 'cause he was trying to get everyone else in the building to see the other people that weren’t there."" Body camera video of Adams' arrest shows him becoming increasingly lethargic and unresponsive after officers put him in handcuffs. At one point, while standing, he slumps forward until he is nearly bent double. When officers escort him outside and allow him to sit down against a railing, he begins to drool and twitch before losing consciousness. ""Jeez,"" one officer says in the recording. ""He's foaming at the mouth."" His breathing stopped shortly after his eyes closed. The fire department gave Adams first aid, including CPR, but he died on the scene. It’s unclear what brought Adams to the apartment complex. Neighbors said they had never seen him. ""Officers did not use any type of force to subdue Mr. Adams during the arrest activity,"" Lt. Stephen Saunders, Cincinnati police public information officer, said in the statement. The body camera footage reflects this assertion. READ the police statement here or below. Police documents released Thursday said District 3 officers responded to 911 calls about a man “exhibiting bizarre behaviors.” Adams responded to officer's verbal commands and he was placed in custody after they encountered him outside the Western Glen Apartments at 2627 Montana Ave., about 7:36 p.m., according to the police statement. Officers observed a small amount of blood from lacerations on Adams’ hands that occurred prior to their contact and immediately requested assistance from the fire department for medical aid, Saunders said. This remains an active investigation and more details will be release when available, Saunders said.","ABC15 Arizona Ohio man who died after arrest had jumped on cars, through window, resident says ABC15 Arizona CINCINNATI – Charles Adams went on a rampage before he died in police custody Wednesday, acting wildly and damaging residents' property at a Westwood …",2018-04-06T12:20:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abc15.com'}","Ohio man who died after arrest had jumped on cars, through window, resident says - ABC15 Arizona",https://www.abc15.com/news/national/ohio-man-who-died-after-arrest-had-jumped-on-cars-through-window-resident-says,https://sharing.abc15.com/sharewcpo/photo/2018/04/06/poster_eed17b2c094040b79d1dd14ba9fba20c_83061143_ver1.0_640_480.jpg,,Abc15.com,Complex fire,1

Nine inmates were killed and 14 injured during the unrest at a prison in the central state of Goias. Stephan de Souza Vieira, 34, was seized a luxury flat in the state of Rio de Janeiro. He had been on the run from the jail since November. He is a leader of the Red Command criminal gang with drug interests across Brazil, police say. Vieira, also known as BH, had been serving a 26-year sentence for drug trafficking when he escaped from the Aparecida de Goiania jail. Police say that he controlled gang inmates from outside the prison and gave orders for armed members to start the riot.

Sarah Perez,"You don’t need a TV to tune into live coverage of the U.S. elections results today – and you don’t have to have Hulu or another live TV streaming service, either. YouTube announced today a list of news organizations that will be broadcasting live elections coverage on its site today – helpful for those who don’t have another way to watch at home, or need to tune in while on the go. There’s also live coverage available on other sites, including Facebook, Twitch, Twitter, and elsewhere. As more people cut the cord with traditional pay TV, YouTube’s reach has been growing when it comes to distributing the news. That’s apparent in the list of available news media organizations who have decided to broadcast live to YouTube tonight. For comparison’s sake, YouTube in 2016 reported viewers had spent over 20 million hours watching and rewatching the presidential debates on the site ahead of the U.S. elections. It then pointed viewers to live coverage from a handful of outlets like NBC, PBS, Bloomberg and Telemundo, as well as MTV, the online news show The Young Turks, and an election special from Complex News. This time around, all the major broadcast networks are participating on YouTube’s platform. The company says viewers can tune in to watch live election results throughout the evening on the following channels: Several outlets are choosing to broadcast on Facebook, too, including ABC News Live, CBS News, and PBS News Hour. The Washington Post will broadcast on Twitch. On Twitter, ABC, PBS, and Univision will live stream election coverage, says Poynter. Snapchat will feature Washington Post in the Snapchat Discover section, NBC’s “Stay Tuned” news stories (these are on IG, too), and will offer live Election Day coverage itself starting at 6 PM ET, hosted by “Good Luck America’s” Peter Hamby. In addition to YouTube, CBS will live stream coverage on its free streaming news service, CBSN, which is also available through its streaming service, CBS All Access. And ABC is covering all the bases, with commercial-free streams from ABC News Live across Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Apple News and its own site, as well as on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. Yahoo News (disclosure: also owned by Verizon, TechCrunch’s parent) will live stream on Yahoo.com, AOL.com, HuffPost and Tumblr. Apple News will have an elections hub, including live streams. And Poynter’s handy resource also includes other places to get the news directly from media companies’ own websites and elsewhere, including The New York Times, CNN, Fox News, FiveThirtyEight, Telemundo, Newsy, and more.","You don’t need a TV to tune into live coverage of the U.S. elections results today – and you don’t have to have Hulu or another live TV streaming service, either.

Colin Dwyer,"It was just after 7:30 p.m., on July 26, that dispatchers heard Jeremy Stoke's mayday call. The fire inspector had been in his pickup heading to evacuate a neighborhood in northwest Redding, Calif., when he was trapped by the blaze himself. Only silence answered the dispatchers' replies. They found Stoke's body the next day. Now, three weeks later, California officials have explained what happened the night Stoke died in the Carr Fire, which was then just days old. And they have identified his unsettling killer: a tornado of flame, the likes of which the state had never seen before. The behemoth that fire officials describe almost beggars the imagination — but they have video proof, from multiple angles. The footage below was shot from a helicopter. The videos were included in a report released earlier this week by California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. In the report, officials describe a ""large fire tornado"" that had formed on the strength of suddenly gusting winds. It had a base wider than three football fields end to end, according to the report, and winds that whipped as fast as 165 mph. Measured on the standard Enhanced Fujita scale, it had the strength of an EF3 tornado. According to National Weather Service data, few tornadoes in California history are known to have reached that high on the scale — and among those that did, none came close to the sheer width of what Cal Fire says ravaged Northern California. That's not to mention the heat: Inside the cyclone of fire, authorities believe temperatures surpassed 2,700 degrees F — in other words, hotter than volcanic magma. Video recorded from the dash of an emergency vehicle reveals the blinding orange phenomenon consuming the horizon. ""Regardless of the primary factors that caused the fire tornado, the resultant fire behavior was unpredictable and unusual,"" the report said. ""It surprised many highly experienced firefighters."" That includes firefighter Jeremy Stoke, 37, a longtime veteran of the fire service who reportedly cut his vacation short to volunteer for the efforts fighting the Carr Fire. ""It's not something that I have ever received training to look out for. It could've been any of us,"" Redding Fire Marshal Craig Wittner told local media. ""It was something out of this world, a perfect storm,"" Stoke's stepfather, Gary Parmely, told The Associated Press. ""It was incompatible with life, and he happened to drive into it."" Elsewhere that night, the Carr Fire claimed the life of another firefighter, a bulldozer operator who was caught in the blaze's rapid escalation. To date eight people have died in the wildfire or complications related to it, according to member station KQED. And it continues to burn. The Carr Fire has consumed more than 218,000 acres, making it the eighth-largest fire in state history — for now. With the blaze just 75 percent contained, it is likely to claim a higher position in the state's record books before long. As NPR's Camila Domonoske pointed out, four of the largest fires have occurred in the past six years, an accelerating pace that experts link with climate change. The state's largest-ever wildfire, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn in its own right. At more than 375,000 acres, the blaze has ravaged an area larger than Los Angeles — and its largest branch stands roughly 25 percent from full containment.","California authorities say the behemoth killed a firefighter battling the Carr Fire last month.

Reuters,"An air tanker drops fire retardant to slow the spread of the River Fire (Mendocino Complex) near Lakeport, California, U.S. August 1, 2018. REUTERS/Fred Greaves REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - Weary firefighters in Northern California were outflanking a deadly, 10-day-old blaze on Wednesday that has destroyed over 1,000 homes as authorities reopened more evacuated neighborhoods and the last few people listed as missing were found alive. Aided for a third straight day by diminished winds, ground crews extended buffer lines carved out of thick, dry brush along the fire's edge to 35 percent of its perimeter, with partial containment lines continuing even farther, officials said. That marked a substantial improvement from the weekend, when the Carr Fire raged mostly unchecked after laying waste to neighborhoods in and around Redding, a city of 90,000 people about 160 miles (257 km) north of the state capital, Sacramento. Having scorched more than 121,000 acres (48,967 hectares), an area larger than New Orleans, the blaze was the biggest of 16 major wildfires burning throughout California and the most formidable of more than 90 across 13 Western states from Texas to Alaska. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) commanders said the Carr Fire, sparked by a vehicle on July 23, was burning with far less intensity this week and posed little immediate threat to populated areas. ""We are making good progress on the fire,"" CalFire Deputy Chief Bret Gouvea told reporters at a mostly upbeat news briefing in Redding. Crews ""still have quite a bit of work to do"" to shore up containment lines, he said. A status update issued hours later said a ""fire weather watch"" would go into effect for Thursday evening through Saturday, with increasing winds in the forecast. Strong gusts kicking up along the upper ridge lines on Wednesday night were a cause for concern on the fire's rugged western flanks, a few miles from the town of Lewiston, which remained evacuated. Elsewhere, fire authorities, utility crews and police were stepping up efforts to remove hazards such as downed power lines and ruptured gas lines to allow evacuees to return as quickly as possible to areas no longer threatened. ""Repopulation is the theme,"" Gouvea said. Firefighters rest between fire engines during a break from fighting the Ranch Fire and the River Fire (Mendocino Complex) in Upper Lake, California, U.S. August 1, 2018. REUTERS/Fred Greaves Redding Police Chief Roger Moore, who lost his own home in the fire, said social workers and clergy would be on hand to lend support to distressed residents. ""We recognize that as people enter back into their neighborhoods, they're going to know people, family members and neighbors that have lost homes,"" Moore said. ""It's a very emotional period. It takes a toll on people."" As many as 38,000 residents were under evacuation orders at the height of the fire late last week. CalFire director Ken Pimlott said more than 32,000 remained displaced by various fires up and down the state. In another sign the crisis in Redding was ebbing, law enforcement officials said the last four people reported as missing among a list of 20 whose names were published on Tuesday were located safe and sound on Wednesday. Six people were killed in the Carr Fire, including two firefighters, two children who perished with their grandmother in a house that burned, and a man who defied an evacuation order to stay put in another home that was consumed by the fire. Property losses so far have been put at 1,546 structures, including 1,0580 homes, making the Carr Fire the sixth most destructive in California's history. Most of the devastation occurred on the night of July 26, when gale-force winds whipped the blaze into a flaming cyclone that jumped the Sacramento River and roared with little warning into Redding and adjacent towns in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region. The inferno swiftly engulfed everything in its path as residents fled for their lives, many with only their pets and a few belongings. At a separate news conference on Wednesday, Governor Jerry Brown said the Carr Fire typified a ""new normal"" authorities are encountering, as large, extremely intense and swiftly spreading wildfires occur more often over a longer fire season. Fire officials said such blazes had been fueled by several years of drought-dessicated vegetation, and stoked by frequent and persistent bouts of erratic winds and triple-digit temperatures. Brown said the trend would likely worsen if forecasts by climate scientists come to pass. ""We're in for a really rough ride, and it's going to get expensive, it's going to get dangerous,"" Brown said.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately. Oklahoma — a state synonymous with tornadoes — didn't have a single twisters through April 30, a new record. Instead, states from Texas north to Nebraska have been dealing with dust storms and sprawling, fast-moving grass fires as unusually dry weather has taken its toll on the region. That tornado and precipitation drought changes on Tuesday, as a complex series of storm systems unleashes several rounds of severe thunderstorms across the region. SEE ALSO: Epic deluge in Hawaii may have broken all-time U.S. rainfall record, with 4 feet in 24 hours The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) — the arm of the National Weather Service responsible for issuing severe thunderstorm outlooks — issued a ""moderate risk"" outlook for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday. In the outlook, the SPC highlighted a small area of Kansas at greatest risk of storms that could bring large hail, damaging winds, and a few potentially strong tornadoes. Plot of annual tornado count, adjusted to remove overcounting from multiple sightings of the same tornado. 2018 is in black. Image: noaa spc. ""Tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong, very large hail, and damaging winds will be possible,"" the SPC stated on its website. Severe thunderstorms are also expected to flare up in Nebraska and Iowa on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Other areas, outside of Kansas, are also at risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday, even if forecaster confidence is lower. These places include Texas and Oklahoma, northward into Iowa. One limiting factor for storms, and a forecasting wild card, is the recent dryness that has contributed to the dire fire weather conditions in the past several weeks. Fires singed more than 350,000 acres in Oklahoma, killing more than 1,000 cattle. Fires are still burning in Oklahoma and Kansas today, at the same time the atmosphere is threatening to unleash a totally different type of hazard. While moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has flowed northward into the heart of what is commonly referred to as ""Tornado Alley,"" the dryness of soils in these states could act to inhibit the formation of severe storms. The threat of severe weather will ramp up on Wednesday and linger into Thursday as a series of storms dives into the Southwest, and moves across the Plains and Midwest. By Friday, it's quite possible that Oklahoma will have recorded its first tornado of the season. While tornado season usually peaks during the next few weeks, the same weather pattern responsible for the extraordinarily chilly April across much of the U.S. helped put a lid on severe storm activity up until now. Mother Nature has a lot of catching up to do if the season is going to turn out to be close to average.","The weather in the Plains states has been anything but normal lately.

David Pescovitz,"When fire ants dig out a new nest underground, a small number are actually doing most of the work while the rest dilly-dally. Apparently this is actually an effective division of labor because it prevents the insects from getting in each other's way. Now, Georgia Tech researchers suggest this approach could be help future robot swarms be more efficient in cramped areas like collapsed buildings or construction sites. From Science News : (Physicist Daniel) Goldman’s team created computer simulations of two ant colonies digging tunnels. In one, the virtual ants mimicked the real insects’ unequal work split; in the other, all the ants pitched in equally. The colony with fewer heavy lifters was better at keeping tunnel traffic moving; in three hours, that colony dug a tunnel that was about three times longer than the group of ants that all did their fair share. Goldman’s team then tested the fire ants’ teamwork strategy on autonomous robots. These robots trundled back and forth along a narrow track, scooping up plastic balls at one end and dumping them at the other. Programming the robots to do equal work is “not so bad when you have two or three,” Goldman says, “but when you get four in that little narrow tunnel, forget about it.” The four-bot fleet tended to get stuck in pileups. Programming the robots to share the workload unequally helped avoid these smashups and move material 35 percent faster, the researchers found.

Associated Press,"(LAKEPORT, Calif.) — Twin Northern California blazes fueled by dry vegetation and hot, windy weather grew Monday to become the largest wildfire in state history, becoming the norm as climate change makes the fire season longer and more severe. The two fires burning a few miles apart and known as the Mendocino Complex are being treated as one incident. It has scorched 283,800 acres, fire officials said Monday. The fires, north of San Francisco, have burned 75 homes and is only 30% contained. The size of the fires surpasses a blaze last December in Southern California that burned 281,893 acres. It killed two people, including a firefighter, and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings before being fully contained on Jan. 12. Hotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts say. But they also blame cities and towns that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling over a dozen major blazes throughout California, state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said. Authorities have evacuated cabins in two communities in the Santa Ana Mountains in Orange County because of a fast-moving wildfire. Firefighters are attacking the fast-moving Holy Fire with a DC-10 air tanker and helicopters. “I can remember a couple of years ago when we saw 10 to 12,000 firefighters in the states of California, Oregon and Washington and never the 14,000 we see now,” he said. Crews did make progress over the weekend against one of the two blazes in the Mendocino Complex with help from water-dropping aircraft, Cal Fire operations chief Charlie Blankenheim said in a video on Facebook. But the other one is growing after spreading into the Mendocino National Forest. The complex of fire has been less destructive to property than some of the other wildfires in the state because it is mostly raging in remote areas. But officials say the twin fires threaten 11,300 buildings and some new evacuations were ordered over the weekend as the flames spread. Farther north, crews gained ground against a deadly blaze that has destroyed more than 1,000 homes in and around Redding. It was nearly halfway contained, Cal Fire said. The wildfire about 225 miles north of San Francisco started more than two weeks ago by sparks from the steel wheel of a towed-trailer’s flat tire. It killed two firefighters and four residents and displaced more than 38,000 people. Officials began allowing some residents to return to their neighborhoods. But tens of thousands of others were still evacuated. The fires in Northern California have created such a haze of smoke in the Central Valley that Sacramento County health officials advised residents to avoid outdoor activities for the entire week. Another blaze that ignited last week has damaged a historic Northern California resort in the Stanislaus National Forest. The nearly century-old Dardanelle Resort has sustained massive structural damage, though the details were unclear, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported.

"AP, Peter Prengaman, AP","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A fire tore through the sprawling training complex of one of Brazil’s biggest soccer clubs, killing 10 people and leaving three injured teenagers in Rio de Janeiro, firefighters said.
Brazilian firefighters were called in just after 5 a.m. Friday to battle a blaze at the Ninho de Urubu training ground of the Flamengo soccer club in the city’s western region, a fire official told The Associated Press.
There was no word yet on the cause of the fire.
The ages and identities of those killed were not released but the three injured were 14, 15 and 16 years old, the fire official said. The injured were taken to local hospitals and their conditions were not immediately known, said the official, who asked his name not be used due to his agency’s rules.

Associated Press,"LAKE ELSINORE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 8 a.m. A Southern California wildfire that has been raging for several days south of Los Angeles is now 29 percent contained. Officials said the Holy Fire in Cleveland National Forest had grown by Saturday morning to nearly 33 square miles (85 sq. kilometers). Earlier this week, the fire had threatened homes in Lake Elsinore and nearby communities. Aircraft have been making flight after flight, dumping water and bright pink retardant to protect the foothill communities as the fire sweeps through the dense, bone-dry brush. The man suspected of setting the blaze, 51-year-old Forrest Clark, appeared in court Friday, but his arraignment was postponed. Clark made several outbursts, claiming his life was being threatened and said the arson charge against him was a lie. He's being held on $1 million bail. ___ 11 p.m. (Friday) Crews are working furiously to keep a Southern California wildfire from burning more homes south of Los Angeles while firefighters in the north have finally gained ground against major blazes. The so-called Holy Fire in the Cleveland National Forest was threatening thousands of homes in Lake Elsinore and nearby communities after growing by Friday night to nearly 30 square miles (77 square kilometers). The fire grew a bit Friday after nearly doubling in size overnight. But firefighters also made progress, with containment doubling from 5 to 10 percent. Gusty winds continued to drive the flames but were expected to ease off overnight before blowing up again Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile north of San Francisco, the Mendocino Complex — the largest recorded fire in California history — is 60 percent contained.","Fox News The Latest: Containment grows for California wildfire Fox News LAKE ELSINORE, Calif. – The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):. 8 a.m..

Reuters,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is moving ahead with plans to revise safety rules that bar fully self-driving cars from the roads without equipment like steering wheels, pedals and mirrors, according to a document seen by Reuters. The auto safety agency, known as NHTSA, ""intends to reconsider the necessity and appropriateness of its current safety standards"" as applied to automated vehicles, the U.S. Transportation Department said in an 80-page update of its principles dubbed ""Automated Vehicles 3.0"" being made public on Thursday. The department disclosed that in an upcoming rulemaking NHTSA wants public comment ""on proposed changes to particular safety standards to accommodate automated vehicle technologies and the possibility of setting exceptions to certain standards—that are relevant only when human drivers are present"" for autonomous vehicles. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who will release the report at event at the department's headquarters on Thursday, said in the report self-driving cars have the potential to dramatically reduce traffic crashes and road deaths, but added the ""public has legitimate concerns about the safety, security, and privacy of automated technology."" Automakers must currently meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. General Motors in January filed a petition seeking an exemption for the current rules to deploy vehicles without steering wheels and other human controls as part of a ride-sharing fleet it plans to deploy in 2019. NHTSA has not declared the GM petition complete, a step necessary before it can rule on the merits. NHTSA said it plans to propose modernizing procedures to follow when reviewing exemption petitions. Alphabet's Waymo unit plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service for the general public with no human driver behind the steering wheel in Arizona later this year. But unlike GM, Waymo's vehicles will have human controls for the time being. In March, a self-driving Uber Technologies vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian, while the backup safety driver was watching a video, police said. Uber suspended testing in the aftermath and some safety advocates said the crash showed the system was not safe enough to be tested on public roads. Safety standards The stepped up regulatory focus by NHTSA comes as legislation in Congress to speed self-driving cars, which passed the U.S. House in 2017, has stalled and has only an outside chance of getting approved this year, congressional aides say. The report said ""NHTSA's current statutory authority to establish motor vehicle safety standards is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the design and performance of different"" automated vehicles. But automakers have warned it could take too long for NHTSA to rewrite the rules to allow for the widespread of adoption of self-driving cars without human controls. The agency said it ""may also consider a more fundamental revamping of its approach to safety standards"" for automated vehicles and added future requirements ""need to be more flexible and responsive, technology-neutral, and performance-oriented."" NHTSA said it could require manufacturers ""to use test methods, such as sophisticated obstacle-course-based test regimes"" or it could also adopt computer simulation requirements as U.S. law ""does not require that NHTSA's safety standards rely on physical tests and measurements, only that they be objective, repeatable, and transparent."" The department also said it ""no longer recognizes the designations of ten automated vehicle proving grounds"" announced shortly before then President Barack Obama left office in January 2017. The sites, including a Michigan center that President Donald Trump visited last year, were named by Congress to be eligible for $60 million in grants ""to fund demonstration projects that test the feasibility and safety"" of self-driving vehicles. The report said ""given the rapid increase in automated vehicle testing activities in many locations, there is no need for U.S. DOT to favor particular locations."" The Transportation Department also announced it will launch a study of the workforce impacts of automated vehicles with the Labor, Commerce, and the Health and Human Services departments. The report also said the Trump administration will not call for ending human driving. The department ""embraces the freedom of the open road, which includes the freedom for Americans to drive their own vehicles... We will protect the ability of consumers to make the mobility choices that best suit their needs.""","Toyota Fully self-driving cars may no longer be required to have features like steering wheels, pedals, and mirrors, according to a report released on Thursday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Reuters,"CARPINTERIA, CA - DECEMBER 12: A smoke-filled sky filter orange light around surfers as the Thomas Fire continues to grow and threaten communities from Carpinteria to Santa Barbara on December 12, 2017 in Carpinteria, California. The Thomas Fire has spread across 365 miles so far and destroyed about 800 structures since it began on December 5 in Ojai, California. David McNew/Getty Images (Reuters) - A fast-moving wildfire driven by hot, dry and windy conditions threatened more than 600 homes and other buildings in Northern California early on Tuesday after forcing some 3,000 residents to evacuate. The Pawnee Fire, which broke out on Saturday near the Mendocino National Forest 70 miles (110 km) northwest of Sacramento, had destroyed 22 buildings and charred more than 10,500 acres (4,200 hectares) by late Monday night, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Lake County, the location of the blaze, on Monday. The scores of firefighters who will seek to contain it on Tuesday face the prospect of temperatures of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 C), 15 mile-per-hour winds and 30 percent humidity, according to the National Weather Service. The fire was 5 percent contained on Monday evening, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The Pawnee is one of four major wildfires burning in California as temperatures rise across the state. None are reported to have caused injuries. To the east, the Lane fire in Tehama County had blackened 3,800 acres and threatened 200 buildings, fire officials said. It was 40 percent contained. The Shu Fire burning some 50 miles (80 km) east of Sacramento near the El Dorado National Forest, was threatening the community of Happy Valley, fire officials said, prompting evacuations and road closures. That blaze was 50 percent contained.

The Mendocino Complex Fire, a merging of the Ranch and River fires that both sparked July 27, was listed at 302,086 acres at 7 p.m. Pacific.

Additionally, work progressed around Pine Mountain Project and towards the Snow Mountain Wilderness,” Cal Fire said. “Fire crews were successful eliminating potential fire threat and decreasing spotting potential in the southern section of the fire. The containment line holding north of SR20 allowed evacuation orders to be reduced.” California fire officials say more than 14,000 firefighters are battling massive fires across the state, including the Mendocino Complex in Northern California, which now being treated as the largest wildfire in state history. (Aug. 8) AP The River Fire, meanwhile, “saw no growth,” Cal Fire said. A total of 119 homes and 110 other buildings have been destroyed by the Mendocino Complex Fire, and another 9,2000 structures remain threatened by a blaze that could soon equal the size of Los Angeles (503 square miles). Cal Fire has listed Sept. 1 as the target date for full containment. Another of the state’s 18 current wildfires, the Carr Fire, was also listed at 47 percent containment by Cal Fire on Wednesday night. That fire, which threatened the city of Redding shortly after starting on July 23, has charred 176,069 acres and destroyed nearly 2,000 structures – including 1,077 homes. A third high-profile blaze, the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite National Park, was listed at 68-percent containment on Wednesday, its 27th day.

Jennifer Calfas,"A fast-moving, aggressive wildfire tore through Southern California Monday night and into Tuesday morning as 500 firefighters struggled to battle flames officials described as “out of control.” The brush fire began just north of Santa Paula in Ventura County and burned through at least 31,000 acres through the county’s city limits toward Highway 33, according to an early morning statement from Ventura officials. The rampant fire, burning just north of Los Angeles, forced at least 27,000 people to evacuate and destroyed at least 150 structures — including one apartment complex that eventually collapsed, officials told the Los Angeles Times. One firefighter was injured, though his or her condition is unclear. About 180,000 residents in Ventura County and another 83,000 others in Santa Barbara lost power because of the fire, according to Southern California Edison. Containment efforts were particularly difficult Monday evening as the fire — fueled by Santa Ana winds and dry brush — moved rapidly. Firefighters were unable to use containment mechanisms from the air — like helicopters dropping water and airliners that drop retardant to make containment lines — most of the evening due to safety risks and visibility issues. “The prospects for containment are not good,” Ventura County Fire Chief Mike Lorenzen said at a news conference early Tuesday morning. “Really, Mother Nature is going to decide if we have the ability to put it out because it is pushing hard.” Officials anticipate the fire to continue to grow into Tuesday as winds increase — and this map from state and local fire officials shows where the fire is burning. Called the Thomas Fire, the active blaze follows a record year of destruction for the California fire season. In October, a number of fires in Northern California’s wine country killed more than 40 people and destroyed around 10,000 structures. Aggressive fires are typical for the month of October, as dry vegetation and seasonal winds fuel fast-moving flames. While other states may be experiencing the beginnings of winter with snow and cooler temperatures, Southern California endures Santa Ana winds, which, along with dry vegetation, are a key agent for wildfires to spread quickly — and dangerously.",Officials anticipate the fire to grow,2017-12-05T14:11:06Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A Fast-Moving Wildfire Is Tearing Through California.

"Allison Shoemaker on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","As with cooking, so with cocktails: Sometimes theres a recipe youre dying to try, and it sounds so good, and youve got most of the stuff youll need, but theres one ingredienta spice, an unusual vinegar, somethingyou dont have, and absolutely need, and may never use again. Most of the time, youd say, oh, what the hell, and buy it. It cant set you back that much. But with cocktails, sometimes that one ingredient is, say, a stone pine liqueur (delicious, by the way). It hard to imagine using such a thing in another kind of cocktail, and since were talking about a bottle of alcohol and not a container of dried galangal, thats a pricy purchase that may just sit around collecting dust. Lets change that. That one bottle of Chambord you bought to make French Martinis this spring can be used for other things. Below, some brief notes on a few commonplace liqueurs, what theyre used for most commonly, and what they can do besides take up space on the bar cart. One quick note: While youve got loads of time before most spirits go bad, the same cant be said of all liqueurs. If youve been sitting on a bottle of Baileys for years, best check the expiration date on that suckerthe same goes for any liqueur that uses eggs or milk. If the liqueur in question has a lower percentage of alcohol (say 16 percent or under) you may want to give it a try before using it willy-nilly. Otherwise, you should be fine. Chambord What is it?: A French black raspberry liqueur thats blended with cognac, vanilla, honey, and herbs. You know this oneits the round bottle with the gold around its middle that looks like it should be in the Popes hand or something. Whats it most commonly used for?: Sweet cocktails of all kinds, perhaps most notably the French Martini, which was a big hit in the 80s and 90s. Another cocktail: Ive had it in a French Manhattan, which is just a Manhattan with Chambord in it. Sweet, but tasty. Used without booze: Excellent in brownies. My favorite, though, is to mix it with something else youre excited aboutbasil simple syrup, another liqueur maybe, preserves of some kindand use it as a glaze or drizzle for something baked. Chambord-glazed doughtnuts! Chambord-glazed scones! Chambord-drizzled cheesecake! You get the idea. Crème de cassis What is it?: Another sweet, berry-based liqueur, though this one is often more complex than Chambord. An important note: does not contain dairy! That crème just means it has a soft, syrupy consistency. Whats it most commonly used for?: On its own as an aperitif, or in a Kir or Kir Royale cocktail. Both have only two ingredients: crème de cassis and white wine. The Kir is made with still wine, the Royale with Champagne. Another cocktail: Can be very tasty in beer and cider cocktails, particularly dry ciders and stouts. Its great in Guinness. Used without booze: Anything fruity and warmed up, just pour a little in. My plan this Thanksgiving is to try some in my cranberry sauce; Ive also had it in pie fillings and drizzled over ice cream and sorbet. The same goes for most fruit liqueurs, some chocolate liqueurs, and crème de violette, although really if you own a bottle of crème de violette you should just make yourself an Aviation every Friday night, ya fancy bastard. Campari What is it?: A complex Italian bitter liqueur with a long history. Whats it most commonly used for?: Negronis ! Another cocktail: Drink it on its own or with soda as an aperitif. Honestly, you can use this every time you have a dinner party and skip the alternate uses entirely. Aperitifs are so fancy. Used without booze: Jams and marmalades, fruit salad, frosting, etc.anything sweet you think could use a little bitter note. Im dying to try this Negroni cake recipe. Triple sec and curacao What are they?: Orange liqueurs. Curacao came first, a Dutch spirit traditionally dark in color (now blue, green, red, whatever) and with a brandy case. Triple sec was invented by the French, is usually clear, and has neutral spirits as a base. There are bad versions of both, and they are used all the time in cocktails, so its worth springing for a decent bottle. As a general rule, curacaos work best with aged spirits, triple sec with gins, vodkas, etc. What are they most commonly used for?: Margaritas, Cosmopolitans, kamikazes theyre everywhere. Theyre also not interchangeable, but for our purposes, well group them together. Another cocktail: Honestly, the most surprising alcohol-related use for triple sec might be to drink it on its own, with an ice cube. Just make sure its a good one. Used without booze: Baking. Triple sec and curacao can be amazing in baked goods, especially brunchy ones. This orange olive oil pound cake is one example, but there are many. Just be careful if youre subbing one for the other, as triple sec is typically not as sweet as its cousin. Sambuca What is it?: A thing you tried in college on a dare. Just me? Okay, its an aniseed liqueur thats very sweet. Whats it most commonly used for?: A shot thats lit on fire, hence the dare. Also frequently served with coffee beans in it. Another cocktail: Its apparently great with or after coffee, but to be totally honest, its not my thing, so I have not tried. Used without booze: Heres a liqueur often used in cooking, rather than baking. I am particularly intrigued by this cranberries recipe. The customers at my fancy whiskey shop have mentioned others, including roasts and breads. Maraschino What is it?: A clear Marasca cherry liqueur. It is not red and syrupy. It is floral and sweet, with an aroma thats nutty and smoky. The cherries are named for the liqueur, not the other way aroundtheyre traditionally soaked in it. Luxardo is the best known; their maraschino cherries are also unbelievable. Whats it most commonly used for?: Keep making those Aviations, ya fancy bastard. Another cocktail: The Hemingway Daiquiri, if you feel like getting hammered and being a sonofabitch. Used without booze: Make your own maraschino cherries. You are extremely welcome. Lots of variations on that recipe available, including just using liqueur and cherries, but Id go the whole hog and add vanilla and lemon and all that. Theyll keep for months.","As with cooking, so with cocktails: Sometimes there’s a recipe you’re dying to try, and it sounds so good, and you’ve got most of the stuff you’ll need, but there’s one ingredient—a spice, an unusual vinegar, something—you don’t have, and absolutely need, and…",2018-09-25T00:18:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thetakeout.com'}",Booze you can use: 7 liqueurs good for more than that one cocktail,https://thetakeout.com/7-liqueurs-guide-chambord-campari-triple-sec-curacao-1829196000,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--JmNQob9U--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/cw55b2uejjefgbv9hddo.jpg",,Thetakeout.com,Complex fire,1
John Biggs,"While the ONE Smart Keyboard Pro doesn’t have a sweet demo tune nor can it play barking dog Jingle Bells without some help, it can teach you or your kids how to play piano. The elegant keyboard has 88 weighted keys that simulate a true mechanical piano and connects to your phone so you can learn to play at your own pace. The Keyboard Pro costs $799 and is essentially a compact teaching keyboard. It can connect to your iOS or Android devices via an oddly shaped USB B cable and once it’s paired with the app you can run through simple songs – think Greensleeves – and more complex sheet music. This keyboard is weighted but not progressively which means that each key offers the same resistance, a consideration that might be important to some more experienced players. Further, you can connect a USB cable and connect the keyboard to your computer to use it as a MIDI controller. Again, this is a very austere keyboard. It doesn’t do much aside from teach you how to play which, in the end, is what most of us need. Because it doesn’t have the expansive bells and whistles of a Casio and because most of the smarts are in the app itself, it’s a bit of a hard sell for most people. However, if you’re looking to learn, the ONE works. This larger and more complete version of the One Smart Keyboard offers quality workmanship and design. The entire system is surprisingly sparse with nothing but a power button and volume on the front of the keyboard. There is an input for a sustain pedal as well as a few output jacks for headphones and that’s about it. Don’t expect to pick out instruments or pitch shift with this keyboard. Once you fire up the app you have access to teaching exercises and games that let you follow along on the LED-lit keyboard as you run through songs and scales. Finally, you can buy sheet music for $3.99 or so that you can learn to play on the ONE. There is also free sheet music available for those who want to play a little classical. [gallery ids=""1629054,1629055,1629053""] I found the entire system to be quite usable and my kids, once they figured out how to slow down the music, jumped right in learning little songs. Nothing can quite teach you how to play piano like a human teacher – there aren’t enough smarts in this app to make adjustments based on your skill – but it’s the electronic equivalent of buying a Teach Yourself Piano book and sitting down in front of grandma’s old upright. I’m especially pleased with the quality of the keyboard. I’ve already had a few MIDI keyboards over the years including models from Casio and Yamaha and this one is on par with those. The teaching feature is the main draw here, as I noted before, because there is little else you can do with this keyboard right out of the box. However, if that’s what you’re looking for in a keyboard and you don’t want to sample bodily noises so you can play Farting Clair De Lune at the school talent show, this might be the model for you.

Connie Loizos,"According to a new report from a Raleigh, N.C. television affiliate WRAL, Google might have quietly helped local detectives in their pursuit of two gunmen who committed separate crimes roughly one-a-half years apart. How? According to the story, Raleigh police presented the company with warrants not for information about specific suspects but rather data from all the mobile devices that were within a certain distance of the respective crime scenes at the time the crimes were committed. In one of its homicide cases, Raleigh police reported asked Google to provide unique data for anyone within a 17-acre area that includes both homes and businesses; in the other, it asked for user data across “dozens” of apartment units at a particular complex. As the outlet notes, most modern phones, tablets and laptops have built-in location tracking that pings some combination of GPS, Wi-Fi and mobile networks to determine each device’s position. Users can switch off location tracking, but if they’re using a cellular network or relying on WiFi to connect, their devices are still transmitting their coordinates to third parties. Google hasn’t responded to a request for more information that we’d sent off earlier today. But in response to WRAL’s investigation, a company spokesman declined to comment on specific cases or discuss whether Google has fought requests from the Raleigh investigators, saying only that: “We have a long-established process that determines how law enforcement may request data about our users. We carefully review each request and always push back when they are overly broad.” According to a Raleigh Police Department spokesperson, the request account data was not limited to devices running Google’s Android operating system but rather all devices running any kind of location-enabled Google app. The department began using the tactic after learning about a similar search warrant in California’s Orange County, said this spokesperson. A Wake County district attorney tells WRAL that the data that investigators have sought from Google contain only anonymized account numbers without any content included, though it sounds from her comments as though Google has been complicit in supplying further information when forced to do so. “We’re not getting text messages or emails or phone calls without having to go through a different process and having additional information that might lead us to a specific individual,” she tells WRAL. Google says that in recent years, it’s been receiving between disclosure requests for between 75,000 and 80,000 users every six months. As of January 2017, which is the last time it publicly updated its transparency report about requests for user data, it says it produced data roughly 65 percent of the time that it was asked to do so. Google doesn’t publicly disclose what kind of data it provides to governmental and other authorities. Further, in cases where it does hand over data, it may be under court order not to identify the individuals impacted. Either way, the area-based search warrants Raleigh detectives have sought seem to be a newer trend, one that will undoubtedly concern Fourth Amendment advocates anew. For one thing, in addition to potentially violating the privacy of Google users and protecting them from unreasonable searches, one can imagine people being wrongly accused by sheer dint of being tied to a murder scene via cell phone location records. In fact, it has happened before. It’s also not too hard to imagine someone with nefarious designs leaving his cell phone behind. Indeed, says WRAL’s investigation, in two separate cases where Raleigh investigators have presented Google with area-based search warrants — one involving a fire and another sexual battery — there was not evidence that either the arsonist or attacker had a cell phone.","According to a new report from a Raleigh, N.C. television affiliate WRAL, Google might have quietly helped local detectives in their pursuit of two gunmen who committed separate crimes roughly one-a-half years apart.

A police officer speaking to News Now Yucaipa confirmed no deaths had yet taken place. News Now Yucaipa posted a video on YouTube showing an SUV with bulletholes near the scene on Lynwood Drive. Police previously reported that children had been injured in the shooting, but an officer on the YouTube video said all victims had been adults. The officer went on to say ""handguns and rifles"" had been used in an exchange of gun fire between two parties that may have resulted from a dice game. ""We do have a lot of gang activity in this area,"" he said in the video. Police have not yet recovered any weapons from the incident, and reported an uncooperative crowd when officers first responded to the scene, though they did say no officers had been attacked and the crowd may have just been bystanders. The shooting happened on a hot holiday weekend in the city that is about 60 miles (96 km) east of Los Angeles. People were gathered outside playing games in a common area of an apartment complex of about 100 units, police said. Units from multiple agencies had responded. Lawhead said that as of early Monday, detectives do not have a suspect or a motive in the shooting. The shooting took place a week after a gunman shot nine people and killed two competitors at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida August 26.

Morgan Sung,"There's a meme on the rise that's perfect for shifting the blame to someone else. If the American Chopper meme is the format for facilitating hard-hitting discussions about toxic masculinity and U.S. interventionist policies, Eric Andre's new ""Who Killed Hannibal?"" meme is for refusing to take accountability. SEE ALSO: Cartoon from the 1920s is an incredibly old-school meme The meme comes from The Eric Andre Show, a surreal late night comedy parodying public access television. In this scene, which originally aired in November 2013, Andre transitions from a chat about climate change to asking the audience, ""Speaking of climate change, when is Hannibal Buress gonna start thinking about some underwear, am I right, ladies?"" As the crowd cheers, Andre pulls out a gun and promptly shoots Buress in the torso. When he's finished unloading two clips into the now-dead Buress, Andre appears to have a moment of baffled remorse. ""Who killed Hannibal?"" he whispers. In the past week, the scene has been reappropriated to describe situations where institutions of power do something toxic, and then blame it on the innocent or uninvolved. The meme, as one poster in r/MemeEconomy irately points out, wrongly replaces ""Who killed Hannibal?"" with ""Why would X do this?"" ""Plz stop. It's detracting an otherwise hilarious meme,"" the OP wrote. The meme is still pretty funny with either phrase, whether it's criticizing baby boomers for blaming everything on millennials ( what will they ruin next? ) or mocking Trump for his tendency to blame factual reporting on ""fake news."" The format works perfectly when discussing history's screw ups and mysteries, like addressing the conspiracy theory that claims the CIA killed John F. Kennedy. Or when the German parliament building just happened to catch fire during Hitler's rise to power, giving him the political loophole to suspend constitutional rights and arrest Communists. And the meme has even taken on more complex versions of itself, like with this explanation of the American Revolution. Like the U.S. oil memes, the ""Who killed Hannibal?"" meme has become something of a lighthearted political commentary on dark moments of history. This one brings up Turkey's continuing denial of the Armenian genocide. But not all of the meme's many manifestations are political critiques. It extends to fandoms, too. We can't wait to see what we learn next from this meme.","There's a meme on the rise that's perfect for shifting the blame to someone else.

Catherine Shu,"Nissan Motor and DeNA announced today that field tests of Easy Ride, the self-driving taxi service they developed together, will begin next month in Japan. This means that Nissan and DeNA now rank among Uber, Lyft, GM, Didi Chuxing and other companies pioneering self-driving taxi pilots, with the goal of launching commercially within the next few years. DeNA is a Tokyo-headquartered online services company that is probably best known outside of Japan for a partnership with Nintendo that has produced mobile games like “Fire Emblem Heroes.” Its other services, however, encompass a wide range of verticals, including e-commerce, entertainment, healthcare, social networking and automotive tech. Two years ago, DeNA launched its first production vehicles with French autonomous vehicle company EasyMile, which are used to provide a driverless shuttle service called Robot Shuttle in Japanese cities. Easy Ride’s first field test will begin on March 5 in Yokohama, the city to the south of Tokyo where Nissan’s global headquarters are located. Its self-driving taxis, which the companies call “robo-vehicles,” will take passengers along a 4.5 kilometer set route between the Yokohama World Porters shopping center and Nissan’s corporate complex. During the ride, passengers can try out Easy Ride’s concierge features by using a mobile app to ask for suggestions about local sightseeing destinations, which are then displayed on an in-car tablet screen, with coupons available for download. A remote monitoring center will oversee the cars during the field test and passengers will be asked after their ride to complete a survey about their experiences and how much they would be willing to pay for Easy Ride when it launches. Nissan is one of several Japanese automakers that want to get self-driving vehicles on the road by the beginning of the next decade, motivated by the country’s aging population, which needs more transportation options, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he wants self-driving vehicles to help with transportation during the games and also serve as a showcase for Japan’s manufacturing and technological prowess. The government is currently in the process of drawing up laws meant to make the process of testing and commercializing autonomous vehicle systems more efficient. Nissan and DeNA say they plan to launch full service of Easy Ride in the early 2020s, after a limited rollout. The fields tests will be used to “develop service designs for driverless environments, expanded service routes, vehicle distribution logic, pick-up/drop-off processes and multilingual support,” the companies said in a release. The taxi industry in major Japanese cities like Tokyo is heavily regulated and cab drivers are required to have special licenses, so companies there must focus on other services instead of ride-sharing. For example, earlier this week Sony announced that it will launch an AI-based taxi-calling app, while Uber chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi said the company wants to form partnerships with a taxi companies to put new life into its Japanese expansion strategy.

Lucas Matney,"With a full year since its last mention onstage at Apple’s last hardware event, Apple’s AirPower wireless charger mat is still missing. At the company’s iPhone event this morning in Cupertino, there was little mention of the wireless charging tech present in the new iPhones, but more surprisingly there was not a single word said about the company’s AirPower wireless charging mat that it teased last year as coming in “early” 2018. Apple even had early AirPower mat samples in the hands-on area of the hardware event last year but it seems delays have left the device out of this year’s show and pushed further down the product roadmap. While Apple’s website did not show any details on the AirPower charger, there were details present still about a wireless charging case for the AirPods “coming in 2018” that is designed for the mat. What’s the problem and why the big delay here? Well new charging tech is a major liability for any tech company and Apple has been trying some ground-breaking things with the AirPower charger that definitely seems more complex than just sticking three Qi charger coils into a padded mat and calling it a day. First off, the big deal about AirPower is that it is an evolution of the Qi charger standard, (at least some of) the coils have to be smaller to work with the Apple Watch and new AirPods case, and the pad also has to be capable of delivering a roughly full speed charge to the phone, something that is likely a major engineering stress test for thermals. What may have been the biggest challenge as a result is that Apple wants you to be able to charge three devices simultaneously without you having to worry about where they are on the pad. That means that unlike today’s Qi chargers where you have to scoot your phone around to nudge into a position where it can charge, you truly should be able to just drop something on the pad and get to charging. Some of these issues were detailed in a report from Bloomberg earlier this summer. In past years, Apple had some issues with shipping both the AirPods and HomePod within the time horizon they had detailer earlier, but Apple gave an awful lot of details about this product in its tease last year and it’s peculiar that it didn’t even get an offhand mention at WWDC or today’s event. While one of Apple’s hardware devices shipping with a buggy version of iOS might lead to some late night patches and customers unable to open an app, dealing with power management flaws is a liability cornucopia. If anything is seriously wrong or the wireless charging mat were to make a mistake detecting a device the paired devices could theoretically catch fire. Given the challenges it might make sense that Apple has been a little more careful with this one in the testing phase, but it’s also possible the issues haven’t been with design and are instead just with scaling manufacturing. We don’t really know because Apple hasn’t said squat, instead they chose to announce the device last year, perhaps before they had an accurate scope of the issues left to tackle before shipping it.","With a full year since its last mention onstage at Apple’s last hardware event, Apple’s AirPower wireless charger mat is still missing.

"Kate Bernot on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Regional Mexican cuisine is, thankfully, beginning to break free of its overgeneralized reputation. A new set of ambitious, young chefs are calling attention to the regional variations within Mexican cooking, while the hard work of some pioneering U.S. restaurants are finally convincing diners that Mexican food isn’t synonymous with fast-food burritos or slushy margaritas. Chief among the regional cuisines lately getting their due is the food and drink of Oaxaca, one of the 30-plus states that make up the country of Mexico. Located in the southern portion of the country, Oaxaca boasts a varied topography that includes mountains, lowlands, coastal areas, and its largest metropolis, Oaxaca City. It’s impossible to talk about the flavors of Oaxaca without first talking about its range of geography and ethnic groups. To better understand the culture (and agriculture) behind Oaxacan cuisine, I turned to chef Hugo Ortega. Oretega was born in Mexico City and is the James Beard Foundation award-winning chef behind four Houston restaurants (Backstreet Cafe, Hugo’s, Caracol and Xochi) and is the author of two cookbooks. Though he was born in Mexico City, his grandmother lived in a 500-person village in the Oaxacan region of Mixteca while he was growing up, and Ortega vividly recalls trips to her candlelit home. He tells me that members of 16 of Mexico’s 21 ethnic groups live in Oaxaca and speak more than 200 dialects. Despite Spanish colonial presence, many pre-Hispanic cultural traditions have survived and mingled with outside influences. “It’s pristine, still,” Ortega tells me. “It’s so difficult to get there and that’s what’s helped maintain what it is today.” Despite some formidable mountains, the capital city is located in a rich equatorial valley perfect for many types of agriculture including corn, chocolate, and chili peppers. Even in the mountains, succulent wild mushrooms are plentiful, while the coastline provides excellent seafood and sea salt. “Oaxaca is the belly of Mexico,” Ortega says. “And as far as I’m concerned, it can be the belly of the world.” If the region is known for any dish, it’s mole. Oaxaca is dubbed the Land of Seven Moles, for seven regional variations on the dish, though most people outside the country are probably familiar with mole negro, the red chili-chocolate version that can contain a few dozen ingredients or more. “You put 20 cooks and you give them chilis, 20 cooks will cook mole differently,” Ortega says. “There’s no such thing as a standardized recipe.” Andres Padilla, culinary director for Rick Bayless’ Frontera Restaurants, describes mole as a hyper-regional dish that most home cooks prepare from their own blend of ingredients and spices. All of it starts, of course, with the red or green chili peppers that flourish in Oaxaca. From there, cooks can add aromatics such as onion and garlic, chili seeds, tomatillos, tomatoes, cacao, spices, and broth or water. “You’re making this really complex flavor that’s not of any one ingredient,” Padilla says. “It’s all the ingredients coming together which is like their indigenous cultures coming together with a lot of Spanish culture, too. You can think about it that way.” Behind mole, mezcal is likely Oaxaca’s most famous culinary export. It’s similar to tequila in that both are made from agave plants, but tequila is only made from one type: the agave tequilana weber plant. Mezcal can be made from dozens of types of agave, so in fact tequila is just one subset of mezcal. Tequila lacks mezcal’s smoky character because its agave is typically steamed rather than roasted in pits. Both spirits are protected by Denominación de Origen (DOC) regulations. As global demand for the spirit grows— AdWeek reports its sales volume doubled between 2012 and 2016—larger, commercial producers are muscling in on what has for centuries been a highly artisanal, individualized practice of mezcal-making. “As you go up in the mountains, they do it in a more organic, rustic way. It’s not commercial-side. People have 20 plants where they do 50 bottles of that particular mezcal and every little village does their own,” Ortega says. “Some companies have commercialized this. They buy the land, plant the agave they want to grow; but overall it’s still very untouched.” Besides claiming some of the best chili- and cacao-growing soil in the country, Oaxaca is also the birthplace of the crop most central to Mexican cuisine: corn. Ortega says Oaxacans cultivate around 200 types of heirloom corn, which can be ground into the masa that forms the base of much of the region’s cuisine. One of the best places to experience the flavors of heirloom corn is at the markets, where vendors, usually women, sell tlayuda. Tlayuda is heirloom corn pressed into a giant tortilla and baked on a clay comal or griddle until crispy, with a flavor like rich popcorn. You can buy them by the stack, but Padilla says they’re best eaten as a base for a snack of creamy black beans blended with the leaves of a wild avocado plant, which lend an anise-like flavor. Topped with queso oaxaca, fresh tomato and avocado, it’s about as good a breakfast as you can find, Padilla says. Also important to the markets are the meat vendors, especially in Oaxaca City’s Mercado Benito Juarez where an entire corridor of stalls fills with the aromas of smoke and cooking meats. The most common trio of offerings are Oaxacan chorizo (made with red chilis, vinegar, and spices); cecina, a super thin-cut pork that’s salted and marinated with a red chile adobo and grilled over a wood fire; and tasajo, accordion-cut, super thin beef that’s salted, cured overnight, and cooked over a fire. “Order your meat by the quarter-kilo and they’ll throw it on the grill for you with knob onions. Then go down to the end of the hall where the ladies make tortillas, and order a dozen. Other people have the fresh salsas and salads. You basically build yourself this little taco platter,” Padilla suggests. “That’s a must for anyone who goes to Oaxaca City.” Above all, he and Ortega stress the importance of this first-hand experience, of going to Oaxaca. They worry that the nuanced culture and food there gets lost in translation to America at times, and that the voices and traditions of the people who’ve made this style of food for generations aren’t being heard. “It worries me when it comes to commercialization, when we as cooks don’t do our homework and go learn firsthand,” says Ortega. “You get satisfied just to serve that something you have not spent your time with; I think that should not happen. Anyone can do Mexican food but it’s our job to study and appreciate what these wonderful people have done for us.”","Regional Mexican cuisine is, thankfully, beginning to break free of its overgeneralized reputation.

Catie Keck,"There are mere days left in 2018, but Facebooks eternal year of reckoning continues.
A new report from the New York Times has pulled back the curtain on part of Facebooks internal struggle to get its hands around the complex problems housed on its platform, not the least of which include disinformation and hate. The report comes as part of a monthslong investigation by Times Max Fisher, who obtained a massive stock of documents intended to guide thousands of moderators on the platform whose job it is to manage potentially problematic content. According to the times, Facebooks so-described rulebooks, which the Times says contain numerous gaps, biases and outright errors.
The Times was reportedly provided the documentswhich were confirmed as legitimate to the paper by the companyby an employee who said he feared that the company was exercising too much power, with too little oversight and making too many mistakes. The report paints a portrait of haphazardly assembled rulebooks comprising loose spreadsheets and PowerPoints of rules and stipulations by which moderators are tasked with policing content. The documents, the Times says, can be confusing when taken as a whole:
One document sets out several rules just to determine when a word like martyr or jihad indicates pro-terrorism speech. Another describes when discussion of a barred group should be forbidden. Words like brother or comrade probably cross the line. So do any of a dozen emojis.
The guidelines for identifying hate speech, a problem that has bedeviled Facebook, run to 200 jargon-filled, head-spinning pages. Moderators must sort a post into one of three tiers of severity. They must bear in mind lists like the six designated dehumanizing comparisons, among them comparing Jews to rats.
The Times reported that while the rulebooks architects consult with outside groups, they are largely free to set policy however they wish. The teams responsible for assembling the rulebooks are mostly young engineers and lawyers who attempt to distill highly complex issues into simple yes-or-no rules, The Times said. That undertaking reportedly proves difficult for moderators, some of whom the Times says rely on Google Translate and have mere seconds to recall countless rules while combing through up to a thousand posts daily.
But more troubling than Facebooks arbitrary collection of rules intended to police its billion-plus usersposts by whom can run the gamut of tasteless memes to calculating and potentially dangerous political propagandais the significant political power it wields. In deciding who is allowed a platform on Facebooks site, the report illustrates that can be incredibly tricky.
One example cited by the Times was a deeply racist ad from the Trump campaign essentially designed to incite fear about a migrant caravan of Central American asylum seekers. That ad was later banned on Facebook just last month. Facebook also came under fire after its platform was used as a political tool by President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte. In Myanmar, Facebook was used to fuel violence against Muslims for years, which the Times said occurred in part because of a paperwork error in its rulebooks that instructed allowing posts that should have in fact been removed.
Much of the Times report fills in the blanks about procedures at Facebook that have long failed to manage the problems on its platform. But it also illustrates the extent to which Facebook is struggling to handle the issues that continue to arise as it attempts to comply with the demands of respective governments.

No injuries reported, and Tesla said the fire wasn't expected to impact car production. But this isn't the first fire there. CNBC says the paint shop at Tesla's Fremont plant has a “a history of frequent fires.” ""Some cardboard and shipping materials being prepared for recycling on our southern fence line caught fire, along with a small patch of grass next to a Tesla parking lot,"" a company spokesperson told a reporter.

Jim Carlton,"A fast-moving wildfire has shut down a nearly 50-mile stretch of one the busiest freeways in Northern California, after it torched at least two big rigs and forced motorists to flee cars and trucks as the state endures one of its worst fire seasons. The so-called Delta Fire broke out shortly after noon on Wednesday about 10 miles north of Redding, Calif. It is the same area where the Carr Fire broke out in late July, destroying hundreds of homes and killing three firefighters. No injuries were reported in the latest inferno, which fire officials said was human-caused without providing details. Officials said the blaze rapidly expanded through tinder-dry brush and timber above Shasta Lake to form a front up to 3 miles wide with 300-foot-high flames that jumped across busy Interstate 5 on Wednesday, setting off a panic as motorists who could feel the growing heat abandoned about a dozen vehicles. “When the inside of your car gets 30 to 40 degrees hotter in a few seconds, that’s scary,” said Brandon Vaccaro, spokesman for an interagency command in charge of fighting the fire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Law-enforcement officials closed the interstate, forcing detours on the busiest highway link between California and Oregon. Siskiyou County sheriff’s officials said they anticipated Interstate 5 would remain closed until Thursday afternoon, but warned the closure could last longer. The fire surged to more than 15,000 acres and prompted mandatory evacuations of some homes and businesses as well as en evacuation warning for the 1,600 residents of Dunsmuir, about 15 miles away, Mr. Vaccaro said. Sheriff’s officials said the fire’s momentum slowed early Thursday but picked up again in the afternoon. The incident added to California’s fire misery this summer. The famed Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park was ordered closed for nearly a month as the nearly 97,000-acre Ferguson Fire raged nearby. Meanwhile, two blazes that merged into the Mendocino Complex Fire consumed nearly 460,000 acres north of San Francisco, setting a record for the state’s largest wildfire. In all, officials from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said they responded to fires that blackened about 614,000 acres so far this year as of Sept. 2, compared with a five-year annual average of about 158,000 acres. When including fires on land managed by the U.S. Forest Service, the total so far this year is about 1.3 million acres. Fire experts attribute the increased activity, in large part, to lingering damage to trees and other vegetation from California’s five-year drought.

Adam Rosenberg,"2018 sure is off to a running start in Trumpland. The 45th President of the United States kicked off a busy weekend of meetings at Camp David on Saturday with a brief, fiery tweetstorm that — even at this early point in 2018 — is already a surefire candidate for the year's most memorable. SEE ALSO: Why 'Fire and Fury' could mark the end of the road for Trump In three tweets, Donald Trump addressed his intellect (""being, like, really smart""), his mental stability (""a very stable genius""), and his successful presidential election campaign (""on my first try""). He doesn't come out and say it, but the tweets are likely a response to Michael Wolff's upcoming book, in which Trump insiders question the president's stability on the record, and/or recent meetings on Capitol Hill to discuss the president's mental state. Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence..... — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018....to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....and a very stable genius at that! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018 In typical Trump fashion, the three-tweet tirade blows past known facts in favor of creating a particular narrative. The ""first try"" election claim, for one, is hogwash; Trump ran in 2000, and even won a couple of primaries — though only after he left the race, in Feb. 2000. He ran under the Reform Party banner, and ultimately blamed his exit on the political organization being a ""total mess."" The Reform Party countered at the time with the contention that Trump's bid had never been serious. ""Donald Trump came in, promoted his hotels, he promoted his book, he promoted himself at our expense, and I think he understands fully that we’ve ended the possibilities for such abuse of our party,"" party leader Patrick Choate said at the time. Predictably, Trump's tweets drew a disbelieving response from social media. Donald Trump calling himself a genius doesn’t break with the rest of his grandiose narcissistic personality disorder.

NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"During the 2016 presidential campaign, I carefully reviewed Trump’s race-related history, including the 1,021 pages of legal documents from racial discrimination suits against him, and the evidence is devastating. We should be careful about tossing around the word “racist,” and any one incident can be misconstrued. But in Trump’s case, we have a consistent 40-year pattern of insults and discrimination, and I don’t see what else we can call him but a racist. It’s true, of course, that some African countries are in wretched shape and that some immigrants from poor countries arrive uneducated and end up, along with homegrown Americans, in dubious trades. But careful, Mr. President, given your own grandfather’s history. More important, the toxic disparagement of immigrants tarnishes heroes like Emmanuel Mensah, 28, a New Yorker who came from the West African country of Ghana and joined the U.S. Army National Guard. Then a couple of weeks ago, when he was back from training, a fire broke out in Mensah’s Bronx building. Mensah easily saved himself, but then rushed back into the burning building to rescue others. Three times he rushed in and out, bringing out four people. Photo At least 12 people were killed when a fire fueled by gusty winds tore through a century-old apartment building in the Bronx. It was the deadliest fire in the city in more than a quarter-century. Credit David Dee Delgado for The New York Times Then Mensah dashed toward the flames again and reached the fourth floor in a desperate effort to save a fifth person. This brave soul from what Trump would describe as a s-hole country, the kind of person Trump was insulting, never made it out. Mensah’s body was found high in the building’s wreckage. A few days ago, the Army posthumously awarded Mensah the Soldier’s Medal, its highest award for heroism outside of combat, and New York State awarded him its Medal for Valor. The citation on the state medal reads: “His courageous and selfless act in the face of unimaginable conditions are consistent with the highest traditions of uniformed service.” Who better embodies our nation’s values? A politician with a history of racist comments who took five deferments to escape military duty in the Vietnam War, including one for heel spurs? Or a heroic Ghanaian immigrant and soldier who dies in a fire while rescuing others? So I apologize to the people of Haiti and Africa for our president’s comments. Most of us recognize that immigration is complex and that we cannot throw open our borders, but also that newcomers enrich us. That is true not only of Norwegians but also of penniless refugees from impoverished, war-torn countries, such as my father — a Polish-Armenian fleeing Eastern Europe, whose first purchase in the U.S. was a Sunday New York Times to teach himself English. Trump once showed a willingness to be big-hearted to immigrants who break the rules: He married Melania, a Slovenian who came to the U.S. on a visitor visa and then earned money as a model before she was authorized to work, according to an investigation by The A.P. If only Trump could show a similar compassion to unauthorized immigrants who don’t look like Melania. In particular, his decision to send Salvadorans back, in the face of murderous gang violence in that country, and his rejection of a bipartisan deal to protect DACA “dreamers,” simply seem cruel. So what can we do? Obviously, we need to stand up to racist xenophobia even when it emanates from the White House — particularly when it emanates from the White House — and in addition, if Americans are looking for a constructive way to respond, here’s a suggestion: How about donating to an immigrant rights organization like the National Immigration Law Center, or to an aid group that works with people whom our president just insulted? I’ve seen firsthand and admired the work of two American aid organizations that save lives in Haiti from tuberculosis, cervical cancer and more. They are Partners in Health and Innovating Health International. Both are working heroically on the front lines to save the lives of ordinary Haitians, particularly women. It seems to me that a fine, practical response to racism is to help save a life. • I’m delighted to announce that the winner of my 2018 win-a-trip contest, to take a university student with me on a reporting trip, is Tyler Pager, a graduate of Northwestern University now studying at Oxford.

David Pescovitz,"In 1997, South Korean artist Lee Bul's ""Majestic Splendor,"" an installation of bedazzled rotting fish, was removed from New York's MoMA because the stink was too much for visitors. To prevent the odor problem from interfering with Bul's new retrospective at London's Hayward Gallery, he put the fish in potassium permanganate. Of course, potassium permanganate is frequently used as a firestarter and can easily lead to a blaze when combined with tiny amounts of other common chemicals. From Frieze : On receiving advice, the gallery decided to withdraw the artwork, but it spontaneously combusted mid-removal. ‘Following expert advice regarding the materials used in Lee Bul’s Majestic Splendor we took the decision, along with the artist, to remove the artwork from the exhibition.

Sarah Gray,"Those impacted by the California fires may face a new danger: mudslides and/or debris flows. Areas hit by the Camp Fire in Butte County and the Woolsey Fire north of Los Angeles are expecting rainfall starting on Wednesday. While that rain and could help prevent further fires — and will provide much-needed relief for the poor air quality in Northern California — it could also mean flash floods and/or mudslides. The Camp Fire The Camp Fire, which has become the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, has burned more than 151,000 acres, destroyed 17,148 structures, and left 81 dead. As of Tuesday, it was 70% contained. Now Butte County, where the fire has all but decimated the city of Paradise, is preparing for two storm systems that are predicted to hit later this week. ""Flash floods and debris flows will be a particular threat in the wildfire burn areas mentioned above,"" the National Weather Service of Sacramento reported, referring to burn areas from the Camp Fire, the Carr, Delta and Hirz wildfires in Shasta County and the Mendocino Complex Fire in Lake County. ""Heavy rainfall at times is possible over the burn areas."" ""Rainfall that would normally be absorbed will run off extremely quickly after a wildfire, as burned soil can be as water-repellent as pavement,"" according to the National Weather Service. ""The Camp Fire will likely see ash flows,"" according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen, ""and it's possible the rain could fall hard enough to create more dangerous debris flows."" The National Weather Service warned residents and emergency responders to be on the alert, as it could ""quickly become a dangerous situation."" The rain may also complicate matters for law enforcement teams searching for remains of those who may have died in the fire. There are still nearly 870 people reported missing, as of Tuesday evening. ""What we're looking at here is potentially remains, or cremains — it's kind of a cremated remains state,"" Brian Ferreira, a rescue squad officer, told CNN. ""It's going to consolidate the material and make it more dense,"" Ferreira said of the rain. ""And it's going to present much more like soil. So anything we find or hope to find that's still there, it's going to make a difficult task... that much more difficult."" Impact on the Woolsey Fire For those in Southern California impacted by the Woolsey Fire, rain is also expected. However, ""outside of any convection, peak rain rates should be well below critical thresholds for debris flows in and around burn areas,"" according to the National Weather Service. The Woolsey Fire, which is nearly contained, destroyed 1,500 structures and killed three. ""Residents near burn areas should remain vigilant but at this time the probability for any significant debris flows is very small,"" the National Weather Service said on Tuesday. Emergency officials were preparing residents for possible flooding. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted out resources for residents — including readiness plans, and sandbag distribution site locations across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. Deadly mudslides hit Southern California in January of this year, following the Thomas fire, which raged through Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties in December 2017.","Those impacted by the California fires may face a new danger: flooding, mudslides and debris flows.

Bryan Clark,"As wildfires raged out of control in Northern California this summer, the firefighters responsible for managing them learned a hard lesson about net neutrality. For the Santa Clara Country Fire Department, it couldn’t have come at a worse time. When they needed them most, Verizon had effectively disabled their mobile devices, leaving the department to scramble for solutions while fighting fires that cost could cost California insurers some $10 to $12 billion. Blockchain and cryptocurrency news minus the bullshit. Visit Hard Fork. As Fire Chief Anthony Bowden tells it: County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon. The throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire‘s ability to provide crisis response and essential emergency services. This, from an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara Country Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities commission, all of which are actively seeking to overturn the recent repeal of net neutrality rules. Bowden states that during his team’s response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, Verizon had effectively disabled communication in its command hub, a vehicle known in the complaint as OES 5262. Bowden continues: In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262 [A fire department vehicle “deployed to large incidents as a command and control resource”] was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds. These reduced speeds severely interfered with the OES 5262’s ability to function effectively. My Information Technology staff communicated directly with Verizon via email about the throttling, requesting it be immediately lifted for public safety purposes. Verizon, now aware of the issue, didn’t immediately restore the department’s previous speeds. Instead, the company attempted to sell them a larger data package at more than twice the cost. “They would only remove the throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new plan,” Bowden wrote. It’s not the first time, either. Emails show that Verizon impeded the department in two previous fires, in December and June. The department now argues that Verizon is likely to continue its practice of milking public safety agencies out of sorely needed funds in a push to move them into more expensive plans. Verizon told Ars Technica : Regardless of the plan emergency responders choose, we have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations. We have done that many times, including for emergency personnel responding to these tragic fires. In this situation, we should have lifted the speed restriction when our customer reached out to us. This was a customer support mistake. We are reviewing the situation and will fix any issues going forward. The company also noted that the issue has nothing to do with net neutrality. This is incorrect. As Ars notes, all ISPs are entitled to impose data restrictions for anyone exceeding a a certain amount of data. The companies argued that it was allowed under current (and past) rules’ for “reasonable network management.” This argument, however, would typically only apply during periods of network congestion. According to Bowden, the Santa Clara Fire Department was throttled at all times once it surpassed its 25GB monthly data allotment. In a side-by-side comparison, a crew member’s personal phone was measured against the department’s device, with one seeing speeds of 20Mbps/7Mbps, and the other clocking in at a paltry 0.2Mbps/0.6Mbps. Even if Verizon‘s behavior didn’t technically violate this rule, Santa Clara no longer has the power offered by Obama administration guidelines that allowed users to file complaints about unjust or unreasonable prices and practices. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai eliminated the complaint option when repealing previous net neutrality guidelines. He also limited a consumer’s right to sue internet providers over this type of behavior.

Alix Langone,"Elon Musk is causing controversy on Twitter again. This time, the Tesla CEO and billionaire attacked one of the divers who played an instrumental role in rescuing the Thai soccer team that was stuck in a cave last week. On Sunday, Musk called him a “pedo” on the social network. Musk’s derogatory tweet appears to be a response to comments made by British diver Vern Unsworth, who helped extract the boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave complex. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Unsworth, a cave explorer, said that the mini-submarine Musk sent to aid the rescue mission was just “a PR stunt.” The diver didn’t stop there, however. He said Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts,” and that it had “absolutely no chance of working.” Unsworth said the mini-sub was too long and rigid for the cave conditions and that Musk had “no conception” of what the cave passages were like. He also said that Musk was asked to leave the cave, saying that he shouldn’t have been there. Musk fired back on Twitter over the weekend, taking his reply a step too far in calling Unsworth a pedophile, causing many on the social media platform to ask Musk to delete the tweet, which he later did. Instead, the Silicon Valley mogul stuck to his original comment, tweeting “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true” to someone who called him out for the remark, while also saying he never saw Unsworth when he was at the cave. Musk did call the other cave divers and rescuers “unsung heroes” in a different tweet. He also defended himself, tweeting out emails between himself and another one of the divers, Richard Stanton, as proof that his plan to use the mini-sub to help the boys was in fact a viable solution. The tech billionaire also took heat on Twitter after a Federal Election Commission filing released this week showed he was large donor to the GOP, giving $38,900 to the PAC Protect The House. Despite the report being publicly available, Musk tweeted that the idea he is a top GOP donor is “categorically false,” as well as tweeting that he is “not a conservative. Am registered independent &amp; politically moderate.” Musk caused more waves on Twitter in late May when he attacked the press for writing articles about Tesla that did not paint the company in an especially favorable light, saying he was going to create a website to rate journalists.",This isn't the first time Musk has come under fire for his tweets,2018-07-15T21:00:06Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Elon Musk Calls a Diver That Rescued Thai Soccer Team a ‘Pedo’ on Twitter,http://time.com/5339219/elon-musk-diver-thai-soccer-team-pedo/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/elon-musk-calls-thai-diver-pedo-on-twitter.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Complex fire,1
Antonio García Martínez,"Voice is the primordial human medium. Newborns recognize their mother’s voice the moment they’re born, having heard a muffled version of it in utero. In extremis, we scream or cry for help or joy. Even our most abstractly textual or computerized communications are framed as “conversations,” mimicking the kind of face-to-face dialogue—rich with body language, subtext, emotional warmth, and innuendo—whose increasing absence has spawned a hundred virtual substitutes. And now that our digital platforms are finally sophisticated enough to turn vocal interactions—listening and/or speaking—into yet another Internet-scale, monetizable platform, voice will soon emerge as the most important content and commerce medium in the world. Three separate epiphanies got me thinking about this pivot to voice, and while they are highly personal, it turns out there are real numbers behind the anecdata. Antonio García Martínez ( @antoniogm ) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Before turning to writing, he dropped out of a doctoral program in physics to work on Goldman Sachs’ credit trading desk, then joined the Silicon Valley startup world, where he founded his own startup (acquired by Twitter in 2011) and finally joined Facebook’s early monetization team, where he headed their targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year, and his writing has appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. He splits his time between a sailboat on the SF Bay and a yurt in Washington’s San Juan Islands. Epiphany one: When I wrote a book in 2016 about my early work at Facebook, I was contractually obliged to be trotted out at launch as a salesman. First stop was the glitzy CBS studios in Midtown Manhattan and a highly stressful five-minute interview in front of millions of TV viewers. With the naiveté of the first-time author, I rushed to Twitter the moment I left the studio to check my mentions, where all of a couple of tweets, by people with two-digit follower counts, appeared. TV was the firework that didn’t pop. Months later, I accepted an invitation to be interviewed by a tech-focused podcast I’d never heard of: Note to Self, produced by WNYC Studios and hosted by Manoush Zomorodi. The online uptick following that show was considerable and long-lasting, and it triggered downstream media coverage from several journalists who evidently don’t watch morning TV. Granted, the subject matter of my book probably had a stronger appeal to this particular podcast’s audience (which likely skewed young, techie, and early adopter) than a CBS morning show’s. But it was also a much better interview. TV anchors seem genetically incapable of replicating the intimacy and engagement that draws more and more people (and, consequently, advertisers) to podcasts every year. The industry numbers bear out the medium’s rise. In the US, more people now listen to podcasts every month (90 million and counting) than use Twitter regularly, and the numbers are only rising. Moneywise, total advertising revenue from podcasts ($220 million in 2017) is doubling every year. The podcast marketing space is crowding up with ad networks, tracking and targeting software, advertiser-facing buying interfaces, tools for crafting ad creative. Most importantly to potential advertisers, users are engaged: The ad networks claim episode completion rates are around 90 percent, meaning most ads are being heard. Also, and here’s the real test, the market is paying an astonishing $30 CPMs for some of these podcast slots, which is something like five times Facebook’s average CPMs. (CPM is cost-per-mille—that is, cost per thousand appearances of an ad, or what advertisers are willing to pay to reach the audience.) This is a very elevated starting point for a budding medium. As someone who’s played a small role in building that same armature in the digital and mobile spaces, the whole thing is redolent with a certain heady déjà vu. Eventually, podcasting is going to do to radio what cable TV did to network TV (and what Netflix is now doing to cable TV): It’ll become the showcase for the premier storytelling in that medium. Even if podcasting only manages to take radio’s ad budgets, that’s a good $20 billion a year and a hundredfold increase over the current status quo. We have 21-century consumers flocking to hear a human voice, often that of the very author, tell a long and complex story, just like the ancient Greeks that gathered around a fire to hear their local bards recite what we now call The Odyssey. That’s for relatively short-form storytelling, whose audio (and textual) competition is journalism. Which brings me to … Epiphany two: Before I wrote a book, books on tape seemed to me like something only long-haul truck drivers, or maybe literary-minded marathon runners, would buy. Then I noticed I had five times the number of reviews on Audible as I had on Amazon, and about half the people I’d meet who’d read the book (yes, including some strangers on the street) had ""listened"" to the book. Again, industry stats support the anecdata. Publishers are reporting declining ebook sales but growing audiobook revenues, with audio filling the digital revenue gap that ebooks left. What’s really happening here? Strip away the technological marvels that make the on-demand nature of streaming audio possible, and just focus on the human experience. We have 21-century consumers flocking to hear a human voice, often that of the very author, tell a long and complex story, just like the ancient Greeks that gathered around a fire to hear their local bards recite what we now call The Odyssey (and whose authorship we’ve amalgamated into a legendary Homer). But what about the audience—do listeners ever get to speak in this voice-driven world? Yes, into a soon-to-be omnipresent smart speaker, which brings me to … Epiphany three: I spent an afternoon in a quasi Her -style romance with my Amazon Echo, shopping for items, organizing my calendar, messaging friends, and rather less usefully, trying to get Alexa to say something obscene or witty (and only partially succeeding). Fast forward four hours later. I’m in my car, when one of those things I forgot to either buy or search for on Amazon pops into my head. “Alexa!” I imperiously shouted into the empty interior of my car, ready to have the global brain do my bidding. The wave of felt stupidity and embarrassment that hit me after was almost as strong as the realization that something had just snapped in my relationship with computing. Using a keyboard and mouse to manipulate a computer after successfully using voice feels about the same as using a command-line interface on an old UNIX machine after using a graphical interface. In a word, it’s starting to feel a little barbaric, and furthermore, has a certain never-going-back-to-that-crap quality to it. Amazon’s Echo sales have shattered all analyst estimates, Apple is rushing to catch up via its new HomePod, and Facebook(!) just announced its own smart speakers, slated to appear this summer. Everyone will soon be having the WTF, I-want-to-talk-to-the-Internet-now tantrum I had inside my car. Prediction: Between touchscreens and voice, most people in the future won’t even know how to touch-type, and typing will go back to being a specialist practitioner’s skill, limited to long-form authors, programmers, and (perhaps) antiquarian hipsters who also own fixies and roast their own coffee. My 2-year-old daughter will likely never learn how to drive (and every pedal-to-the-metal, ""flooring it"" driving analogy will be lost on her), instead issuing voice commands to her self-driving car. And she’ll also not know what QWERTY is, or have her left pinkie wired to the mental notion of the letter ""Q,"" as I do so subconsciously I reach for it without even thinking. Instead, she’ll speak into an empty room and expect the global hive-mind, along with its AI handmaidens, to answer. The data-for-money alchemy that pays for the Internet will no longer only be turning Google queries and Facebook actions into fortunes. Rather, the new data inputs of value will be her spoken requests to the ambient and ubiquitous smart speakers, which will follow her seamlessly like a disembodied servant from home to transit to work. Dynamically-generated targeted ads, based on those spoken queries, will fill the gaps in her ever-present stream of music, podcasts, and books. Perhaps they’ll even be synthesized to sound like Ira Glass or Joe Rogan or some other favorite host (since so-called ‘host-read’ ads outperform random human voices). Computer keyboards will then join typewriters in the history museum displays, and that complicated larynx, unique among primates, that first set us down the road to sophisticated social intelligence will once again be central to how we navigate the world.

Aria Bendix and Peter Kotecki,"Since Thursday, at least 31 people have died from three wildfires burning in California. The Camp Fire charred the entire town of Paradise in northern California. As of Sunday evening, the blaze covered 110,000 acres and was 25% contained. Officials have declared it the most destructive wildfire in California history based on the loss of 6,700 structures. In southern California, the Woolsey and Hill fires have burned more than 140 square miles in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. According to CalFire, the Woolsey Fire had burned about 91,500 acres as of Monday morning and was 20% contained. The Hill Fire burned over 4,500 acres and was 75% contained.

Reuters Editorial,"KEMEROVO, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew to the scene of a deadly shopping mall fire in Siberia that killed 64 people and promised angry residents on Tuesday that those responsible for what he called criminal negligence would be harshly punished. The fire, at the Winter Cherry mall in the city of Kemerovo, killed 41 children, according to the Interfax news agency, and the calamitous way it was handled has stirred anger and focussed attention on corruption and lax fire safety standards. Re-elected only this month, Putin laid flowers at a makeshift memorial to the victims in the coal-producing region about 3,600 km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow, before chairing a meeting of top officials. “What’s happening here? This isn’t war, it’s not an unexpected methane explosion at a coal mine. People came to relax, children. We’re talking about demography and losing so many people,” Putin, visibly angry, told the meeting. “Why? Because of some criminal negligence, because of slovenliness. How could this ever happen?,” he added. “The first emotion when hearing about the number of dead and dead children is not to cry but to wail. And when you listen to what has been said here, speaking honestly, other emotions arise.” Investigators said fire exits had been illegally blocked, the public address system had not been switched on, the fire alarm system was broken, and children had been locked inside cinemas. Many staff responsible for public safety fled when the fire broke out, investigators said. The fire swept through the upper floors of the shopping centre, where a cinema complex and children’s play area were located, on Sunday afternoon. Hundreds of angry protesters, many of them crying, gathered in central Kemerovo on Tuesday morning. The mayor, Ilya Seredyuk, tried to speak, but his words were often drowned out by chants calling on him to resign. “Why don’t they tell us the truth?,” shouted one protester. Many locals do not believe the official death toll of 64 and suspect that hundreds of people were killed in the blaze and that a cover-up is underway, something Putin has flatly denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin visits the site of fire, that killed at least 64 people at a busy shopping mall, in Kemerovo, Russia March 27, 2018. Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS Relatives of the victims say they have compiled a list of 85 people, most of them children, who are still missing. RAW ANGER Public anger was reflected in protesters’ placards. “How many victims are there really,?” read one, while another suggested corrupt officials had taken a bribe to sign off on the mall’s fire safety. “Vova and Aman to prison!” read another banner, referring to Putin and the local governor. Natalia and Sergei Agarkov, whose two children were killed in the tragedy along with their grandmother stood on the square holding photographs of their dead loved ones. “Masha was 10, Kostya was eight,” Sergei told Reuters. “Masha... was really good at sport. She should have ran out, but everything was locked. I identified them yesterday. I didn’t see Kostya, but recognised him by his little boots.” Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, told Putin the fire alarm system in the mall had been out of order since March 19 and that a security guard had not turned on the public address system to warn people to evacuate the building. He said five people had already been detained. Asked by Putin why the doors of three cinemas had been locked with people inside, Bastrykin said investigators were still checking, but that one theory was that it had been done to stop people without a ticket getting inside. “Most of the staff ran away and left children and parents and their children to their fate,” said Bastrykin. “... those workers who should have been responsible for people’s safety, for organising an evacuation, they were the first to run away.” Additional reporting by Alexander Reshetnikov and Maria Kiselyova; Writing by Christian Lowe and Andrew Osborn; Editing by Larry King","Reuters Putin, at fatal mall fire scene, pledges action as anger mounts Reuters KEMEROVO, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew to the scene of a deadly shopping mall fire in Siberia that killed 64 people and promised angry residents on Tuesday tha…",2018-03-27T05:40:01Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}","Putin, at fatal mall fire scene, pledges action as anger mounts - Reuters",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-fire-putin/russias-putin-says-criminal-negligence-behind-shopping-mall-fire-idUKKBN1H30GT,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180327&t=2&i=1245287533&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE2Q0EM,reuters,Reuters,Complex fire,1
Lauren Johnson,"Amazon has long been an e-commerce giant, but it's quickly becoming a growing advertising force. 
 Marketers view Amazon as an alternative to the growing control that Google and Facebook exert on digital advertising, and mounting evidence shows that Amazon is slowly beginning to chip into the duopoly's clout. Research firm eMarketer estimated that Facebook and Google would collect 57.7% of US digital ad budgets in 2018, followed by Amazon in third place at 4.1%. 
 Amazon execs are notoriously tight-lipped on the company's financials, but advertising is increasingly popping up in earnings. The word ""advertising"" was mentioned 12 times in the company's third-quarter earnings call, up from nine in its second-quarter call.
 This year, Amazon consolidated its ad business into a single brand and is reportedly building out an ad network for Fire TV. 
Read more: One of Google's biggest spenders says there's a hole in Amazon's ad business
 While the rebrand was meant to group all of Amazon's advertising into one place, marketers still struggle to understand the company's sprawling amount of ad units across search, display and video. 
 ""A lot of their products are built in silos, and now they're saying, 'OK, let's try to bring it together,'"" said Todd Bowman, senior director of Amazon and eRetail at Merkle. ""It still is a very complex space though — there is explanation and education that needs to go into that."" 
 Still, Amazon's trove of data that details what consumers buy, search for and look at outside of Amazon gives it a massive edge, say marketers. 
 ""No other partner right has the level of depth from a consumer knowledge standpoint,"" said Sargi Mann, executive vice president of digital strategy and investments at Havas Media. ""We're definitely seeing an active trend of marketers getting comfortable with the idea that it's not just a performance platform, it's a brand awareness platform as well."" 
 Big brands that don't sell stuff on Amazon are starting to get on board 
 Amazon has long talked about the potential for ""non-endemic"" brands on its platform outside of its core retail and consumer-packaged-goods advertisers. Non-endemic brands don't sell items on Amazon — like financial services, automakers or travel agents. 
 This year, marketers got a hint that those brands may finally be testing advertising on Amazon, signaling that ad business is becoming more important for brand-building campaigns. 
 But because these brands don't sell items on Amazon, they're getting more creative with campaigns that use insights about consumer behavior. 
 ""I don't think it's purely as an ad-buying platform,"" said Mann. ""I think it has a role as an audience intelligence platform as well."" 
 In November, Audi worked with Amazon to dole out surprise test drives to Amazon Go shoppers in Seattle, and one shopper won a trip to Audi's headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany. 
 The Audi campaign is an example of how big brands are carving out specific ad budgets for Amazon, said Eric Heller, CEO of WPP-owned Marketplace Ignition. 
 ""It used to be that there was a brand, e-commerce and direct budgets, and what we're seeing is, a lot of that is melding,"" he said. 
 Video will be a big deal for Amazon in 2019 
 In August, Amazon began experimenting with video ads in mobile search results and is betting big on its rumored ad-supported Fire TV app in 2019, sources said. 
 ""Amazon has increased the inventory that they have,"" Merkle's Bowman said. ""It's almost like they're starting to get endless opportunities with Fire TV [and] the streaming capabilities that they have to put high-impact ads out there for some of those brands in non-endemic categories."" 
 Amazon's push into video advertising signals that it wants to be a bonafide advertising player, but the e-commerce platform is complicated for retailers. Brands that sell on Amazon need to handle all the basics of e-commerce like fulfillment and merchandising in addition to running paid ads. 
 ""While video is exciting, the vast majority of brands have so much low-hanging fruit that they can still fix,"" said Marketplace Ignition's Heller.

It could launch its own search engine to take on Google 
 One way that Amazon has chipped into ad budgets this year is through encroaching on Google search. CPG brands are shifting budgets from Google to Amazon because people search for specific brands when buying commodity goods. 
 For that reason, Amazon could consider building its own search engine next year, predicted Mark Douglas, CEO of SteelHouse, an ad-tech firm that provides media-buying tools to brands. 
 ""Right now, Amazon's search business is clearly in the context of a shopping experience,"" he said. ""I think the interesting thing would be if Amazon encroached more on search."" 
 Amazon's ad network is gaining traction 
 Amazon also runs a programmatic-like ad network that places ads on websites outside of Amazon, much like Google DoubleClick Bid Manager. 
 Agencies say marketers are seeing more interest in that arm of Amazon's business because the ads are served using Amazon's lucrative first-party data about consumers. 
 Trevor George, CEO of agency Blue Wheel Media, said that roughly 30% of its clients ran ads on Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) this year. He expects that number to hit 70% next year. 
 With the ad network, brands can hit a wide group of consumers across the internet who may not be immediately looking to buy something. 
 ""Getting access to Amazon's display program provides access to a unique network that's exclusive to Amazon,"" Merkle's Bowman said.","Amazon is gradually taking on Facebook and Google's dominance in digital advertising. Observers expect Amazon to boost its video, display and search ad products in 2019 and possibly even launch a search engine to take on Google.

https://fox13now.com/facebook/,"LEHI, Utah – Wildland firefighters from Lehi have been deployed to Colorado to help battle more than a dozen wildfires. Marshall Phillips, Aaron Fuller, and Sam Ashman had just finished fighting the Trail Mountain Fire in Emery County and two days later, they’re on a new assignment in Colorado. “Monday afternoon we got a resource order for our type 6 engine to report to Colorado,” said Jake Beck, Lehi Battalion Chief. “It’s a local Type 1 incident in Colorado. A Type 1 incident is the most complex wildfire incident which typically brings in the most qualified teams to run it.” While wildfires ravage parts of Utah, Beck says they committed to the Colorado assignment before the Dollar Ridge Fire became more intense. At least nine wildfires are raging in Colorado creating challenging conditions for crews. Hundreds of homes are under evacuation orders and structures have been destroyed. The Utah crew is being deployed to the High Chateau Fire in Teller County in the mountains west of Colorado Springs. As of Wednesday morning, it has burned nearly 1500 acres and is 35% contained. “They’re getting more urban interface fires. By looking at the complexities, and evacuations they have going on they’re probably going to be defending a lot of structures,” said Beck. Lehi firefighters will join 255 others on the ground in Colorado for the 2-week deployment. Once they arrive at the mobilization center, they’ll learn more about their duties. “More than likely, they’ll either be on the fire line for a couple of hours or they’ll put them down in camp. Tomorrow they’ll report to the fire line,” said Beck. It’s the type of mission they continually train for so they’re ready at a moments notice. “They’re the best we have in Lehi and we’re proud they’re going there and representing Utah and representing Lehi,” said Beck.","fox13now.com Lehi firefighters deployed to Colorado to battle raging wildfires fox13now.com LEHI, Utah – Wildland firefighters from Lehi have been deployed to Colorado to help battle more than a dozen wildfires.

He says the 42-year-old had extensive experience battling wildfires. Walker had no details about Burchett's death. Authorities say Burchett died Monday night at a hospital after being injured in the Mendocino Complex Fire north of San Francisco. He was one of five firefighters the city sent to California in early August. Fellow Battalion Chief Bart Vawdrey says Burchett had worked other large fires and was hired to oversee Draper's wildland firefighting efforts because of his experience. He says Burchett was a good man with a dry wit. ___ 8:45 a.m. Yosemite National Park officials say tourists returning after a nearly three-week closure could still face smoky air from a wildfire. Most of the park reopened Tuesday after flames burned in remote areas of Yosemite and left it shrouded in smoke during the height of tourist season. Park officials say a major road from the south, Highway 41, and a popular park attraction known as Glacier Point will remain closed for likely at least another week for fire operations. Despite the reopening, officials have warned that the air quality in Yosemite Valley has been poor and are recommending visitors reduce prolonged times outside or heavy exercise. ___ 12 a.m. Most of Yosemite National Park is set to reopen after a 20-day closure that cost the surrounding communities an estimated $50 million in lost tourism dollars. Yosemite Valley, which includes most of the park's major attractions, is set to reopen Tuesday but hotels and other businesses say it will likely be weeks before bookings return to normal levels. The nearly three-week closure was the result of a nearby massive wildfire that has burned 150 square miles and killed two firefighters since it started July 13. The blaze is one of several in California that in less than three weeks have destroyed more than 1,000 homes and killed at least a dozen people. The latest fatality was a Utah firefighter killed Monday in a blaze north of San Francisco.","LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Latest on wildfires burning across the U.S. West (all times local):

But seeing what it's like to escape for your life by driving right through a massive fire so that you can't see anything in front of you is absolutely terrifying. The fire spread so quickly ""80 football fields per minute,"" says The Guardian that some people barely escaped, while others have died. This video was taken by Brynn Parrott Chatfield, from the town of Paradise, which has been destroyed by the fire. The fire, which started Thursday morning around 6:30am, has burned over 20,000 acres so far, forcing ""about 50,000 people to evacuate,"" according to The Guardian. Via The Guardian: As CNN points out, over 2,200 firefighters are currently battling the Camp Fire and they face a tough road ahead. The combination of dry conditions and high winds are making this a particularly difficult fire to fight. Multiple fatalities have been reported but its not yet clear how many people might be dead. The exact number of injuries is also unknown and authorities still dont know what caused the blaze. The area burning from the massive Delta fire in Shasta County, California tripled in size overnight, scorching 15,294 acres and counting as of Thursday afternoon, per California fire authorities.

12 News,"PHOENIX - A Christmas Day standoff ended with the death of an 11-year-old girl and a baby. On Monday around 3:45 p.m., police officers responding to a shooting found a 38-year-old woman shot to death outside an apartment complex near Highland Avenue and 16th Street in Phoenix. Police surrounded the apartment complex as a 45-year-old man, later identified as Anthony Milan Ross, the woman's estranged husband, was barricaded inside one of the apartments with the couple's two children. During negotiations, which continued for hours, police said Ross threatened to kill the children. According to police, at one point he said he had already killed the children before changing his story to threats.

(Photo: Bianca Buono/12 News) Police said shortly after 10 p.m. officers deployed a robot into the apartment and found the 10-month-old baby dead. According to police, Ross started firing shots as officers continued using the robot to search for the 11-year-old girl inside the apartment. Officers entered the apartment and exchanged gunfire with Ross. An officer was injured in the exchange, but it's not clear whether he suffered a gunshot wound or was hit by shrapnel. Ross eventually surrendered, police said, and was taken into custody. He was not injured. The girl was found dead in the apartment. Sierra Scott was celebrating Christmas with family elsewhere when she got a frantic call from her mother. ""We don't know what's going on,"" said Sierra Scott. Her mom lives inside The Highland apartment complex. ""We were at Christmas dinner with my other family and she called me hysterical saying that she heard over 15 shots,"" said Scott. Scott rushed to the scene only to find dozens of police cars, armored trucks and fire engines. The streets surrounding the complex were completely shut down and her mom was unable to get out.

Associated Press,"(CLEARLAKE, Calif.) — A utility worker was killed near a Northern California wildfire as crews working in sweltering conditions battled multiple blazes, including twin fires that exploded in size and forced hundreds more to evacuate rural communities, officials said Sunday. The Pacific Gas and Electric employee was fatally injured in a vehicle-related accident Saturday on the western edge of the Carr Fire in Shasta County, said utility spokeswoman Melissa Subbotin. Jairus Ayeta, who was in his 20s, worked as an apprentice lineman and was part of a PG&amp;E crew working in “dangerous terrain” to restore power, she said. Ayeta is the seventh person to die in the immense blaze that has been burning for two weeks near Redding, where armies of firefighters and fleets of aircraft continue battling the flames about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of the Oregon state line. Two firefighters and four residents, including two children, were also killed. The fire was more than 40 percent contained Sunday. Meanwhile to the south, new evacuations were ordered Saturday evening near twin fires burning in Mendocino and Lake counties across wilderness on both sides of Clear Lake. Dry, hot winds fueled both blazes, which have collectively charred nearly 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers) of brush and timber. The entire so-called Mendocino Complex Fire is now one of the largest on record in the state, officials said. The Ranch Fire was just 22 percent contained and the River Fire was 50 percent contained. New evacuations were ordered in neighboring Glenn and Colusa counties, including an area just east of the boundary of Mendocino National Forest. Some 15,000 structures were threatened, 68 homes have been destroyed and at least a dozen are damaged, officials said. The fire remained several miles from the evacuated communities along the eastern shore of the lake, but “it looks like there’s dicey weather on the way,” California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Jane LaBoa said. Meteorologist Steve Anderson said wind gusts could reach 25 mph (40 kph) during the day Sunday. Temperatures will remain hot all week across much of the state including Southern California, where red flag warnings for increased fire danger are in place. Gov. Jerry Brown on Saturday toured Redding neighborhoods wiped out by flames and called on President Donald Trump to help California fight and recover from the devastating wildfire season. “The president has been pretty good on helping us in disasters, so I’m hopeful,” said Brown, a Democrat. “Tragedies bring people together.” Some areas on the fire’s southeastern flank were reopened to relieved residents. The Carr Fire, which incinerated 1,067 homes, started with sparks from the steel wheel of a towed-trailer’s flat tire, Department of Agriculture and Fire Prevention officials said. The fire burned slowly for days before winds suddenly whipped it up last week and drove it quickly through dry brush and trees. It burned so furiously on July 26 that it created what is called a fire whirl. The twirling tower of flame reached speeds of 143 mph (230 kph), which rivaled some of the most destructive Midwest tornados, National Weather Service meteorologist Duane Dykema said. The whirl uprooted trees and tore roofs from homes, Dykema said. There are at least 18 major fires burning throughout California, authorities said. In all, they have destroyed hundreds of homes, killed eight people — including two firefighters assisting in a wildfire near Yosemite National Park. Hundreds of colleagues, family and friends attended a memorial service Saturday in Fresno for National Forest Service Capt. Brian Hughes. He was killed July 29 by a falling tree while fighting the blaze that has closed Yosemite at the height of tourist season. Firefighters have achieved more than 40 percent containment of that fire, which had reached into remote areas of the country’s third-oldest national park.",Jairus Ayeta died working in 'dangerous terrain' of Carr fire,2018-08-05T19:40:17Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Death Toll in California’s Carr Wildfire Raises to 7 as Utility Worker Dies,http://time.com/5358253/utility-worker-death-california-carr-redding-wildfires/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/northern-california-fires.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Complex fire,1
Jason Gay,"Urban Meyer is suspended from Ohio State. Yes: the university says it has placed its head football coach on “paid administrative leave,” and surely there are crucial bureaucratic differences between we’re putting you on leave and we’re suspending you from work, but let’s not argue the impact. Meyer—one of the most celebrated coaches in college sports—is officially, stunningly, on ice. The issue is whether or not Meyer protected an assistant coach, Zach Smith, after domestic violence allegations were made against Smith. Meyer dismissed Smith last month after Smith’s ex-wife, Courtney Smith, obtained an order of protection against the former Buckeyes assistant coach. In the aftermath of the firing, Meyer admitted he’d known of a prior domestic violence allegation involving Smith and his former spouse from 2009, when Smith worked for Meyer at the University of Florida, but he said he’d been unaware of later allegations against Smith from 2015. Now Meyer’s account is under scrutiny. Former ESPN college football reporter Brett McMurphy reported Wednesday on a series of alleged texts and photos dating back to 2015 between Courtney Smith and Meyer’s spouse, Shelley, that detailed an alleged episode of violence. These new allegations— plus an interview of Courtney Smith by the digital sports outlet Stadium—challenge Meyer’s claim that he did not know about any of the 2015 allegations. It also raises the question as to whether Meyer failed to appropriately respond and report the case to school officials. It’s now on Ohio State to determine whether Meyer appropriately handled the matter, or knew about it at all. By Wednesday evening, at least one betting house was tackily predicting he’d be fired. Assistant Ryan Day will handle coaching duties in the meantime. There’s a lot that needs to be sorted out here, and Meyer has yet to be heard from, other than a statement saying he looked forward “to the resolution of this matter.” But whatever happens, this case is yet another reminder of a continued cultural blind spot: we spend far too much time deifying college sports coaches. Meyer’s spent a generation being presented as a towering figure in modern college football, practically a living statue. For years, both the media and the college football ecosystem have lionized his intensity, his work ethic, his meticulousness, his devotion…I could go on. Meyer is an undoubted success on the field—he’s brought national championships to both Ohio State and the University of Florida—but the characterization is almost mythological. Moments of personal vulnerability—a heart attack while at Florida—are presented as rare human aberrations, like slivers of Kryptonite. This is not just the story of Urban Meyer. This has been happening forever in big-time college sports. Some of it is structural—players come and go, but the coaches remain, the most victorious of them staying for decades. These living statues become a permanent part of campus, a flesh-and-blood version of a vine-covered library. Millions get made. Administrators bow. Alumni get nostalgic. Media partners develop pets, entangled with their subject, selling the fuzzy image, instead of presenting college sports for what it is in 2018: another cutthroat business, where the bottom line is the bottom line. Think of how often you’ve watched a college football or basketball game and heard the announcers rhapsodize about the coach as a virtual God. It’s absurd, a ludicrous standard. It’s also fraught. Over time, the powerful college coach may evolve into his or her own self-policing nation state. They become hard to discipline, much less fire. It’s an attractive status for a coach to aspire to, but in the end, it’s a disaster for everyone. We’ve seen it again and again— a literal statue went up and came down at Penn State—and we may see another falling to earth in Columbus. Did another college program believe it knew best? There are allegations in Courtney Smith’s account—her claims in her Stadium interview that her abuse was met with inaction by people close to her—that are truly heartbreaking. But they’re painfully familiar. Domestic violence is an epidemic, and yet silence is too often the response. It’s not hard to see the conflict between a serious allegation and a workplace incentivized to protect itself. That’s not merely a college football thing. That’s everywhere. The good news is that the rest of the culture is showing signs of accelerating past the slow-crawling sports world. I don’t want to give us too much credit for evolving—as the past year has shown, in case after case, from the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to the conviction of Larry Nassar, this remains a culture sadly conditioned to doubt or diminish women on matters of abuse and violence. But there’s a growing recognition that allegations need to be treated seriously, with urgency, by leaders prepared to act. That’s it. That’s the human standard that college sports—and everyone else—needs to live up to. Meanwhile, let’s stop building statues.

"WUSA-TV, Washington, Arielle Buchmann, WUSA-TV, Washington","In this Sept. 19 photo, firefighters pour water on a fire at the Arthur Capper Senior Building, an apartment building that houses senior citizens. Engineers made a startling discovery while inspecting the wreck of the fire-damaged public housing complex: A 74-year-old tenant, alive and well, five days after the whole building was supposedly evacuated. (Photo: Alex Brandon, AP) WASHINGTON, D.C. An elderly man was found alive and apparently with a ""sense of humor"" inside of a D.C. senior apartment building five days after a fire broke out causing more than 100 residents to be displaced. Crews hired to evaluate the safety of the structure located 74-year-old Raymond Holton Monday morning sitting inside of his apartment in the building that caught on fire last Wednesday. Officials believe he is a resident of the second floor senior living community and had been in the building since the fire happened. Despite the situation, Holton made a joke when crews arrived, saying he ""wasn't going any place."" Holton was in ""incredibly good shape"" and told crews that he wanted to walk out of the building on his own. Crews helped Holton, who had non-life-threatening injuries, into a kitchen chair and then carried him out of the building so he could be taken to the hospital. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the search has now been turned over to DC Fire and EMS and ATF. Officials are working to reverify that everybody has in fact been accounted for. This comes after Bowser confirmed during a press conference last week that all tenants in the building were accounted for and were able to make it out of the building. Officials used a list provided by Edgewood Management Company to determine who had gotten out. More: Bedsores, neglect, alleged abuse: Inside low-rated VA nursing homes A primary search, ""where they bang on doors, check apartments etc.,"" was done in the complex last week, however, Bowser said they ""cannot say specifically what happened to this particular unit."" She did say that the 74-year-old man didn't show up on at least one of the rent roll lists from the management company. The fire chief added that a secondary search was not possible due to rubble and items collapsing in the building and that there. ""There is a chance that an apartment or two may have been missed as this was going on,"" the chief elaborated. ""Discipline is not the issue here, it's really looking a what else we need to do to accomplish what we need to accomplish."" The city is rechecking on about 30 residents who were displaced and are believed to be with family members. Crews will also be rechecking every unit and K9s will also be assisting in the search. They now have all the tools to ""open doors if they have to."" Arthur Capper Senior Apartment is a new senior community in Capitol Hill that was completed in 2007. The five-story building houses senior citizens and has 162 apartments.
