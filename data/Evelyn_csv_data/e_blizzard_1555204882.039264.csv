David Lumb,"New adventures are waiting for you! Play BLIZZARD WORLD now on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. pic.twitter.com/XLXVLRcaRr — Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) January 23, 2018 The map is a hybrid type that starts as point capture and switches to escort, much like Numbani. Otherwise, Blizzard World is a visual delight, creating rides and zones patterned after particular locations and events (like boss battles or raids) from Blizzard's roster of games. Plus a few great puns (like Snaxxramus and The Lost and Found Vikings). But it's also a not-so-subtle homage to Disney's parks: Sleeping Beauty's Castle, the centerpiece of Disneyland and Disneyworld, is replaced by WarCraft's Stormwind Keep, while the lake with Darkmoon Ferris Wheel clearly resembles the waterfront section of Disney's California Adventure. Heck, all the attraction posters around the map imitate the modern 50s-era look of those that still line Disney's parks. There's more than just a map in this update. Players get 100 new cosmetic items to find in loot boxes. 17 of those are new skins: Some are homages themselves to characters in other Blizzard games, like Barbarian Zarya or Nova Widowmaker, while others are from Overwatch short animations, like Crusader Reinhardt or Ecopoint: Antarctica Mei. The other 83 are standard loot box fare, from emotes to highlight intros to sprays. Note that these are additions to the core cosmetics pool, meaning they aren't event-bound and can be earned year-round.","Back at Blizzcon 2017, Blizzard's big announcement for its hero shooter Overwatch was a new character Moira -- at long last, another healer for the lineup.

Saqib Shah,"""We believe that this change will bring up the overall level of competition, which will serve to better hone Contenders players and provide more entertaining matches,"" explained Blizzard. It's also shaking things up by splitting North America into two regions (NA West and NA East), each with eight teams, bringing the total number of regions to eight. Additional changes include a ""soft region lock"" to encourage teams to recruit local talent after Korea's Lucky Future Zenith dominated season 1 and 2. The change will restrict teams to just three import slots. And from 2019, only Overwatch Academy teams will be guaranteed a spot in their respective Contenders division, while those not linked to an Overwatch League franchise may have to re-qualify. However, Blizzard made no mention of the leaks from VPEsports, which claimed that Contenders would no longer feature any offline playoffs. Dot Esports notes that the lack of LAN events is ""concerning"" for players, with Norweigian pro Jørgen ""Decod"" Myrlund adding that the removal of LAN and earlier third-party LANs has been ""slowing down"" Overwatch.",Blizzard has officially announced the modifications it's making to Overwatch Contenders 2019 following the leak of some of the most divisive changes.

Jon Fingas,"The Open Division, designed for solo queue players, is also giving you a better chance at glory. Whenever a Contenders season ends, the leading four Open Season teams in a given region will be invited to compete in the Contenders Trials (whose first season starts in February) and potentially guarantee a spot in the next season. You don't have to fully invest yourself in a team to draw attention, in other words. It's no shocker as to why Blizzard would do this. A more direct path to paid competition might not only encourage more Overwatch play, but lure players who would otherwise stick to third-party leagues. It's hard to knock the move, though, as it could foster eSports interest among gamers who'd otherwise be daunted or might not realize that pro play was an option.","It's tempting to compete for a spot in the Overwatch League -- make it big and you could earn a solid income from your Mercy or Reinhardt skills.

AJ Dellinger,"According to Blizzard, Overwatch League will conduct full reviews of player conduct and history as new gamers are picked up by teams. If any of those players are determined to have broken league rules, those actions will be reviewed and disciple will be handed down based on the severity and recency of the violation. The Overwatch League will evaluate infractions over the course of the season and take additional action when needed.
Players who are not currently on an Overwatch League team but could face suspensions or fines if they return to league play are not listed. Players who served penalties while playing in Contenders usually aren't subject to additional discipline when joining the Overwatch League, Blizzard said.
While the Overwatch League has been a considerable success, player conduct has been a major concern. The league handed out a number of suspensions and fines for players who behaved in an inappropriate manner on personal streams and broadcasts.

Saqib Shah,"Blizzard president J. Allen Brack and chief development officer Ray Gresko wrote: ""The love that the community has for these programs is deeply felt by everyone who works on them, but we ultimately feel this is the right decision versus moving forward in a way that would not meet the standards that players and fans have come to expect."" HOTS has been live since 2015 and released its 2.0 update in April, 2017, as a much-needed overhaul that brought with it upgrades to the player progression system, random-reward loot boxes, and the addition of Overwatch 's teen mecha-piloting pop star, D.Va. After two years of being aired on ESPN, the Heroes of the Dorm tournament was streamed exclusively on Facebook Live last year. Despite Blizzard's assurances that it will continue to actively support HOTS with new updates, events and characters, the double blow throws doubt over its future. If it's not being developed to maintain a huge audience and losing its competitive series, it could end up dying a slow death.

Kate Clark,"Founder and chief executive Jack Dorsey says Square has poached Amrita Ahuja from Blizzard Entertainment, a division of the gaming company Activision Blizzard, to lead finance at the merchant services and mobile payments company.
Ahuja will join Square later this month, about three months after long-time Square chief financial officer Sarah Friar exited the company in favor of a CEO opportunity at Nextdoor, a neighborhood social networking site. Friar, often described as Dorseys right-hand woman, joined Square in 2012 and led the startup through an initial public offering that valued the company at about $3 billion.
Prior to an eight-year stint at Blizzard, Ahuja clocked in a few years at Fox Networks Group, the Walt Disney Company and Morgan Stanley, where she was an analyst in the investment banking division.

Jamie Rigg,"Weird and wonderful maps that offer all kinds of different game types and training grounds are a staple of the Starcraft II multiplayer experience, thanks to Blizzard including a map editor with the game. There's an 'Arcade' section dedicated to these community creations already, but a new premium category is being added to showcase the new, paid custom maps. Only two will be available at launch, including ""ARK Star,"" a turn-based RPG set in the StarCraft universe that looks like a game in and of itself. Joining that will be ""Direct Strike,"" which is an evolution of an existing, popular custom map called ""Desert Strike HotS."" This game has players picking different unit compositions to send out in waves with the hope of besting the enemy's army and pushing through to their base. Because people are already playing Direct Strike under a different name, it'll be free. It will, however, include a number of special modes you have to pay to unlock. Both custom maps will sell for $5, with an unspecified share of that going to the creators. In late 2017, Blizzard decided to make StarCraft II 's first campaign and all multiplayer elements free, ahead of the game's 20th anniversary this year. Though the custom map marketplace is many, many years late, it does give Blizzard an opportunity to cash in on any new players it's attracted over the past few months.

Perfect, right? So efficient! But most Recruit cards are conditional (e.g. only bringing creatures of a certain cost), so you'll have to build your decks carefully. As mentioned, each class gets its own legendary-quality weapon, most of which have powerful or lingering effects that make them useful for far more than whacking enemies. There are also two new card types. Spellstones are spells that increase in power after certain conditions are met keyed to your class (suffer damage as a Warlock, etc), and once powered up, can swing the game in your favor. In keeping with the expansion's Dungeons and Dragons -esque theme, the other new cards are Unidentified Items, which randomly adopt one of four upgrades every game. The single-player mode, Dungeon Run, will excite players who have mourned the absence of solo content after Blizzard switched to releasing only full expansions this year. Previously, they interspersed larger 135-card releases with smaller 45-content drops called Adventures that centered around player-versus-computer experiences. To make up for it, Blizzard promised to add free solo content to the new full expansions, beginning with the previous release Knights of the Frozen Throne. Whether that makes up for how much more expensive it is to keep up with the game without the far-cheaper Adventures is up to each player. Kobolds and Catacombs is the last of 2017's three planned expansions.

Greg Kumparak,"Blizzard the company behind massive game titles like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Hearthstone is getting new leadership. After 27 years, Blizzard President Mike Morhaime is stepping down from the company he co-founded back in 1991 (back when it was known as Silicon and Synapse.) J. Allen Brack, previously Senior Vice President and Executive Producer on WoW, will now lead the company. Brack has been with Blizzard since 2006. In a letter about the transition, Brack also mentions that Blizzard co-founder (and the original lead designer of WoW) Allen Adham will be joining the company’s executive team to “oversee development of several new games”. Adham left Blizzard in 2004 shortly before WoW went live, which he later called his “biggest mistake”. Morhaime doesn’t say much about his reason for departure, besides that he’s “decided it’s time for someone else to lead Blizzard Entertainment”. He’ll stay on with the company as a strategic advisor.","Blizzard — the company behind massive game titles like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Hearthstone — is getting new leadership.

Jason Abbruzzese,"""World of Warcraft""— an iconic game recognized in homes around the world, a name that resonates beyond the gaming community, a whole world of magical and mystical adventures. Blizzard Entertainment employs the creative geniuses behind WoW, Overwatch and Diablo, some of the top-selling games of all time with some of the strongest fanbases around. Blizzard has not only created an entire community around their online games, but they’ve built their own world within their campus too. Blizzard HQ is a place where you’re more likely to see a costume than a suit, a world where creative, hard work wins the day, an environment where the feats of engineering rival those in Silicon Valley. This is a team that lives by the passion they have for what they’re doing –– and when you’re building video games from the ground up, not sure how anyone could get bored! In order to source the most creative, risk-taking minds the world has to offer, Blizzard has to compete with major tech companies for top talent ranging from artists and managers, to engineers and game designers. I sat down with Alice White, Vice President of Global Talent Acquisition at Blizzard, to hear what Blizzard looks for in building their dream teams and how they stay one level ahead of the competition. RB: Blizzard not only makes really unique games, but also seems to have a really unique culture. What are the three traits you always look for in a candidate to ensure they’re the right fit? AW: Open, hardworking, and the ability to listen first. Blizzard is an accepting environment where we really embrace our inner geek. In a pocket of Orange County, we are our own unique world. We take casual to a whole new level –– I saw a baby wolf on campus just the other week! If that’s going to freak you out, then Blizzard probably isn’t the right fit. But just because we’re super casual doesn’t mean it’s not a driven work environment. I wouldn’t describe Blizzard as laid back — we churn out amazing high quality, high volume work. In order to make great creative content, you have to work really hard, and we need people who understand that. Lastly, I’d say that we look for an ability to listen first and build relationships. Being able to listen first and engage in conversation that allows you to build relationships with teams helps to strengthen our ability to work together and ultimately drives further success. The Takeaway: Be open, work hard, and remember the value in listening first. RB: Absolutely, important qualities in any candidate! How do you know when you’ve found that in a candidate? AW: As a company, we really put a strong focus on our core values, which are laid out and well defined. They’re quite literally carved in a circle around a statue at the front of our campus! One of the first things we look for in a candidate is to see if they share the same values and are as passionate about them as we are. Game play is at our core, and everything else derives from that. We strive to make our experiences as fun for as many people as possible. Being dialed in and authentic to who you are can come from the ability to embrace your inner geek. We design our interview questions to get at each of our core values. We want to find people who can not only do their job, but do it in a way that clicks with our broader team and preserves the strong culture we’ve built here. The Takeaway: Convey your values and passion. RB: Blizzard surely has a huge range of candidates applying, so what makes someone stand out to you? Their cover letter or portfolio? AW: Cover letters began in the days of paper resumes. With the change from paper to digital and the evolution of competition in the tech industry, we’re playing catch up in the recruiting world. The email you send to a recruiter with you resume is one example of a replaced cover letter. Depending on the role you’re applying for, what you’re submitting can look dramatically different from a resume and cover letter –– for example, engineers typically have code sites that host examples of their work and a portfolio link is extremely important for filling a creative role. At Blizzard, what we’re looking for no matter the role is seeing what you’ve been able to accomplish in your previous work environments. Candidates that have clear markers of past success helps us see how their experience would translate here. The Takeaway: Cover letters may be dead, but highlighting your experience never will be. RB: And finally, I have to ask. What’s your biggest piece of career advice for young professionals? AW: Save up enough money early on in your career that you have enough to cover one month of expense so that you’re not living paycheck to paycheck, so that you have the ability to quit a job you hate. You should never feel like you have to stay in a job where you’re not happy. It doesn’t take as long as you think to find a new job when you’re young and it’s important to get away from a toxic culture before it changes your outlook. I’d also say, don’t be afraid of risk and don’t underestimate yourself. Early on, if you think you’d be interested in a new career path, hunker down and do the research. Looking at actual jobs or companies rather than just picking a general field or major can paint you a better picture of steps you can take to achieve your goals. There are tools out there that can give you insight into what people actually do. People say “follow your passion” but sometimes that’s the last thing you want to hear because you don’t know what it is! Many people are LOOKING for that passion still, and need something more tangible to hold on to. So get closer to finding yours sooner by seeking out a job where you could see yourself thriving. The Takeaway: Take tangible steps to build your dream job. Working in a relaxed environment that values individuality means having the ability to be open and accepting. Though that welcoming nature doesn’t negate the importance of hard work, your dedication to your craft and the culture can go hand in hand when you value building relationships with your coworkers. Conveying your passion not only for the position you’re applying, but for the company’s values, shows the recruiter how you’d be the right fit for the role. While cover letters are becoming a thing of the past, remembering to engage with the recruiting team, show some personality as well as metrics behind your experience provides more color to your resume (and portfolio). And sometimes fulfillment in a job can come from the tenacity to seek it out, and make it happen for yourself. +++ Rachel is Chief People Officer at Jobvite, a.k.a., head honcho of finding and keeping the geniuses who work there.

Julie Muncy,"Happy New Year! We're back at it, with more thrilling game news. Some Blizzard alums are joining Marvel's slate of developers, a competitive player is not getting what they deserve, and big corporate shakeups roil the international market. So, really, about the same as 2018. Let's get to it.
A Group of Former Hearthstone Devs Are Embracing the Marvel Method
When the corporate going gets tough, the tough start their own game company. Recently, Ben Brode, the former director of Blizzard's card game juggernaut Hearthstone, quit his role and founded a studio called Second Dinner. As is tradition, he brought some Blizzard buds along with him, and today the company announced an infusion of investment capital and a first project: a Marvel game.
Precisely what kind of Marvel game is not clear at this time, nor is it clear if it'll be of the card variety. With the pedigree here, though, it certainly wouldn't be a longshot. Interestingly, as Kotaku reports, the investment money comes from another Blizzard-related entity: NetEase, the Chinese company co-developing that mobile Diablo game everyone got so mad about. Small, Blizzard-y world, I guess.
Another Overwatch Controversy Shows the Ugly Side of Competitive Gaming (Again)
While we're on the subject of Blizzard, things are not all well in the world of competitive Overwatch. A streamer and Overwatch player named Ellie joined an Overwatch Contenders team called the Second Wind. (The Blizzard-run Contenders league functions as a sort of farm system for high-level players to get recruited by Overwatch League, Blizzard's pro esports entity.) Then, well, the internet happened. There were doxxing threats; a few competitive players publicly questioned her credentials, even claiming she wasn't the person playing the game during her own matches. Not long after joining the team, she quit.
This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it won't be the last. To put it bluntly, videogames have a long way to go before they can claim to be even remotely safe for womenespecially in esports and other competitive settings. And every time a promising player endures treatment like this, it makes it harder for the next person to come along. Whatever the opposite of a virtuous cycle is, you're looking at it with the Overwatch community.
South Korea's Biggest Gaming Company Hits the Market
One of the biggest game companies in Asia is Nexon, a Tokyo-based firm that has become one of the largest presences in gaming in South Korea. Now, as reported by Gamasutra, its founder, Kim Jung-ju, is putting his commanding share of the company's stock up for sale, putting one of the most important players in that region's gaming market up for sale.
Nexon operates extremely popular mobile games like MapleStory, and has also been responsible for bringing Western and Japanese titles to the South Korean market. It's early on, but whoever comes to own this company will instantly gain immense power in the Korean market. Rumored contenders include Tencent and Electronic Arts.
Recommendation of the Week: Kingdom Hearts, on PlayStation 2/3/4
Over the holidays this year, I decided to revisit a classic: In advance of the upcoming, long-long-long-awaited Kingdom Hearts 3, I went back to the original. In its PlayStation 4 HD re-release, I found a game that was much less rough than I expected. With the exception of a wonky camera, it holds up remarkably well as a goofy, lighthearted action role-playing game, with responsive, chunky combat and a delightful sense of wonder. As the beginning of a long, bizarre series of games about friendship, Disney characters, and creeping existential despair, it's a strange and essential document of modern gaming history. And as a game? It's an absolute blast.

Andrew Webster,"Blizzard’s team shooter Overwatch is hitting a major milestone today with the official unveiling of Baptiste, the game’s 30th hero. Baptiste is a support character described as a “combat medic” who uses an array of gadgets to aid his team in battle. That includes a device called an immortality field that prevents nearby allies from dying, healing grenades, and Baptiste’s ultimate ability, described as “a matrix that doubles the damage and healing effects of friendly projectiles that pass through it.” The reveal follows a few days of teasing, including a short trailer yesterday. Baptiste joins an ever-growing cast of characters for the colorful shooter; last year saw the addition of the well-armored engineer Brigitte, a Wild West gunslinger called Ashe, and everyone’s favorite hamster Wrecking Ball. According to lead hero designer Geoff Goodman, the concept for Baptiste started around the idea of a “gadget healer” character. “We were playing with various gameplay concepts around deploying gadgets / devices as a way to support and heal your team,” Goodman tells The Verge. “From a pure gameplay standpoint, this hero was built to both give support players new options and gameplay to support their team, and also to appeal to players who might not play support often.” Baptiste joins a crowded field of Overwatch characters, and Goodman admits that it’s “an increasing challenge” to come up with new heroes that feel distinct. “We’re always wary about making heroes that overlap too much and don’t feel unique enough to stand on their own,” he says. That said, the designer believes that Baptiste’s unique healing abilities, combined with his combat skills — which include “an accurate hit-scan 3-round burst rifle” as a primary weapon — should provide plenty of new strategic options for players. Right now, high-level Overwatch play is dominated by a particular composition that combines three damage-absorbing tank characters with a trio of healing supports. It’s known as “goats,” and it’s particularly prevalent in the Overwatch League at the moment. Interestingly, Goodman doesn’t see Baptiste fitting particularly well in this composition; instead, the new support hero might shake things up a bit. “I think we’ll see Baptiste played with Ana for some longer range damage dealing and damage boost ultimate comboing,” says Goodman. “Ana can also fire through his ‘amplification matrix’ and get both boost healing and boosted damage, depending on who she hits. I also think its possible we’ll see Baptiste paired with Bastion, which can be really scary when you can buy him precious time with ‘immortality field’ and boost his already scary damage with ‘amplification matrix.’” (Goodman says that the design team has “an open line of communication with [professional] players, which can be helpful to gain their perspective of the game. Ultimately though, we’re designing heroes for everyone and hope players of all levels enjoy playing them.”) As for how Baptiste fits into the ever-evolving Overwatch lore, Blizzard describes him as a former soldier with a tragic childhood, who was forced to join the infamous Talon mercenary group. But when he realized the group was up to no good, he had trouble leaving. Per Blizzard: Talon would not let him go. Baptiste knew too much, and they sent operatives after him to silence him. Agent after agent came for him, including Baptiste’s former comrades. To stay under the radar, Baptiste drifted from place to place, aiding in humanitarian efforts around the globe. The few Talon members who managed to track him down were never seen again. Now, Baptiste works toward a better world, healing where he can and fighting when he must. He knows that he cannot undo his past — but that making a difference now is what matters. Or you can just watch yesterday’s teaser. Luckily you won’t have to wait long to try out the intriguing hero; Baptiste is available in beta today through Overwatch ’s public test region, with a full release to follow after.",Today Blizzard revealed the latest hero for its online shooter Overwatch: a character named Baptiste who uses an array of healing gadgets to offer new strategy for support players.,2019-02-26T19:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Overwatch’s 30th hero Baptiste is here to shake things up,https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/26/18234492/overwatch-baptiste-hero-reveal,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bi-q_IcQYXp3Sn11bdzJSz2Hm78=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14121846/OVR_Baptiste_Intro.png,the-verge,The Verge,blizzard,1
Andrew Webster,"Just ahead of the Overwatch League’s debut season, Blizzard and Twitch announced a multiyear deal that would see every match of e-sports league broadcast on the streaming service. Now, the two companies are revealing a series of features designed to further enhance the viewing experience and offer bonuses to those who watch on Twitch. For fans who “cheer” in Twitch chat (cheering involves using animated chat emotes purchased with real money ) during matches, they’ll have a chance to earn in-game items like rare character skins and exclusive new emotes. Viewers will also have a chance to earn “league tokens” — a form of virtual currency in Overwatch exclusively used to buy in-game league jerseys — simply by watching matches through to the end. (You’ll also need to connect your Battle.net and Twitch accounts.) Outside of those features, Twitch says it’s also “developing a VIP ticket to the best of the Overwatch League that unlocks even more in-game items, behind-the-scenes video content on Twitch, and plenty of other perks to be announced.” The partnership between Twitch and Blizzard runs through the league’s first two seasons, with ESPN reporting that the deal is worth an estimated $90 million. According to Blizzard, more than 10 million people watched Overwatch League matches during its opening week in January, with an average audience of 280,000 viewers over that span.

David Murphy,"It’s a big day today for World of Warcraft, the massive multiplayer online game from Blizzard Entertainment. The game’s seventh expansion officially kicks off at 3 pm (PT) for North American players, ensuring many a geek will be skipping dinner tonight—or ordering in—as they devour as much content as they can get before bedtime. If you’ve seen or heard people getting excited for World of Warcraft because it’s “getting back to its roots,” thanks to a renewed focus on the shared hatred between the game’s two major factions—Horde and Alliance—in its new Battle for Azeroth expansion, maybe you’re tempted to sign up and give the game a whirl. Or, if you haven’t played in years, perhaps you’re curious to see what’s changed. Spoiler: A lot has changed. It can feel daunting to jump into a huge world of which you know very little, and World of Warcraft is gigantic. You will feel overwhelmed if you just rush in. As a returning player who used to write for the freakin’ World of Warcraft magazine (RIP), even I find it hard to figure out exactly where to get started adventuring if I haven’t played the game for a while. No matter your experience level—whether you’re about to experience the thrill of hearing the Stormwind City theme as you walk through its epic gates for the first time, or whether you can spell Ahn’Qiraj off the top of your head—here are some tips and suggestions for making the most of your new life in the World of Warcraft ( or your epic, Illidan-like return to Azeroth.) Watching your way through World of Warcraft Let’s start with the basics. At its core, World of Warcraft is a grand, spiraling saga centered on two warring factions: the aforementioned Horde and Alliance. They’ve been fighting each other since the days of MS-DOS, locked a never-ending war—save for those rare moments where they attempt to team up to counter a greater threat—that has taken them across continents, into space, and through time. If that all sounds confusing, that’s perfectly understandable. Thankfully, there are some fantastic videos you can watch to catch yourself up to speed on the 14-year journey that is World of Warcraft. Grab your lunch, take out your phone, plug in your headphones (important), and let Blizzard’s experts help you through the game’s considerable lore: If you need the abridged version, because you’d rather spend an hour in a game than hearing someone talk about a game, you can also check out the excellent “New &amp; Returning Player Guides” series from YouTuber (and World of Warcraft expert) Bellular. And you probably even skip the bits about ”how to purchase” or “how to install” the game, saving you even more time for new World of Warcraft adventures: You can also kick up your feet and watch your way through World of Warcraft’s story via Blizzard’s incredible cinematics—one of the company’s cornerstones. Sure, you’ll be spoiling yourself for parts of the game you have yet to uncover, and you might not know the importance of the various characters you’re watching, but you’ll at least get a pretty good sense of how World of Warcraft operates. Also, did we mention that Blizzard’s cinematics are gorgeous? We’d rather watch these than the Warcraft movie, that’s for sure. World of Warcraft resources worth reading for new players If you’d rather read than watch, there are also plenty of resources you can use to acclimate yourself to World of Warcraft, figure out what to do next, and ask questions when you’re feeling stuck. For the basics, I recommend reviewing Wowhead’s “ Guide on How to Play World of Warcraft,” which is definitely worth scanning if you’re new to massively multiplayer online games or just want to get a sense of how Blizzard’s approach differs from others you’ve played. Blizzard also has a handy New Player’s Guide, split into four major sections, as well as its “ A Return to World of Warcraft ” compendium. And be sure to check out Blizzard’s online forums, especially the New Player Help and Guides forum, where you’ll be able to find more information, ask questions, and engage with some of the World of Warcraft community’s most helpful members. It’s been nearly 14 years since Blizzard launched the world’s most popular massively multiplayer… Read more Read Take advantage of World of Warcraft’s Starter Edition and Class Trials As Kotaku’s own Mike Fahey notes in his own epic new player guide, one of the most important tips new (or returning) World of Warcraft players should know is that you don’t actually have to buy the game. That’s right. You don’t have to spend a single penny to play World of Warcraft. Download the game right now, create an account (a new one; not your old one, if you were a previous player), and you’ll be able to level your character all the way to 20 for free. There are other annoying limitations placed on this free experience, but it’s still a great way to familiarize yourself with the world, see if you enjoy the experience as much as you were hoping, and get a feel for the different classes before you settle on a main one to play as for the next 100 levels’ worth of gaming. If you’re a returning player, consider paying for a month’s worth of playing time—a mere $15—and using the game’s newer Class Trials to see if you still have that spark for higher-level play. While you can also go the “ Starter Edition ” route for a free, limited romp through Azeroth, you might need a little more than the newbie zones to help you decide whether you want to play through the game’s latest expansion. Find friends to adventure with Even though you will invariably do a bit of soloing during your time in World of Warcraft, the game is a lot more fun when you have other people to interact with. Whether you’re starting out, or getting back into the swing of things, having helpful mentors feeding you suggestions (or gear, or gold) doesn’t hurt, either. The /r/wownoob subreddit is a good place to find friends to quest with, as is the main World of Warcraft subreddit (and don’t forget its helpful “ Murloc Monday ” thread for newbie Q&amp;A). You can try joining a Discord server themed around the class you’re playing, how you like to play World of Warcraft (achievement hunting, dungeon-running, player-versus-player combat, etc.), or your location, to name a few examples. World of Warcraft also has player communities built directly into the game. Find a community themed for newbies, or whatever else you want, and you’ll have a great resource to go to with questions. You might even make a few friends (or fellow adventurers). Getting ready for Battle of Azeroth: the nitty-gritty We’ve spent a lot of time focusing on those with less experience in the nuances of World of Warcraft. If you’re a player who generally knows how to get around the game—or did at one point—you’re probably still going to feel a little stuck if it’s been a decent amount of time since you last played. For example, why does your favorite weapon no longer work the way it used to? What’s the latest currency you have to know about? Should you ever waste time hanging out in your Garrison again? If you’re jumping back in for Battle for Azeroth, we recommend checking out the big “what to do first” guide from Wowhead. You’re also going to want to brush up on specific advice for your class—both Icy Veins and Wowhead have incredibly detailed guides for all of the game’s combinations of classes and specializations. Make sure you go in and figure out all the new (or changed) talents you’ll be using, and start to memorize a typical combat rotation so you don’t die nearly as much in game’s latest incarnation. There are also a number of different online tools you can use to make yourself a better World of Warcraft player—and to help you decide what to focus on. Wowhead has a great Attunement Tool that shows you how close you are to unlocking significant milestones in the game, like unlocking new allied races, earning reputations with key factions (which will ultimately help you unlock faster mount speed and other goodies in the game’s expansion), and how far along you are in your dungeons and raids. If you just care about unlocking the ability to fly in the new expansion, the site’s Pathfinder tool is a must-bookmark. Its Character Planner is also incredibly useful for getting a sense of what you could (or should) do next, based on your recent activity, the gear you’re wearing (and would like to upgrade), achivements you’re close to unlocking, et cetera. If you want a simpler guide, the site also has a great list of all the activities you should be doing each day and week in Battle for Azeroth. We’re also big fans of Simple Armory, which gives you a similar look at your overall progression in the entire game, as well as a gorgeous, detailed graphical listing of all the achievements you’ve unlocked, as well as the mounts, companions, pets, and toys you’ve collected. The site makes it incredibly easy to see what you still have to get, if you’re a completionist. If you’re looking to fill out your collection of mounts, the site will even create a handy, optimized guide of how you should spend your day (or week) adventuring to acquire them all. A number of World of Warcraft fans have also made their own handy guides that you can follow when starting out in the game’s latest expansion—a perfect reason to run a dual-monitor setup, right? And, of course, there are plenty of in-game addons you can use to make your adventures in Azeroth even more efficient. Try checking out Azeroth Auto Pilot, which points you where to go, handles all your NPC discussions and quest turn-ins, and automatically sells your junk gear (among other features). Deadly Boss Mods is still a must-have, so you don’t die in dungeons quite so quickly. Pawn helps you tell whether the gear you’re getting is actually an upgrade or not. World Quests List gives you a much better way to see what’s happening in your zone (and sort for the rewards you’re prioritizing). MapCoords will help you figure out where to go when players in your zone say there’s a special Fortnite -like air drop nearby. And, of course, if you’re big into player-versus-player combat...","It’s a big day today for World of Warcraft, the massive multiplayer online game from Blizzard Entertainment.

Julia Alexander,"Blizzard’s beautiful cinematics have long caught people’s attention when they debut at BlizzCon, the publisher’s annual convention, and this year’s shorts stole the show once again. World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch all received their own cinematic shorts, teasing new players, worlds, and experiences for fans of the franchises. Overwatch’ s latest short focused on McCree, the game’s popular, roughneck cowboy character. (It’s an appropriate choice considering Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2, arguably the biggest game of 2018, came out last week.) Blizzard also debuted the trailer and cinematic short for its first full-fledged mobile Diablo game called Diablo: Immortal. Overwatch’ s short was by far Blizzard’s most interesting, introducing a new playable hero named Ashe. But don’t discount the others just yet: World of Warcraft’ s short set up the next chapter in the Alliance and Horde’s continuing battle, while Heroes of the Storm’ s short introduced a new playable hero named Orphea. Ashe, the leader of the Deadlock gang, also received her own standalone trailer as Overwatch’ s new hero, showing off her unique skills in action. All of the cinematic shorts that premiered at BlizzCon can be seen below.

Jon Fingas,"There's no mention of when you can expect to see Baptiste in action. Blizzard historically introduces heroes shortly before they appear in the Public Test Realm, though. If you're willing to be an early adopter, you can likely check out his abilities in the near future.
The timing may be more important than it has in the past. The second season of Overwatch League kicked off earlier in the month (albeit with a rough start), and the Paris map debuted shortly before that. More importantly, there's fresh competition. While a title like Apex Legends is fundamentally different, there's a real chance it's drawing the attention of some Overwatch players given its early popularity. Baptiste might give them a reason to come back, if just to see what's new.","Overwatch fans only have a handful of options for healers, but they're about to get one more.

Chaim Gartenberg,"Blizzard and Lego showed off the first Overwatch Lego set last month in the form of a limited-edition Bastion figure, and now at BlizzCon the two companies are taking the wraps off the rest of the lineup. There are a total of six sets coming from the two companies: a $14.99 Tracer vs. Widowmaker set, a $19.99 Hanzo vs. Genji set, a $29.99 Dorado Showdown set, a $39.99 D.Va & Reinhardt set, an even bigger $49.99 Bastion model (which fixes the first version by adding a conversion to turret mode), and an $89.99 Watchpoint: Gibraltar set. The first wave of sets will feature Lego versions of Tracer, Widowmaker, Hanzo, Genji, Soldier: 76, McCree, D.Va, Reinhardt, Pharah, Mercy, Reaper, and Winston to start, but if Lego’s other licensed lines are anything to go by, odds are more heroes will be available soon.

JASON SCHREIER,"So far, progress has been slow. While game workers have become more likely to voice support for unionization on social media and in private gatherings, no major studio in the United States has seen an attempt to organize yet.
I dont work in video games, but as a journalist who writes about them and is part of a union, Ive seen the benefits of organization firsthand. In 2018, our union was able to negotiate the layoffs many of my colleagues faced into buyouts. Like journalists, workers in the video game industry will be better off when they are able to leverage their talent and experience to demand better conditions from the executives who profit off their work.
One common argument by critics of unionization is that it wont prevent layoffs or studio shutdowns. It wont automatically provide money to struggling companies or force Mr. Kotick to take a lower salary. Thats true, of course. But unions will open lines of communication between workers and management. Unions will allow video game workers to negotiate guaranteed severance packages, mandatory paid overtime, stronger benefits, better salaries, notification before layoffs and fair crediting policies.
Another argument is that if American workers unionize, companies will just turn to cheaper countries. Anyone whos ever glanced at a video games credits section knows that companies are already doing that to some extent. But it would be prohibitively expensive for a company like Activision to simply pack up shop and move all of its developers from North America and Europe to a cheaper area, not just in cash but in terms of lost institutional knowledge. Besides, in the ideal version of this scenario, game developer shops all across the world would also be organizing, allowing them all to stand in solidarity together.
Right now, all of the power belongs to Bobby Kotick, Andrew Wilson and their fellow rich video game executives. Theres only one real way to change that.

MITCH SMITH,"CHICAGO Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.
If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.
Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.
Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways. In Minnehaha County, S.D., which includes Sioux Falls, the sheriffs office posted a photo of a car washed off the road. In Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, near Sioux City, residents were asked to conserve their water use because all the draining water is inundating our sewer system. And in Nebraska, the State Patrol said at least one rural bridge appeared to have been destroyed and that large ice blocks had washed down from rivers and covered highways.","Martin Thompson cleared snow from a sidewalk on Wednesday in Casper, Wyo.

JOHN SURICO,"For dogs who may not enjoy the winter accessory, Dr. Wilson said praise or treats should be used in advance to prepare the pet. “You don’t want the first time you have to use them to be during a blizzard,” she said. When Dr. Wilson first dressed her Corgi in them, the dog went into what she described as “bootie paralysis,” falling over and refusing to walk. “My best advice would just be for owners to examine the state of the sidewalk,” Dr. Wilson said. “If there’s no snow or ice present, there’s a good chance that a de-icer was used.” In Riverside Park, James Hercher, 29, said his dog, Marlowe, and other dogs he has seen know to avoid the northern section, where the chemical de-icers are more commonly used. “The salt around here is a big issue,” he said. “It really messes with his head when it’s on the ground.” On a recent afternoon, after a snowfall, Mr. Hercher found himself following Marlowe — at least as best as he could — near the park’s central bank, at West 85th Street, where the materials’ use is less apparent. Free of a leash, the 2-year-old Husky Australian Shepherd pranced in the snow, inviting other dogs nearby to play with him. “These are actually my favorite days to walk the dog,” Mr. Hercher said. “It’s only us dog walkers out here. No one biking, no one running. Just us.” A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2018, on Page MB4 of the New York edition with the headline: Please Don’t Make Me Go Out There.

Mat Smith,"Day-and-date announce and release is a new wrinkle. Netflix surprise released 'The Cloverfield Paradox' worldwide after Super Bowl LII Last year, Netflix's Super Bowl ad focused on a season of Stranger Things we still had months to wait for, but this year things are different. The streaming company dropped a surprise 30-second teaser for The Cloverfield Paradox, a sequel to the 2008 monster movie, which became available for viewing worldwide right after the game. The Paramount/J.J. Abrams flick had been planned for a theatrical release this weekend, but this agreement with Netflix reportedly made the $45-million movie ""immediately profitable."" And you can watch it, well, right now. Say hello to S Mode. Microsoft to drop Windows 10 S as a stand-alone product Both Thurrott and Neowin have discovered that Microsoft is dropping Windows 10 S as a stand-alone product for everyday users in favor of S Mode, which is already available for the enterprise crowd. The cost of unlocking full access would depend on what you're running: Windows 10 Home S users could unlock to the regular Home release for free, while those using Windows 10 Pro S would pay $49. Good luck with that. SpaceX confirms it will try to land all of Falcon Heavy's boosters Elon Musk's outfit has confirmed it will attempt to land all three boosters on Falcon Heavy's launch, which is now slated for a 2.5-hour window starting at 1:30PM Eastern on February 6th. As expected, the two side boosters will come back to the on-ground landing zones at Cape Canaveral, while the center booster should land on a drone ship off the coast. Over $200 million minimum -- and a lot of luck. Here's what it would take to make Overwatch's 'Blizzard World' IRL Last week, the Overwatch team released a new map: Blizzard World.

PETER BAKER and EILEEN SULLIVAN,"The Justice Department report that seemed to animate the president so much had nothing to do with the special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible ties with Russia. But one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said on Thursday that Mr. Mueller’s investigation should be suspended and predicted that Mr. Strzok would be in jail in the coming days. Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey in May 2017 was the first in a series of steps that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller, whose team continues to investigate possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia’s meddling in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The inquiry, which Mr. Trump regularly calls “phony” and a “witch hunt,” has ensnared some of Mr. Trump’s former aides and has been a dark cloud over his administration. In his conversation with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump again attacked the special counsel investigation as “13 angry Democrats,” referring to campaign donations some of the prosecutors have made, although Mr. Mueller is a lifelong Republican. The president also sought to distance himself from Paul J. Manafort, his former campaign chairman, who has been indicted on a series of tax and financial charges not directly related to the campaign. “I feel bad about a lot of it because I think a lot of it is very unfair,” he said. “Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign. I feel a little badly about it. They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago.” He added, “He worked for me, what, for 49 days or something? A very short period of time.” Mr. Trump even suggested that his former national security adviser, Michael J. Flynn, a retired three-star general, did not actually lie to investigators even though he has pleaded guilty to doing so. “I feel badly for General Flynn,” he said. “He’s lost his house, he’s lost his life. And some people say he lied and some people say he didn’t lie. I mean really it turned out maybe he didn’t lie. How can you do that? How can you do that because who’s lied more than Comey. Comey lied a tremendous amount.”","The president delivered a blizzard of pointed messages on Twitter, gave an interview to his preferred Fox News show and then engaged in a freewheeling encounter with reporters on the White House driveway.",2018-06-15T15:51:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Trump, Riding a North Korea High, Unloads on the F.B.I., Democrats and Obama",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/trump-fbi-democrats-obama.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/16/us/politics/16dc-offense/16dc-offense-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,blizzard,1

Kellen Beck,"Diablo Immortal is just the tip of the iceberg for Blizzard Entertainment's new ventures in mobile. After the reveal of Diablo Immortal at BlizzCon Friday, I had a chance to talk to Blizzard founder Allen Adham, who is currently the executive producer of incubation, about its newly announced mobile game and the possibility of other Blizzard franchises getting the mobile treatment. SEE ALSO: 'World of Warcraft Classic' is kind of agonizing No other new mobile games were confirmed by Adham, but he did nod at the fact that the company is interested in creating more mobile games, even hinting at the fact that more unannounced projects are currently in production. ""We're excited to imagine taking all of our IPs [intellectual properties] into this venue and bringing them to a full-on global audience,"" Adham said. ""I think in some cases they'll be completely new games. You see this with Hearthstone a total reimagining of an all-new game type using the Warcraft IP. In some cases it might be like we've shown with Diablo Immortal a similar game type but different and unlinked from the core game franchise."" Slaying demons on-the-go. Image: blizzard entertainment Blizzard's first foray into the mobile market was Hearthstone, which first landed on PC and Mac in March 2014, followed by iOS and Android in April and December of the same year. Diablo Immortal will be its second when it launches. ""We view this as another platform that's special in its own ways"" Adham noted that as phones get better and better, there's a possibility that its mobile games could connect with its desktop and console games. ""It's also easy for us to imagine sometime in the future games that are directly linked with cross-play and maybe cross-progression,"" he said. ""I think you can expect over the years to come, many interesting things in the mobile space."" The idea of Blizzard venturing further into mobile isn't so outlandish. Although some may consider Blizzard to be a developer that primarily focuses on PC games, the company's history shows that isn't really the case. ""We've been making games for close to three decades now, and we've made them in that history across many different platforms,"" Adham said. ""In the early days it was Amigas and Commodore 64s, and then the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. We view this as another platform that's special in its own ways."" Of course, just because Blizzard is making mobile games doesn't mean they're done creating games for consoles and desktops. Adham made it clear that with Diablo specifically, there are multiple teams working on multiple Diablo games. Part of the reason Diablo Immortal was revealed now is because smartphone technology has gotten to a point where it's actually feasible to have a game like Diablo represented well on mobile. From the demo that I played at BlizzCon, Diablo Immortal plays very well and looks even better than 2012's Diablo III. 'Diablo Immortal' looks very good on mobile. Image: blizzard entertainment Just look at games like Fortnite that are pretty much as good as they are on mobile as they on desktop and consoles. Not only that, but more and more people are playing games on their phones. Blizzard developers are gamers too, and many of them are spending more time playing mobile games, so of course they would be interested in developing something for mobile. ""Our pipeline is richer and broader than its ever been"" ""Us internally, we kind of reflect our own audience,"" Adham said. ""Us as gamers, many of us have shifted our playtime from being purely either PC or console to now spending a fair amount of our time in mobile. I'm roughly 50/50 desktop and mobile, and so the idea that we can bring [ Diablo Immortal ] to that device, and as we've seen handheld phones get higher and higher fidelity, we felt a few years ago it was time that we could make an authentic Diablo experience that you could hold in your hand."" As for how new games like Diablo Immortal come to be, Adham spoke about how Blizzard's approach to design and its large teams can spin out into these new ideas. Blizzard has five development teams in Irvine, each of them with 100 to 300 people, and within those teams there is the opportunity to take elements of those teams and spawn new projects. Adham name dropped World of Warcraft game director Tom Chilton and Heroes of the Storm/StarCraft game director Dustin Browder as a couple of folks working on new projects for Blizzard right now. ""We have, today, more new products in development and our pipeline is richer and broader than its ever been in our three-decade history,"" Adham said. ""But great stuff's coming.""","Diablo Immortal is just the tip of the iceberg for Blizzard Entertainment's new ventures in mobile.

Jonathan Shieber,"What could be more perfect than moving the inaugural championship finals for an eSports league from its Los Angeles home to Brooklyn? For Overwatch League, the esports conference created by fiat from Activision Blizzard, the move is the first step in its plans for housing esports teams in cities around the country. Heading from sunny Burbank, Calif. to the hipster heartland of Brooklyn conjures up echoes of the famed Dodger franchise move (in reverse) while tapping into one of the few other markets in the U.S. that might rival LA for esports popularity. When the Overwatch regular season ends on Sunday, June 17, six teams will face off in the league’s first post-season playoffs. Those games are set to begin July 11 and will take place in Burbank at the company’s “Blizzard Arena Los Angeles”. After the playoffs, the final teams will fly to New York to compete for the largest share of a $1.4 million prize pool and the first Overwatch League trophy. The games are slated to begin Friday, July 27 and continue on the 28th. “The Overwatch League Grand Finals will be an epic experience for fans and viewers,” said Overwatch League commissioner Nate Nanzer in a statement. “We want this to be the pinnacle of esports, and holding it at a world-class venue like Barclays Center, in a global capital like New York, will help us celebrate not only the league’s two best teams, but the fans, partners, and players who have joined us on this incredible journey.” Overwatch is taking a geographic approach to its franchises with teams sponsored by cities in the U.S. and major esports hubs around the world like London, Shanghai, and Seoul. Eventually the league is looking to set up stadiums in locations outside of Burbank. With league play requiring teams to travel — like a traditional sports league. The move to Brooklyn could be a test of how well the Overwatch experience travels and a precursor to the league starting to take its show on the road in earnest. Tickets go on sale on Friday, May 18, at 10 a.m. EDT, and can be bought on ticketmaster.com and barclayscenter.com, while tickets to the first two rounds of the Overwatch League postseason at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles go on sale Thursday, May 10, at 9 a.m. PDT via AXS.com.","What could be more perfect than moving the inaugural championship finals for an eSports league from its Los Angeles home to Brooklyn?

Mark Kaufman,"The nor'easter that has shut down much of New England ion Tuesday s reaching its great arms into regions over both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, sucking moisture into the powerful storm. In a technical forecast discussion on Monday night from the National Weather Service forecast office in Boston, meteorologists said the storm was even importing moisture from as far away as the Pacific Ocean. The result — aided by the storm also drawing in cold air from Canada — is a blizzard wherein enough moisture and freezing temperatures can create copious snowfall and high winds. SEE ALSO: Did a nor'easter whip a puffer fish into a tree? An investigation Satellite images captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) weather satellite GOES-16, shows what exactly is going on with the storm from high above. GOES-16 orbits more than 22,000 miles above Earth, allowing it to capture such wide-field images of the planet. It's high-resolution cameras can also see detailed images of the *nor'easter*, including the eye-like feature near the center of the storm. This is the third nor'easter — which is broadly defined as a winter storm with strong winds blowing from the northeast — to hit New England in two weeks. An artist's rendering of the GOES-16 satellite orbiting above Earth. Image: NOAA The previous nor'easters, while bringing high winds and coastal flooding, lacked the right combination of cold air and high winds to result in a true blizzard, which has a strict meteorological definition. Specifically, a blizzard is a storm that has sustained 35 mph winds (or greater) and enough blowing snow to reduce visibility to under a fourth of a mile for at least 3 consecutive hours. And that's what's happening for some parts of the Northeast today, including Boston. This storm is also far from from finished, and it could become Boston's second-largest March snowstorm storm on record.","The nor'easter that has shut down much of New England ion Tuesday s reaching its great arms into regions over both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, sucking moisture into the powerful storm.

CHRIS STANFORD,"Our White House correspondents note: “Assuming it lasts — and with Mr. Trump, nothing is ever certain — the schism could test whether he or Mr. Bannon has more resonance with the conservative base that has sustained the president through a tumultuous tenure marked by low poll numbers.” • Separately, Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday to try to limit the scope of the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Voter fraud panel is shut down • President Trump abruptly dissolved a White House commission he had charged with investigating voter fraud after he claimed, without evidence, that widespread irregularities had cost him the popular vote. He cast the decision as a result of continuing legal challenges, but added that the Department of Homeland Security would continue the investigative work. • No state has uncovered significant evidence of fraud, and election officials, including many Republicans, have strongly rejected Mr. Trump’s claim. Major computer flaws are discovered • The security problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal data from mobile devices, personal computers and servers running in so-called cloud computer networks. Meltdown affects nearly all microprocessors made by Intel, whose chips are used in more than 90 percent of the servers underpinning the internet. Spectre affects most processors but is more difficult to exploit, researchers say. • The advice for computer users is longstanding: Update your software. Koreas open dialogue, and the U.S. watches • This week’s overture between South Korea and the North is viewed — from the sidelines — with deep suspicion in Washington. Trump administration officials said on Wednesday that talks should be limited to North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics, which will be held in South Korea next month. • Diplomats say it is important for Seoul to be in lock step with Washington. “It is fine for the South Koreans to take the lead,” said a former adviser in the Obama administration. “But if they don’t have the U.S. behind them, they won’t get far with North Korea.” “ The Daily”: Trump vs. Bannon • A tell-all book about the first year of the Trump administration has the White House in a fury. Listen on a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. Business • The party’s over at the car lot. U.S. auto sales fell 1.8 percent in 2017, ending seven years of growth.

Almost 40 years in the works, the euro was toasted with Champagne by finance ministers in the 11 countries where it was introduced. Photo While the euro was introduced in 11 countries in 1999, notes and coins only started being used in 2002. Credit Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Though euro bank notes and coins wouldn’t be released until 2002, eurozone banks were required to use the currency in transactions as soon as markets opened on Jan. 4, 1999. Fears of technical glitches meant banks brought in employees en masse : In Frankfurt, one bank had 3,200 people working to reprogram its computers. London had 30,000 workers on trading floors and in back offices, even though Britain wasn’t even adopting the euro. The switch took more than a year of planning, months of rewriting software, and full-scale dress rehearsals. But the reward for the banking world’s tireless efforts was a smooth debut when world markets opened for business. Others received something more concrete: For sharing a birthday with the new currency, each baby born in France on New Year’s Day that year received 100 euros from the Finance Ministry.

SEE ALSO: All 165 of the best 'Overwatch' skins, ranked In a tidy infographic, Blizzard showed how much work has gone into its beloved first-person competitive game and shared some fun facts and figures about how much players have contributed. Take a look: Image: blizzard entertainment The team behind Overwatch certainly hasn't been slacking in bringing in new content, characters, maps and game modes, that's for sure. Since launch, the team has added 2,050 cosmetic items like sprays, skins, victory poses, and more. That's roughly 513 loot boxes' worth, as long as you don't get any duplicates or currency. A very interesting piece of information is the amount of damage done to hit points healed. Healers have nearly healed half the amount of damage done (17.2 trillion to 38.6 trillion, if you don't feel like counting commas). Meanwhile, healing has been requested a whopping 752 million times.

Kellen Beck,"Death is an inevitable part of Overwatch. Sometimes I step onto a Junkrat trap and eat a grenade, sometimes D.Va drops an ultimate right on my head and I explode, sometimes I get pulled off a cliff by a gravity-defying feat of technology. SEE ALSO: 'Broverwatch' is a group of guys who get together to play games and talk about their feelings There are so many ways to die in Overwatch; some of them heroic, some of them hilarious, but generally all of them frustrating. But occasionally, depending on what character skin my assailant is wearing, it just rubs it in a little deeper. And on the very rare occasion, a character with a particular skin will kill me and I'll think ""Yes, this is how it was meant to be."" Here are the top 10 Overwatch skins I've been killed by, both good and bad. 10. Baihu Genji Slay me, Genji. Image: blizzard entertainment When Baihu Genji enters the fray, I feel like I'm a Dark Souls boss about to be vanquished by a well-armored adventurer. When he hits that Dragonblade ultimate, I know my time is up. I'll put in a good fight, sure, but he's faster and stronger than me, and he deserves to vanquish me with armor and a blade like that. 9. Biker Reaper Too edgy. Image: blizzard entertainment It hurts on a deep, emotional level to get killed by Reaper because oftentimes he materializes behind me and blasts me away with his shotguns before I even have enough time to turn around. When he's wearing his motocross outfit with the word ""Edge"" literally written on the side, it just feels like I'm being completely humiliated by a pre-teen. 8. Nutcracker Zenyatta Perhaps the creepiest skin in 'Overwatch.' Image: blizzard entertainment There's nothing quite like getting killed by a healer in Overwatch, especially when it's Zenyatta hurtling a handful of small metal balls into your head. But with the nutcracker skin, those balls and transformed into walnuts and Zenyatta's face is transformed into a creepy, vacant, and vaguely horrifying nutcracker face. Getting blasted with a bunch of walnuts while getting stared down by Nutcracker Zenyatta is a truly horrible experience. 7. Formal Doomfist A classy skin for a classy punch. Image: blizzard entertainment Getting hit by a car doesn't seem like it would be a fun time, but if I had a chocie, I guess I'd prefer to get hit by a cool, fancy, expensive car. That's what it's like to be punched to death by Formal Doomfist, the best-dressed hero in Overwatch. You're going to die, why not do it with a a whole lot class slamming right into your face? 6. Yeti Winston The yeti, a.k.a. the apex predator. Image: blizzard entertainment If I saw a yeti face to face in the real world, I would accept my death. When Yeti Winston hits his ultimate and comes at me in a painful flurry of fists, I accept my death. I deserve it. What was I thinking, imagining I could go toe to toe with a yeti? They're built to kill. I am nothing but prey. 5. Lifeguard McCree The shirtless wonder. Image: blizzard entertainment Lifeguard McCree doesn't save me when I'm drowning, no. He pumps me full of lead. But he looks good doing it. It's honestly an honor to be murdered by this shirtless version of McCree. He clearly works hard at keeping himself in shape, and do you think he does that for himself? No. He does that for us. 4. Grillmaster: 76 This dad should not be racking up kills. Image: BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT There is no skin more ""dad"" than Soldier: 76's Grillmaster skin. It's dorky. It's corny. It's completely impractical for a firefight. It's not because he's embracing his dad status that it sucks to get killed by Grillmaster: 76, it's because he clearly wasn't ready for battle. It's embarrassing to get shot by a guy wearing cargo shorts and a floral shirt. 3. Pink Mercy Respect. Image: BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT I have to show respect for Pink Mercy. When this wingéd healer busts out her sidearm and ends me with a handful of well-placed bullets, and I see she's wearing pink, I can't help but receive those bullets graciously. Each Pink Mercy skin I see means that much more money was donated to support breast cancer research, so when Pink Mercy kills me, I know I'm, in a weird way, contributing to a good cause. 2. Pajamei Come on, Mei, at least make it look like you need to try a little bit. Image: BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT Pajama-clad Mei just rolled out of bed. She didn't even bother putting on her battle attire. She doesn't need to, because she knows she's that much better than you. Getting frozen in place by Pajamei and finished off with an icicle in the head is the epitome of embarrassment. She wiped the floor with me, and she barely even had to try. 1. Gridironhardt The champ. Image: BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT There's something about getting bodied by a giant man in a giant, armored, football uniform that feels right. Seeing that giant football man fly toward me, knowing that there's no way I can get out of the way, my life flashing before my eyes, I am content. This is how it should be. Gridiron Reinhardt is a champion, as seen on his left arm and the trophy instead in place of his usual hammer head. That means I'm the loser. That's just how the world works; the circle of life.

Ron Miller,"When Snowflake, the cloud data warehouse, landed a $263 million investment earlier this year, CEO Bob Muglia speculated that it would be the last money his company would need before an eventual IPO. But just 9 months after that statement, the company announced a second even larger round. This time it’s getting $450 million, as an unexpected level of growth led them to seek additional cash. Sequoia Capital led the round, joined by new investor Meritech Capital and existing investors Altimeter Capital, Capital One Growth Ventures, Madrona Venture Group, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures and Wing Ventures. Today’s round brings the total raised to over $928 million with $713 million coming just this year. That’s a lot of dough. Oh and the valuation has skyrocketed too from $1.5 billion in January to $3.5 billion with today’s investment. “We are increasing the valuation from the prior round substantially, and its driven by the growth numbers of almost quadrupling the revenue, and tripling the customer base,” company CFO Thomas Tuchscherer told TechCrunch. At the time of the $263 million round, Muglia was convinced the company had enough funds and that the next fundraise would be an IPO. “We have put ourselves on the path to IPO. Thats our mid- to long-term plan. This funding allows us to go directly to IPO and gives us sufficient capital, that if we choose, IPO would be our next funding step, he said in January. Tuchscherer said in fact that was the plan at the time of the first batch of funding. He joined the company, partly because of his experience bringing Talend public in 2016, but he said the growth has been so phenomenal, that they felt it was necessary to change course. “When we raised $263 million earlier in the year, we raised based on a plan that was ambitious in terms of growth and investment. We are exceeding and beating that, and it prompted us to explore how do we accelerate investment to continue driving the companys growth,” he said. Running on both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which they added as a supported platform earlier this year, certainly contributed to the increased sales, and forced them to rethink the amount of money it would take to fuel their growth spurt. “I think it’s very important as a distinction that we view the funding as being customer driven in the sense that in order to meet the demand that we’re seeing in the market for Snowflake, we have to invest in our infrastructure, as well as in our R&amp;D capacity. So the funding that we’re raising now is meant to finance those two core investments,” he stressed The number of employees is skyrocketing as the company adds customers. Just eight months ago the company had around 350 employees. Today it has close to 650. Tuchscherer expects that to grow to between 900 and 1000 by the end of January, not that far off. As for that IPO, surely that is still a goal, but the growth simply got in the way. “We are building the company to be autonomous and to be a large independent company. Its definitely on the horizon,” he said. While Tuchscherer wouldn’t definitively say that the company is looking to support at least one more cloud platform in addition to Amazon and Microsoft, he strongly hinted that such a prospect could happen. The company also plans to plunge a lot of money into the sales team, building out new sales offices in the US and doubling their presence around the world, while also enhancing the engineering and R&amp;D teams to expand their product offerings. Just this year alone the company has added Netflix, Office Depot, DoorDash, Netgear, Ebates and Yamaha as customers. Other customers include Capital One, Lions Gate and Hubspot.","When Snowflake, the cloud data warehouse, landed a $263 million investment earlier this year, CEO Bob Muglia speculated that it would be the last money his company would need before an eventual IPO.

Sarah Perez,"Netflix has officially confirmed the hiring of its new Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann, formerly CFO at Activision Blizzard. The announcement directly follows reports from Reuters and Wall Street Journal which said Netflix had poached Neumann from Activision and would start him in his new position this year.
CNBC on Wednesday reported Neumann had been fired from Activision two days ago, because he was pursuing another job. Activision declined to state the cause of his firing, saying only that it was “unrelated to the Companys financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures,” in a regulatory filing.
Activision said Dennis Durkin, who was CFO from 2012 through 2017, would return to his role to replace Neumann.
At Netflix, Neumann will replace David Wells, who served as CFO since 2010.
Spencer is a stellar entertainment executive and were thrilled that he will help us provide amazing stories to people all over the world, said Reed Hastings, Netflix Chief Executive Officer, in a statement. I also want to again say thank you to David Wells, on behalf of the company and our shareholders, for his invaluable contributions at Netflix over the past 14 years.
Neumann became CFO at Activision Blizzard in May 2017. Prior to that, he held a number of roles within Disney and elsewhere. From 2012 up until his hiring at Activision, Neumann was CFO and executive vice president of Global Guest Experience of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. He also worked in private equity at Providence Equity Partners and Summit Partners.
Also at Disney, which Neumann first joined in 1992, he had served as executive vice president of the ABC Television Network from 2001 to 2004 and CFO of the Walt Disney Internet Group from 1999 to 2001.
His hiring is notable given Disney’s plans to introduce a Netflix competitor of its own this year, with the forthcoming launch of the Disney+ streaming service. Netflix is also facing increased competition from AT&amp;T, which is creating several new streaming services following its Time Warner acquisition; as well from Hulu, which becomes majority-owned by Disney, with its acquisition of  21st Century Fox.
To keep up, Netflix has been increasing its spending on content. It reportedly spent $8 billion in 2018, and that figure is set to grow this year as the streamer invests heavily in originals to help grow and retain its customer base.
Netflix is a singular brand, and Im excited and honored for the opportunity to work with the Netflix team and all of our stakeholders to build on the companys exceptional track record of success and innovation, said Neumann, in a statement.

Jordan Crook,"If you’re sick of hearing about esports, you need to get over it. The space continues to grow, inching its way into the traditional media landscape. Today, in fact, Activision Blizzard announced that the Overwatch League playoffs will be aired on ESPN and Disney XD. The Overwatch League in itself is a huge step for esports, as it’s the first true city-based league for a competitive video game. While most esports leagues are comprised of privately owned teams with little or nothing to do with geography, Overwatch League is a pro league made up of city-based teams such as the Dallas Fuel or the San Francisco Shock. Many of these teams are owned by big names in the traditional sports world, such as Robert Kraft (CEO and owner of New England Patriots, who owns the Boston Uprising) and Jeff Wilpon (COO of the New York Mets, who owns the New York Excelsior). The agreement, which also includes a recap/highlights package from 2018 Grand Finals coverage on ABC on July 29, marks the first time that live competitive gaming has aired on ESPN in primetime, and will be the first broadcast of an eSports championship on ABC. Activision Blizzard said in the announcement that this is just the start of a multi-year agreement. That said, EA’s Madden NFL 18 did broadcast an e-sports tournament on ESPN2 and Disney XD earlier this year. Overwatch League playoffs begin tonight at 8pm ET, and will culminate in the Grand Finals, taking place in the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, on July 27 and July 28. Here’s what Justin Connolly, EVP of Affiliate Sales and Marketing at Disney and ESPN, had to say in a prepared statement: The Overwatch League Grand Finals is by far our most comprehensive television distribution for an esports event over a single weekend: 10 total hours over four networks and three days. This overall collaboration with Disney/ABC, ESPN and Blizzard represents our continued commitment to esports, and we look forward to providing marquee Overwatch League coverage across our television platforms for fans. The rise of Twitch stars, like Ninja, and the growth of the competitive gaming scene have paved the way not only for a new type of sports media, but for a growing new economy. While challenges remain around monetizing the content, the pieces of the puzzle are slowing coming together to create an audience large enough to incentivize advertisers to spend big money. In fact, sponsorship revenue and ad spending revenue are expected to hit $655 million and $224 million respectively by 2020, according to Newzoo. That doesn’t sound like much when you think about the NFL, which raked in $1.3 billion in revenue in 2017 alone. But, like this deal proves, the esports space is growing and working its way into the mainstream, hoping to get the attention of young men between 18 and 34 who have become increasingly difficult to reach via traditional advertising. Alongside the live TV broadcast of the Overwatch League playoffs on ESPN and Disney XD, the playoffs will also be livestreamed via Twitch, MLG.com and on the ESPN app and DisneyNOW.","If you’re sick of hearing about esports, you need to get over it.

Devin Coldewey,"It can be hard sometimes to grok the scale of the gaming community, but the occasional charity event not only demonstrates the hugeness of the industry but also its diversity and willingness to shell out for a good cause. Today Blizzard announced that an Overwatch charity campaign raised an impressive $12.7 million for breast cancer research in just two weeks. Overwatch is an extremely popular team-based shooter that has made an impression not just with its solid gameplay, but its striking and inclusive character design. This sensitivity to the ever-widening demographics of gaming led them to conceive of this charity campaign back in May. Players could for a limited time purchase a special “skin,” or 3D model, for the character Mercy — she’s the most powerful healer in the lineup, so the choice makes sense, even though the statuesque blonde isn’t exactly their most interesting character work. (A Pink Genji would probably look cool, but it would probably just make more people play him — a regrettable outcome.) Special skins are highly sought-after, and while many can be obtained through in-game loot boxes, they can also be purchased. In this case, the price was set at $15, rather high for a skin but clearly that didn’t deter players, who shelled out by the thousand for both it and related t-shirts. I asked for a breakdown, but a little napkin math gives a basic idea of the volume. The press release announcing the $12.7 million number says “thousands” of t-shirts were sold at $30 apiece; usually if it’s 10,000 or more they say so, so we’ll just use 10K as our estimate. That makes $300K from shirts, so the remaining $12.4 million means somewhere north of 820,000 people paid for the Pink Mercy skin. Think about that! In two weeks more than three quarters of a million people paid $15 each for a virtual item. Pretty great. It’s all going to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, by the way. They got a big novelty check: And this is by no means the only big gaming charity event. Games Done Quick regularly raises millions, and Penny Arcade’s Child’s Play got so big that it had to be spun off as its own thing. It just recently announced a round of grants funding pediatric hospital equipment and staff, by the way. This event went well enough that we can probably expect more in the future for other causes — I’ve asked Blizzard for any details on that front and will update if I hear back.","It can be hard sometimes to grok the scale of the gaming community, but the occasional charity event not only demonstrates the hugeness of the industry but also its diversity and willingness to shell out for a good cause.

Josh Constine,"Facebook is challenging Twitch and YouTube for video game live streaming supremacy with the release of its new Games SDK for PC. After testing Live streaming from games like Overwatch from developers like Blizzard, today Live broadcasting from PC games to the News Feed opens to all developers. And Facebook will let them reward fans who watch by providing in-game items or bonuses. The potential for viral growth and sales could convince tons of game developers to bake in Facebook’s new SDK, while players could use the simple broadcasting feature to reach a big audience — though one not as dedicated to gaming as on other platforms. Facebook meanwhile benefits because game streams create compelling niche content that can drive long viewing sessions, helping Facebook monetize viewers in the moment with ads while locking them deeper into the platform long-term. Facebook is also hooking up developers with deeper analytics through custom “app events” that are now available on PC as well as web and mobile. Game developers can also integrate Facebook’s enhanced Friend Finder feature that lets them play with friends and now see “Key Player Stats” about other people they want to join up with to keep playing together.","Facebook is challenging Twitch and YouTube for video game live streaming supremacy with the release of its new Games SDK for PC.

Billy Steele,"As it has in the past, Treyarch enlisted help from Beenox to develop the PC version of Black Ops 4. The Quebec-based studio is another Activision subsidiary and lent a hand on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered as well as Black Ops 3. This time around, though, there's a push to offer more to PC gamers, including the first Call of Duty that will be available on Blizzard's Battle.net. First and foremost, the team is able to put more effort into fine-tuning the controls for PC. They should feel more natural on the platform, optimized specifically for PC with a high degree of customization. A lot has gone into making the default settings feel good, but there are a ton of options to cater to a wide range of preferences. ""If you want to throw a grenade, you can choose between cooking it by holding the mouse button or as a toggle,"" explained Beenox technical lead programmer Phillippe Troie. ""So you can also click once to start to cook it and click twice to throw it."" That's just one of many examples of how PC gamers will be able to adjust controls to their liking. Options like that run throughout the PC release of Black Ops 4. Troie gave another example of how mouse sensitivity comes into play. When you're using Ruin's grappling hook, the mouse sensitivity won't be slowed down like it is for console thumbsticks. For each specialist, there are configurable controls that PC players will be able to go in an customize. ""Mouse sensitivity is king,"" Troie said. ""It's really an extension of the human body."" In addition to controls, Treyarch wanted to ensure that Black Ops 4 ran well on a range of systems, so that players wouldn't be hampered by a modest setup. ""We wanted to make sure it ran great on the broadest array of hardware,"" Treyarch co-studio head Mark Gordon explained. ""Feeling great and running great were the two high level goals."" To make all of that happen, Treyarch staffed a team much larger than they have before. ""A larger team enables us to put more effort into things we haven't been able to do before,"" Gordon said. The team also sought feedback from another Activision company: Blizzard. They were able to tap into Blizzard's PC expertise for tips on what would or wouldn't work on different hardware. The features don't stop at customization though. Black Ops 4 will run in 4K HDR and offer an uncapped frame rate. The version playable at the Activision booth at E3 ran above 150 frames-per-second on the company's (very expensive) setup. This Call of Duty will also support ultra-wide monitors up to an aspect ratio of 32:9. Of course, you need your HUD to adjust if you're using one of those fancy displays, rather than having it parked in the extreme corners on the side. On PC, the UI will recenter to accommodate those monitors -- another configuration specifically for this platform. And all of that is in addition the new features in multiplayer, zombie mode and Blackout, the battle royale option in Black Ops 4 players on all platforms can look forward to. ""It's the combination of the Beenox team's passion and availability to work on this and the Blizzard team wanting to partner with us on this game,"" Gordon explained. ""That was what all slotted into place and enabled us to do things this way."" The result of all three teams working together is a new Call of Duty for PC that offers a plethora of customization alongside a number of platform-specific features for gamers to employ. And let's be honest: More options are almost always a good thing. Follow all the latest news from E3 2018 here!","Call of Duty is no stranger to the PC.

Richard Lawler,"Also, his turret no longer requires hammering to build or upgrade, since he can just toss it out and it sets itself up, although he can repair it if it's damaged, and a cooldown timer for the ability doesn't start until the turret has been destroyed (either by Torb himself or an enemy). Meanwhile the characteristics of his existing ""Molten Core"" ultimate have become ""Overload,"" a secondary ability that doesn't impact his turret, but speeds up his movement and attacks (his gun has been updated for more speed and consistency overall) and grants him temporary armor. Finally, his new Ultimate ability retains the name Molten Core, but works very differently. Now it's a bit closer to Wrecking Ball's ultimate, although instead of dropping floating mines, Torbjörn's claw arm shoots out 10 molten projectiles to create a damaging pool on the ground where they land that lasts for ten seconds, with extra damage against enemies wearing armor.

Andrew Webster,"One of the biggest problems with fast-paced e-sports like Overwatch is that it can be tough to follow the action; there’s just so much happening all at once. For the second season of the Overwatch League, which kicks off next month, Blizzard and Twitch have partnered for a robust new spectating tool that should make matches much easier to understand. Called the “command center,” the tool lets you watch games from multiple viewpoints, switching between them at will. They include the first-person viewpoint of any player, the standard broadcast view, and a customizable “three-feed template” where you can add an overhead map alongside two other feeds. Blizzard previously tested these features during the Overwatch World Cup last year. “Since the biggest request was more personal ways to view all the Overwatch League action, we’ve overhauled the command center for an evolved Twitch viewer experience,” explains Twitch’s commerce VP Matt McCloskey. These options won’t be available to all viewers, however. Instead, they’re part of Twitch’s “ Overwatch League All-Access Pass,” which will cost you $14.99 for the entire 2019 season. In addition to the new command center, that money will get you in-game tokens for buying OWL team skins, discounts on merchandise, exclusive chat rooms that include player Q&As, and other Twitch rewards like emotes, badges, and the removal of ads. The second season of OWL kicks off on February 14th, and it’ll feature a number of notable changes, including eight new teams, a shorter schedule aimed at improving player wellness, and a handful of home matches in cities across the US.",Twitch subscribers who pay for an Overwatch League all-access pass will get a brand-new spectator tool that should make Blizzard’s e-sports league much easier to follow.,2019-01-31T18:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Blizzard’s Overwatch League has a robust new spectator tool if you pay for an all-access pass,https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18204364/blizzard-overwatch-league-twitch-all-access-pass,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvgs5lrorX3r1xqv2pXHAVr29-0=/0x86:1200x714/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13369485/20180728_173839_Patrick_Dodson_.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,blizzard,1
Kellen Beck,"When Diablo Immortal was revealed at BlizzCon on Friday, I thought it looked cool. A lot of people disagreed, and immediately began complaining both online and in-person about this apparent slight, this bastardization of ""their"" franchise, this complete abandonment of rational thought by a company that routinely creates some of the best and most successful games to ever exist. Well guess what, you entitled crybabies. I played Diablo Immortal at BlizzCon shortly after it was revealed, and it's a lot of fun. SEE ALSO: 'Diablo 3' on Nintendo Switch is the perfect excuse to revisit a masterpiece Take a look at the gameplay trailer, which shows off some classic bloody Diablo action set against the gothic world of Sanctuary that fans have hacked and slashed through countless times. The boss fights look interesting, the levels look more dynamic than ever before, and, to be frank, I like the Diablo Immortal aesthetic more than I like Diablo 3 's aesthetic. I got my hands on the demo of it and blasted through the levels with a Barbarian, and then I did it again with a Wizard. It was a blast the controls are simple and laid out very well, the action feels like classic Diablo, and the level design had a great foreboding feel to it. And this is coming from someone who is generally not a fan of touch controls. Some of the beauty of the Diablo franchise is that it's pretty easy to navigate, and that simple movement system translates very well to mobile with Diablo Immortal. You move around by using a digital analog ""stick"" on the left side of the screen, while all your abilities are arranged on the right side of the screen. It's pretty similar to how the game works with a console controller. And it feels just as intuitive and easy. The Wizard fighting against a big ol' demon. Image: blizzard entertainment And yet, without even giving the game a shot, tons of people are pissed at Blizzard for daring to make a new Diablo game. Just look at the replies to any recent tweets from the Diablo Twitter account. I am a huge Diablo fan. A lot of people who are Mad Online about Diablo Immortal claim to be fans of the franchise too. Grow up. So why are they mad that there's a new Diablo game? Because it's on mobile. People immediately lashed out, calling the announcement a joke because they think the game is inherently bad and will surely be full of micro-transactions that chip away at the integrity of the series. People are also mad that Blizzard didn't announce new content for Diablo 3 and didn't announce Diablo 4, the latter of which the company expressly said it wasn't going to reveal. So I just have one thing to say to people who are mad that Blizzard, employing a team that wasn't even working on the main Diablo franchise, made a new Diablo game: Grow up. You are entitled to nothing. Game companies owe you nothing. You don't just get to have whatever you want and then throw a tantrum when your own personal dreams don't come true. Blizzard hasn't abandoned the core Diablo franchise just because it created a mobile game. Do you get mad when Blizzard announces a World of Warcraft update when you were hoping for a Warcraft 4 ? No, because you understand that those two things would be made by two different teams and Blizzard isn't obligated to make you a new real-time strategy Warcraft game. From what I saw and played, Diablo Immortal is a fun, quality Diablo game that retains that special something that makes the franchise so special. You don't have to play it, but whining online makes you sound like a literal infant.","When Diablo Immortal was revealed at BlizzCon on Friday, I thought it looked cool.

JOHN ELIGON,"Pack away the sidewalk tables and flip-flops; break out the boots and shovels.
Nature was showing its fickle side on Wednesday, with blizzard conditions, heavy snow and frigid air expected to pound parts of the Rockies and the Plains, just a day after the weather was sunny and idyllic in some of those same places.
The storm, caused by a low-pressure system moving east from the Pacific Ocean, is expected to bring temperature drops of about 50 degrees to places like Denver, where it was in the mid-70s and sunny on Tuesday but could drop to the mid-20s by Wednesday night, with 55-mile-an-hour wind gusts and up to 10 inches of snow. Whiteout conditions could make driving nearly impossible, forecasters said.
The effects of the low-pressure system will be felt from Colorado through Michigan, with heavy snow and thunderstorms, and even down into Texas, where dry conditions and high winds have led to fire warnings.
While the whiplash from pleasant to grim conditions might draw a collective groan, it should not come as much of a surprise to those familiar with springtime in the Plains.",Up to 10 inches of snow may fall on the city Wednesday as temperatures plunge below freezing from the mid-70s. The storm is also headed for states still recovering from flooding.,2019-04-10T16:08:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Denver Braces for a Blizzard, a Day After Basking in Spring Sunshine",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/denver-weather.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/us/10storm2/10storm2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,blizzard,1
David Murphy,"Kaeo Milker has had a long and eye-opening career at Blizzard Entertainment: QA, facilities management, recruiting and, now, heading up the companys big MOBA franchise, Heroes of the Storm. Youre probably more likely to follow his advice than follow him down a lane, though; although hes the captain of the Heroes ship, hes quick to admit that you wont find him at the top of the games leaderboards. We caught up with Kaeo at this years BlizzCon, and he gave some excellent advice about how to manage what you think you should do as a career versus what youd love to do as a career. Name: Kaeo Milker Location: Irvine, California Current gig: Production Director, Heroes of the Storm Current computer: a Blizzard-specced machine One word that best describes how you work: Triage First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. I took a very long and windy road to get here. My undergrad, I went to school to be a veterinarian. That was my path that I was going down. I was an animal science major in college and... its a very different path where I am now. I love video games, though, and I love Blizzard. Blizzard was the pinnacle for me. I lived in Southern California and I found out they were hiring for game testers for Warcraft 3, and I basically quit another career and came into Blizzard to try to get my foot in the door and see what it was all about. I had no idea what video game development was. There were not a lot of resources then; there werent really things you could study in school, necessarily, that would take you down the path of game development, because it was still pretty young industry at that point. I loved it. I wanted to see what it is. I wanted to be a part of it. And I basically did anything. They were just testing games, and that parlayed into a bizarre role of recruiting-slash-facilities management. Every opportunity given to me, I just was trying to do the best job I couldbe kind and collaborative to everybody that I came across, and make sure that people knew me as just a hard-working nice person that they wanted to be around. As opportunities unfoldedas the company grewthere were more and more things that I was getting responsibility for. And I did my best not to screw all those things up along the way. And I think I continue to get rewarded with more responsibility over time, for just proving myself as a valuable person in this organization. Take us through a recent workday. A typical Monday, Im coming into the office. First thing, I have a directors meeting with the leadership team of my game itself. So I sit down with that group of people and we basically just talk about everything thats on our mind coming back from the weekend. We play the game a lot, so we talk about the game itself; we talk about our challenges from the week before. We start aligning on the things we want to make sure were all conscious of as we move into the work weekendall the crazy things that are going on with our game and its development. Thats a very collaborative process. While Im the senior-most developer on the team, I rely heavily on a technical director, the lead of engineering team, an art director, and two design leads. We all work really closely together to keep track of the game and make sure were all staying on the right things at any moment in time. I get a lot of mail; Im copied on a lot of things. So I had not just a lot of rules, like, literally, thousands of rules, I had 17 years worth of rules, because I never clean them out. They basically just accumulated. But I got to a place where my rules started interacting in a really bad way, and I was losing things, and I actually killed every single rule I had. That goes into a leadership meeting for Blizzard that I go to. I step out of the Heroes portion of it, and its a bunch of leaders from across the game teams and across Blizzard having a similar conversation that I just had about my Heroes team, but now were talking about Blizzard as a whole. I get a lot of perspectives and insights and input from them, and have the opportunity for me to raise challenges and questions and also listen to the things that theyre bringing up. So its, again, a very collaborative, very supportive environment, with a lot of people who genuinely care about not just the work that were doing on our individual games, but what what the collective work of the company is at any given moment. And then I go into a series of meetingsa lot of meetings. Actually, we fight against meetings. We want meetings to be short and effective, and we dont want any more meetings than what we need to have, but I am getting kicked into a lot of them. Some of them are informational, where Im a fly on the wall, just trying to pay attention and hear what everybodys talking about. A lot of it is challenges of creative things or prioritization calls that were trying to make across the game. A lot of interaction with external teams too, so I might bounce from a design meeting where Im focused on Heroes, the game, to a meeting with our our web and mobile team, or talking about our new forums that are going to roll out, and then go into a lot of one-on-ones. I have a lot of direct reports, people who work with me, but I also want to talk to everybody on our team. Its really important to me to stay in contact with them. Ill hear their perspectives on the game, on the way were running the team in the game, so that we can all kind of align to do the best work possible. This is a creative environment and Blizzard is fueled by peoples passions. Its really important that people are motivated and excited. And thats the only way that were all able to do this magic that is game development, where youre kind of just making stuff out of the ether. And that leads into my lunches, which usually our one-on-one lunches as well. Ill go to lunch with someone and well just be talking about career development, the games, or a big challenge that were dealing with at that moment in time. Thats a lot of digging deep into the problem of the moment. And production is a lot of problem-solving: just working a problem, focusing on the right thing, and making our way through it. We have play test every day. So a chunk of my day will be getting involved in a test, either with the design group, or it could be with our UI team, just getting a snapshot of something tangible that I can log into the game, check out, and give feedback on to make sure that it feels like were aligned to the right things. And then I do a lot of strategic work with outside leaders as well, talking about the overarching course of the game and all the content that were aligning to. Theres a lot of meetings with PR, and marketing, and publishing about how weve done all this great work with the game, now how do we want to talk about it. What are the moments that we want to be shouting from the rooftops and where do we want to create that anticipation for the next thing that were building toward? I dont know what we just did, but its kind of beautiful and kind of scary at the same time. What apps, gadgets, or tools cant you live without? Theres all kinds. We use Confluence a lot for many things at Blizzard, so whether its make meeting notes, or setting up the stage for a big conversation we want to have directly with people, or exposing things for our entire team they can weigh in on, whether its art, or design, our scheduling, everythings kind of built into there so that we can share information and have a mechanism to track and comment on it. We have a lot of internally developed tools that we use as well. One of the big ones is something called Play Tester, which is a way for the design team to basically create a list of all the things in a given build that they want people to check out and playfocusing the peoples attention on certain areas of the game. That tool not only gives us that information, but it allows us to quickly download and play the correct build on the correct correct environment so that we can actually jump in, play the game, and check out those things. Whats your workspace setup like? I do a billion things in Excel, even when I have bigger tools at my disposal. My actual workspace is an office with a whole bunch of chairs in it. Usually if Im in my office, and not on the way to a meeting, its an unending stream of people. My door is usually open and people will just come in and talk to me about random things. We do have white boards, and they are pretty crazy. Theres a lot of stuff on my whiteboard right now that I didnt erase because it was so chaotic. I was like, I dont know what we just did, but its kind of beautiful and kind of scary at the same time. My job overlaps with the production of the game, so I use Excel for a lot of tracking and visualizing things, but my job also intersects with the business of the game, too, so Im doing a lot of data analysis of things that come from Tableau, like data on the game itself, or data on the business of the game. For my own curiosity, or to answer questions that I have at any given moment, Im doing a lot of number crunching, and Excel is usually might go-to tool for for doing that Whats your best shortcut or life hack? My world is very chaotic, and theres a lot of things, so its going back to a very basic to-do list. When I say triage, its about sitting down and prioritizing. There are many things that are going to give in a day for me, and so its critical for me to identify the things that I want to ensure that I dont give on, so that Im making conscious choices of what Im letting go of and Im focusing on the things that are most critical for me to actually accomplish today. So, something as simple as just a basic to-do listand this is the one thing I write on paper physically, too. Everything else is digital except for this to-do list, so that Im going back to something tangible and physical that is ultimately guiding me on ensuring that if I do nothing else today, I have to do these things. Whats your best email hack? For a very long time, I was driven by rules. I get a lot of mail; Im copied on a lot of things. So I had not just a lot of rules, like, literally, thousands of rules, I had 17 years worth of rules, because I never clean them out. They basically just accumulated. But I got to a place where my rules started interacting in a really bad way, and I was losing things, and I actually killed every single rule I had. Now, even though I get literally thousands of emails, I am filtering my mail manually again. It was a weird thing to go back to, but its been better in the end, and its also made me a lot more disciplined about what Im responding to, what Im reading, and the things that I want push asidethat Im making a conscious choice to push them aside instead of some rule from 2003 that did it. Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work. Heroes makes patches and releases constantly. At any moment, there might be three or four or five releases in simultaneous parallel development, and we get to the point where we want to lock those things down as we approach actually launching them to the public. To do that, we start closing gates off. Many developers do this stuff, but for us, we used to have a thing called silver ticket, which was the path to golden ticket. Once you get to golden ticket, nothing changes without an approval. Like, I got a golden ticket, I can change this now. We had to extend that, though, because we werent very disciplined about sticking to golden ticketso we created silver ticket. Today, that process is very, very curated. At any moment, were stampeding towards locking down a built so that we can release it. And because we dont change our dates on anything herebasically, the game patches on a regular cadencethe question is Whats going to be in the patch? Did all the things that we wanted to do make it? Or did we yank a whole bunch of them out because we didnt have time for them? The games still going to patch, its just a question of whats inside of that patch. This process by which we arrive at our final release candidate, which is a version of the build thats actually going to go out to the public, is insane. Its just so much wrangling from a lot of people to to make sure that we lock ourselves out and close off every spigot of stuff that pours into that in time to release it. It never ends. We do that process today, and were starting into golden ticket mode on the next one immediately because Heroes releases are so close together. Our Live Operations team lives in perpetual state of release finalization. For anybody who finalizes releases, thats not a fun state to live in, but theyre mastering it and are really, really good at it. Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them? It takes village to make a game. I rely on everybody, from my leadership team, to other directors on my team, to every producer. Again, as as the Production Director, Im ultimately overseeing the pipelines for the game, our structure and strategy of the way were actually developing it. I have a team of producers at every level, going from associate producers to lead producers, that I trust to carry forth the timelines while also maintaining something very special to Blizzard. We dont ship things until theyre ready. Heroes moves very fast, so we have to this weird alchemy of how do we maintain Blizzard quality at the same time as moving incredibly quickly and releasing all the time. And it was a very different thing for us. We had to change our mentality and our workflow and our tools, everything had to change around that notion. And the production team is really the glue that holds it all together and keeps people honest, Production at Blizzard is not like this authority that comes in and says, You must do this and you must do it now. I kind of call us opportunistic enablers. Its about looking for those moments that we can help, that we can speed things up, that we can remove the roadblocks, that we can unblock people on, facilitate communication, everything we can do to keep the machine moving. And so production is the biggest part of that. Whats your favorite side project? Its not really a side project, But for me, its like a real shifting gears: Blizzcon. We create these moments where we want to talk about a lot of things for our game, and its a celebration to me, really, because we work on all this stuff, and theres a couple of times a year that we get the biggest platforms possible that we can speak to them. Now were physically here at Blizzcon on a Friday, and thats the magical time where we get to meet the players, and we get to talk to the journalists, and watch the esports, and all these things become real to us. Its not the work anymore, its the result of all that work and its a really special time to celebrate Whats the best advice youve ever received? I grew up with parents who were really passionate about their jobs. Their jobs werent about money, it was about something that they were excited to get up every morning and go to. My veterinary path was me trying to go, Well, I need to be professional. So this is professional, and I love animals, and its good, its all going to work out. But there was this moment where I had this turning point of, Should I go down this path of video games or continue down that? I talked to them, and they reiterated to me, You need to follow your passions. Thats what weve always done, and we would encourage you to do that as well. And I had to make some difficult life choices at that moment to change my path. I started from nothing, and there were no guarantees that this was all going to go anywhere at all. But having that support to just go, You have to go for these things, this is importantit transformed me. In Heroes, one of the best things you can do to be a better player is to stop dying. Whats a problem youre still trying to solve? Theres nothing that we do that I ever say, Cool. Were done with that. Check that box, were done, and lets move on to something else. Its always a question of, What if we try that? I love that. That part of it is exciting work. Id get really bored, I think, if I mastered game development. That challenge never goes away. On one hand, you never get some permanent sense of satisfaction, like, I mastered it! I did it! But that quest to get better, and see the constant improvements, is so satisfying. How are your skills as a Heroes of the Storm gamer, and do you feel you have to maintain those because you kind of run the ship? As a producer, its not like Im a balance designer and that my job is to competitively balance the game. I lean into that a little bit, because I am not by any means the best Heroes player in the world. I do play a lot of Heroes of the Storm ; Ive played, like, 7,000 games. I play pretty much every night for a couple hours. I sacrifice sleep to play Heroes. I genuinely enjoy the game and have a lot of fun with it, but Im a very average player. I had an experience at Gamescom, just in August, where they put me on stage with Team Liquid, a pro team, and members of Dignitas, another pro team. And there I was, and it was atrocious. I was so apologetic to them, and theyre like, No, its cool, well play with you,and Im like, Oh, dont do this to me ever again. I think theres this thing of like, Hey, youre not good at the game, so how can you make it, but for most of the things Im making calls on, how good I am has no bearing on it. Its more about me looking at the big picture of the game and thinking about whats important and hearing the feedback from players. Do you have a favorite Heroes of the Storm character? We released a character named Blaze in January. Usually Ill play a new hero until the next hero comes out, and Ill bounce around. Ive been playing Blaze almost nonstop since January, which is kind of insane. I just fell in love his his kit, the way his abilities interact. He also has a lot of sustain and escapes and things so he doesnt die a lot. In Heroes, one of the best things you can do to be a better player is to stop dying.","Kaeo Milker has had a long and eye-opening career at Blizzard Entertainment: QA, facilities management, recruiting and, now, heading up the company’s big MOBA franchise, Heroes of the Storm.

This shouldn't surprise anyone who watched the league's player draft earlier this month: In addition to NBA TV, it was streamed on Twitch.

"Jennifer Gray, CNN","(CNN)While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over. 
The potential is there for a ""bomb cyclone"" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. 
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. 
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. 
Things begin to unravel Tuesday
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota.
Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes. 
Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions.
Thursday the bottom drops out
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours.
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis. 
Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous. 
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. 
On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms.
The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest
Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely. 
We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected. 
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding. 
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend. 
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay.
CNN Meteorologist Dave Hennen and Allie Mazurek contributed to this report","While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it.

Rhett Jones,"Among the blizzard of news bits from Apple’s WWDC, a much-anticipated feature has returned to the beta for iOS 12: a mode for keeping the FBI and other snoopers out of your phone. The feature has come and gone in the past, but it’s looking more real and better than ever this time around. Still, I’ll believe it when it’s actually live. “USB Restricted Mode” has been spotted in previous iOS betas, but has never made it to a public release. It’s one of the most hotly anticipated features for security experts because it promises to be a major obstacle for iPhone hacking tools—like GrayKey and Cellebrite —that law enforcement has been using to break into encrypted phones. With the announcement of iOS 12, developers are getting their first look at the latest iteration of Apple’s mobile OS, and we now have a screenshot of the settings menu where you can turn USB Restricted Mode on or off. The mode is designed to disable USB connectivity on the iPhone after it goes a certain amount of time without being unlocked. In previous iterations, the time limit was seven days, but it now appears that it will only be an hour. The security feature is also mentioned in the release notes for iOS 12 beta. The public doesn’t know for certain how the iPhone cracking services that law enforcement uses actually work. But researchers at Elcomsoft explained the general theory last month: Before iOS 11, one could use an existing lockdown record to access the iPhone or iPad device for the purpose of creating a new local backup ( logical acquisition ). Essentially, this is exactly how experts perform logical acquisition in the vast majority of cases of iPhone and iPad devices that are locked with an unknown passcode. The lockdown record (a small file extracted from the suspect’s computer) allows accessing essential information about the device and initiating the backup sequence without the passcode. In addition to iTunes-style backups, the lockdown record could be used for pulling media files (pictures and videos), list installed apps, and access general information about the device. Apple has already introduced a seven-day time limit on how long lockdown records last, but with USB Restricted Mode it’ll be all but impossible to access them after an hour without using the numerical passcode for the phone. Yes, enabling this mode means you’ll probably have to punch in your passcode more often and it will complicate that (really convenient) Face ID thing, but having bad actors break into your phone is no fun either. FBI or not, better-encrypted protection is just an all-around good thing. We’ve asked Apple if it intends to include the feature in iOS 12's public release this fall, but did not receive an immediate reply. Ryan Duff, Director of Cyber Solutions at Point3 Security, told Motherboard he believes Apple is just getting a feel for what the best execution of the tool will be. “They definitely don’t want the scandal of removing a security feature because of something they didn’t anticipate,” he speculated. Apple is also likely nervous about what the reaction from law enforcement will be. Despite the expert consensus that a built-in encryption backdoor for the government will make everyone less safe, the FBI continues to make its case that it urgently needs one. That case was severely weakened in March when the agency admitted it was using totally inaccurate statistics for the number of devices it had on hand that couldn’t be cracked. It attributed the miscount to “programming errors.” All we can say is wait and see on this feature, but keep an eye out for it this fall. You’ll definitely want to turn it on as soon as it’s out.

Nicole Gallucci,"Snow may be dominating headlines in the wake of Thursday's "" bomb cyclone,"" but coastal flooding has proven to be another serious danger in places along the East Coast. In addition to blizzard conditions, Massachusetts has been walloped with the combination of astronomical high tides and strong onshore winds up to 75 mph. The resulting coastal flooding reached record levels in Boston, with severe flooding reported all along the coast. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained Flood waters took over sidewalks and streets, trapped cars, and shut down subway stations. The severity of the floods, which exceeded the region's benchmark storm of the Blizzard of 1978, was caused by a combination of high astronomical tides from Monday's supermoon, the timing of the storm that brought the strongest winds onto the coast at high tide, and a rising sea level over the past few decades. Perfect storm of ingredients for a major coastal flood 1) Supermoon Monday (high astro tides) 2) Worst of the storm hitting *at* high tide 3) Ice hunks chucked ashore from recent arctic cold 4) Some sea level rise since 1978 also 'helps' — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) January 4, 2018 'The Blizzard of 1978' gets some competition In February of1978 a winter storm struck New England that set records and killed 54 people. Much like that benchmark storm, this year's bomb cyclone's high tides and fierce winds meant a lot of flooding. In Boston back in '78, waves reached higher than 10 feet. Thursday's images of seawalls being breached and water pouring into streets were eerily reminiscent of the major blizzard 40 years ago. Currently in the midst of one of the worst coastal floods in generations. Topping water levels from the Blizzard '78 with just one tide cycle and a fast moving storm? That is surreal. https://t.co/1NJXeAOuVx — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) January 4, 2018 Wow!! Boston Harbor tide level up to 15.1 feet which ties the old record from the Blizzard of 78.

The Aquarium train Station was closed down as a result of the floods. Down by the aquarium, the water is coming up onto part of the harbor walk. “I’ve never seen anything close to this,” Rene Miller, a resident in a nearby building, said. “There was water over my boots, in the road.” (Also: dog out with owner) pic.twitter.com/uryAseE4kO — Steven with a ph (@steveannear) January 4, 2018 In an afternoon tweet, Boston's National Weather Service forecast office noted that though water from the coastal flooding will take hours and perhaps days to drain, they believe the worst is behind them. But super cold temperatures coming in next will likely cause water that's washed ashore to freeze. Other parts of Massachusetts and the Northeast Boston isn't the only part of Massachusetts that experienced flooding. Cities like Salem and Gloucester also saw treacherous water levels as the snow fell. Coastal flooding has also affected Maine and New Hampshire, as well as New Jersey, among other states.

Kellen Beck,"Diablo 3 is one of the most enrapturing games of all time. With the third installment of its gothic dungeon crawling series, Blizzard Entertainment created a masterpiece that continues to completely engross the brain six years into its life. The release of Diablo 3 and its expansions on Nintendo Switch is the perfect excuse to revisit one of the greatest games of all time. SEE ALSO: Top 10 'Overwatch' skins Ive been killed by I jumped into the Nintendo Switch version of Diablo 3 and sunk more than a dozen hours into the game within just a couple of days. Despite having played through the story and beyond a handful of times since its PC release in 2012, Diablo 3 pulled me in again, except this time I could play it anywhere I wanted. Running through demons like a hot knife through butter. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment A world worth visiting Diablo 3 is set in the fantasy world of Sanctuary, standing on the precipice of a demonic invasion. A star has fallen near the bleak town of New Tristram and the dead are rising. A hero has been sent to investigate the situation. The despair of Diablo 3 is unceasing A tale unfolds, with twists and turns and rising stakes that ends with an all-out war between the forces of heaven and hell as Diablo, the Prime Evil, seeks to destroy the home of the angels. Diablo 3 weaves through setting after dire setting, delving into torture dungeons devised by a mad king, a city beset by death with bodies choking buildings and streets, and even the streets of the High Heavens itself where angels, hopeless against the onslaught of hell, stand impaled by knotted black spikes. The settings are stunningly macabre. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment The despair of Diablo 3 is unceasing, only mitigated in fleeting moments by the hero's accomplishments against seemingly insurmountable evils. In any other context, the content might be too much, too overwhelming, but the backbone of Diablo 3 turns the dismal setting into a beautiful, cathartic orchestra of progression that is unmatched by almost every game that has come before or after. The evils of hell are relentless. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment The magic of Diablo Playing Diablo 3 is like sitting at the edge of the ocean's tide, with its cool, calm waves of salt water lapping over your legs to relieve the sun's skin-sizzling heat. The heat is wave after wave of demon, cultist, and crazed beast in Diablo, and the relieving water is the game's steady stream of new abilities and item upgrades. While the story of Diablo 3 is entertaining on its own, the magic of Diablo lies in this progression that continues long after the story wraps. There's nothing more satisfying than a powerful Corpse Explosion. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment As the hero of Diablo 3 levels up, the difficulty of enemies scales up right alongside them. New levels bring new abilities and passive upgrades that allow players to sculpt their hero to their own personal playstyle. Trying out new combos of moves to find the perfect balance keeps the game interesting even after dozens of hours of playing as the same character. It's an intensely gratifying feeling The secret sauce is the random loot that drops from elite enemies, treasure chests, and giant bosses. Sure, new abilities are fun, but the joy of Diablo bubbles up from the feeling of power that comes from earning a legendary item that gives you such a large stat boost that previously difficult hordes of enemies suddenly turn into walking cannon fodder. Enemies drop like flies when you get a good legendary item. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment In the lead up to a boss fight, it may take a handful of powerful attacks to take down an elite enemy, but if a legendary weapon drops, all of a sudden those enemies that used to give you pause go down within a second. It's an intensely gratifying feeling. Happening upon an especially powerful item is akin to being used to cutting grass with scissors and all of a sudden being handed a lawnmower. At times Diablo 3 is difficult, but persistence and patience will always reward players with that sweet nectar of power, allowing players to dig deeper into the game and its endlessly satisfying endgame content. The challenge never really ends with 17 levels of difficulty and new seasons that introduce new challenges. Diablo on Nintendo Switch Just as Diablo succeeds on other platforms, it succeeds on Nintendo Switch with a few added bonuses. The most obvious bonus is the fact that Diablo 3 can be played in both home console mode and handheld mode, which is a first for any Blizzard game. In fact, Diablo 3 's arrival on the Switch is the first time a Blizzard game has hit a Nintendo console since the Nintendo 64 version of StarCraft in 2000. I did this on the train to work. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment If you don't have Nintendo's online service, you still have access to Diablo 3 leaderboards and can still play local co-op (either using the same console or a couple of consoles near each other. That means LAN parties just got a whole lot easier. The Switch version of Diablo 3 also comes with some console-exclusive cosmetics, including a dark purple pair of ethereal wings inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a pet cucco (chicken) from Zelda, and the option to transmogrify all of your gear to look like the primary Zelda villain Ganondorf. You know I put on those wings and had that cucco follow me around all game and watch me destroy the most evil and powerful demons from hell. Check out my wings and cucco. My flair is unrivaled. Image: mashable / blizzard entertainment Having played the game on PC on and off for so many years, it took a couple hours to get used to playing a hack and slash dungeon crawler with a controller, but I sunk right into the game just like I've done half a dozen times before. It continues to be one of the best games I've ever played, no matter what system it's on. Diablo 3 invades the Nintendo Switch on Nov. 2.","Diablo 3 is one of the most enrapturing games of all time.

Jonathan Shieber,"The first match of the inaugural season of Overwatch is set for 4:00 pm PST to catch the kids on the West Coast as they get out of school, kids on the East Coast as they finish dinner, and kids in Asia as they get up in the morning. The two-year deal, which will include every. single. game. of the league’s first two seasons includes every geography but China (no word about who the streaming partner will be there). Twitch will be the third-party provider for everything from the regular season, through the playoffs and championship games and will broadcast in English, Korean, and French. The two partners are also working on finding ways to part fans from their money with different features and rewards that will give perks to fans like in-game items and exclusives, the company said. Fans can also spend money for Cheering, a Twitch virtual currency, with exclusive Overwatch League Cheermotes. “Our fans love to engage with content on Twitch, and we wanted to drive significant viewership of the Overwatch League in its inaugural season and beyond,” said Armin Zerza, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment, in a statement. The Overwatch League is a big bet for Blizzard/Activision, which has gone all-in to promote and support the league for its newest and fastest growing title (that fastest growing medal may be a function of the game’s novelty, or a function of the incredible spread of gaming since the launch of Overwatch in 2014 and the company’s last completely new game launch … in the 1990s). The first season of the league will run from January to June with playoffs and finals slated for July. Here are a list of the teams (and their owners) who have paid a reported $20 million dollars for rights to participate in the new league. Pacific Division o San Francisco Shock – Team Owner: Andy Miller, Co-Owner of Sacramento Kings and CEO of NRG Esports o Los Angeles Gladiators – Team Owners: Stan and Josh Kroenke, Owners of LA Rams, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Rapids and Arsenal F.C. o Los Angeles Valiant – Team Owner: Noah Whinston, CEO of Immortals (which recently received investment from Peter Levin, executive Lionsgate Entertainment) o Dallas Fuel – Team Owner: Mike Rufail, CEO of Team EnVyUs o Shanghai Dragons – Team Owner: NetEase, a Chinese internet technology company o Seoul Dynasty – Team Owner: Kevin Chou, CEO of KSV eSports Atlantic Division o Boston Uprising – Team Owner: Robert Kraft, Owner of New England Patriots and New England Revolution o New York Excelsior – Team Owner: Jeff Wilpon, COO of New York Mets o Philadelphia Fusion – Team Owner: Dave Scott, President &amp; CEO of Comcast Spectacor (Owner of Philadelphia Flyers and Wells Fargo Center in Philly) o Houston Outlaws – Team Owner: Hector Rodriguez, CEO of OpTic Gaming (which recently received investment from Texas Rangers co-owner Neil Liebman) o Florida Mayhem – Team Owner: Ben Spoont, CEO of Misfits Gaming (which recently received investment from Miami Heat) o London Spitfire – Team Owner: Jack Etienne, CEO of Cloud9 “The Overwatch League is making a major impact on esports by reshaping the industry with city-based teams,” said Kevin Lin, COO of Twitch. “Given Overwatch’s consistent reign as a top viewed game by our community, we look forward to offering their pioneering style of league play to a large and passionate fanbase that will be able to bond over not only their favorite plays, but hometown pride.” Hometown pride won’t be part of the first season of games, which will all take place at Blizzard Arena Los Angeles, in Burbank, California. The venue was custom-renovated for Blizzard Entertainment esports events and is housing all matches while local franchises get their own venues prepped for eSports. Fans can watch the games live by buying tickets for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday matches. The full schedule and information about ticket sales can be found at https://overwatchleague.com/ or you can look at the listings down here. Activision’s decision to go with Twitch as a partner makes sense given the massive reach Twitch has, but it does beg the question why it didn’t use mlg.tv (which it acquired)? That’s the exclusive platform for Call of Duty. Perhaps with Overwatch as the new marquee title, distribution trumped acquisition. No matter the reason, Twitch’s Overwatch deal is another step on the road to ensuring that Activision’s new league hits the ground running. Now we’ll see how far it can go.

David Lumb,"Have you yearned for an exciting career in SCIENCE? If you answered yes, you're hired! Announcing Hearthstone's newest expansion: The #Boomsday Project! https://t.co/dQGbLiaGlY pic.twitter.com/HxVgdOMkUz — Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) July 10, 2018 Boomsday introduces two new card keywords. If you have a minion of the 'mech' type, playing a card with the Magnetic tag will combine them into a bigger, stronger creature (kind of like an ad-hoc mechanical version of Deathstalker Rexxar's build-a-beast power). The second, Omega, empowers cards later in the game: Once you've gained ten mana crystals, playing a card with this keyword gives it a bonus effect. From an early look, this makes weaker cards more versatile, empowering them to go toe-to-for with higher-cost minions and spells. There are also 'Project' cards, spells that affect both players. There's a new card type, too: Legendary-rarity spells. Presumably, they'll have wondrous and specific effects, especially since you can only have one in your deck: The example shown, Myra's Unstable Element, draws the rest of your cards. Obviously this is foolish to play early on, but as the match winds down, this Hail Mary may just give players the right tools to secure a win. Also coming in the set are legendary minions -- excuse me, scientists -- that promise interesting interactions, like double-casting the next spell you play. Just like the last two expansions, Boomsday comes with a free player-vs-computer mode. Puzzle Lab is a dive into the Warcraft character Dr. Boom's laboratory, where players face bosses warped with gadgets and mad science. The previous Adventure-style excursions in December's Kobolds &amp; Catacombs and April's The Witchwood were decent fun and open to all players, so it's nice to see Blizzard continuing the tradition. Before the new set comes out in early August, the Hearthstone team will start revealing cards on a livestream at 10AM PT on July 23rd on the game's official Twitch channel.","The second expansion of the year for Blizzard's digital card game Hearthstone, called The Boomsday Project, is coming on August 7th.

Janine Engelbrecht,"report this adThe first month of 2019 has turned out to be tumultuous time for Activision Blizzard, as some of the companys top managers are leaving. Activision Blizzards CFO, Spencer Neumann, will be joining Netflix, and Blizzard Entertainments CFO, Amrita Ahuja, will be entering a new position at Square Inc. Following these changes, Activision has now also revealed as part of its SEC filing this week that Blizzards former president and co-founder, Mike Morhaime, will also be leaving the company in April.
In October last year, Morhaime stepped down from his position as the head of Blizzard and signed an agreement with Activision Blizzard to join the board as a special advisor. Since then, Morhaime has provided strategic advice to the company, but as of April 7, 2019, that agreement will conclude and he will no longer be part of the company at all. It is very likely that Morhaime planned to retire from his position as head of the company last year, but may have decided to stay on a bit longer as an advisor to reassure investors.
J. Allen Brack took over Morhaimes position as head of Blizzard after running its biggest title, World of Warcraft, with big success for a long time. Morhaime, who co-founded Blizzard in 1991 as Silicon &amp; Synapse, and had been a leader in the company ever since then, has previously expressed his great confidence in Brack, and has assured that the company is in good hands.
While Morhaimes departure in April may not have a significant impact on the future of the company, it looks as if other divisions of Activision Blizzard have been greatly affected by the recent structural changes made to the company. After splitting with Activision, Bungie recently announced that it will self-publish Destiny, and Blizzard has received a lot of criticism recently after the announcement of the mobile game, Diablo Immortal, among other things. Despite this, gamers may yet see more great games from these companies in the future.

Andrew Freedman,"A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast. The blizzard is the result of three distinct disturbances in the atmosphere as well as the intense contrast between the Arctic air mass in place across the East and a subtropical plume of moisture moving up the coast near the Gulf Stream. Non-tropical storms feed off air mass differences, along with upper level disturbances, and these ingredients are quickly coming together for a historically intense storm to form. SEE ALSO: A meteorological ‘bomb’ is set to go off along the East Coast, and dangerous cold will soon follow In fact, snow, sleet, and freezing rain is already underway across the Southeast, where the heaviest snowstorm on record is possible on Wednesday in Savannah, Georgia, and the first measurable snowfall in 28 years is falling in Tallahassee, Florida. Snow will overspread the region tonight/Thursday morning &amp; last most of the day. Heavy snowfall is possible around 9am to 4 pm w/ snowfall rates near 2 inches an hour. Travel may become difficult due to poor vsbys &amp; snow covered roads. Blowing &amp; drifting snow is also possible. pic.twitter.com/BSF9XzJj6f — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) January 3, 2018 While there are still nagging questions about the storm's exact track and evolution, it's clear that it will intensify at an explosive rate, potentially doubling the intensification rate needed to qualify for undergoing a process known to meteorologists as ""bombogenesis,"" which refers to a storm whose minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm is projected to go from about 998 millibars on Wednesday morning to 950 millibars by midday Thursday, a plunge of 48 millibars in about 24 hours. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Storms of this intensity are extremely unusual in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin when compared to climate records during the past 30 years. Hurricane Sandy, which had tropical characteristics, ruling it out as a direct comparison, had a minimum central air pressure of 946 millibars when it made landfall in New Jersey in October 2012. Blizzard conditions to hammer Northeast, Carolinas Late Tuesday and into Wednesday, computer models have tended to move the storm track to the west, bringing the heaviest precipitation over the East Coast. So, what first appeared to be a glancing blow now promises to be a full-fledged blizzard in some locations. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for Boston on Thursday, where up to a foot of snow is expected to fall, accompanied by wind gusts to 70 miles per hour. Computer model projection of satellite imagery on Jan. 4, 2018, from the high resolution NAM model. Image: tropicaltidbits Blizzard warnings have also been hoisted for parts of the Carolinas, and more may be issued later Wednesday depending on the latest computer model data. Blizzard warnings for up to a foot of snow, along with howling winds and low visibility, include Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia, which is the largest naval base in the world. Blizzard warnings are extremely rare in this area. Near-blizzard conditions are also anticipated to affect coastal Rhode Island and Connecticut, along with Long Island, with perhaps the toughest snowfall forecast reserved for New York City and New Jersey. Some computer model projections show this region getting buried by a foot of snow, while others show a far less severe event, with just 4 to 7 inches of snow. It may take until late Wednesday for the forecast to be ironed out for the Big Apple, and even then the level of uncertainty may be unusually high. The local National Weather Service office in New York City said the following in a morning technical forecast discussion on Wednesday: As mentioned, this remains a fluid situation based on model spread, with potential for these numbers to go down, but still seems more so upwards based on model trends and mode of SREF/GEFS/ ECMWF ensemble members compared to operational runs. This higher trend is reflected in latest WFO /WPC snow probs, with high probs of greater than 6 inches of snow across E LI /SE CT and low to moderate probs to Hudson River. A significant jump in the reasonable worse case has also been noted, with 1 in 10 chance of seeing more than 12-16 inches of snow across much of LI /CT, 8 to 12 inches of snow across NYC/NJ metro to Hudson River, and 4 to 8 inches N &amp; W still in play. To try to reduce the forecast uncertainty, the National Weather Service is dispatching hurricane hunter research aircraft to fly a route around the Southeast U.S. today to drop instruments that will gather data on winds, humidity, pressure, and other parameters. This information will then be fed directly into the agency's computer models, potentially making their projections more reliable. In recent years, the Weather Service has flown such missions outside of hurricane season for high uncertainty, high impact events, and this one definitely qualifies. Ice chunks to exacerbate coastal flooding Because the storm will intensify so significantly, and so quickly, it will generate very strong winds. These winds — in some instances gusting to hurricane force of 75 miles per hour — will drive water toward the coast, particularly in southeastern New England, where moderate to major coastal flooding is expected during high tides on Thursday. Given the recent, unrelenting cold snap, one additional threat will come from the ice chunks that are clogging many harbors and portions of Cape Cod Bay. These chunks could cause damage to shoreline infrastructure, or worsen flooding in some cases. Farther out at sea, high winds will create towering waves, creating a major hazard to mariners caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why this low pressure area will become such a monster The storm will have every ingredient it needs to intensify into a blockbuster. First, it will have ample upper level support from three distinct disturbances in the fast-moving current of air known as the jet stream. Once these combine into one, powerful system, they will promote lifting of the air over the East Coast, which is essential to forming precipitation. Lift is also key to the formation of a surface area of low pressure, as well as its intensification. An animation from the North American Model, known as the NAM, shows the combination of the three disturbances and the formation of a deep trough, or dip, in the jet stream off the East Coast, with the low pressure area tucked into it. If the model projections prove correct, as they have been so far, this could be one of the strongest winter storms on record, at least for this part of the North Atlantic Ocean. Image: tropicaltidbits The storm, named winter storm Grayson by The Weather Channel, will also have the advantage of forming in an area off the Southeast coast where the temperature contrast between frigid, dry Arctic air, near-record-warm ocean waters, and comparatively moist subtropical air is at its maximum, allowing the low pressure area to feast off this contrast as if it were at an all-you-can-eat buffet. And as it moves northward up the coast, it will also sustain itself through the release of latent heat via the formation of thunderstorms and precipitation in the cold sector. Winter Storm #Grayson will act as a heat bomb in the atmosphere in response to all the deep convection associated with the cyclone. Watch how this coastal cyclone accelerates the upper-level irrotational wind field, building the downstream jetstreak. #Science is awesome. pic.twitter.com/6V45hgw3d8 — Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) January 3, 2018 The Gulf Stream will play a key role in allowing this storm to explosively intensify, experts say. ""Relationships between the ocean and atmosphere are complicated, especially as they relate to explosively developing extratropical cyclones (like the one currently in the forecast),"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, in a Twitter message. ""But the extreme thermal contrast between very cold atmospheric temperatures over land and an unusually warm nearby Gulf Stream certainly sets the stage for impressive storm-strengthening potential,"" he added. ""Ocean conditions are not the only factor at play (atmospheric conditions, like the position and strength of jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere, are also critical), but they’re definitely important."" Polar vortex to follow this beastly storm The winter storm will plow into the Canadian Maritimes on Thursday night, and behind it, the coldest air of the season will pour southward, into the East, from Greenland, Hudson Bay, and the Arctic. Map showing a piece of the polar vortex (in white) moving from Hudson Bay down into New England on Saturday, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell Technically speaking, the cold that will follow the blizzard is associated with part of the polar vortex, which is a circulation of air around the Arctic that plays a role in determining how cold winters are in North America, Europe, and Asia. Temperatures of 30 degrees Fahrenheit below average are expected on Friday and Saturday in the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic, which will put all-time temperature records in jeopardy. Anyone that loses power during the storm will have to seek out heat elsewhere, as temperatures plunge well below zero at night, and barely recover above the single digits during the day. Even in New York City, the high temperature on Saturday may not climb much above 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and winds gusting to 30 miles per hour will make it feel far colder. Fortunately, this weekend appears to be the end of this extraordinarily long cold snap, as more seasonable temperatures return next week.","A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast.

David Murphy,"Feeling lucky? The first of two batches of tickets for Blizzard’s big BlizzCon gaming convention go on sale this week (Wednesday, May 9 and Saturday, May 12). If you want to attend in person and see the Level ?? Mike Morhaime up close, you’ll be facing off against a Zerg rush of eager gamers who are also looking to score tickets. Here are a few tips you can try to max out your odds: Set an alarm Obviously, you aren’t going to get any tickets for BlizzCon if you ignore or otherwise sleep through your alarm. And Blizzard isn’t kind with its on-sale times for its convention, especially for West Coast gamers—much of BlizzCon’s target audience, given the convention’s home base of Anaheim, California. BlizzCon tickets go on sale at 7 a.m. PT Wednesday, May 9 and a more-pleasant 10 a.m. PT Saturday, May 12. You’re going to want to be on the Universe website —the service Blizzard is using for ticketing this year—at least ten minutes before the on-sale time. Pro tip: Hit up time.gov and have the official, synchronized U.S. time playing in the background so you’ll know exactly when you should start mashing F5 (or clicking your browser’s refresh button) on the ticketing website. As you get closer and closer to the ticket sales time, your process will look a little something like this: Create a Universe account right now You’ll save a lot of time if you get a chance to buy tickets by creating a Universe account in advance. Click on this link, enter an email address and password you want to use, and... that’s it. Check your inbox for an email verification link and confirm your account, and make sure you’re logged into Universe’s website early on the day you’re looking to buy tickets. You can’t pre-populate your Universe account with your payment information in advance—alas—so don’t bother looking for this option anywhere in your account settings. Tickets are your top priority—care about nothing else If you’re lucky enough to make it past BlizzCon’s virtual waiting room and onto an actual page where you have to enter information to purchase tickets, don’t let any other side quests distract you from your primary mission. Since you set up a Universe account in advance, your name and email address should automatically populate on the ticket purchase page. You’ll have to select how many tickets you want—you get up to four—and you’ll need to enter your credit card information to complete the purchase. Last year’s BlizzCon was one of the higlights of the cosplay calendar. BlizzCon 2017 was no… Read more Read Don’t dawdle. It almost goes without saying, but don’t be a level one who sits there and manually hunts-and-pecks in a long credit card number. Copy your credit card information to your clipboard while you’re waiting in line, and paste it as quickly as possible into Universal’s ticket purchasing window once you’re in. Then, just type in the much-smaller expiration date (which you’ve already memorized, right?) If Universe asks you for your character’s name, don’t worry about it. You can provide that information later, if not at the convention itself when you go to pick up your badge. Don’t miss out on purchasing tickets because you were too busy trying to remember the spelling of “Acererak,” your level 110 Undead Warlock, or whether your “Caelestrasz” server has two Es or three. Assign all your tickets to yourself If you’re in the unenviable task of purchasing tickets for your BlizzCon group, here’s a quick tip: Just put all the tickets in your name. As in, when the ticketing system asks you what name you want to put on each ticket, use yours. The name on the ticket only matters for picking up your badges, and it’s a lot easier to manage group logistics if they’re all in your name—as long as you know, without any doubt, that you’ll be attending BlizzCon this year. Otherwise, you’ll waste valuable time typing in the names of your three friends. And if a friend finds out they can’t attend the convention in a few months, you’ll might not be able to edit the name on the ticket after a certain date. Then, to pick up that ticket, you’ll have to deal with the hassle of getting copies of their identifying information (and ticket barcode) to present at the pick-up booth, and it’s just not worth it. Put all the tickets in your name. Your friends can then have Blizzard reprint the tickets with their names (and characters’ info) on site. Try using more than one laptop, desktop, or browser to queue for tickets People multibox in World of Warcraft all the time. Why shouldn’t you try the same approach for BlizzCon tickets? You can increase the odds of you getting past Universe’s virtual waiting room by signing into your account (or making multiple accounts on Universe—just add “+[text]” to the end of your regular gmail address, for example) and signing in from different browsers on the various desktops and laptops within arm’s reach of your primary system. Each browser’s “normal” and “incognito” mode should get you two spots in the virtual queue, multiplied by however many browsers you use, multiplied by however many systems you use multiple browsers on. I wouldn’t go crazy, though. Since tickets are first-come, first-serve, having too many options in play might add an unnecessary delay as you figure out which browser, on which machine, successfully made it into the BlizzCon ticket-purchasing window. Phone a friend (or guildmate) One of the best ways to get BlizzCon tickets is to enlist others to help—your loved ones who don’t care about gaming, your roommates, or even members of your World of Warcraft guild. Sit in a chat room, a Slack, a Discord, a group-texting thread, or even a quick conference call (so you don’t accidentally purchase multiple pairs of tickets at the same time). If one of you gets into the ticket-purchasing screen before the others, make them the raid leader that has to buy tickets for everyone else. Don’t concede to failure If you don’t kill the ticketing boss on your first attempt, retry the raid. Don’t forget about Saturday’s sale. Keep tabs on Blizzard’s social media accounts to see if they offer up any other ticket sales beyond this week’s. Check out the sites LFBlizzCon, /r/Blizzcon, /r/BlizzconPassExchange, the BlizzCon Discord, and the unofficial BlizzCon 2018 Facebook group to see if anyone has any tickets they’re willing to part with (for face value; fuck scalpers). You might also want to consider ponying up $750 for the BlizzCon charity dinner, which goes on sale May 16, if you absolutely need a BlizzCon ticket at any price. You’ll have a much easier time buying charity tickets, given their higher price, than the mad rush that is BlizzCon general ticketing.","Feeling lucky?

Marcus Gilmer,"There's a Simpson's reference for any occasion. Friday night's annual Apple Cup was no exception. The matchup between number 16 Washington and their rival Washington State (number 8), wasn't just a big deal because of its impact on the Pac-12 conference championship game. There was also heavy snow throughout and it looked really awesome. In fact, there was so much snow that Fox announcer Robert Smith broke out into song and not just any song. Smith busted out the classic ""Mr. Plow"" song from a famous episode of The Simpsons (via Uproxx ). Beautiful. The rest of Twitter thought so, too, including Simpsons writer Al Jean who, alongside Mike Reiss, was show-runner of The Simpsons when this episode was written and aired.

It also granted a bonus resurrect. It doesn’t do that anymore either. In addition, the speed boost Guardian Angel gets from Valkyrie has been dropped by 50 percent, and Valkyrie now only lasts 15 seconds instead of 20. The Overwatch team explained that while they’ve already nerfed Mercy some, they felt that her ult still made her too powerful. “Mercy’s recent Resurrect changes have helped in allowing enemies to have more counter play in dealing with her,” they wrote, “but she was able to use Resurrect through Valkyrie enough to largely mitigate the impact of the previous changes.”","After weeks on Overwatch ’s public test realm, Blizzard’s big Mercy nerf has gone live.

Kevin Webb,"Blizzard Entertainment, one of the biggest names in the video game business, has begun a significant round of layoffs, Kotaku reports. The move seems to confirm earlier new reports from Bloomberg.
 Blizzard is responsible for flagship gaming franchises including ""World of Warcraft,"" ""Overwatch,"" ""Hearthstone,"" and ""Diablo."" A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 In a memo to staff obtained by Kotaku, Blizzard leadership promised an ""comprehensive severance package"" to affected employees. Kotaku reports that the job cuts could affect as many as hundreds of employees. 
 On Tuesday, Blizzard parent company Activision Blizzard is expected to report its earnings for the December quarter. The holiday quarter is traditionally the biggest of the year for the video game business, but Wall Street is projecting the company to show slowing revenue. Activision Blizzard stock has seen its value cut in half in recent months. 
 A person close to the company previously told Kotaku's Jason Schrier that the layoffs are expected to hit Blizzard's esports and publishing divisions especially hard. Blizzard, has spent the last several years supporting professional competition for its most popular games, including ""Overwatch,"" ""Hearthstone,"" and ""Starcraft."" 
 Notably, it seems that Blizzard esports head Amy Morhaime left the company in December, according to her LinkedIn. That came just months after Blizzard cofounder Mike Morhaime, her husband, announced that he would step down as president of the company. Morhaime is staying on as a strategic advisor to Blizzard through April. 
 Beyond Amy Morhaime and Mike Morhaime, Activision Blizzard has lost other key executives, including CFO Spencer Neumann. More recently, Activision Blizzard lost the rights to flagship online shooter ""Destiny 2,"" as developer Bungie opted to split off and self-publish the title. 
 Activision Blizzard cited underwhelming sales for the ""Destiny 2: Forsaken"" expansion as one of the reasons the company underperformed during the third quarter of 2018. In that quarter, the video game publisher reported a 5% decline in earnings over the same period of 2017, and revenue over the same quarter declined by 6.6% to $1.151 billion. 
 Blizzard has reportedly been working to cut costs since early last year. Employees at Blizzard told Kotaku that they were repeatedly told to reduce spending by former CFO Amrita Ahuja, who left in January 2019. In December, Eurogamer reported that Blizzard negotiated buyouts for more than 100 customer service employees based in Ireland.

Devindra Hardawar,"On stage at the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) today, CEO Jensen Huang described self-driving as ""probably the hardest computing technology we've ever encountered."" But, after the Uber accident, he says he was reminded just how important this work is. ""We have to solve it step by step by step,"" Huang said. ""We're dedicating ourselves to this problem. The grandest of computer problems."" On one end of the Constellation system is a server running NVIDIA's Drive Sim software. As you'd probably guess, it simulates all of the technology you'd find on a self-driving car, including sensors, cameras, radar and lidar (the light and distance measuring component). It's powered by the company's GPUs, each of which creates its own stream of sensor data. The simulation server can also render ""photoreal data streams"" to reflect all sorts of driving conditions, like a fierce blizzard or glare during a sunset. Another server is powered by the company's Drive Pegasus software, which runs all of NVIDIA's autonomous car technology and processes the incoming sensor data. The Pegasus server sends its responses back to the simulation machine for validation. That feedback loop occurs 30 times a second, according to NVIDIA. Using this dual server setup, car makers will be able to construct all sorts of extreme scenarios to see how their self-driving algorithms react. The obvious drawback is that it's tough to simulate every potential issue, but it's still better than relying entirely on real-world testing (especially since it can easily be run millions of times per day). Like any machine learning algorithm, NVIDIA's self-driving technology will only get better with every simulation. At CES, the company unveiled its Xavier system-on-a-chip, which will let other companies quickly build up their own autonomous vehicles.

Kyle Orland,"Heroes of the Storm will continue to increase this character roster going forward, but maybe not as quickly as previously.""/&gt; Enlarge / Heroes of the Storm will continue to increase this character roster going forward, but maybe not as quickly as previously. 10 with 8 posters participating Blizzard may only have seven active games listed on its Battle.net launcher at the moment, but that list includes some of the biggest in the gaming world. So when the company announces it's shifting its development priorities away from one of those ongoing online titles, it's a big deal. So it is with last night's surprise update on the status of Blizzard-universe MOBA Heroes of the Storm. Blizzard now says ""we need to take some of our talented developers and bring their skills to other projects,"" and thus has ""made the difficult decision to shift some developers from Heroes of the Storm to other teams."" This doesn't mean the immediate end of the game or anything of the sort. Blizzard promises continued active support, ""with new heroes, themed events, and other content that our community loves, though the cadence will change."" We're guessing that last part means the ""cadence"" will get less frequent, for what it's worth. Epic also says it's cancelling esports plans surrounding the game, and it won't renew the Heroes Global Championship and Heroes of the Dorm programs for next year. That suggests Heroes of the Storm wasn't able to get the expected traction in the lucrative esports market, where the biggest online games can really cash in on their popularity. That fact alone suggests Epic's promises of robust ""long-term sustainability"" for the game might not pan out for years and years. Heroes of the Storm has been far from a flop for Blizzard, with an estimated 6.5 million players as of April, according to Superdata. But that number paled in comparison to the tens of millions of players (and even more regular esports viewers) for genre heavyweights like Dota 2 and League of Legends. It seems there just wasn't room in the market for a third MOBAeven a well-received one with Blizzard's backingto succeed at that kind of scale. But HotS ' biggest competition may have come internally. With games like Hearthstone and Overwatch raking in money with tens of millions of players and robust esports scenes, even a minor hit like Heroes of the Storm starts looking like it might not be worth the smaller return on investment. Add in Blizzard's plans for new Diablo games on both mobile phones and PC, as well as other rumored projects, and you can see why HotS might end up being relatively neglected. We can't help but think of Epic's crowdsourced Unreal Tournament revamp, launched in alpha back in 2015. That project quietly stopped receiving updates last June, just as Fortnite started taking off, before development was officially confirmed as dead just this month. That's not a perfect analogy for Heroes of the Storm (which is still receiving updates), but probably echoes the long, slow decline the game can expect as Blizzard shifts its focus to its biggest hits.","Plans for HotS esports cancelled, suggesting slow decline.",2018-12-14T16:07:36Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Blizzard shifts developers away from Heroes of the Storm,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/blizzard-shifts-developers-away-from-heroes-of-the-storm/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/hots-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,blizzard,1
Anonymous,"Blizzard kicks off BlizzCon today, and hot off the heels of the Diablo 3 Nintendo Switch release ( our review ) is the next addition to the Diablo franchise: Diablo Immortal, coming to mobile devices on Android and iOS. There's not too much known about Diablo Immortal right now, but they did say that this game takes place after Diablo II: Lord of Destruction and before the events of Diablo III. This will be a full-fledged massively multiplayer online action RPG (MMOARPG) for mobile, and graphically speaking, it will look similar to Diablo III. Tyreal the Archangel is dead, and a shattered Worldstone is scattered all over, tainting and bringing forth ancient evils who want to harness the Worldstone's power to control mankind. If you're wondering how the gameplay on a touchscreen will be, don't worry. This is the first game that Blizzard has designed with mobile in mind, and it'll feature a virtual joystick in the bottom left, with several buttons for abilities on the right. Diablo Immortal will feature six playable character classes that most people will be familiar with: Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Necromancer, Demon Hunter, and Crusader. Oddly enough, the Witch Doctor from Diablo III seems to have been omitted, though more classes could be added later. These six classes were the only ones that were shown off at BlizzCon. With Diablo Immortal, every class gets new abilities that we haven't seen before. There will also be new zones, new stories, and new dungeons to play through. And like the full console and PC games, there's an online multiplayer experience, so you can team up with others and slay the demons of hell together. It appears that up to six people can play together at once, which is more than previous Diablo games (up to four). Diablo started out as a PC game, but Diablo III (originally released in 2012) has made its way onto the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and now Nintendo Switch.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations. First, there's the cold. The first two weeks of April have been the coldest on record for the Upper Midwest, and even some areas to the south, such as Little Rock, Arkansas, have seen temperatures during this period that are far below average. Such extreme cold is noteworthy given trends in the opposite direction related to global warming. The cold set the stage for a blizzard that slammed the Upper Midwest over the weekend. This storm was so severe that it set all-time records, not just milestones for the heaviest spring snowstorm. SEE ALSO: Researchers hit back at climate change deniers twisting polar bear science A staggering 24.2 inches of snow fell in Green Bay, Wisconsin, making it the heaviest April snowstorm on record, and the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm on record at any time of year. Similarly, Wausau, Wisconsin, picked up 20.7 inches of snow, setting an April snowstorm record and making it the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm of all-time at that location. The snowfall jackpot was Amherst, Wisconsin, where 33 inches fell, according to the National Weather Service. Minneapolis, which is no stranger to snow and cold weather, picked up 14.9 inches of snow, making it their heaviest April snowstorm on record. Thundersnow was reported in and around the Twin Cities as the storm intensified, leading to snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour at times. Another, weaker, snowstorm is slated to move across the Midwest during the next 2 days, bringing several inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The thick spring snowpack is raising fears of flooding if temperatures suddenly warm up and heavy rain were to fall in the coming weeks. Then there are the fires. In association with strong storm systems, massive walls of wind-driven flames have swept across the Plains, particularly in Oklahoma, where at least 300,000 acres went up in flames during the past week. Another ""Extremely Critical"" fire weather day looms in the Southwest on Tuesday, including parts of Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, with temperatures soaring into the 90s, winds gusting above 40 miles per hour, and relative humidity plunging to an arid 2 to 5 percent. Average temperature during the first half of April (top) and departures from average (bottom) during the same period. Image: NOAA CPC. The National Weather Service forecast office in Amarillo Texas warned Tuesday morning that ""A regional outbreak of dangerous wind-driven wildfires is possible."" Third, there's the severe weather and flooding. The same storm system that brought blizzard conditions to the Upper Midwest spawned at least a dozen tornadoes across the Southeast on Sunday and Monday, including an EF-2 tornado that struck Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday night. At one point on Monday, a nasty squall line stretched from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic, and rainfall was so intense in New York City that water came pouring into the aging subway system. Air travel was disrupted along the busy East Coast on Monday, particularly at the three major New York City area airports. In Boston, a heavy rain and cold onshore wind challenged runners of the Boston Marathon. And let's not forget the extreme weather whiplash that aggravated millions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic over the weekend, when temperatures in the 70s and 80s Fahrenheit suddenly plunged to the 30s and 40s within a matter of several hours between Saturday and Sunday, thanks to a ""backdoor"" cold front that moved from the northeast to the southwest. Such fronts are most common in the spring, when the temperature difference between the ocean and the land is at its peak. There are some signs of a warmup ahead late in the month and into May, though computer models have shown such glimmers of hope before, only to yank it away at the last minute, in favor of a colder, snowier solution.","The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations.

Kellen Beck,"Bungie and Activision are no longer working together.
In a joint statement from both Bungie and Activision, the two companies announced Thursday that will be cutting ties with each other. All publishing rights of the Bungie-developed series Destiny will be handed over to bungie by Activision at an unspecified date.
SEE ALSO: The best video games of 2018
This means that Bungie will be taking control of all rights for Destiny and Destiny 2, the latter of which released in 2017 and continues to be updated today.
In a statement from Bungie, the developer announced that it will be publishing Destiny on its own now, rather than find a new publisher to work with. Before partnering with Activision, Bungie was previously owned by Microsoft where the studio developed the first three Halo games.
""The planned transition process is already underway in its early stages, with Bungie and Activision both committed to making sure the handoff is as seamless as possible,"" Bungie said in its statement.
Many Destiny fans are excited about the development, has the community has routinely expressed its distaste for Activision's perceived involvement in the game.
Bungie first partnered with Activision in 2010, signing a 10-year agreement which seems to be getting cut short a year early (unless the split takes a whole year and change to wrap up). The first Destiny game launched in 2014.

There's no guarantee that these features will be going away or downplayed in the future, that'll be up to Bungie to decide. 
In its statement, the developer says that it has listened to fans with regard to its latest expansion, which could be a beacon of hope for players who have aired their grievances publicly.
""With Forsaken, weve learned, and listened, and leaned in to what we believe our players want from a great Destiny experience,"" Bungie said. ""Rest assured there is more of that on the way. Well continue to deliver on the existing Destiny roadmap, and were looking forward to releasing more seasonal experiences in the coming months, as well as surprising our community with some exciting announcements about what lies beyond.""
Activision will continue to work on its other properties, which includes the recently released Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. 
Activision is also partnered with Blizzard Entertainment under the joint banner of Activision Blizzard, and while the two companies have reportedly remained mostly independent in terms of game development, some Blizzard fans have expressed similar grievances to those of Destiny fans and have taken this opportunity to tell Activision to drop its relationship with Blizzard too.
Of course, this is all just perceived influence on popular game series, and we don't know exactly what kind of effect Activision has on its partners.","Bungie and Activision are no longer working together.

David Lumb,"""What the bill says is, 'Industry, state: sit down to figure out the best way to regulate this,'"" the bill's author state Senator Kevin Ranker told The News Tribune. ""It is unacceptable to be targeting our children with predatory gambling masked in a game with dancing bunnies or something."" The bill's text (PDF) includes loot boxes 'and similar types of mechanisms' on online titles and mobile apps, expanding the inquiry across all of video gaming. It would require the Washington state gambling commission to consult with the industry and commit a near year-long survey before submitting their findings by December 1st. The commission's report will also recommend how to regulate loot boxes and restrict the sale of games that include them, especially to young players. Rankin believes loot boxes and similar mechanisms are especially harmful for children who don't know better. ""If (parents) realized how predatory these game are then they wouldn't want them under their Christmas tree, they wouldn't want them going to their kids,"" Ranker told The News Tribune. While not a requirement for the final results, Rankin and his coauthors wrote their concern in the bill that games don't disclose loot box odds for receiving particular items. Loot box games rarely volunteer this information, and their studios are extremely coy about publishing the drop chances for, well, obvious reasons. Last month, Apple finally required games on the Apple Store to list their loot box odds, while China forced EVERY developer across all platforms to disclose theirs a year ago. That's the only reason we know the odds in every Overwatch, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm loot box drop, incidentally -- since Blizzard won't reveal them publicly.","Despite its long-awaited single-player story and gorgeous graphics and sounds, Star Wars Battlefront II will likely be remembered for one thing: Loot boxes, or the mismanagement of.

Jon Russell,"Valve is officially bringing its Steam game platform to China as it aims to take a chunk of the world’s largest market of gamers. Valve said it will work with local partner Perfect World, which it previously collaborated on to release major games Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Shanghai-based Perfect World will control local promotional, the selection of games and distribution. There’s no confirmed date for when the Steam China service will go live. The move makes perfect sense. For one thing, Valve has a vast opportunity to tap into. China’s games market is booming, with Newzoo forecasting that it represented $32.5 billion in 2017, ahead of the U.S., Japan, Germany and the UK. PC gaming has always been the base for revenue, but mobile is growing fast with Tencent — one of the largest gaming firms on the planet — recently reporting that its mobile revenue has overtaken that of PC. But, as with all things China, access is uncertain. Parts of Valve’s service were blocked in China last December, although the ability to guy games remained intact. It isn’t clear why the partial blockage occurred — China frequently upgrades its firewall technology which can trigger changes — but working with a local partner is a more reliable approach than going solo. That said, Perfect World will have to manage the inevitable government censorship demands. Despite having no official presence in China, more than one-quarter of Steam users have the language set to Basic Chinese, second only to English, according to a user survey. Whilst that also accounts for the Chinese diaspora, it is a sign that Steam already has significant traction among China’s gamers. There’s plenty of competition in this space, so Valve won’t simply waltz into dominance. Tencent has its own Steam-like platform while NetEase has partnered with big U.S. gaming companies like Bungie and Blizzard.","Valve is officially bringing its Steam game platform to China as it aims to take a chunk of the world’s largest market of gamers.

Jason Schreier,"Publisher Activision Blizzard has begun its long-rumored layoff process, informing employees this afternoon that it will be cutting staff. Rumors suggest that the layoffs could be in the hundreds.
This afternoon, the mega-publisher began notifying those who are being laid off across its various organizations, which include Activision, Blizzard, and King. 
At Blizzard, the layoffs appear to only have affected non-game-development departments, such as publishing and esports, both of which were expected to be hit hard.
Over the last few years, many of our non-development teams expanded to support various needs, Blizzard president J. Allen Brack said in a note to staff around 1pm PT that was obtained by Kotaku. Currently staffing levels on some teams are out of proportion with our current release slate. This means we need to scale down some areas of our organization. Im sorry to share that we will be parting ways with some of our colleagues in the U.S. today. In our regional offices, we anticipate similar evaluations, subject to local requirements.
The letter also promised a comprehensive severance package, continued health benefits, career coaching, and job placement assistance as well as profit-sharing bonuses for the previous year to those who are being laid off at Blizzard. (Blizzard employees receive twice yearly bonuses based on how the company performed financially.) Theres no way to make this transition easy for impacted employees, but we are doing what we can to support our colleagues, Brack wrote.
The news follows months of rumors about layoffs at the publisher, which heated up early last week as word began to spread that hundreds of people across Activision Blizzards various divisions might lose their jobs. Leading up to today, some of the publishers employees had been coming to work with no clue as to what might happen. One person at Blizzard told me this morning that as employees arrived, they cried and exchanged hugs in the parking lot.
Last fall, Kotaku reported that Blizzards 2018 mandate had been to cut costs and produce more games, and that as a result, layoffs would likely hit the companys support departments even as Blizzard continues to expand its development teams. Bracks email suggests the same. Its critical that we prioritize product development and grow the capacity of the teams doing this work to best serve our player community, he wrote. We also need to evolve operationally to provide the best support for new and existing products.
Meanwhile, in a press release to investors this afternoon, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick wrote: While our financial results for 2018 were the best
in our history, we didnt realize our full potential. To help us reach our full potential, we have made a number of
important leadership changes. These changes should enable us to achieve the many opportunities our industry affords us, especially with our powerful owned franchises, our strong commercial capabilities, our direct digital
connections to hundreds of millions of players, and our extraordinarily talented employees.

Emily Sullivan,"A winter storm created whiteout conditions across Kansas on Sunday, prompting blizzard warnings as it was projected to travel north through the Midwest and into New England this week, according to the National Weather Service. The storm caused major cancellations at Kansas City and Chicago airports, during a weekend that the AAA projected would see the highest travel volume in more than a dozen years as people return home after Thanksgiving. The storm will continue into northwest Missouri, northern Illinois and southeast Wisconsin before heading into New England, bringing dangerous blizzard conditions in its path, the NWS says. More than 1,270 flights nationwide were canceled on Sunday. Nearly 5,000 more have been delayed into Monday morning. Chicago's O'Hare airport, a hub for the entire Midwest, saw mass cancellations 801 arriving and departing flights were cancelled on Sunday, with more than 300 others delayed. However, Newsweek reports that it set a daily snowfall record of 5.3 inches in Kansas City, noting that the previous record of 3.9 inches was set in 1895. ""The National Weather Service said Kansas City International Airport received 5.3 inches, but totals ranged across the region,"" reports member station KCUR. ""The blizzard warning, which the NWS said was the first in Kansas City since Jan. 31, 2011, stretched south from the Missouri state line to Olathe, west to beyond Topeka and east to Macon, Missouri."" The storm shut down 235 miles of Interstate 70 in Kansas for several hours on Sunday, as well as a portion of Interstate 29 from Mound City, Missouri, to the state's border with Iowa. By Sunday afternoon, Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer declared a state of emergency. ""We strongly recommend that you postpone travel plans,"" the Republican said in a statement, noting gusting winds and whiteout conditions. The Kansas Division of Emergency Management has received multiple reports of drivers abandoning vehicles stuck in the snow. ""Road crews may not see you due to visibility issues. Stay in your vehicle,"" Colyer said. According to the statement, the Kansas National Guard has dispatched nine Stranded Motorists Assistance Response Teams throughout the state. Other snow totals throughout the state are still being measured, the Kansas City Star reports. Preliminary data from the NWS says different parts of the state received between 2 to 12 inches of snow. Over 67,000 power outages occurred throughout Kansas thanks to powerful wind gusts of over 55 mph that knocked down power lines, with Atchison, Leavenworth and Ottawa the hardest-hit areas, according to KCUR. As the storm passed through Kansas on Sunday evening, the National Weather Service lifted blizzard warnings from the state and declared them in parts of northeast Missouri, including St. Louis, north Illinois, including Chicago, and southeast Wisconsin.

"Maddy Myers on Compete, shared by Maddy Myers to Kotaku","All of the support players in Overwatch League will have a tough time during the first competitive season, slated to start next Wednesday night, and it’s all because of the character Mercy. The angelic healer has undergone multiple makeovers in the past few months, all with the intent to balance her most controversial ability: the resurrection. This week, Overwatch ’s play test region has introduced a whopping barrage of nerfs to the character that make her resurrection even harder to use. This new slew of Mercy changes has not been implemented in the actual game yet—just on the test region—and Blizzard’s patch notes about the new design say that developers “will likely be iterating on these changes in the coming weeks.” Mercy mains can only hope, because in her current test form, the healer has become a shadow of her former self. Mercy’s ultimate ability, the Valkyrie, used to give her an instant resurrection, bonus charging on that resurrection ability, plus a speed boost to ensure she could heal her teammates and get out of danger fast. Now, she doesn’t get an automatic resurrection anymore. She also moves much slower while in Valkyrie mode. And, once activated, Valkyrie only lasts 15 seconds instead of 20. That’s cold, Blizzard! Real cold. Mercy pros told Compete earlier this year that their number one idea for balancing Mercy would be to reduce the length of time of the Valkyrie ultimate. Except that the nerf doesn’t stop there. It also removes everything that makes the Valkyrie ultimate useful. Before, Mercy’s Valkyrie ability let her fly around super-fast, healing and raising the dead in an untouchable burst of power. Now, the Valkyrie reduces her resurrection opportunities and the speed boost that kept Mercy out of the fray. After the initial Valkyrie buffs, Mercy dominated as a healer pick, even after the introduction of the new and second-most popular healer character Moira. When Blizzard introduced Mercy’s super-powered Valkyrie mode, they also limited her resurrection abilities, perhaps hoping to de-emphasize that controversial skill of hers. Mercy can’t revive an entire team at once anymore; she has to go from person to person, and do the revivals within specific time and distance windows. To make up for those limitations, Blizzard gave her the Valkyrie mode, making Mercy into a more well-rounded battler. Mercy can still resurrect other players, although it’s much more difficult now than it used to be, and she also has the speed and power that comes with her Valkyrie mode. So she still seems unfair, even though her resurrection has been nerfed. Blizzard’s solution, apparently, is to keep the resurrection in its current limited form and also nerf the Valkyrie mode. As a result, Mercy’s gone from being an unusual character with a small but persistent fan base… to a character that has a hard-to-use resurrection ability and no other upsides. The constant changes to Mercy have unfolded alongside the ramp-up to Overwatch League. As I noted in my write-up of the Overwatch League preseason, Mercy’s resurrection skill is part of what makes Overwatch so different from other team shooters. It’s an ability that commentators rarely explain to audiences during matches, instead opting to highlight killstreaks by sniper characters. But Mercy’s abilities allow her to undo those impressive killstreaks, thereby undercutting the usual emphasis that other esports have on assassin snipers. Commentators’ inability to keep up with Mercy’s resurrections could be due to the fact that she’s only recently become competitively viable, thanks to that Valkyrie buff. Overwatch pros who previously played as other healers have had to switch to Mercy in the wake of her super-powered makeover, which meant that we saw a lot of Mercy newcomers trying their best during Overwatch League pre-season. This means we’ve seen a lot less of healers like Lucio and Ana, with many more teams declaring Mercy mandatory. By introducing these massive nerfs to Mercy in the final week before Overwatch League’s inaugural season, Blizzard seems to be sending a message that the hammer will be coming down soon, and that Overwatch League matches will not be dominated by the use of this controversial resurrection mechanic. The nerfs, as they currently appear, still do not take away Mercy’s resurrection skill but do make it even more difficult to perform. Perhaps these decisions make sense for anyone who wants Overwatch to look and feel more like Counter-Strike. But for non-pro players who just happen to enjoy playing Mercy? Sucks to be you! It also sucks for the pro players who main supports, because they’ve had to spend the past three months learning the Valkyrie version of Mercy—only to learn that she’s about to change yet again. Perhaps Mercy’s play test region updates will result in some valuable feedback that leads to a build for the character that preserves what makes her unique, while still allowing her to feel fair compared to her fellow healers. Also, these changes aren’t live yet, so Mercy’s old Valkyrie build will still dominate competitive play during Overwatch League’s launch week. There’s still a chance for a miracle to happen: a version of Mercy that makes sense. No matter what, though, people will still hate her. Mercy’s resurrection skill can’t be removed; it’s too central to who she is as a character, yet it’s also why people feel so frustrated by her. Blizzard has a choice here: either lean into it and design the rest of the game around this unconventional ability, or nerf Mercy into the ground so that people stop picking her. That second thing is easier. But the first thing would result in an esport that’s more unusual and, perhaps, more compelling… but it would require a complete reversal of every expectation and convention of how team shooters operate, so it won’t happen. Rest in peace, Mercy. They did you so wrong.","All of the support players in Overwatch League will have a tough time during the first competitive season, slated to start next Wednesday night, and it’s all because of the character Mercy.

Julie Muncy,"Games get announced, games get cancelled, players get mad. As Lion King fans might say, it's the circle of hypeand it's well-represented in this edition of Replay. Controversies, kiboshes, and the oddly high risk associated with surprise game unveilings. In other words, just a normal week. Blizzard Announces a Diablo Mobile Game, Making Everyone Furious At fan gathering Blizzcon late last week, Blizzard capped off their presentation with a surprise announcement: Diablo: Immortal would be a multiplayer mobile game set in the Diablo universe. It doesn't not make sense for the publisher to try to tap the gargantuan smartphone market, but with it having been more than six years since the last core title in the dungeon-crawling franchise (the last Diablo III expansion came out in 2017), hardcore fans were... well, they weren't happy. This wasn't the announcement a lot of fans wanted, and seeing a game that you don't think is going to be very good is a valid reason for disappointment. But gosh, the internet response was ugly. Here, I have an idea: What if we didn't announce videogames ? Just release them when they're ready. Keep hype cycles to a minimum. So much less shouting. Final Fantasy XV Is One Director (and Three Downloadable Episodes) Short Square Enix's Final Fantasy XV has had a storied, decade-long history of development limbo, which didn't stop just because the game came out: since release, the creators have worked to put out a wide selection of DLC that serves to patch in missing parts of the story, add multiplayer, and broadly expand its engaging world. That, however, is going to come to an end sooner than expected. Wednesday night, in one of the strangest announcement streams you'll ever see, Square announced that it was cancelling three of the four currently planned DLC packseverything except an episode about the character Ardynand that lead director Hajime Tabata would be leaving Square Enix altogether. It's not clear why Tabata is leaving, but the announcement mentions that he has another project in the works, and he'll be founding another company to see it through. After everything, it seems, Final Fantasy XV will remain somewhat unfinished. So it goes. Nintendo Removes Offensive Animation From Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Which, Good Attentive viewers might have noticed something off about Mr. Game and Watch, a fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate based on the line of retro Nintendo handhelds of the same name. As shown in recent promos, he has an attack based on the game Fire Attack, a game about a Civil War general fighting indigenous peoples and well, you can see where this is going. During the attack, Mr. Game and Watch briefly turns into a racist caricature. Pretty upsetting stuff. And, somewhat surprisingly, Nintendo is ahead of the curve on this one, announcing that the animation would be patched out upon release. While it probably shouldn't have ended up in the game in the first place, it's nice to see some swiftness from a company that's generally been less than responsive to concerns about representation from its Western audience. Next time, maybe keep it out of the trailers, too, huh? Recommendation of the Week: SUPERHOT for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 (and Oculus/Vive/PSVR) It's one of those weeks where I just want some good old-fashioned fantastical action. SUPERHOT isn't exactly old-fashioned, but it distills that desire for adrenaline and excitement down to its most basic parts. The premise is simple: time moves only when you do. Shoot your enemies. Survive. That mechanic turns action into choreography, letting you slowly map out moves that would make the heroes from The Matrix jealous. With a basic, stylized art style, it really sings.

ERIC MOSKOWITZ,"Waiting for the first real snow of winter is an annual exercise in anticipation and dread, with the accompanying hallmarks invariably falling into place: breathless headlines, familiar checkout line chatter, readying the shovels and snowblowers, restocking the cocoa, bracing for traffic tie-ups and rail delays or perhaps doing nothing at all. 
If that all feels eternal, consider what it was like to endure a snowstorm in a time before Gore-Tex and Doppler radar, snow blowers and plow trucks, subway commutes and automobile windshields actually, before automobiles. Instant hot chocolate didnt become a supermarket staple until the 1940s, and it took Swiss Miss until 1972 to roll out a revolutionary cocoa mix with mini marshmallows already inside. (Whatll Swiss Miss think of next, the first ads asked.)
Early New York Times photographs of snowstorms really capture the havoc, misery and peril a blizzard could visit on the city in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Blizzard of 1888, for example, dumped 21 inches of snow on the city and killed an estimated 200 New Yorkers. But even a garden-variety snowstorm in those days would menace the citys main form of transit horses and impose human suffering of all kinds, while posing the immense logistical challenge of clearing an entire city of snow.
Still, then as now, snow slowed the city down in a stop-and-look-around way. Itbrought a serene kind of beauty and wonder, turning almost anyone into Peter, the wide-eyed child hero of Ezra Jack Keatss 1962 ode to winter reverie, The Snowy Day.","Today, tickets in a snowstorm tend to mean violations for failing to shovel your walk.

So, basically, this is Cracker Jacks taken to whole other level. It's only available for a limited time. Dairy Queen But before you run to your nearest Dairy Queen, know that this is only available in 15 cities. Ughhhh, I know! This year marks the first time in nearly 50 years that all 30 MLB teams will open on the same day, and the Triple Play Blizzard is just as rare.

Cecilia D'Anastasio,"Today, Blizzard dropped Overwatch ’s latest map, a literal carnival of Blizzard references. “Blizzard World” is a theme park about Hearthstone, Starcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Warcraft. Playing it feels a lot like being invited to loud, garish party that you leave feeling just okay. Putting aside cute easter eggs, like a spawn point designed like a Hearthstone tavern, Blizzard World is a cookie-cutter hybrid map: part control point, part payload. Players pass through a defined choke point before claiming a point. Then, they take a payload through a winding pathway and into the goal. Alongside the path are a few small rooms and, above it, some platformed pathways. It’s a lot like King’s Row, a map with a somewhat straightforward strategy. Unlike Overwatch ’s newer maps, like Junkertown, Eichenwalde or Horizon Lunar Colony, Blizzard World feels plainer, despite its glitz and glamour. Its design doesn’t appear to vary from already-existing Overwatch maps in ways that immediately feel fresh. We’ve seen hybrid maps just like this before with tight choke points, long platforms and weaving side rooms. After a few games, Blizzard World didn’t feel too different. Today, we gave it a spin: Blizzard World serves its purpose—to showcase Blizzard’s numerous accomplishments and hype players for the publisher’s other games. Perhaps because of that, it seems to lack Overwatch ’s signature flair for interesting design. Blizzard World is enjoyable to tour but didn’t give me that great of a ride.","Today, Blizzard dropped Overwatch ’s latest map, a literal carnival of Blizzard references. “Blizzard World” is a theme park about Hearthstone, Starcraft, Heroes of the Storm and Warcraft.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Commuters in Chicago and across the Midwest will face a blizzard packing more than a foot of snow and whiteout conditions as they head back to work on Monday after the long Thanksgiving weekend. Blizzard warnings were in effect early on Monday in northeast Missouri through metro Chicago and northeast into Michigan as the storm brought winds up to 45 miles per hour (72 kph) and more than 12 inches (15 cm) of snow to the region, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. The service said in an advisory that travel on Monday morning will be “very dangerous to impossible” and the heavy snow was difficult to shovel and may cause falling tree limbs and power outages. The storm canceled 1,270 flights on Sunday for travelers trying to get home after the Thanksgiving weekend. Most of the cancellations were of flights departing or arriving at Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway Airport, which combined saw a total of about 900 flights canceled. At Kansas City International Airport, nearly 200 flights were canceled.

Engadget,"David Lumb Contributing Editor There's a juicy heresy in Lev Grossman's 2009 novel The Magicians and its two sequels, which subvert the cozy magical power fantasies in Narnia and Harry Potter. The core of that cultural skewering carries on in the SyFy show (loosely) adapting Grossman's books. I binged the first two seasons (currently on Netflix) while in the feverish throes of a nasty stomach bug, which is an adequate metaphor for the show's take on beloved childhood magic. Strip away the sentimentality and show the cruel realities of life-altering magic, and you'll arrive at a different truth about humanity. In this case, the show stares unflinchingly at a world where people use spellcraft and sorcery for selfish ends and quick fixes, which has devastating consequences. It's not a perfect show; It falls into subplots that do little for the story and less for the characters, but it's the only media chipping away at the assumption that magic would be benevolent and liberating. Sometimes the most seductive shortcuts have crippling costs -- perhaps just for everyone around you. Are they worth taking, and what would that say about you? The third season is almost over, and it's getting farther away from the source material, for better and worse: A straight adaptation of the book trilogy would've been a lot more concise and preserved the emotional body blows. But what can I say, I enjoy watching these characters finagle solutions to problems they created trying to fix other things. New viewers can blitz through seasons one and two on Netflix, while the third is available on SyFy's website -- though I'd recommend watching it on a streaming provider app to avoid the finicky web player. Richard Lawler Senior News Editor With motorsports seasons opening, March Madness at its peak and NBA action barreling toward the playoffs, I've been oddly obsessed with a different competition: Overwatch League. While I'm only just now diving into the world of eSports, millions more have plunged in already across a number of games. I've tried to watch a bit of eSports before but never got hooked. Games like Dota 2 or Street Fighter are a bit too fast and specific, while eRacing never matched the appeal of real-world action. Overwatch's focus on teamwork and roster of varied characters eventually pulled me in as a player, and suddenly, as a viewer. The work Blizzard has put in to make the game more watchable with floating cameras and team-specific colors helps a lot. While combat can occasionally be confusing as the camera jumps from one first-person perspective to another, there are enough replays and breakdowns between matches to help a novice keep up. I'm not as sold on many of the commentators, who occasionally opt for speed over clarity in their broadcast. Still, they seem to be settling in -- in the league's second stage (recently completed, with stage three scheduled to begin Wednesday) I noticed more time taken to educate viewers who might not know everything about team composition, strategy or what a particular buzzword means. Its first season is only halfway through, and besides the action happening on screens, we've seen it match or exceed other leagues with player issues of nearly every possible type. Simple things like teamwork and management don't come so easily to some squads despite a demanding practice and competition schedule, leading to roster changes. Players have been suspended and even cut for breaking vaguely defined rules, racism and personal scandals. Blizzard has to do more about the ""toxic"" behavior that feeds some competitors and viewers -- the live chat with each game is an unreadable mess -- but outside drama isn't always a bad thing when you're trying to build brand new reputations. The only trouble now is that I haven't picked a favorite team. Watching eSports means tracking teams and players across social media and their own regular live feeds in addition to the scheduled games. As previously mentioned, it also opens up opportunities for player's behavior to get them in hot water. I never thought I'd see anything more viewer-involved than people calling golf tournaments to report rule infractions, but in this world anyone can be screenshotted or have a video clip taken to show exactly what they've been doing.

Samuel Axon,"reader comments 0 Video shot and edited by CNE. Click here for transcript. Blizzard Entertainment just released Rialto, a new map for its hero-based first-person shooter Overwatch. Set in Venice, Italy, Rialto does a few things differently from past Overwatch maps—it has more water than any before it and uses 90° angles in tightly packed streets to create choke points in addition to narrow archways, to name a couple changes. In this video, Overwatch Assistant Game Director Aaron Keller talks about how Blizzard approached designing the map and about the process for making Overwatch maps in general. I visited Blizzard HQ in Irvine, California, and among many other things, I asked Keller: How do you balance a map for nearly 30 characters? Do you design maps to be strong for specific characters? How do you make sure framerates stay high and the action stays fast? And do the differences between consoles and PCs affect map designs in any way? If you want answers to all those questions and more, check out the video. Keller also revealed a hint about a new easter egg, and he explained how a fleet of small boats run by robot gondoliers saved players from getting booped into the water too much and helped keep the map balanced.",Assistant Game Director Aaron Keller explains what went into making Rialto fun.,2018-05-10T16:21:13Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Video: How Blizzard makes Overwatch maps, and why tiny boats made Rialto more balanced",https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/video-the-inside-story-of-overwatchs-rialto-map-and-its-robot-gondoliers/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-8.33.38-AM-760x380.png,ars-technica,Ars Technica,blizzard,1
Rachel England,"According to Kaplan, the Overwatch team has been paying attention to feedback from fans, and has tweaked the rules of Capture the Flag accordingly. For a start, there will be no more draws -- as Kaplan notes, ""they can feel very anticlimactic"". As such, the game will feature a sudden-death mechanic. Kaplan explains: ""What will happen is both teams' flags are moved closer to the center of the map and then the map resumes at that point and the teams will go for the flags and then they only have a very short distance to cap."" Flag pick-up rules are also changing. ""Picking up the flag is instant, but if you use certain abilities and these abilities are limited to things that either give you invulnerability or give you great mobility, those abilities will drop the flag. We call these 'restricted abilities'."" Kaplan explains that Winston's leap, for example, will cause the flag to drop if he's holding it. Players can also expect six legendary skins, a four-week competitive season for the new Capture the Flag mode and a new highlight intro for one of the game's heroes -- although Kaplan didn't say which one. The Year of the Dog event kicks off on February 8 on Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC.","It's the Year of the Dog in Overwatch, and Blizzard game director Jeff Kaplan has revealed a little more about what we can expect from the game's seasonal event.

Jason Schreier,"Staff at the game publisher Activision-Blizzard are preparing for big layoffs next week, waiting to see who will be one of potentially hundreds of employees who could lose their jobs on Tuesday. 
Theres been no official news from the publisher yet, but we first heard word of upcoming layoffs late last year. At the time, Activision and Blizzard staff told me they expected the axe to fall in February, and I started hearing more and more rumors earlier this week, with whispers suggesting that the layoffs would happen ahead of the publishers quarterly earnings call, which is on Tuesday, February 12. Employees across all of Activisions offices have been kept in the dark as they wait to see what will happen. Some say theyre pretty sure theyre safe; others say they fear they will no longer have jobs next week.
Last night, Bloomberg reported that the layoffs would take place on Tuesday and number in the hundreds. When contacted earlier this week by Kotaku about the upcoming layoffs, a spokesperson for Activision did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Blizzard declined to comment (twice).
This news comes after a tumultuous year for the publisher, which consists of two entities, Activision and Blizzard. Both Activision and Blizzard operate autonomously but are governed by the same C-suite of executives, including CEO Bobby Kotick (whose salary in 2017 was roughly $28.6 million). 
At Blizzard, 2018 was a year full of cost-cutting, under chief operating officer Armin Zerza, whose mandate has been to reduce spending and produce more games. (Other than expansions and remasters, Blizzard has not released a new game since Overwatch in May 2016.) Employees all across Blizzard have been told to cut their budgets and spend less money, and theres general concern about Activisions creeping influence as the company looks to make more financially-driven decisions. In October, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime stepped down, to be replaced by Blizzard veteran J. Allen Bracknot as CEO, but, notably, as president. In December, Blizzard abruptly killed the Heroes of the Storm esports program and cut down the development team for that game, its least successful.
People who work or have worked at Blizzard told me that they expect Tuesdays layoffs to be primarily in non-game-development departments, such as publishing, marketing, and sales. Some of those jobs and roles may then fall to Activision proper, further reducing Blizzards autonomy.
Activision, meanwhile, has also been struggling. Last years Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 was successful, one of 2018's best-selling games according to NPD data, but the publisher lost one of its major franchises after Destiny 2's Forsaken expansion failed to meet Activisions lofty expectations. In January, developer Bungie announced that it was parting ways with Activision and ending its development contract early, putting the bow on a long-doomed relationship. Bungie would hang onto the Destiny franchise as a result.
The business angle is that Activision is now missing one of its biggest tentpoles, but the human angle is that the split leaves people in danger of losing their jobs. Activision employed an entire team full of Destiny support staffPR, marketing, social media, business, and so onwho now have no work. Two people close to the company told me that there have been a few opportunities for those former Destiny staff to move to other teams, but those opportunities are limited, and members of that department are perhaps the most worried about their job security.
The layoffs will likely happen on Monday and Tuesday. For now, those who might be affected can do nothing but wait.","Staff at the game publisher Activision-Blizzard are preparing for big layoffs next week, waiting to see who will be one of potentially hundreds of employees who could lose their jobs on Tuesday.

SEE ALSO: We almost got a cat-with-a-jetpack hero in 'Overwatch' Take a look: Overwatch 's latest upcoming hero was first teased on Monday with a short clip showing the hero rolling through a ratty looking alleyway. People immediately began speculating about what kind of hero this could be, with some thinking it could be a new omnic like Bastion and others dreaming up a sort of ball suit for one of Winston's fellow apes from the Horizon Lunar Colony. Nope. It's a hamster. We don't know anything official about this hamster and its death ball yet, but we can surmise a few things from these short teasers. First, this hero will probably be pretty fast, likely able to switch back and forth from its quick rolling mode and its more offensive mode where it busts out a pair of guns. Second, the hamster itself seems to be pretty intelligent and is likely piloting this death ball without any outside help. Perhaps this hamster was genetically engineered like Winston and possesses the knowledge to build death balls. Third, this hero was likely inspired by development team's early ideas for a hero that's a cat with a jetpack. Yes, that's a thing. As for this hero's name, its background, and its abilities, we'll have to wait and see what Blizzard reveals.","Overwatch 's 28th hero is a hamster. Oh, I'm sorry, does that sound ridiculous?

Jordan Crook,"Though Apex Legends continues to be a bright spot for EA, the game publisher and the industry as a whole still have hurdles ahead. Today, EA confirmed that it laid off 350 people in marketing, publishing and other departments.
Kotaku obtained an email sent to employees by EA CEO Andrew Wilson, which said that the main focus is increasing the quality of its games. A part of that is ‘ramping down’ the company’s presence in Japan and Russia. Famitsu later confirmed that the Japan office has been closed entirely.
Of the 9,000 global employees at EA, the 350 people laid off represent 3.8 percent of EA’s workforce.
EA isn’t alone. The publisher’s biggest competitor, Activision Blizzard, let go nearly 800 employees, roughly 8 percent of its workforce, in February.
“We have a vision to be the World’s Greatest Games Company,” wrote Wilson in an email obtained and published by Kotaku. “If we’re honest with ourselves, we’re not there right now. We have work to do with our games, our player relationships, and our business. Across the company, teams are already taking action to ensure we are creating higher-quality games and live services, reaching more platforms with our content and subscriptions, improving our Frostbite tools, focusing our network and cloud gaming priorities, and closing the gap between us and our player communities.”
EA sent Kotaku the following statement:
Today we took some important steps as a company to address our challenges and prepare for the opportunities ahead. As we look across a changing world around us, its clear that we must change with it. Were making deliberate moves to better deliver on our commitments, refine our organization and meet the needs of our players. As part of this, we have made changes to our marketing and publishing organization, our operations teams, and we are ramping down our current presence in Japan and Russia as we focus on different ways to serve our players in those markets. In addition to organizational changes, we are deeply focused on increasing quality in our games and services. Great games will continue to be at the core of everything we do, and we are thinking differently about how to amaze and inspire our players.
This is a difficult day. The changes were making today will impact about 350 roles in our 9,000-person company. These are important but very hard decisions, and we do not take them lightly. We are friends and colleagues at EA, we appreciate and value everyones contributions, and we are doing everything we can to ensure we are looking after our people to help them through this period to find their next opportunity. This is our top priority.
Gaming continues to grow, and record-breaking titles like Fortnite and EA’s own Apex Legends show that there is plenty of money to be made. In fact, Blizzard Activision CEO announced record earnings in 2018 but also said that the company failed to reach its full potential.
That potential has to do with a shift from a model that generates revenue once for a single title to something more akin to a content subscription service. In-app purchases and gaming subscriptions are accounting for more and more of game publishers’ revenues. The Financial Times reported in 2017 that, ten years prior, one-off sales of packaged home-console software accounted for 64 percent of the global gaming market. That number dropped to 30 percent as in-game purchases and subscriptions continue to grow in popularity, as seen with games like Fortnite and Apex Legends.
This more layered revenue structure creates something sticky with consumers, but also runs the risk of alienating them by constantly asking for more money, especially with a game that isn’t free to play.
We’ve reached out to EA and will update if/when we know more.","Though Apex Legends continues to be a bright spot for EA, the game publisher and the industry as a whole still have hurdles ahead.

David Perry,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar answers questions from voters tonight in a CNN town hall with Don Lemon at 10 p.m. ET. David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. 
 (CNN)The launch of Sen. Amy Klobuchar's presidential campaign at Boom Island Park on the Mississippi River, in the middle of a friendly little blizzard, was a perfect political event. Thousands of people showed up, some on skis or hauling their kids on sleds, to see Minnesota's senior senator enter the race. Dogs played in the snow. There were campfires burning in the shelters and plenty of hot cocoa to go around. 
As I drank hot cider and listened to DJ Dudley D spin tunes, I found myself doing a little shuffle dance to stay warm. A drumline from north Minneapolis kicked the formal proceedings off, elite Minnesota politicians revved up the crowd, and the snow fell harder as the DJ played Dessa's ""The Bullpen"" for the senator's entrance music. Klobuchar gave her speech. The crowd cheered. We all sloshed our way back to our cars to get warm. That's the fun part. Now the hard work of the campaign begins.
Amy Klobuchar will inevitably be compared to the other female senators running for president. When it comes to policy and self-presentation (as opposed to the sexism that she will inevitably experience), that's a mistake. Klobuchar is not going to be competing on the progressive edge of the Democratic primary electorate, but is instead is projecting herself as a hard-working, blue-collar Midwesterner. 
This is a frame that distinguishes her from the coastal candidates like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand and reminds me, more than anything else, of the pitch that former Vice President Joe Biden might make if he decides to run. Like Biden has in the past and surely would do again, Klobuchar's reaching out to an important swath of the overall electorate in competitive states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but also to a much smaller percentage of the Democratic primary electorate. So as she starts campaigning, there are plenty of questions about whether she can win and what her formal entry into the race might mean for other would-be moderate candidates or potential candidates.
Those questions, though, belong to the ""horse race,"" and they aren't the most important questions we should be asking in these early days. One of my goals, following the work of NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen, is to weigh candidates not based on their poll numbers but on the extent to which they are addressing the key issues voiced by their potential voters -- one of whom is me. I am a Minnesota Democrat. I voted for Klobuchar enthusiastically last November, but none of the 2020 candidates have won me over yet. 
At the announcement, despite the snow, I heard potential supporters consistently raise three issues: climate change, universal healthcare and income inequality. I know what the progressive vision to address these three issues looks like. The Green New Deal proposes transforming the economy while addressing decarbonization at the same time. Competing Medicare- and Medicaid-for-all proposals would move toward more universal healthcare (with important caveats around immigrants and long-term support for disabled Americans). Wealth taxes (such as the one proposed by Elizabeth Warren) and increases on top marginal tax rates would go a long way towards shifting wealth back to the people who actually do the hard work in this country. Few in the Minnesota crowd talked about the abuses of the Department of Homeland Security, but again, there's a progressive vision of a more just America: Abolish ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). 
I'm less sure what the centrist vision is. Klobuchar has called the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-all discussion starters. Well, the time to have that discussion is right now. Anyone who wants to be president needs a plan to get us from where we are today to a better place. If not Medicare-for-all, then what's the plan to cover everyone? 
If not the Green New Deal, what is the senator's plan to hold climate change to a 2-degree rise? The details matter. Klobuchar, but really everyone who wants to be president, needs to give more than glib, polished answers -- they need to actually show their work.","The launch of Sen.

Midwest Communications Inc.,"By Brendan O'Brien MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - A powerful spring storm pummeled the U.S. Midwest and Plains on Saturday with blizzard conditions and high winds, while tornadoes and thunderstorms menaced some of the South. Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota were under warnings for blizzard-like conditions. The city of St. Paul, Minnesota, declared a snow emergency. Forecasters were expecting more than a foot (30 cm) of snow in parts of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Wind gusts around Duluth, Minnesota, had exceeded 50 miles (80 km) per hour, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. ""Mother nature continues to troll us,"" the agency's office serving the Minneapolis/St. Paul region said on Twitter, posting a video of snow falling at a rate of 1 to 2 inches (2 to 5 cm) per hour. As the storm pushed south into Saturday evening, authorities warned that severe thunderstorms could bring gusting winds, flooding and hail. Severe weather warnings extended from Texas to central Alabama, which was under a tornado watch. At least one tornado packing winds up to 90 miles (145 km) per hour was reported near Jackson, Mississippi, the NWS said. Freezing rain and ice storms were expected to move into northern New England through Monday. National weather forecasters also cautioned that high winds were producing critical fire conditions in the Southern Plains. On Friday, the system produced 17 reports of tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas, the weather service said. Four people were injured and 160 buildings damaged in a possible tornado in northwest Arkansas, local media reported. An overnight storm killed a 1-year-old girl when a tree fell on a recreational vehicle where she was sleeping, the sheriff's office in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, said. State Governor John Bel Edwards said in a statement that emergency responders had been activated in anticipation of severe weather. Some 750 flights in and out of airports in Minnesota and Toronto were canceled, the website flightaware.com reported. The airport in Rochester, Minnesota, said on Twitter it had canceled all flights until Sunday morning ""due to the extreme weather conditions."" Rapidly falling snow also prompted Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to suspend flight operations into Saturday evening. About 29,000 customers in Texas and Louisiana were without power on Saturday afternoon, along with an additional 50,000 in Michigan and Wisconsin, the website Poweroutage.us reported.

Riley  Johnson,"A powerful spring blizzard swept into the state Friday, first smacking the Panhandle and central Nebraska before threatening northeastern counties. Lincoln was never supposed to see the worst of this storm, but by noontime Saturday, it appeared the impacts here would be even less than expected. The capital city has been just warm enough to prevent rain from switching to snow, with an area of low pressure essentially parked between Beatrice and Falls City keeping the rain-snow line at bay for now, said Van DeWald of the National Weather Service office in Valley. To the north and west, though, the blizzard's effects were seemingly inescapable. At least one person died on Interstate 80 during the storm. Rollo Ward, 61, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, was killed after losing control of his eastbound semitrailer, entering the median and crashing into an already stranded semi on near Chappell, according to the Nebraska State Patrol. The patrol and other agencies also helped more than 100 motorists who became stranded on I-80 near Sidney, ferrying them from their vehicles using Sidney Public Schools buses escorted by patrol cruisers and snow plows. +5 Sidney Public Schools buses carry stranded motorists from Interstate 80 near Sidney overnight Friday as a blizzard sweeps across Nebraska. Courtesy photo/Nebraska State Patrol ""The assembled law enforcement officers went door to door, knocking on all vehicles and rescuing all of the occupants in freezing temperatures,"" the patrol said in a news release. ""The rescued motorists were taken to Light Memorial Presbyterian Church in Sidney or to a hotel of their choice."" Travel across much of Nebraska was still near-impossible Saturday afternoon, with road closures on Interstate 80, U.S. 30 and U.S. 20. Westbound I-80 was closed from Grand Island to the Wyoming state line, and eastbound I-80 was closed from Wyoming to Ogallala. “Road conditions are still not safe across the state and travel is not recommended,” said Bryan Tuma, assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a news release. “Stay home and be safe.” Gov. Pete Ricketts declared an emergency, making state funds available to local entities responding to the blizzard. And the Emergency Management Agency was working to set up a temporary communications tower after 60 mph winds toppled a dispatch tower that served several counties in the Loup Valley in north-central Nebraska. The town of Newport in Rock County had seen 14 inches of snowfall as of 8 a.m. Saturday, and more was falling. At least 11 inches of snow had fallen in Valentine, and areas near Chadron and Sidney received nearly 10 inches. But even areas with less snowfall saw whiteout conditions due to high winds. Much of Nebraska experienced wind gusts in excess of 50-60 mph. the Ogallala area clocked a 68 mph gust Friday afternoon. In Lincoln, snow was expected to arrive by mid-afternoon and linger into the evening, with possible accumulations of about 1 inch. Wind gusts already exceeded 43 mph. City crews planned to treat major streets and bridges with granular salt pre-wet with brine starting at noon. ""The application is expected to be completed after 8 p.m. and crews will remain on patrol to monitor street conditions,"" city officials said in a news release. The Lincoln area is under a winter weather advisory until 7 p.m. Much of the rest of the state is under a blizzard warning. Just Friday, the high in Lincoln was 82 degrees.

William Parks,"report this adThe beginning of 2019 has been marked by a number of changes at Activision Blizzard, with the companys CFO, Spencer Neumann, leaving to join Netflix and Blizzard CFO Amrita Ahuja taking a new position at Square Inc. Today saw yet another shakeup when it was announced that the company is relinquishing the publishing rights to Bungies Destiny, and this has seemingly led to a significant drop in the value of Activision Blizzards stock.
Specifically, the companys stock fell more than 6.5% following the announcement that Activision Blizzard would be separating itself from Destiny 2. This drop occurred in after hours trading, following a day that put the  stock up 1% to $51.35, as the announcement was made after the market had already closed.
Indeed investors appear to be concerned about the implications of losing Destiny as a revenue stream, and Stifel analysts suggest that the sci-fi shooters absence will create a void across Activision Publishings content pipeline. That said, analysts further indicate that the overall financial ramifications will likely be limited, and Activision Blizzard seems to share this sentiment, stating in a securities filing that it does not expect an operating loss to occur.
When Activision Blizzard began publishing Destiny, following a partnership with Bungie that started in 2010, the companys stock was on the rise. In 2015, it hit an all-time high before encountering some notable dips, which culminated last year with the company closing 2018 down 26% on the market.
Some analysts have cited concerns about the companys 2019 release schedule as a culprit for these losses, pointing to a controversial showing at last years BlizzCon in particular. While Activision Blizzard indicates that the loss of Destiny will have no impact on its bottom line, the absence of the title from the companys portfolio is certainly not improving the years offerings.
Last November, Activision Blizzard indicated that Destinys financial performance had fallen below expectations, leading to Destiny 2s game director, Luke Smith, taking to social media in defense of the title. Clearly, the two companies have not been seeing eye-to-eye on the franchise, and time will tell just how much impact the split has on the companys finances.

Rachel Reeves,"The first week of March will roar in with travel-disrupting snow, strong winds and blizzard conditions across the north-central United States. After spreading accumulating snow over the northern and central Rockies this weekend, snow and wind will ramp up across the northern Plains Sunday night into Monday. The winds combining with the snow will lead to local whiteout and blizzard conditions, according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun. The worst of the blizzard is expected across the Dakotas, from Minot and Bismarck, North Dakota, to Pierre, South Dakota.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Snow will blow and drift across roadways and the open landscape, making driving difficult, if not impossible, along stretches of interstates 90 and 94. Anyone who must travel is encouraged to pack a winter survival kit in the event you become stranded. Officials may be forced to close some roads. RELATED: How to drive safely in the snow Life-saving items to keep in your car in case a winter emergency happens Midweek nor’easter to renew risk of travel disruptions, power outages in northeastern US While the worst conditions rage to the west, windswept snow can still reduce visibility and create treacherous travel in Fargo, North Dakota; Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota; and Green Bay, Wisconsin. There is the potential for many communities to pick up 6 inches or more of snow with this storm across the north-central U.S. “Bismarck has only received around 18 inches of snow so far this season and could receive around a foot or more from this event alone,” Rathbun said. Precipitation will start with rain and/or a bit of ice across the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin prior to colder air wrapping into the storm. Snow may struggle to stick to roads and sidewalks initially in these areas. However, as the temperature plummets and the ground cools, motorists and pedestrians will need to be wary of slick travel.

The heavy burst of snow may cause roads to quickly become covered and treacherous for motorists. ""Flight delays and cancellations can quickly mount around Minneapolis on Monday afternoon,"" Pydynowski said. ""Anyone with plans later Monday should prepare for postponements."" The band of snow will continue to sweep eastward and create slippery travel for a time over Michigan and surrounding areas on Monday night and Tuesday. This snow will graze Chicago and Detroit. The worst of the snowstorm will be over by Tuesday. However, there can still be pocket of heavier snow that may lead to minor travel disruptions across the north-central U.S. See images of storms in the U.S. this year: CHICAGO, USA - JANUARY 20: A view of the frozen trees and ornamentals at Whihala Beach Park with the impact of surges and extremely cold weather in Chicago, Illionis, United States on January 20, 2018.

The southern portion of the nation's midsection will avoid snowy conditions but may face other hazards from the storm. ""While the snow falls to the north, winds strong enough to cause power outages and overturn high-profile vehicles along I-80 and I-70 will gradually sweep southward across the central Plains Monday into Tuesday,"" Pydynowski said. If any wildfires ignite to end the weekend, the winds would create issues for firefighting efforts. Calmer conditions are expected to return at midweek as the storm restrengthens along the Northeast coast, causing residents to face more power outages and travel disruptions.

Alex Newman,"What has been ruled a blizzard in many parts of the state is still going strong into Tuesday evening. More than 100 schools have already been canceled for Wednesday, about 200,000 homes are without power, and Boston is weighing what to do with the St. Patrick's Day Parade route. Dozens of cities and towns have already got more than a foot of snow. The number of Massachusetts homes without power has dipped below 200,000. As of 6:32 p.m., the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency said 196,270 were in the dark - a daunting number but one that falls well short of the damage done in the previous two storms.

mph on Cape Cod, clocking in at 81 mph in East Falmouth, 79 mph in Hyannis and 77 mph on Nantucket. Boston saw wind speeds of 49 mph. At a midday press conference, Gov. Charlie Baker cautioned that the storm is far from over, according to the State House News Service. ""This storm is still getting -- I wouldn't call it still getting going, but there is still a lot of time left in this storm,"" Baker said from the Department of Transportation Highway Operations Center in South Boston. Baker added that heavy snow is forecasted to continue to fall about 1-3 inches per hour for much of the day. The latest totals still call for 12-18 inches in eastern and central Massachusetts and as much as 2 feet for parts of Cape Cod and the southeastern part of the state. Officials will speak with emergency management officials and municipal leaders at 3 p.m. to discuss the latest forecast and conditions across the state, according to Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito. Baker said utility crews are stationed around regions expected to be among the hardest hit so they can respond quickly once the storm passes and begin the work of restoring power. ""As soon as the snow stops and the wind stops blowing we'll be pushing the utilities to give people a sense about when the power will be back on,"" he said. ""Over the course of the past 10 days the utilities have restored 750,000 homes and businesses that were without power... and my guess is they will move quickly and aggressively to deal with this once the snow stops.""

""In 2018, Activision Blizzard had roughly 9,600 employees, which would mean nearly 800 people are now out of work,"" reports Kotaku. ""This afternoon, the mega-publisher began notifying those who are being laid off across its various organizations, which include Activision, Blizzard, and King."" From the report: On the earnings call, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told investors that the company had ""once again achieved record results in 2018"" but that the company would be consolidating and restructuring because of missed expectations for 2018 and lowered expectations for 2019. The company said it would be cutting mainly non-game-development departments and bolstering its development staff for franchises like Call of Duty and Diablo. Development sources from across the industry told Kotaku this afternoon that the layoffs have affected Activision publishing, Blizzard, King, and some of Activision's studios, including High Moon. At Blizzard, the layoffs appear to only have affected non-game-development departments, such as publishing and esports, both of which were expected to be hit hard. ""Over the last few years, many of our non-development teams expanded to support various needs,"" Blizzard president J. Allen Brack said in a note to staff. ""Currently staffing levels on some teams are out of proportion with our current release slate. This means we need to scale down some areas of our organization. I'm sorry to share that we will be parting ways with some of our colleagues in the U.S. today. In our regional offices, we anticipate similar evaluations, subject to local requirements."" Thankfully, the letter promised ""a comprehensive severance package,"" continued health benefits, career coaching, and job placement assistance as well as profit-sharing bonuses for the previous year to those who are being laid off at Blizzard. ""There's no way to make this transition easy for impacted employees, but we are doing what we can to support our colleagues,"" Brack wrote.","On an earnings call this afternoon, publisher Activision Blizzard said that it would be eliminating 8% of its staff.

Kellen Beck,"World of Warcraft Classic is delivering on its promise to bring back the original World of Warcraft experience, for better or worse. I had a chance to play the World of Warcraft Classic demo at BlizzCon, rolling a level 15 Tauren shaman to try to recapture the experience of my youth. Kicking around in the arid Barrens zone that I remember from the good old days, I was struck by how foreign the game felt. SEE ALSO: How 'World of Warcraft' became a life-consuming addiction for me Since WoW first launched in 2004, a ton of changes have been made to the game. Of course there have been some visual upgrades and aesthetic changes, and then the expansion World of Warcraft: Cataclysm changed the actual landscape of many of the games' zones and storylines. Those are the sort of changes I expected to see reverted in World of Warcraft Classic. What I didn't remember was how much changed in the game at the system level. Things like item drop rates. Things like mana management. Things like combat speed and quests. Playing World of Warcraft Classic feels like Blizzard took modern WoW and hit it in the knees with a lead pipe. In the Crossroads of the Barrens, I grabbed a couple of quests that had me hunting raptors, killing plainstriders, and locating Mankrik's wife a classic lineup of quests. Right off the bat, I looked at my minimap to see where I would find these plainstriders. But there was no golden arrow or blue circle to lead me toward the plainstriders whose beaks I needed to collect. I had to read the quest text to find out that they were located to the east. I had to read directions. I haven't done that in years thanks to the built-in quest helper that Blizzard added to WoW. These guys are a real pain in the ass. Image: blizzard entertainment Once I found the plainstriders, I started killing them, very slowly, one at a time, and found that less than 50% of them had beaks when I looted them. They were also pretty spread out around the desert landscape, so it took me around 15 minutes to finish the single quest a process that is usually done within a couple minutes these days. They are a bunch of little changes, but wow do they add up It was kind of agonizing, but it brought back some good memories of lazy days working my way up to level 34 on my Tauren shaman in vanilla WoW over the course of several months. The game was slow, but that is part of what made it such a wonderful experience. If you wanted to do anything in vanilla WoW, you had to dedicate a lot of time to it. If you wanted to do a dungeon, there was no helpful group finder that automatically paired you with other players so you would have to spend a long time gathering a group of players on your realm before diving in. Gold was pretty hard to come by too, raid groups were hard to get together, high-end gear was reserved for the best and most dedicated players, and there were no super fast flying mounts. You couldn't even get your first mount until you were level 40, and even when you hit level you probably had to grind a bit to get the gold required to buy it. During a panel about World of Warcraft Classic at BlizzCon, game director Ion Hazzikostas mentioned some other differences between WoW Classic and modern WoW, many that I had forgotten about over the years. They are a bunch of little changes, but wow do they add up. Westfall had quite the glow-up. Image: blizzard entertainment One thing that stuck out was that the mail system was going back to a delay when players send a piece of mail. Right now, mail delivery between players is pretty much instant, whereas back then it would take an hour to get to the recipient. Hazzikostas pointed out that, if you wanted to get something crafted, it might be easier to go and meet them somewhere rather than spend a couple of hours waiting for some back-and-forth mail business. This paired with needing to find players for dungeons and other things meant you were probably more likely to make deeper connections with players. It's something I felt in the demo as me and a group of people tried to get a group together to dive in to the Wailing Caverns dungeon. It wasn't easy, and to be honest we didn't even make it to the entrance of the dungeon (although it wasn't for lack of trying), but it felt like through that struggle we connected in a way that I haven't connected with fellow dungeoneers in a long, long time. WoW Classic was slow. A lot slower than I remembered. But it felt good to be back.","World of Warcraft Classic is delivering on its promise to bring back the original World of Warcraft experience, for better or worse.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"A strong winter storm will spread across much of Colorado and parts of the central United States on Wednesday, sending hurricane-force winds and heavy snow across the region, meteorologists said.
The fierce winter weather, part of which was expected to classify as a bomb cyclone, was expected to pummel parts of Colorado and rapidly intensify throughout the day, the National Weather Service said.
Heavy rains turning to snow, blizzard conditions and high winds will also affect areas of the country from the Central Rockies across the Plains, and from the Mississippi Valley into the Upper Great Lakes, including Wyoming, Nebraska and South Dakota.
In Colorado, computer simulations showed a record change in pressure that suggested conditions for the bomb cyclone, also known as a winter hurricane.","The storm will spread across much of the state and other parts of the central United States on Wednesday, bringing with it hurricane-force winds.",2019-03-13T14:47:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘Bomb Cyclone’ With High Winds and Heavy Snow Takes Aim at Colorado,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/bomb-cyclone-colorado.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/us/13xp-storm/13xp-storm-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,blizzard,1
Mark Weinraub,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers, who have spent the last month sifting through damage left by a storm that flooded more than a million acres of crop land, now face a blizzard ahead of planting season. 
The storm hit the U.S. Rockies on Wednesday and was forecast to move eastward, threatening to bring as much as 30 inches of snow to western Minnesota and southeast South Dakota and another round of flooding to the Plains states. 
“We are still recovering from the bomb cyclone and the floods,” said Craig Frenzen, a 55-year-old farmer from Fullerton, Nebraska. “This storm is testing our will, testing our mindset about what we are going to do with farmland that is left.” 
Frenzen, who grows corn, soybeans and wheat and raises cattle, said about a sixth of his acreage was devastated by the floods in March. Even after the waters receded, his land was strewn with sand, silt and other debris that he estimated would cost $500 to $600 an acre to get back into production. 
The latest storm would delay planting on his remaining acres and threaten some of the cattle, particularly young calves and pregnant cows. The herd must be constantly monitored throughout the storm to ensure that animals do not suffocate in the snow. 
“It’s no sleep,” said Frenzen, who was setting up wind breaks on his operations as protection from hypothermia. 
The storm will hit just as many farmers are making their final preparations to begin planting. Growers were hoping to get an early start this year as a rainy fall limited the amount of field work they could do after harvest, but the weather has not cooperated. 
“It is a very wet snow,” said Drew Lerner, meteorologist with World Weather Inc. “It will melt and there is no place for that moisture to go.” 
Spring delays threaten productivity at a time when the farm economy is already under severe stress and growers’ profits are falling due to the trade war with China. 
“With prices as low as they are you need to maximize yields as much as you can,” said Darin Anderson, a farmer in Valley City, North Dakota. “You already know you are going to be behind the eight ball from the get go. Everyone is behind.”

Matthew S. Schwartz,"A massive spring storm is bringing blizzard conditions to several central U.S. states, leading officials to close hundreds of schools and hundreds of miles of roads.
NASA/NOAA GOES Project
Interstates were closed for hundreds of miles in the Midwest and Plains Thursday, as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought a major winter storm to states in those regions. Some towns that just days ago were experiencing sunshine and temperate weather are now under one or two feet of snow.
Most of Nebraska and South Dakota remained under a blizzard warning Thursday afternoon, as snow continued to cause dangerous conditions. Minnesota, Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Upper Peninsula face a winter storm warning. Eastern North Dakota is under a flood warning.
Parts of South Dakota have seen up to 18 inches of snow, and ""thunder snow"" snow that falls alongside the crash of thunder and the flash of lightning was also reported in the central part of the state. ""It's essentially a thunderstorm, but it's cold enough for snow,"" Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist, told the Associated Press.
Minnesota has faced snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Hundreds of schools canceled classes Thursday. More than 200 accidents were reported throughout the state. A video from the Minnesota Department of Transportation shows every power line down along a strength of Highway 59 near Fulda, in the southeastern side of the state.
In Minnesota, the bad weather will continue through Friday, with winds gusting more than to 50, according to the National Weather Service.
Some of the snow might be tinted orange, the Twin Cities NWS said. ""The color is likely due to dust that was blown by high winds all the way from west Texas.""
Whiteout conditions were reported Wednesday night northeast of Denver to the Nebraska state line, Colorado Public Radio reported. Some major roads were closed for hundreds of miles because of poor visibility and blowing snow. Colorado DOT closed 150 miles of Interstate 76, and Interstate 70 was closed between Kansas and the Denver metro area, CPR said.
In Nebraska, Interstate 80 and Highway 30 were closed on Thursday morning between Lexington and Wyoming a distance of about 200 miles.

Street food starts trends. A lot of great restaurants, cafés, and dessert spots started as street food: New York has Big Gay Ice Cream, Van Leeuwen, Halal Guys, Korilla, and more. One of Twitters early practical uses was as a way to track taco trucks. As a genre of cuisine, it tends to be cheap, fast, and democratic.

Rowan Kaiser,"Heroes of the Storm isn’t dead. But it isn’t alive, either. Blizzard Entertainment’s announcement this week that it was ending Heroes esports entirely, shifting developers off the game, and “changing the cadence” of updates effectively stated that the game was shifting away from active development.The maudlin tone of the piece, even though it said the game was continuing development, made it fairly clear: Blizzard will support Heroes as it is for a while, but it’s halting its attempts to make it a hit. There are several clues in that direction in the open letter. First, when it says it’s changing the cadence of hero releases, it’s worth noting that it’s been six weeks since Heroes’ last new addition, Orphea, with nothing new on the horizon — that’s the longest it’s been between new hero releases since early in its beta. Moreover, while the letter promises new content, it specifically doesn’t mention new maps — the thing that has separated Heroes from its competitors. But it’s the end of esports, with the canceling of the Heroes of the Storm Global Championship (HGC), that really indicates the Blizzard has surrendered to the market. To be sure: the HGC was never especially popular. I watched most of it last year, and despite an increasingly high quality both of the production and the competitive matches ( this is amazing! ), it usually hovered around 20,000-to-30,000 Twitch viewers, and I’m not sure, even in the biggest of matches, that it ever cracked 50,000. That’s not good. That lack of esports success reveals the core tensions at the heart of HOTS, and the thing that probably doomed it: as a game, it was never able to remedy the difference between casual and competitive play. It bet heavily on being the MOBA for casual players while also trying to develop a competitive playerbase and an esports league of the sort that Blizzard games have been known for. How Blizzard games work Blizzard had good reason to believe that it could hit both the casual and competitive market: that’s what its history says it’s good at. Blizzard, as a company, is rarely directly innovative in its games. Instead, it has achieved monumental success by moving into existing genres with games that are more accessible and more polished. Warcraft and Starcraft muscled in over early real-time strategy games by having the better interface (left-click selects and right-click moves!) in-game, but also making it much, much easier to connect to other players online. This is something that’s been a success for Blizzard over and over. Diablo’s ease of use and superb graphics and music blasted roguelikes into the mainstream. World of Warcraft’s appeal came from how streamlined it felt compared to the chaotic original massively multiplayer RPGs, as well as the aesthetic appeal of the, well, world of Warcraft. And more recently, of course, both Hearthstone and Overwatch have wildly exceeded expectations for digital card games and team shooters. What’s essential to all these games’ success, however, is that they also successfully converted casual players into players who cared about the depth of the game. Whether it be competitive Starcraft players, WOW raid tanks or role-playing guilds, or grinding for gems in Diablo II, the history of Blizzard and its players is one of curious players being developed into diehard fans. Where Heroes succeeded … and failed At a technical level, Heroes of the Storm fits this model. Yes, it’s built on MOBAs like the original Defense of the Ancients, with multiple lanes, heroes with a limited set of skills, and the demand for teamwork. But HOTS simplified this in that Blizzard way, eliminating the traditional MOBA annoyance of last-hitting minions, streamlining team leveling, and having creative maps that channeled players into objectives so that they always knew what they should be doing. So far, so good. But Blizzard was always unable to take that next step of casual players learning the depths of the game — and largely due to its own mistakes, which can be seen in how Heroes esports never caught on. The core problem with Heroes of the Storm came from its default game mode: Quick Match. The idea of Heroes, embodied in Quick Match, was that you could pick any combination of characters, jump into a game, and it would be fun. This was both a core design philosophy and how it pushed players to play. The matchmaking would make what it believed were fair teams based on Blizzard’s class system of Assassin-Support-Warrior-Specialist. The problem with that was that, at higher levels, the game stopped being played that way. Blizzard was extremely wary of defining a “meta” for Heroes of the Storm — because they wanted it to seem casual — but in any kind of competitive game that doesn’t have an official meta, one will grow up without it, and in this case, it did without Blizzard ever being able to grapple with it. Solo laning for (no) profit Here’s a key example: the solo laner. At pro and high levels of competitive play, an extremely specific role, the solo, evolved. This player would usually work on the top lane of a map, making sure that the team gathered experience, and popping into fights in order to gain the advantage of surprise. Several of the pro scene’s top players, like Dignitas’ “Wubby” and Tempo Storm’s “Glaurung” played this role. The evolution of the solo lane role led to characters with survivability against ambushes, which meant, for most of last year, that it was primarily filled by the unofficial category of “bruisers” — melee characters either with enough hit points or self-healing to get out of tough spots, and doing enough damage to swing late-game team fights. This meant Warrior characters like Dehaka or Arthas, or Assassins like Thrall or Malthael. You can start to see the problem arising just in that description: How on earth would a new player know that there’s a specific role that multiple characters from multiple different classes can play? It gets worse. The characters ho are treated as being the best solo laners for new players to try are usually in the Specialist class, who are designed to push lanes as much as they can. So the game not only doesn’t show players the “right” way to play, it actively pushes them in a different direction. But that’s not even the wrong direction! At most levels of play, those lane-pushing specialists like Azmodan and Sylvanas? They’re actually great! It’s just that at the pro level, coordination and fast movement meant that those characters were effectively useless, because they were so easy to seek and destroy. But for general use, they’re almost overpowered. And in Quick Match? Unless you randomly got a counterpart to one of those specialists, it’s possible you’d just straight up lose the game based on a bad random composition. So what ended up happening, throughout all of Heroes of the Storm’s existence, is that the pros, by and large, played an extremely different game from general use in Quick Match, and a game that was still pretty damn different from competitive players. Blizzard’s halting attempt to acknowledge this? This summer, a few blog posts framed through the lens of the pros, and an oft-promised, never-delivered reclassification system for its heroes. Thus the problems persisted. Most players would get stuck in Quick Match and never check out the depth of the draft modes. Or if they did, the communication of how to play a ranked mode well wasn’t in the game. And esports, which can often be used to bridge that gap, never filled that role in Heroes. The end of esports, the end of Heroes Heroes of the Storm, in part because it was so wary of setting a meta, never came anywhere near succeeding at aligning conventional play with high-level play. And this meant there was both always a severely limited ceiling for Heroes esports, but also that players wanting to get better by watching the pros would have limited ability to do that. And this pulled out one of the three pillars that competitive games usually need to achieve lasting success. A strong casual presence was something Heroes always had; a basic competitive scene was in increasingly good shape over time as the game adapted after its big HOTS 2.0 launch. But an esports scene that would feed back into both of those things, like League of Legends and Dota 2 possess? That gets players hyped to learn more, and that focuses media attention back on the game to get new players? This pillar never existed sufficiently well, despite all the noble attempts to get it in place. Without it, it seems clear that Blizzard has given up on expecting Heroes of the Storm to ever be more than it is. And they’re probably correct to do so — it’s been almost five years since the beta started. It’s just hard not to see where the potential got wasted.",It's just hard not to see where Blizzard wasted Heroes of the Storm's potential.,2018-12-15T14:10:07Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Venturebeat.com'}","Heroes of the Storm eulogy: For once, Blizzard couldn’t balance the casual and competive",https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/15/heroes-of-the-storm-eulogy-for-once-blizzard-couldnt-balance-the-casual-and-competive/,https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/orphia-2.jpg?fit=1549%2C851&strip=all,,Venturebeat.com,blizzard,1
Camila Domonoske,"Notes An NOAA GOES satellite image shows the massive winter storm currently affecting New England. Credit: NOAA A massive winter storm continues to travel up the East Coast, with heavy snow falling from New Jersey to Maine as road crews in Georgia are stilling cleaning up patches of ice. The ""bomb cyclone"" that's bludgeoning New England is a powerful storm, bringing bitter cold and the chance of heavy snow. The National Weather Service warns of possible blizzard conditions, with the risk of damaging, hurricane-force winds. The rate at which the storm has intensified is unusual — the Capital Weather Gang at the Washington Post called it ""astonishing."" A storm can be classified as a ""bomb cyclone,"" or a particularly fast-forming storm, if the pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm has more than doubled that pace. ""This storm's pressure tanked 53 millibars in 21 hours (and 59 millibars in 24 hours ), which puts it into the upper echelon of the most explosive East Coast storms ever observed — and perhaps even at the top,"" the Post writes. The winter storm off the East coast has deepened ~24 millibars in a mere 7 hours. It is very rare for a storm to intensify so fast (usually 24 millibars in 24 hours is the standard for a rapidly intensifying storm). For all our friends out east...stay safe! pic.twitter.com/hgT7jmcA20 — NWS Marquette (@NWSMarquette) January 4, 2018 The NWS in Boston calls this storm ""impressive, explosive"" and ""high-impact."" Thousands of flights have been canceled. Across the Northeast, schools are shuttered, salt has been spread, and local officials are pleading with residents to stay off the streets if they can. There is near-zero visibility in some of the snow bands passing over the states from New Jersey to Maine, the weather service says. As NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports, it's not just the ice and cold that authorities are worried about: ""Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy says drivers should be prepared for strong winds: 'I would ask folks who don't need to be on the highway, and this includes trucks particularly in a high-wind situation, that if you can delay that delivery or delay that travel that you do that.' ""Winds with gusts as high as 75 miles per hour are forecast for some areas. That brings the risk of power outages from downed power lines. Malloy says wind conditions may make it difficult for utility workers to quickly restore power."" Lori Mack, of member station WNPR in Connecticut, tells our newscast unit there are whiteout conditions in parts of the state. Member station WNYC reports that officials are urging New York City residents to remain indoors: ""The city's Department of Education is shuttering schools all day Thursday as the powerful nor'easter moves through the New York/New Jersey region.

Joshua Calixto,"On Tuesday, Blizzard quietly released Hearthstone patch 11.2, whose seemingly-tame purpose was to introduce a limited-time event and a new purchasable card bundle. But the patch came with a few other changes, including “updates” to game mechanics and a long list of “bug fixes” that stirred up some major gameplay issues. In doing so, the patch has injected some unwelcome chaos into the casual and professional communities both. One of the changes affected a legendary Rogue card called Tess Greymane. Tess is a card that randomly casts a copy of each “stolen” spell that the Rogue has cast from another class. The card was hardly seen in competitive play and rarely mentioned in discussions about power issues. But the patch made a tweak to Tess—it now has a limit of 30 spells cast, and if it dies to one of those spells, its effect stops. The change isn’t that big of a deal by itself, but the manner in which it was done is irking players. Usually when Blizzard nerfs a card it gives players the option of taking a full refund for it in dust, the currency that Hearthstone uses for crafting specific cards. However, since the Tess change is listed as a bug fix and not a nerf, Blizzard won’t give out dust for it. This is almost exactly the same change that Blizzard made to a card called Yogg-Saron, Hope’s End in 2016, but in that case the change was listed as a nerf and gave players a full dust refund. Tess Greymane wasn’t the only important card to get hit by these covert 11.2 nerfs. Both the Paladin Legendary card Lynessa Sunsorrow and the Druid Quest card Jungle Giants were affected by other “mechanics changes” that have changed the way they work in the game and makes them considerably weaker—but in these cases, too, Blizzard isn’t giving players the usual refund option, since it’s not classifying these changes as nerfs. On top of all these issues, the 11.2 patch has introduced a series of bugs that hurt the viability of multiple popular decks, including decks that run the Shaman legendary card Shudderwock and decks that run elemental-type minions. While some of these bugs have been hotfixed, there’s still no word on when or even if the rest of the bugs will be. These issues will affect more than the in-game experiences for casual players. According to emails shared by professional players earlier today, pros who are competing in this weekend’s Hearthstone Championship Tour Seoul event will need to play on patch 11.2—but with decks they made before the patch launched, which means that some players will be playing with weakened decks. One player, Fr0zen, uses a “Quest Druid” deck that revolves around the Jungle Giants card. The decision to make him use it as submitted pre-patch will mean that he’s coming into the weekend’s contest with a dud deck. In the hours since the changes were announced, the community has already spoken up to express dissatisfaction in waves of Reddit threads. Blizzard has issued a statement to address the Tess Greymane nerfs, saying they are “currently discussing this change further.” While Blizzard is sure to speak up on some of these issues, they raise some important questions about the nature of Hearthstone esports and the future of card changes in the game: What, for instance, differentiates a “bug fix” from a “nerf,” when the change reduces the power level of a card? What is the logic behind the decision to force players to use their pre-submitted deck lists at HCT Seoul? When will bugs introduced by patch 11.2 be fixed, and will they potentially impact the tournament this weekend? Blizzard said it had no further comment to offer when we reached out to it earlier today.","On Tuesday, Blizzard quietly released Hearthstone patch 11.2, whose seemingly-tame purpose was to introduce a limited-time event and a new purchasable card bundle.

Mike Fahey,"Next weeks World of Warcraft 8.1.5 update gives both the Alliance and Horde factions centralized portal hubs, which is good. At the same time, Blizzard is removing a bunch of existing portals, making it harder to get around the game. Its an odd change that has players asking Blizzard why, and theyre not satisfied with the answer.
Reported last week by the fine folks at Wowhead, centralized portal hubs are a common request from World of Warcraft players. Rather than catching boats and zeppelins, taking overly long gryphon trips, or hunting down existing portals scattered about the cities, a central location with portals connecting to most commonly traveled locations would be a boon to travel-weary adventurers. Thats what players had in mind. It turns out Blizzard had other ideas.
The new portal hubs are currently featured on the public test server and are going live next week. Located in the Stormwind mage tower and inside the gates of Orgrimmar, each hub features portals to seven locations:
The Burning Crusade expansions Shattrath
Wrath of the Lich Kings Dalaran
Mist of Pandarias Jade Forest
Legions Azuna
Faction-specific cities for Warlords of Draenor and Battle for Azeroth
Blood elf or draenei starting areas from The Burning Crusade
These hubs also feature a non-player character that will teleport players to the Blasted Lands, where the Dark Portal stands.
Thats not a bad selection, though there are some glaring omissions. Theres still no quick way to get from Orgrimmar to the Tauren hometown of Thunder Bluff. Alliance characters looking to get from Stormwind to Ironforge still have to take the tram. Portals to every major faction city can be found in the current expansions hub towns of Boralus and Dazaralor, but lower-level characters still have to hoof it. There doesnt seem to be an easy way to get to Karazhan and the Caverns of Time anymore. Worst of all, the Legion version of the floating city of Dalaran, still used by many as a teleportation hub, is being purged of portals, a move that will likely leave the city a shadow of its former self.
The news of the portal shuffling caused quite a stir amongst players unhappy with the changes. A massive thread in the official World of Warcraft forums titled Stop Removing Portals has garnered more than 5,000 replies, including one from community manager Bornakk attempting to put the change in a positive light.
I understand that changes can throw people off a bit at first, but I also think they help keep the world of Azeroth feeling alive. When there are fewer portals, does the world feel a bit bigger to you? Do you like that? How difficult is it to get to the locations you mentioned without a direct portal?
Bornakks comment alone drew nearly 500 direct replies, including this one from player Orctang:
Nope, just feels like travel is being time gated. If you want the world to feel bigger make bigger zones that are more alive.
And an excellent point made by forum contributor Synsha:
You opened numerous pandoras boxes of convenience throughout various portions of the game and have built a community that relies on that convenience. Taking it away now is akin to shooting your own foot.
Build on what youve built dont tear out the base and expect the rest of the building to just figure out how to stand up on its own. Itll fall. As will your community.
In response to the overwhelming negative player feedback, Blizzard community manager Kaivax posted an extensive explanation of the developers decision. In his post, Kaivax talks about attempting to balance conflicting design considerations. On one hand, the team doesnt want to make the game too portal reliant. Too many eliminations of the distances between places can diminish a sense of the world having a meaningful size, Kaivax said. At the same time, Kaivax explained they dont want to make travel to any location too inconvenient. He also points out that removing portals is something thats happened with the release of every expansion; it just never happened with Legion or Mists of Pandaria, and now the devs are playing catch-up.
With new expansions, weve made a tradition of removing some of the portals from the previous expansions cities. The goal with that is to encourage transportation flow through newer places where players are more likely to interact with other players. We neglected to do that initially following Legion (and we never did that following Mists of Pandaria for various reasons), but we feel that we should have. Were correcting that now.
Kaivax ends his post by saying that the new changes are the direct result of feedback from players, and that We believe that the numerous remaining means of quick access in the game make most locations quite reachable. The post already has more than 3,700 responses, many of them negative.
My favorite reactions to the portal controversy comes by way of the World of Warcraft Reddit page, where user winner_in_patching is compiling a list of predictions for the next unnecessary random change in WoW. Here are a few.
After tirelessly listening to feedback on how the Open World is not dangerous, we have removed out of combat health regeneration. Fear not. Spending 8 hours at an inn will get you back on the sunny fields in Azeroth. (by CardinalM1)
Armor Rating now converted to Movement Speed Rating. Your movement speed is affected by how many armor pieces you wear. Your movement speed can be reduced to a maximum of 1% and a minimum of 70%. Cloth Armor users will have a combined Durability of 2 for all their pieces. Naked Players will gain a boost to their movement speed and also be entered in the monthly Transmog competition.

Flying mounts now get an exhaustion bar, rarity and levels. This is to ensure people enjoy the landscape instead of flying. (by Kremdes)

Colin Campbell,"Ben Brode, a key leader in the success of Blizzard’s Hearthstone, today announced he’s leaving the company to set up a new venture. Brode was on the original launch team for collectible card strategy game Hearthstone a decade ago. He leaves the company as game director for Hearthstone, which boasts more than 70 million players and has established itself on the professional esports circuit. We’ll probably make games, but we haven’t figured anything else out In a post on the Battle.net forums, Brode wrote of his pride in the Hearthstone team and the game’s accomplishments. “People tell me that Hearthstone brought their family closer together, or that they became close friends with people they met,” Brode said. “Others tell me they were inspired by Hearthstone to become game developers themselves. It’s incredible to be a part of something that touches so many people.” When the game launched in 2014, Polygon’s review gave it a rare perfect score. Back in 2003, Brode worked as a pizza delivery man, regularly bringing food to the Blizzard offices, where late night working sessions were the norm. He snagged a job as a game tester on Warcraft 3, working his way up into game design. He was on the launch design team for Hearthstone ’s cards, which are based in the Warcraft universe. He eventually became lead designer for the game. At this point, there are no details on his next venture. “I’m going to help start a new company,” he wrote. “We’ll probably make games, but we haven’t figured anything else out, yet. I’m looking forward to designing, programming, and actually creating things again.”","After 10 years working on the hit card game, Ben Brode has new plans",2018-04-20T18:15:01Z,"{'id': 'polygon', 'name': 'Polygon'}",Hearthstone game director quits Blizzard,https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/20/17263008/hearthstone-game-director-ben-brode-leaves-blizzard,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42TeYUOE3cH4kE6AjDJP0klmIzE=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10689399/Ben_Brode_Headshot.jpg,polygon,Polygon,blizzard,1

Nathan Grayson,"It’s official : Diablo III is coming to Switch. Later this year, you’ll be able to cosplay as Ganondorf from Legend of Zelda and kick the crap out of Diablo from Diablo. It’s the first Blizzard game on a Nintendo platform in 15 years, but fortunately, Blizzard had help. During a meeting in San Francisco earlier this week, senior producer Pete Stilwell said that porting Diablo III was a relatively smooth process, with “conversion on the graphics side” of things presenting the biggest challenge. Nintendo offered assistance with trouble-shooting, though. Stilwell said the experience paved the way for potential future Blizzard ports to the Switch. “Yeah,” he replied when asked if other Blizzard games could end up on Switch. “Without going beyond [the Diablo port], I think it was a good exploration into the platform and into the relationship with Nintendo that has been extremely positive, extremely healthy and forward-thinking.” In a lot of ways, Diablo III was ideally positioned for a Switch port. Blizzard had to re-tune and re-imagine the game—originally PC-only—for consoles a few years ago, so the roadmap was already there. Plus, it wasn’t just Nintendo helping Blizzard with the Switch version: Stilwell said that a team of “eight or nine” Blizzard staffers collaborated with Iron Galaxy, the studio that helped bring Skyrim to Switch last year. The whole process of bringing Diablo III to Switch took them about nine months. If you think this means Overwatch on Switch is just around the corner, though, think again. Stilwell said that there was “nothing to say about that today” when asked about Overwatch, and he added that each potential port of a Blizzard game will be its own process. “Blizzard is really comprised of many unique game teams, so the game engines are equally unique,” he said. “I wish I could say it’s simple, like ‘flip a switch.’ But it’s not.” He did, however, tell GameSpot that Overwatch on Switch is “feasible,” so that’s something. As for Diablo on other mobile devices, that, too, is its own can of worms. “I don’t think there’s current interest,” he said when asked if Diablo III could end up on smartphones next. “I think that has another set of problems and challenges with it.” He was similarly skeptical of the idea of Blizzard doing a game developed with Switch in mind first and foremost. For now, the focus is on Diablo III ’s Switch version and letting people who might’ve only been privy to the game’s rocky, auction-house-embattled launch back in 2012 know that, hey, the water’s fine now. “Hopefully, with the renewed attention around [the game], people will find out that it’s not just that version of the game you knew right after launch,” he said. “There’s meaningful change with Loot 2.0 and the Kanai’s Cube and all the other cool things that aren’t necessarily on the box.” “Where the game was at launch compared to where it is now, it’s light years forward.”","It’s official : Diablo III is coming to Switch.

Mike Minotti,"Blizzard has released a new cinematic for World of Warcraft ahead of the August 14 launch of its seventh expansion, Battle for Azeroth. It comes at a time when fans are up at arms over recent story developments, but this new movie shows that Blizzard can still craft good stories that make players happy. I was one of the voices criticizing World of Warcraft’s story last week. A new quest line and cinematic showed the Horde acting as the aggressors in a new war against the Alliance. This event reached its climax with the Horde leader Sylvanas burning down the world tree, home of the Night Elves. It’s a heinous act that kills a lot of innocents. For many Horde players, it was upsetting to see their faction painted as so evil. This new cinematic, which you can watch above, focuses on an Orc veteran, Saurfang. It makes it clear that he is not happy about the burning of the world tree. It also shows him reflecting on the death of his own son (something that happened in the game back in the second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King). Above: Sylvanas looks evil and … well, she is. First off, the quality of the cinematic is outstanding. Unlike the recent Warbringers shorts, which mostly get by with still images, this a full GC animated production. We usually only get these kinds of cinematics when Blizzard is announcing a new expansion. It’s great to get one just as a way to further the game’s story. And this movie’s story is captivating. It gives Horde players something they’ve wanted since last week with a major Horde character questioning Sylvanas’s actions. But beyond that, it helps develop Saurfang’s character, a person who will be a major player in Battle for Azeroth. We also get a new character via a plucky, young Troll Shaman that revers and challenges Saurfang. It’s great to see a more hopeful and just downright pleasant character in the Horde. And he’s already won the hearts of the community. Last week, Reddit’s World of Warcraft front page filled with posts complaining about the world tree story. Today, it’s all memes celebrating this new character, which the community has dubbed “Zappy Boi.” Above: The Zappy Boi memes are flowing. Image Credit: ExclusiveAgate Does this cinematic quell all my worries about World of Warcraft’s story? Not really. Many players assumed that Saurfang would take up the mantle of opposition against Sylvanas. It’s nice to see that her evil deeds will be challenged, but this is still a bit predictable. It also mirrors a story that World of Warcraft already told when Garrosh, a former leader of the Horde, went too far and had to be taken down by a rebellion. But while I’m worried that the overall narrative could retread old ground in a predictable manner, it’ll be easier to swallow if the execution is as thoughtful and compelling as it is in this cinematic. Oh, and Blizzard? Give us more Zappy Boi, please.","OPINION: Blizzard has released a new cinematic for World of Warcraft ahead of the August 14 launch of its seventh expansion, Battle for Azeroth.

The Globe and Mail,"Just when the Prime Minister was escaping the political controversy swirling in the nations capital at least for a few hours Mother Nature let him know she had other plans.
After holding a news conference in Ottawa early Thursday to answer questions about the latest testimony about the SNC-Lavalin affair, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew off, bound for Iqaluit.
He was to apologize for how past governments mistreated Inuit who went south for tuberculosis care in the middle of the last century, some of whom died and were buried rather than being returned to their families.
Story continues below advertisement
But, an early morning windstorm in Iqaluit quickly turned into a blizzard that by the lunch hour forced his plane to divert to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, N.L.
While Prime Ministers Office staff in the capital of Nunavut voiced hope initially that Mr. Trudeau could arrive later in the evening, the whiteout conditions and wind chill temperatures of -45 C winds gusted to nearly 80 kilometres an hour soon made it evident the event would be postponed until Friday morning at the earliest. Friday, the weather forecast calls for light snow rather than a blizzard.
The apology has been in the works for the better part of two years since Mr. Trudeau signed an Inuit-Crown partnership agreement in 2017.
Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the organization that speaks for Inuit in Nunavut, has said it wants to help family members locate burial sites of those who died during tuberculosis treatment from the 1940s through the 1960s and whose bodies were buried in southern Canada.
A dinner feast that was planned for the event Thursday, which was to include samplings of narwhal and caribou, was also postponed as Iqaluit was virtually shut down.
Services such as water delivery, waste management, garbage pickup and snow removal are being suspended, and city facilities are being closed to the public, until further notice, due to severe weather conditions, the city said in a statement posted on social media. Taxis and local residents were also advised to stay off city roads.
Tuberculosis rates among Inuit are still 290 times higher than among Canadian-born non-Indigenous people, according to a 2018 paper from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Wonbo Woo,"With August 14 approaching fast, fans of World of Warcraft are eagerly awaiting the release of Battle for Azeroth, the seventh expansion in the mega-hit MMORPG. WoW was first released in 2004, and in the fourteen years since, expansions and patches have introduced iconic features like flight ( Burning Crusade ), the dungeon finder ( Wrath of the Lich King ), transmogrification ( Cataclysm ), garrisons ( Warlords of Draenor ), and artifact weapons ( Legion ). Battle of Azeroth will introduce two new continents, as well as gameplay features like island expeditions, in which players can compete against artificial intelligence bots in fulfilling objectives. World of Warcraft: Battle of Azeroth Cinematic Trailer “Each new expansion we add to the game, we're looking to expand the core of the game the players have come to know and love over all these years, but also add brand new ways of playing the game, new features, new types of gameplay, new challenges to undertake, and a fresh look at a game that seeks to reinvent itself every couple of years,” says Ion Hazzikostas, the game director on World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment. But that’s not always easy to do. Take flying, which the team introduced in the game's first expansion, The Burning Crusade. “That was huge, it really changed the way we built zones and different landscapes and design visually the landscapes too,” says Jimmy Lo, the game’s visual development supervisor, in the video above. We now had to actually think about transition zones and how one landscape transition into the next one.” Changing those landscapes presented all sorts of challenges, as the team learned when developing 2010's Cataclysm. “ Cataclysm set out with a massive undertaking of actually breaking the world,” Hazzikostas explains. “So it told the story of this great dragon, Deathwing, who burst forth from within the Earth and unleashed chaos and catastrophe across Azeroth. Areas were flooded, areas were broken apart, massive crevices appeared, but what this did, what this provided was a vehicle to remake the original world that had been crafted in 2004.” Changes needed to be implemented while people are still players are still actively playing the game, which is where engineers come in. “How do we sunder the world out from under the players, make it believable and not mess everything up in the process?,” asks Patrick Magruder, WoW ’s lead gameplay engineer. “Because when they logged out, they were above the ground, and when they log in, this exact same position is now inside of a mountain or inside of a fire pit, or they're high up in space because there's now a crater where they were.” “That was, even to this day, I would say probably the single largest task the World of Warcraft team has ever undertaken,” says Hazzikostas.

Jason Schreier,"Alongside the announcement of a Warcraft III tournament, Blizzard last night said it will add some significant features to the 16-year-old game, raising the inevitable question: Is a remaster coming? The list of changes, which will be added to Warcraft III ’s Public Test Realm (did you know Warcraft III had a Public Test Realm?) includes balance tweaks and map pool changes. It also doubles the number of people who can participate in custom games, from 12 to 24, which is huge. Blizzard is also adding widescreen support to the fantasy real-time strategy game. Most unusually, Blizzard has added a ton of changes and improvements to Warcraft III ’s in-game editor, which allows players to create custom maps and games. (This editor, you may remember, was the tool used to create the map “Defense of the Ancients,” which would go on to spawn Dota 2, League of Legends, and many many more games.) Is this simply Blizzard trying to inject some life into an old game, or is it a sign that there’s a Warcraft III remaster in the works? Blizzard has hinted for a while that it wants to update and re-release some of the classic gems in its back catalog, as it did with StarCraft last year, so expecting an HD version of Thrall and crew might not be too much of a stretch.","Alongside the announcement of a Warcraft III tournament, Blizzard last night said it will add some significant features to the 16-year-old game, raising the inevitable question: Is a remaster coming?

Jessica Conditt,"There's no dedicated gaming space on the UC Berkeley campus, though Overwatch team coach and fourth-year cognitive-science major Kyle Feng says it's only a matter of time. The school is taking a real interest in esports, thanks in part to Feng's team. They picked up their second win in a row at the Overwatch Collegiate Finals, defeating UC Irvine 3-0, taking home $6,000 in scholarship money per player. ""Expanding at a collegiate level is extremely smart right now because it's such a big industry,"" Feng said. He wants all universities to have varsity esports programs and gaming rooms if only to even the playing field at tournaments like the Collegiate Finals. In the college scene, teams with dedicated coaches and practice areas regularly compete against groups of friends who simply play together on the weekends, sometimes from their dorm rooms. That was the case this weekend when UC Berkeley and UC Irvine -- a school with one of the most robust esports programs in the country -- competed against UC San Diego and the University of Toronto, neither of which offer support to esports teams on campus. No surprise, then, that Berkeley and Irvine had the upper hand in last weekend's finals. ""UCSD hasn't really embraced the idea of esports,"" San Diego offense player Ernie ""Jinora"" Lum said. ""So having the opportunity to come out to this event is definitely a milestone for all of us."" Despite the lack of support, UCSD did take a positive step before the finals, according to Lum: It published an article about the team heading to the Fiesta Bowl championships. ""We just pulled a bunch of people off of Facebook,"" Lum said. ""We came together instead of having someone pull us together. And we made it all the way here. It's kind of amazing."" ""We just pulled a bunch of people off of Facebook."" Blizzard helped pay for UCSD's trip to Tempe, but otherwise, players were on their own. It was a similar story with the University of Toronto, which doesn't offer support or organization for esports players, even though its League of Legends team is renowned in the college scene. ""It's really hard to get recognition from the administration,"" said Toronto support player Marco ""Funanah"" Chu. ""Being able to come here and see how other teams -- especially UCI, they have a lot of esports backing -- I wish Toronto could be like that."" The stories out of UC Irvine are vastly different. Instead of fighting for dedicated gaming rooms and financial backing, Irvine players receive support that will look familiar to any student-athlete, including scholarships and a brand-new esports arena (the first of its kind in the country). It's still on a small scale compared with the investments made in college football, and the school doesn't actually fund the program -- entrance fees to the arena and sponsors like Logitech, iBuyPower and Vertagear provide that money. UC Irvine supports two esports games, League of Legends and Overwatch, offering about $5,600 in scholarship money for League players and $2,500 for Overwatch fiends. One of the most powerful aspects of UC Irvine's esports program is that the administration actively seeks out talented players. Tank player Nick ""LearnTooPlay"" Theodorakis was in community college last year, and he performed well in a regional Overwatch tournament hosted by Blizzard's collegiate esports arm, Tespa. Afterward, Acting Director of UC Irvine Esports Mike Deppe sent Theodorakis an email inviting him to attend the university -- and play Overwatch. ""I'd always wanted to go to UCI, so it just worked out really well,"" Theodorakis said. ""Now I'm there, I'm doing business econ and just having an amazing time."" While many universities play catch-up, outside organizations are stepping in to help college players build esports programs at their schools. For instance, Find Your Grind and ReKTGlobal this week announced a $450,000 annual scholarship fund for students interested in esports. Tespa, Blizzard's collegiate-esports initiative that helps organize student esports groups and tournaments -- including the Fiesta Bowl championships -- has 220 chapters in schools across North America. ""If you were to compare that to a fraternity or a sorority, it would be top 10 in the world in terms of size, and that's all for gaming,"" Tespa founder Adam Rosen said. Rosen and Tespa helped Fiesta Bowl administrators -- including esports newcomer Mike Nealy -- plan last weekend's grand finals. The Fiesta Bowl folks brought the event-organization chops, while Tespa served as the esports and Overwatch guru. The championship demonstrated the potential benefits of friendly alliances between traditional sports and esports. ""This event, specifically, is super-exciting to us,"" Rosen said. ""It actually came together pretty quickly, but it's something that we all believe, as we look back five years, will be a turning point for esports and what we're doing."" Universities are attempting to organize and embrace a new generation of student-athletes, even as questions about the nature of esports remain unanswered. It has ""sports"" in the name, but the jury is still out on whether competitive gaming is an actual athletic activity. ""It's something that we all believe... will be a turning point for esports."" This question isn't just pedantic -- it makes all the difference to groups like the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which regulates university sports across the country. In December the NCAA announced it was investigating the collegiate esports scene. Marketing firm Intersport was tasked with putting together a report for the NCAA, led by executive director of esports Kurt Melcher, who happened to also be the founder of Robert Morris University's inaugural gaming initiative. ""The current NCAA structure, as we know, in some ways fits and in some ways does not fit collegiate esports as it stands right now,"" Melcher told ESPN in December. He estimated there were 500 collegiate programs in the wild, NACE-sanctioned or otherwise. But without a clear structure behind them, the industry was fractured. Students and faculty were constantly cobbling together programs wherever they fit. ""We are seeing that 30 percent of formalized programs are in student services, 30 percent are in athletics, 20 percent are in an academic house setting where there is game design or computer design,"" Melcher said. ""I think that is part of the process, seeing if this is a space that [the NCAA] should become involved in, and how, if possible."" The NCAA hasn't decided what role it should play in esports yet, but the conversation is happening. The association will need to figure it out soon if it wants to get in on the ground floor of esports: Professional gaming is becoming mainstream in a real way. More than 10 million people tuned into the debut week of the Overwatch League in January, and Blizzard confirmed it's raising the franchise fee for season two. Twelve teams across the globe paid $20 million each to buy into the OWL in season one, but ESPN sources expect that figure to hit as high as $60 million for season two.","As executive director of the Fiesta Bowl, one of the largest college football tournaments of the season, Mike Nealy was more familiar with shoulder pads than mousepads.

Jason Schreier,"Blizzard has spent the year taking big measures to cut costs as it prepares for a lean 2019. Those measures, as conveyed by people who work or have worked for the iconic studio, include employee buyouts in which workers are offered money to leave, a broadening of the finance department, and the limitation of budgets for any team at the company that isnt directly making video games.
Much of Blizzards cost-cutting has gone unreported until recently, but its been a consistent theme throughout 2018 at the Irvine, California-based studio behind mega-hits like Overwatch and World of Warcraft. One Blizzard program, for example, is called Career Crossroads. It offers healthy severance packages to people who voluntarily take buyouts and choose to leave the company. At first, Career Crossroads was designed for veteran customer service representatives who had been at Blizzard for more than five years, but this year, it opened up to QA and IT, according to one person familiar with the program. Blizzard has also lowered the number of years required to take a buyout, opening up Career Crossroads to even more employees, likely in hopes of increasing those numbers.
Over the course of the last year, Blizzard has been trying very actively to find creative ways to cut costs that wont draw negative press attention, said a former employee.
When asked for comment, Blizzard declined to address other items in this report but did send over a statement about Career Crossroads:
We have had a completely voluntary and long-standing program in various locations around the world that gives eligible staff the option to make the most of incentives while proactively pursuing other career opportunities. No one is required or encouraged to participate in the program, but for those who do, we work hard to make it generous. Weve been offering it for many yearsinitially to some of our customer service teams, and we expanded it for a short period of time to a few other departments recently, given that it has proven to be a good way to help people who have been thinking about a career change or going back to school to get a head start on that path if thats what they want to do. While fewer than 10 people in the departments we recently expanded the program to have taken advantage of it, the general idea is that in addition to providing them with that opportunity, it also helps us give more advancement opportunities to other employees on the team when possible.
At the same time, Blizzard is actively hiring for its game development teams, as it continues to work on new games in franchises like Diablo and Overwatch. Theres no way to know what the results of this cost-cutting might look like in the coming years, but its clear that the direction from the top is to release more games, which could ultimately benefit fans of Blizzard. The big question, as expressed by those who work and have worked at the company, is what kind of impact these cultural shifts will have on one of the most legendary studios in gaming, one that is regularly ranked among the best video game companies to work. And what kind of impact will it have on Blizzards games?
Last month, a Kotaku investigation revealed that Blizzards staff have been told to reduce expenses while at the same time produce more games. There are likely several reasons for this shift in priorities, including a lack of consistent output, a weak year for Activision-Blizzard overall, and Activisions increasing influence on Blizzard, which has traditionally been an autonomous company but has been overseen by Activisions CEO, Bobby Kotick, since the two companies merged in 2008. That influence has grown this year in many ways both blatant and subtle.
For Novembers report, we talked to 11 current and former Blizzard employees. Since then, weve heard from even more current and former Blizzard staff about the companys cost-cutting measures and how theyve materialized. The Career Crossroads program is one example. Another, according to three Blizzard staff who all left recently, is a power shift that has seen the finance department cultivate influence that it had never had in the past.
Finance in general in Blizzard has been one of these invisible functions thats there, but doesnt have a say, said one veteran employee who left recently and asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to press. Now theyre suddenly in meetings.
Said a second, who also asked not to be named: A lot of decisions now are being driven by business folks, marketing and finance folks. Theres a real struggle now between developers and the business people Strategic decisions are being driven by the finance group.
These decisions could range from major (Which technology should we use for this new incubation project?) to minor (How much do we spend on BlizzCon goodie boxes this year?). Its a major cultural shift, one driven by top executives at the company including Armin Zerza, who was chief financial officer (CFO) at the studio before he became chief operating officer (COO) in late 2017. Under Zerza, Blizzard has brought in a number of business-minded employees both from Activision and the consulting company McKinsey, many of whom might have different priorities than longtime Blizzard staff or those with development backgrounds.
Earlier this year, new Blizzard CFO Amrita Ahuja, who also came over from Activision, told employees during an all-hands meeting that it was time to start reining in their spending. That was a common theme at many of Blizzards departments this year, according to those who were there. That speech from Amrita about cutting costs, that wasnt a one time thing, said one person who worked on a non-development team. We were told to cut costs on a monthly basis.
So far, the cost-cutting has mostly taken place in non-gaming departments, with one big exception. Last week, Blizzard announced plans to reduce the staff of Heroes of the Storm and eliminate its esports program. It was a surprising move to those who made their careers off Heroes, but among Blizzard games, this was the weakest linkHeroes of the Storm had always struggled to find as much financial success as Blizzards other big hits.
There have been other big moves as well. Today, the British website Eurogamer reported that over 100 people have accepted buyouts at Blizzards customer service office in Cork, Ireland. Weve also heard that Blizzards publishing department has put an extra step into the hiring process, with prospective employees having to get approved by Zerza before they can be officially on-boarded.
And among Blizzard staff and close observers, rumors have circulated about potential layoffs in the new year. The game development teams are seen as safethe mandate is to make more games, after allbut those at other departments are worried about what might be coming when 2019 arrives.
To look at Activision and Blizzard is to see two companies that, for over a decade, have followed connected but very different models. Under Bobby Kotick, Activision has found success through annual releases of games like Call of Duty and, until recently, Skylanders. Meanwhile, under co-founder and longtime CEO Mike Morhaime, Blizzard has marched at its own pace, sticking with old games for the long haul and releasing new ones whenever the company felt like they were ready. Blizzard has gone years without releasing a brand new game, while Activision hasnt let a fall go by without a new Call of Duty since 2004.
Now, Morhaime is gone, and Activision appears to have more influence on Blizzard than it ever has. Will Blizzards games-as-a-service, release-it-when-its-ready approach to development survive these new changes? It might take years before we know the answers, but some Blizzard employeesand many fansare concerned about what they might be. The influences of a major corporation can be subtle and sometimes impossible to discern.
Blizzard is a special place, said one former employee. A lot of people are worried about the future of Blizzardif the Activision method seeps in more, what thats going to become.

Nathan Grayson,"Not so long ago, Overwatch was a poster child for toxicity run rampant in competitive multiplayer games. People regularly trolled and spewed vitriol while a barebones report system did little to stem the tide. Oh, what a difference a couple years (and a smartly implemented endorsement system) makes.
Overwatch, like pretty much all competitive games, still has its fair share of toxicityor as Blizzard calls it, disruptive behaviorbut during a talk at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Blizzard research developer Natasha Miller said its down a whopping 40 percent since last years addition of two new social features. First, theres the endorsement system, which lets players reward each other for communicating effectively, playing respectfully, and calling shots. Then theres Looking For Group, which lets players hunt for others of certain endorsement ranks, hero roles, or communication styles.
While the benefits of Looking For Group are pretty self-explanatory, theres a bit more going on under the hood of endorsements. Miller explained that they address a central (and often misidentified) problem with online games and the internet at large: a lack of consistent social norms.
Its a difference between physical and online communities, Miller said (via Variety). If youre constantly tardy and you only do the bare minimum at work, youre not going to get promoted. You have to watch someone else who does the work get the raise... In online communities, there are usually no consequences for bad behavior and no rewards for star players. We wanted the community to have their own reward system.
One of the core goals of the system, Miller noted, was to give players a chance to bounce back even after being penalized. If youre a jerk or a bad teammate, people will stop endorsing you, and your endorsement level will fall. That means you might miss out on rewards like loot boxes, and you wont be able to group up with some players in Looking For Group. Its natural for players to want to earn levels backand thus, hopefully, to behave better in order to accomplish that.
The system makes people nicer, Miller said. Since endorsements launched, there have been questions about whether its real niceness or fake niceness born of a desire to win and watch numbers go up. But either option is better than everyone being nakedly toxic swamp people, if you ask me.","Not so long ago, Overwatch was a poster child for toxicity run rampant in competitive multiplayer games.

Mike Minotti,"Blizzard and GOG announced today that the original Diablo is now for sale at GOG’s digital store. This makes the PC classic available via digital distribution for the first time.
Diablo costs $10 on GOG, and this version features Windows 10 compatibility and bug fixes. GOG is a digital store that specializes in classic PC games, but this is the first time that they’ve landed one of Blizzard’s titles. Blizzard has its own PC game launcher and store, Battle.net. But that hosts newer games (and remasters of older ones, like with StarCraft and the upcoming Warcraft III: Reforged).
GOG is giving Blizzard’s older, un-remastered PC games a digital home. Along with Diablo, Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness are coming to GOG at a later date.
“We were bummed that these iconic games werent available to our players, so we’re very happy to work with the crew at GOG.com to rectify that, said Rob Bridenbecker, vice president and executive producer at Blizzard Entertainment, in a press release sent to GamesBeat. This has been a long time coming and we hope our players will be excited to jump back into these classic titles.”
Diablo first came out for PC in 1996. It’s a landmark game, popularizing a style or action role-playing games that focuses on randomly-generated dungeons and collecting lots of loot with an over-the-head camera. It sold over 2.5 million copies.
It also started a big franchise for Blizzard. Diablo II followed in 2000, and Diablo III came out in 2012. The series has sold a combined 24.8 million copies.
Diablo’s future includes Blizzard’s first mobile game, Diablo: Immortal. It’s announcement last year caused anger with some Blizzard fans, some of which were hoping for a remaster of Diablo II or an announcement for Diablo IV.

"SkyWarn 13 Meteorologists: Monica Ott, Drew Williams and Darren Maier","A major winter storm will arrive in Western Wisconsin by Monday morning, with a combination of rain, ice and snow likely but a quick change to all snow in the Chippewa Valley and surrounding areas will lead to several inches of accumulation throughout the day, causing a severe disruption to everyday travel. Though Monday will look far different, there is still plenty of time to get out and run those errands before the snow starts to fly. The weather will just remain cloudy and mild today, with temperatures again well into the 30's. Conditions won't change much for tonight, though there may be some drizzle that starts to develop. In places that see temperatures drop down near freezing, this could lead to some light icing, while further north it may just be some very light snow. Conditions will then rapidly deteriorate on Monday. For those heading out early in the morning, precipitation in the form of rain, sleet and snow will begin to fill in and expand across the area from the south. This is when temperatures will be near 32 but a change to just heavy, wet snow is then expected by mid-morning. Plan on it being a slower morning commute than normal, but the worst conditions will hold off until later, with the height of this winter storm pushing through during the late morning, through the early evening hours. This means the evening commute will likely be far worse with several inches of snow already on the ground, combined with blowing which will lead to very low visibility at times. Winds will be increasing to 15-25 mph for the afternoon with some higher gusts, bringing near blizzard conditions at times. Bottom line is travel will be very difficult for several hours that will include the entire afternoon. Snow accumulations will be significant, with a swath of 6-10"" currently forecast through the Chippewa Valley, stretching southwest down towards the Rochester, MN area. Either side of this heaviest band of accumulation, amounts will drop off rather quickly and places further south around the La Crosse area will see mostly a rain/snow mix, with perhaps just an inch or two of accumulation. The storm will be winding down Monday night, but travel impacts will likely continue to be felt right into early Tuesday morning.

Although Google didn't dive into specifics, it had offered to ""loosen restrictions"" in Android contracts and had considered distributing its apps in ""two different ways."" The EU wasn't having it, according to the sources. Officials reportedly said only that a settlement was ""no longer an option,"" and that Google's offer was ""too little too late."" It couldn't even mention the possibility of paying a fine as part of an agreement -- regulators had effectively locked in their course of action.

Kellen Beck,"For a sizeable chunk of my life, I played World of Warcraft too much. Way too much. I played WoW so much and so often that some people may classify my worst years with that game as an addiction. SEE ALSO: 'World of Warcraft' is getting a new expansion that's all about Horde vs. Alliance Every moment of free time I had, from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed, I spent sitting at my desk playing World of Warcraft. I would ignore responsibilities, flake out on friends, and sometimes even skip meals just because I didn't want to step away from the screen. This was my life, on and off, for about four years. The game sucked me in entirely, allowing me to ignore real life and experience a different world where I got to carve my own path, explore, meet new people, and grind through endless feedback loops that made me feel like I was being productive while my own life was slowly eroding. Image: blizzard entertainment With the release of the newest World of Warcraft expansion Battle for Azeroth Aug. 14, just like with every new expansion over the years, I once again have that urge to hop back in and try to replicate whatever it is that I felt I enjoyed so much, plugging myself back into the thing that I sunk not just hundreds of hours into, but hundreds of days. And I have hopped back in. The game World of Warcraft, known colloquially as WoW, is what’s known as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG for short). It’s a fantasy game where players get to create their own characters, explore the world of Azeroth, level up, and collect new stuff to their hearts’ content. There are all your classic fantasy things like orcs, elves, mages, dragons, and druids, all of it entwined in a deep well of lore set on a world packed full of characters, stories, and a colorful array of enemies. Image: blizzard entertainment World of Warcraft unveils itself slowly, deliberately, and naturally But you may not know that right from the start. Starting off in the world, there’s so much mystery. No matter what kind of character you create or which faction you pick — either Horde or Alliance — you begin in a secluded space. All you know is the tiny immediate area around you. At first. World of Warcraft unveils itself slowly, deliberately, and naturally. With every new quest, you get pushed into new territory and learn more and more about the world, gaining experience, leveling up, earning new abilities, and getting new gear. The more time you put into World of Warcraft, the more you get out of it. Whether your thing is watching your experience bar move up and up with each new level, chatting and messing around with other players, teaming up and delving into difficult dungeons, or kicking other players’ asses, the game has a little something for everybody. The more you learn and further you get, the more you realize there is to experience. At various times, different aspects of the game fulfilled whatever itch I was looking to scratch. That's part of what makes the beast that is World of Warcraft so addicting to so many people — if you get tired of doing one activity, you can try doing another. A building addiction I started playing World of Warcraft in late 2005, about a year after it first released, and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, probably a similar experience to most other players who jumped in without a veteran to show them the ropes. Despite me being horrible at leveling and managing my in-game money, I still liked the game a lot and played it pretty often. But it wasn't until 2007 that I really locked in with WoW. The release of the first major expansion, The Burning Crusade, brought with it a brand new world to level up in and a huge new threat to contend with, along with a bunch of cool cosmetic items and mounts and new characters to play as. I had spent enough time in the game that I finally ""got"" it and decided to make a fresh start with a new character to take on the new content. This is when I first became addicted to World of Warcraft. I was 14. Image: blizzard entertainment I don't know exactly when it started, but I began spending all my free time at my desk in my bedroom playing WoW. Over a few months I got my character, an undead mage, up to level 70, the maximum level, and settled into the ""end-game"" — the content you unlock once you hit the top level. At this point, I was pretty lucky that I was in school, because I was forced to step away from the computer almost every day. I was still hanging out with friends but I began skipping out on homework assignments and things like that because, in my mind, it was much more important to grind dungeons for minimal stat improvements and repeat the same quests every single day to earn in-game money and work my way toward getting a cool dragon mount. I even fell asleep at my keyboard on multiple occasions. Eventually I got good enough that I could start raiding with a guild. In World of Warcraft, raids are varieties of extra challenging dungeons that require anywhere from 10 to 25 people working together to complete. With a group that knows what it's doing, some shorter raids can be done in under an hour. If your group is newer to the raid and it's a lengthier one, you could be putting 4 hours a night into them multiple nights a week and still not complete them. For some weeks, this meant I was putting in my normal couple hours of game time after school, breaking for dinner (not always though, sometimes I ate dinner at my computer), and then hopping back on and raiding until midnight or later. I even fell asleep at my keyboard on multiple occasions. My parents, being rational, tried to make sure I was getting to bed at a reasonable hour, and sometimes I'd pretend to be asleep and then pop back up after they checked in on me. This all sounds kind of like normal teenage stuff, but I kept putting aside other things to play more and more. It got bad. Dark days Between late 2008 and into 2011, World of Warcraft was seriously impacting my life. On multiple occasions I played the game all night, by myself, just because I didn't want to stop. I stopped doing homework pretty much altogether. On weekends and during the summer, it wasn't uncommon for me to log in right when I woke up, play for a few hours, maybe eat some dry cereal I kept in my room, and play all day. I skipped lunches. I ate frozen pizza because it was quick and easy. I drank too much Coke and would pile the cans up around my desk. I would play upwards of 14 hours a day and at night my eyes would be so dry it would hurt to blink. Sometimes when friends asked if I could hang out, I'd say no just because I wanted to play more and had already set aside that time in my head as WoW time. I would fake sick to stay home from school so I could play more. Image: blizzard entertainment I was completely obsessed. If for some reason I wasn't playing, I was watching YouTube videos about WoW. I was reading the novels. I was checking out the wikis. My life was World of Warcraft focused, 24/7. Naturally, I burnt myself out. I found that when I was logging on to play, I was just sitting there, bored, not doing anything because I didn't find any part of it fun. Yet I kept logging in and doing menial tasks because what else was I supposed to do? I was completely obsessed I got into a cycle. I would binge on World of Warcraft for months at a time and then quit. But when I quit, I didn't bounce back and become a productive student or healthy person, I just replaced it with something else. Sometimes it was binging television shows, YouTube videos, or sitting alone and watching movies all night. In my sophomore year of high school, I failed my first class. I dropped out of Advanced Placement classes because I simply didn't do the work and didn't intend on doing it. I was underweight from skipping meals and eating terrible food. At random points, I would hop back into World of Warcraft and feel a renewed sense of satisfaction from the game, kind of like slipping into a comfortable outfit and just being able to relish in it. And then I would burn myself out again. The only thing that made this self-destructive cycle stop was the threat of college. I was so focused on ignoring my life and just floating by comfortably that I didn't even attempt to apply to any colleges. Toward the tail end of my senior year of high school, I realized that people were moving on and at least attempting to do something with their lives. I was a reluctant pizza delivery driver with no ambition. I realized other people had goals, so I figured I should get one of those too. Stepping away While pretty much everyone I knew went away to college, I stayed home and went to a community college, which happened to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was driven to catch up and finally do something with my life, so I dug down and got good grades across the board for the first time in years. After a year, I had good enough grades to apply to a four-year school. I also happened to pretty much stop playing World of Warcraft during that time. I would play for a month at a time maybe but I never got sucked in like I did before. I realized that the time I spent playing that game wasn't the game's fault, it was merely the tool I used to ignore my life, erase stress, and dull any anxieties I had. Image: blizzard entertainment Some people turn to other things to manage these common life problems, these problems that can snowball into something so overwhelming that the only thing you can do is try to ignore them, because surmounting them seems so impossible. I don't need to play World of Warcraft all the time Some people find solace in drugs. Some people ignore life with alcohol. Some people rack up debt buying themselves new things or gambling. Some people sink into video games like World of Warcraft. At this point in my life, I've stepped away from the situation long enough that I can see what it was: a means of escape. I have ADHD. I experience anxiety that's sometimes comes on so strong that it's physically debilitating. I have gone through bad spells of depression. I was experiencing all of those things back then too but I didn't have the tools or knowledge that I have now to fight those things head-on. In the past five years, I've tried to play World of Warcraft multiple times, but it never sucked me in like it did before. Perhaps because I didn't need it to. Jumping back in A few weeks ago, in anticipation of the release of World of Warcraft 's seventh expansion Battle for Azeroth, I jumped back in. I expected to play it briefly and then drop it, but I've played pretty consistently over the weeks and don't have any intention of stopping. Hold up. I know what you're thinking. Why am I doing this to myself? The difference between how I'm playing right now and how I was playing back then is monumental. Right now, I'm playing WoW because I'm having fun and I like to hang out with my friends online. Image: blizzard entertainment I'm not spending all my free time plugging hours into this game. Just the other day I could've easily sunk eight hours into the game but instead I went to the gym, did laundry, hung out with my cat, and played some Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. Because I don't need to play World of Warcraft all the time. I'll play WoW when I want. And if I play for 20 minutes and realize it's not doing it for me, I stand up and do something else. As much as I look back on my time with the game as toxic, I also made some good friends and had some really fun, unforgettable times. The key is moderation. During my worst days, World of Warcraft was my life. Right now, World of Warcraft is just a game. A great game, mind you, but still just a game.","For a sizeable chunk of my life, I played World of Warcraft too much. Way too much.

"David Anthony and Marah Eakin on The Takeout, shared by Riley MacLeod to Kotaku","When Dairy Queen introduced the Blizzard in 1985, it was a big step forward in ice cream shop innovation. Before, you had hand-dipped cones and soft serve, sundaes and splits. If your shop knew what it was doing, you might be able to swing a chocolate- or sprinkle-covered cone, and there was always the milkshake. Blizzards changed all that, blending popular sundae toppings—toppings with name brands, even—with Dairy Queen’s signature soft serve. You didn’t just have to have a spoonful of Oreos on your vanilla ice cream anymore. Now, thanks to the magic of the DQ Blizzard machine, you could have a spoonful of Oreos in your ice cream. Thirty-three years later, the DQ Blizzard has been ripped off and blown up, with the Warren Buffett-owned chain now offering no fewer than 15 Blizzard options at all times, plus seasonal options and off-menu selections. And while Blizzards are inherently customizable—you can add mint flavoring to just about any of the options, for instance, or make any of the Blizzards with either chocolate or twist ice cream—the classics remain classics for a reason. Or, at least, that was our thinking. Spurred by the knowledge that we could ostensibly be paid to consume an insane amount of ice cream in a ill-advisedly short amount of time, The Takeout set out to taste and rank all of Dairy Queen’s available Blizzards. Using an extremely scientific metric, we calculated each item’s tastiness and/or grossness, and our resulting list is below, in ascending order. Please feel free to tell us we’re wrong in the comments below and on Twitter. 19. Banana Split (1 point out of a possible 20) God, how this Blizzard sucks. In our test, it came out of the DQ kitchens with a watery consistency that was more like a smoothie than a Blizzard. When we finally managed to pour it precariously into our mouths, we were instantly turned off. The bananas were too ripe, giving the ice cream an almost sour taste, and the other toppings—strawberry topping and chocolate fudge—faded into the background—present, but not really. Supposedly there’s also pineapple in it, but we neither tasted nor observed any, though that would explain some of the wateriness. While the concept of a Banana Split Blizzard seems solid—it’s just one form of ice cream turned into another—in execution it failed in pretty much every way. On paper, the Salted Caramel Truffle Blizzard sounds like a good idea. It’s got the titular truffles, after all, plus toffee pieces, fudge, and chocolate chunks. In practice, though, it’s a mishmash of poorly layered flavors, all of which mix to form one funky aftertaste. It tastes like a Rolo you found in a winter coat you haven’t worn in years. While it’s kind of amazing how all the flavors really do arrive in waves—ice cream, chocolate, toffee, salt, caramel—there’s never really one that you want to invite to stay. Dairy Queen’s embodiment of a culture that believes everything must be pushed to the maximalist apex, the Monster Cookie Blizzard is the dessert equivalent of chewing on shrapnel. Every time the spoon dredges into this abomination, it’s fighting through a sea of M&amp;M’s, peanut butter topping, chocolate chunks, peanut butter cookies, and utter sadness at the world we have created. Chewing is about as pleasurable as deciding to snack on the insides of a stapler: It’s sharp, jagged, and completely without reward. The peanut butter is okay, though. 16. M&amp;M’s (4 points) Here’s the thing with M&amp;M’s: They’re great on their own and fucking terrible in ice cream. Unlike other prepackaged treats that give a bit of themselves to the dairy base, M&amp;M’s keep their flavor hidden below their hard outer coating. Not just that, they also only get harder when in cold conditions, making their presence in a Blizzard a potential dental concern instead of a simple sweet treat. 15. Georgia Mud Fudge (4.5 points) An off-menu item that doesn’t appear anywhere on the DQ website, the Georgia Mud Fudge Blizzard may have been one of the company’s seemingly brilliant ideas that never really panned out. Like so many Blizzards at the bottom of this ranking, the Mud Fudge Blizzard wastes delicious-sounding ingredients—brownie pieces, cocoa fudge, and pecans—on chocolate soft serve, making the whole thing into a flat-tasting chocolate mess. 14. Double Fudge Cookie Dough (5 points) Everything we already said regarding Georgia Mud Fudge also applies here, though this Blizzard also kicks things up a notch by nixing the pecans and adding cookie dough. The result is weirdly chewy and needlessly intense. No one other than a chocolate-crazed kid with low standards should order this thing. Another variation on a theme, Chocolate Xtreme blends chewy brownie pieces, chocolate chunks—sorry, “choco chunks,” as per the DQ site—and “cocoa fudge” into vanilla soft serve. You’d never know it was vanilla, though, as the whole thing turns into an xtremely chocolatey mess that’s more like candy than ice cream. Nothing plays together and nothing is enhanced, making the whole thing entirely forgettable. The issue with this Blizzard is that it seemingly tries to double up on flavors, meaning that nothing really shines. The chocolate chip cookie dough mirrors the vanilla ice cream a little too closely, and the inclusion of both peanut butter and peanut butter cookies means there are two incredibly similar flavors pushing against one another instead of working together. This Blizzard should be great, but in practice, it suffers from an identity crisis. 11. Heath (7 points) Although one fellow A.V. Club staffer has intimated that this entire list is invalid because of the Heath Blizzard’s placement, we’re sticking to our guns and say that, honestly, the toffee-heavy Blizzard is kind of a bummer. It’s too crunchy, and the toffee flavor lingers in a way that’s fairly unpleasant—again, even for people who like toffee. It’s unbalanced and off-kilter and, in our opinion, too much. Cookie dough is a utility player in the world of Blizzards. It can nestle itself along any of the name-brand candies without upstaging them, and it can fit in with any base flavor well. But those assets are exactly why it ranks so low when isolated. It has an artificial cookie dough flavor, the kind that blends into the vanilla ice cream too easily. It’s pleasant and inoffensive, but it’s not worth writing home about. 9. Royal Rocky Road (9 points, tied with Chocolate Covered Strawberry) The lowest ranked of Dairy Queen’s three new Royal Blizzard flavors, Royal Rocky Road falters because it lives up to its name a little too well. There’s nothing wrong with rocky road as an ice cream, and that’s the problem with this Blizzard: It doesn’t offer anything a scoop of ice cream wouldn’t. Where the other Royals are distinct, the Royal Rocky Road Blizzard exists to mimic something that’s already behind the counter. This one was divisive among our team. Some of us loved the fruity essence the strawberry brought—it was a welcome flavor during the onslaught of Blizzard tasting—while others found it fake-tasting and cloying. Still, Choco Covered Strawberry landed solidly in the upper half of the rankings, an especially good showing considering the Blizzard isn’t even on the menu most of the year. (Our friendly DQ cashier just asked us if we wanted to try it.) Choco Covered Strawberry tastes more grown-up than some of its creamy competitors, and while the chocolate supposedly “covering” the strawberry sauce has a weird aftertaste—a fact made all the more suspicious by the word “choco” in the Blizzard’s name rather than “chocolate”—it’s still worth a go once in a while. The Turtle Pecan Cluster Blizzard is Dairy Queen’s attempt to join Blizzards and sundaes in some sort of unholy union. What makes a Blizzard work is its ability to have flavors mix, while a sundae is all about toppings. The Turtle Pecan Cluster does an admirable job of marrying these two opposing desserts but, it’s hard to nab a single bite that captures the Blizzard’s opposing halves. When everything comes together in a perfectly balanced spoonful, it’s satisfying in a way few other Blizzards are. Sadly, that’s rarely the case. The most divisive of all the Oreo Blizzards—due in part to one of us not being a fan of mint—the Mint Oreo Blizzard is the one that strives to stand out from its brethren. Fans of mint chocolate chip ice cream will find a lot to love here, in part because the Oreo flavor pairs well with the base. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising if mint lovers ranked this one highest out of the pack. But for us, it’s just the start of Oreo’s dominance. Few candies are as divine as the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. This is due in large part to peanut butter cups not allowing for much tinkering. There are some novelty shapes here, a bigger size there, and occasionally some different types of chocolate used, but it’s about as straightforward as candy gets. It only makes sense that a Reese’s Blizzard works well even if it’s not the most dynamic. It may not mix in as well as a softer candy, but it’s not as jarring as M&amp;M’s. It’s a simple item and one that’s rightly considered a classic. Although the candy sticks to your teeth a little, the Butterfinger Blizzard lands toward the top of this list because of its balance. It’s a little salty, a lot sweet, a little crunchy, and a little squishy. It’s the best of all worlds, with the crispity, crunchity candy bar somehow lending its peanut butter essence to the ice cream via osmosis, taking the whole creamy mess to a whole other level. 3. Oreo (15 points) The mix-in is what truly defines a Blizzard, and each candy option has its loyalists. That being said, Oreos are a staple of ice cream shop menus for their sheer versatility. They can be crunched up as a topping or swirled inside and work well in both presentations. As the mailman sitting next to us at the Dairy Queen noted, “You can’t go wrong with Oreo,” and he’s right. It might not be the flashiest item on the menu, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s damn good just the way it is. We swear we’re not trying to shill for DQ’s newish Royal Blizzards here, but two-thirds of them really are pretty good. While Royal Oreo is more of a daily eater (Note: Don’t do that unless you’re Michael Phelps or something.), Royal Cheesecake is more suitable for a mini-sized snack. Rich and surprisingly light for a dessert that’s made of presumably shitty cheesecake and a bunch of ice cream, the Royal Cheesecake blizzard is enhanced by the strawberry sauce at its core, which adds a crisp fruitiness not really present in most candy and chocolate-centric Blizzards. While many of the Blizzards that landed at the bottom of this list tanked because they tried to do too much, Royal Cheesecake succeeds on its restraint. The thing with trying to upgrade a classic is that it will always be compared to the original. The Royal Oreo Blizzard doesn’t attempt to change the fundamental truth that Oreos and vanilla ice cream pair well. Instead it makes one simple addition: hot fudge in the center. While a single bite of the Royal Cheesecake might be more pleasing, it’s rich enough to wear you down. Instead, the Royal Oreo is the Blizzard that’s the most enjoyable and requires the least amount of effort over time. Even as it got warm and the ice cream got watery, the pleasant flavors remained. It may not be the most decadent option on Dairy Queen’s menu, but it’s certainly the most pleasing. All hail the Royal Oreo.","When Dairy Queen introduced the Blizzard in 1985, it was a big step forward in ice cream shop innovation.

The last time the company did a mass layoff (600 people in 2012), it generously rehired those people as temps, doing the same jobs for less pay, with no security or benefits.
The layoffs targeted the most precarious workers at the company: low-earning temps and contractors pulling long shifts in the hopes of getting hired on permanently.

I was working as an In-Game Support Representative (also known as a Game Master) in Blizzards World of Warcraft customer support department when the Activision/Vivendi merger finalized in the summer of 2008. While many of us were concerned about Activisions potential influence on Blizzards sacred creative freedom, many fears were assuaged by managements generous gift of a free copy of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith for the Wii.
Of course, the hundreds of us who were considered temporary full-time employees did not receive any perks like free Aerosmith games, despite doing the same work as full-time regular employees, just at $9 an hour instead of $11. Dont you worry, though! I persevered and eventually earned my place as a full-time Blizzard employee $11 an hour and everything and was even allowed to attend the annual Blizzard Christmas party, which temporary full-time employees were barred from.

Jason Schreier,"Yesterday, at the exact moment Activision Blizzard chief executive officer Bobby Kotick hopped on a quarterly earnings call to inform shareholders that his company had just gone through a record year, employees across the publisher of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and more were being brought into conference rooms and informed that they were losing their jobs.
Its a bloodbath here, one Blizzard employee told me last night. A lot more cuts than we were expecting.
As Kotick and other executives were telling investors that the next Call of Duty was shaping up to be the best one yet, employees across Activision Blizzards various divisions nervously sat at their desks, waiting to see who would be next to get the severance envelope. In Blizzards publishing department, management had booked a series of meetings from 1pm to 3pm Pacific. On the calendar, they were all blank. Everyone knew what that meant.
The look on peoples faces as theyre pulling in through the [campus] gates is just awful, said another Blizzard employee. This is the fucking worst.
Later on the call, Kotick delivered the grim news: Activision Blizzard, which employed around 9,600 employees last year, would reduce its workforce by 8%. That equated to around 800 people. Some were junior employees, having started at the company just recently; others had been with Activision Blizzard for 15 years or longer. Some were informed yesterday; others, particularly in Europe and other non-U.S. divisions, didnt find out their fates until this morning.
It was carnage. People were laid off at Activisions main office in Santa Monica, California, where an entire team of Destiny publishing staff had been coming to work with nothing to do. (Some of them were laid off; some were moved to Call of Duty or other teams. Some in other departments were also laid off.) People lost their jobs at King, the developer of Candy Crush, and at Activisions various development studios including Vicarious Visions (Albany, NY) and High Moon Studios (San Diego, CA), both of which had handled support on Destiny 2. Activision Blizzard staff in Europe, Latin America, and other regions across the world also lost their jobs. Some who were laid off wrote messages on social media to say goodbye, while developers all across the video game industry tried to help by posting job listings on Twitter and Facebook. Although the bulk of laid-off employees were support staff, some were in departments like art and design as well.
Over the past week Ive talked to around 20 people who were laid off or close to those being laid off, as well as others with knowledge as to whats happening at Activision Blizzard. If theres a consensus, its rage. Rage at Koticks comments, at the way Activision executives seemingly view their employees as numbers on a spreadsheet, at the callousness in which this layoff was handled. Theres rage at who was chosen to be laid offtwo people told me that it felt like a random, haphazard practiceand rage that some important employees were let go. Some who had been laid off told me they had felt safe, expecting their studios or departments to not be affected. Even those who felt layoffs were necessary or justifiable said they were shocked by the scale, scope, and coldness from executives.
At Blizzard, for example, rumors of big layoffs had been circulating as early as November. Back then, as I began to learn about the sweeping changes that had come to the legendary game studio in 2018, I heard from a former high-level employee that layoffs were coming in February. I heard the same from a source plugged into the investor community. Another Blizzard employee told me today that the layoffs had been an open secret for months.
Blizzard, founded in 1991, has developed critically and commercially successful games from Warcraft and StarCraft to Diablo and Overwatch. It has kept its game quality high even after Activision merged with the studio in 2008. It just hasnt produced many new games of late, increasing tensions with management in Santa Monica. Since the beginning of 2018, as Kotaku has reported previously, the mandate at Blizzard had been to cut costs and produce more games. 
To those who worked outside of Blizzards development teams, in departments like publishing, esports, QA, and IT, it felt last year like the axe was about to fall. After all, if Blizzard was looking to develop more games without spending more money, theyd need to lose headcount in non-game-development departments. But management said nothing. With no union or other method for collectively communicating with executives, employees were left with nothing but whispers. As November turned into December and the new year came, all they could do was wait.
Last week, as rumors began heating up and culminated in a Bloomberg story on Friday night reporting that hundreds of layoffs were coming, one Blizzard employee reached out to me to ask if I knew whether or not theyd get severance. The person said they werent expecting to be affected, but wanted to know if Id heard anything about how impacted employees would be treated. Just in case. On Tuesday night, I found out theyd been laid off. (Full-time employees who were laid off across Activision Blizzard did get severance, although contractors did not.)
I heard other stories, too. Some people supposedly learned their fate early, signing non-disclosure agreements last week in exchange for severance packages. Others took buyouts thanks to the Career Crossroads program that allowed QA, customer service, and IT employees to voluntarily leave, as we reported in December. Some were given hints from their managerswarnings to polish their résumés before Tuesday. One Blizzard employee told me theyd see the job networking website Linkedin open on computer screens as they walked around the office over the past week.
Some outside of Blizzard, at Activisions various development studios, thought they were safe but on Tuesday and Wednesday reached out to let me know that they or their colleagues had been unexpectedly laid off.
Last night, the picture at Blizzard became clearer. Support teams had been gutted. The layoffs were largest in non-development departments like IT and QA, according to those who were there. The esports department was hit hard, as many within Blizzard had expectedafter all, it had been led by Amy Morhaime, wife of Mike, the long-time Blizzard CEO who left the company last fall. She departed around the same time. The two Morhaimes were seen as big advocates for esports within Blizzard, even when it wasnt quite as lucrative as Activisions executives might have hoped, and with them gone, the department was in danger.
Blizzards publishing department, which is comprised of PR, marketing, community, and other game support divisions, was also hit hard. Around late 2015 or early 2016, Blizzard had split North American and global publishing into two departments, according to long-time employees. It was seen as a bad move by those who worked there, one that caused resentment, redundancy, and unnecessary bureaucracy. As part of this weeks layoffs, Blizzard reconsolidated those divisions, laying off dozens in the process. Executives like chief operating officer Armin Zerza and marketing boss Todd Harvey, both of whom are heavily connected to Activision, are running the show.
So what does this all mean for the future of Blizzard? Since the beginning of 2018, Activision has been exerting more influence on Blizzard, pushing the company to release more games and find more ways to make money. General consensus, even among rank-and-file employees, is that Blizzards lack of new game output over the past few years hasnt been healthy or sustainable. But Activisions influence has raised questions among Blizzard staff about whether the studio can retain its culture. Said one former Blizzard employee to me last December: Theres a real struggle now between developers and the business people Strategic decisions are being driven by the finance group. 
Blizzard has spent the year taking big measures to cut costs as it prepares for a lean 2019. Those

For decades, Activisions philosophy has revolved around annualized releases, most notably with the gargantuan Call of Duty series, which hasnt skipped a year since 2004. That sort of schedule is diametrically opposed to Blizzards release it when its ready philosophy, which has led to massively successful games like Overwatch and Hearthstone but has also led to periods like the present, in which Blizzard has gone three years without releasing a major game. The tension between annualized releases and games as a service that dont have to have new, boxed releases and sequels is one of the main reasons that the Activision and Bungie relationship never worked out. Last month, the two companies split, with Bungie buying the full rights to sell and publish Destiny on its own.
This year will likely be a slow one for Blizzard, as the company implements its new strategy across franchises like Diablo, Warcraft, and Overwatch (all of which have new games in development, many for smartphones). Then, well likely see more new Blizzard games come out more regularly than ever before. And well have to wait and see if they live up to the quality bar Blizzard has set for itself over the past three decades.
At the Yard House restaurant in the Irvine Spectrum mall in California last night, a group of current and now-former Blizzard employees met up to drink and commiserate. The mood was somber, according to one person who was there. There was plenty of sadness and blame to go around. There was anxiety expressed by those who now need to hunt for new jobs, and those who might be forced to uproot their families for new cities or countries. And among those who remain at the company, theres survivors guilt. The fallout of this layoff will linger for a long time. Work again tomorrow, said one Blizzard employee who remains at the company. I have a feeling no one will be doing much work the rest of the week.","Yesterday, at the exact moment Activision Blizzard chief executive officer Bobby Kotick hopped on a quarterly earnings call to inform shareholders that his company had just gone through a “record year,” employees across the publisher of Call of Duty, World of…",2019-02-13T19:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kotaku.com'}",The Fallout Of Activision Blizzard’s Massive Layoffs,https://kotaku.com/the-fallout-of-activision-blizzard-s-massive-layoffs-1832597892,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--T8Yy5O2w--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/j0wvfkle55dikdumywcr.jpg",,Kotaku.com,blizzard,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over. A powerful storm is set to spin up in the Midwest this week. And if youre getting deja vu looking at the weather map up top, youre not alone.
The swirling mass of air forecast to blast the region with blustery winds, snow, and rain bears more than a passing resemblance to last months bomb cyclone that devastated the region. While this weeks storm might not be quite as strong, it will unleash a wave of misery in places still suffering from flooding.
The gnarly weather pattern will follow a similar evolution to last months bomb cyclone. A storm will come racing on the back of a strong jet stream dipping across the west through the first half of the week. As the jet stream swoops back up into the Midwest on Wednesday, it will pull ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico up to meet cold air from the north. Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota are all under winter storm watches. The contrasting air temperatures will have winds whipping up to 35 mph and six or more inches of snow are forecast, according to the National Weather Service. Other parts of the Upper Midwest could also see snow through Thursday before the storm swirls into the Ohio River Valley, and its extremely likely those winter storm watches could expand to other areas and be upgraded to warnings. Blizzard-like conditions are also possible, so it wouldnt be wholly shocking to see the National Weather Service issue blizzard warnings at some point either.
While the storm is no joke, its also not likely to be quite as potent as last months bomb cyclone, which arrived with hurricane-force winds and record-setting low pressure. Thats because the environment isnt as conducive to as powerful a storm this time around. The temperature gradient on either side of the fronta key ingredient for winter storms to bomb outwont be as extreme. That means this storm might not meet the textbook definition of a bomb cyclone, a term that applies to storms that see their central pressure drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. 
But textbook definitions aside, this storm poses a serious risk to the region still recovering from flooding last month. Data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows thatMidwest soil moisture levels are in the 99th percentile, which is to say that soils are extremely waterlogged. The new batch of rain and snow is like pouring a can of gas on a fire. Except instead of the flames rising higher, the water will. 
If youre wondering what climate change looks like, this is it. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, unleashing more deluges and with them, more floods. With saturated soil, water is once again expected to run off into rivers and streams, many of which are still swollen. In the Missouri River basin, 26 flood gaugesin NOAAs networkare in a state of major or moderate flooding. In the Upper Mississippi basin, 56 gauges are at those levels of flooding. The new influx of water will add to the flood woes and is likely to tip other gauges back toward moderate or major flooding.
That could add to the billions of dollars in losses and once again raise the specter of flooding at Superfund sites. And it will add to the slow moving torrent of water working down the Mississippi River toward the Gulf of Mexico. That wall of water is forecast to unleash historic flooding through May, according to NOAA.","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over.

Jason Schreier,"Former Hearthstone director Ben Brode and a group of his colleagues left Blizzard last year, and although they yet havent announced what theyre making next, today they dropped some big news: Its a Marvel game.
Second Dinner, a new indie studio founded by Brode, former Hearthstone executive producer Hamilton Chu, and several other ex-Blizzard employees, announced today that its gotten a $30 million investment from the Chinese company NetEase and that its first game will be set in the Marvel universe. The company is hiring new staff in Irvine, California.
This news comes after a rough 2018 for Blizzard, one that saw the departure not just of Brode and Chu but its CEO, Mike Morhaime, who left the company last October. It was a year full of frugality for the iconic studio, as cost-cutting became the watchword. Current and former Blizzard employees continue to express fear about Activisions growing influence on the company through executives like chief operating officer Armin Zerza. Fans also revolted after a disastrous BlizzCon keynote in November 2018 that closed with the announcement of Diablo Immortal, a game for phones.
Incidentally, NetEasethe company funding Second Dinneris also a co-developer on Diablo Immortal.

Amanda Lee Myers / AP,"(LOS ANGELES) — Heather Turping was snowboarding with her boyfriend when she heard someone scream “Avalanche!” Then Turping, 39, saw “a cloud of snow coming down.” The avalanche that hit Friday at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort caught five people — one day after a snowboarder died there during a blizzard as a winter storm rolled through California. The storm that steamrollered through the Sierra Nevada still threatened rain and snow through Saturday afternoon in Southern California, a few hundred miles away. The National Weather Service said mountains in Ventura and Los Angeles counties could see up to a foot of new snow at higher elevations. Other areas could see some showers before an eastward-moving low-pressure trough moved on but forecasters said it wouldn’t be enough to cause major flooding. That was a relief to residents of the coastal foothill town of Montecito, northwest of Los Angeles. The Santa Barbara County town was ravaged by mudslide in January that killed 21 people and inundated hundreds of homes. Evacuation orders affecting up to 30,000 people on the south Santa Barbara County coast were issued Wednesday but lifted Friday after the worst of the rain passed without significant damage. “We have come through this with minimal impact,” said Rob Lewin, director of the county Office of Emergency management. The Sierra Nevada avalanche Friday afternoon injured two people, one seriously. Three others escaped without being hurt. Heather Turping saw the massive avalanche passed only a foot in front of her. A woman screamed that her husband was missing and someone spotted a snowboard poking out of the snow. “That’s what saved his life,” Turping said. “I took my gloves off and I helped dig him out,” she said. “When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, ‘You were under for six minutes.'” The man wasn’t seriously hurt and was able to snowboard back down the mountain, she said. The skiers and snowboarders were within areas open to skiing at the time and the guests had been warned of the potential danger, Squaw Valley spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn said. The resort used explosives and other tools to knock down snow to prevent avalanches throughout the day but the snowfall was heavy, she said. “We had assessed the area to be safe to open to the public and unfortunately an avalanche did occur after that assessment was made,” Hepburn said. The avalanche occurred hours after the body of a missing snowboarder was found at the same resort. Wenyu Zhang, 42, vanished Thursday as the region was hit by a blizzard packing winds gusting to nearly 150 mph (241 kph) over the ridge tops. It dumped 3 feet (1 meter) of snow in the mountains. A blizzard warning expired Friday but whiteout conditions were still possible around Lake Tahoe, where a winter storm warning remained in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said.",The avalanche hit one day after a snowboarder died during a blizzard,2018-03-03T14:33:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘Avalanche!’ Blizzard Leaves 1 Dead at California Ski Resort,http://time.com/5184080/california-avalanche-squaw-valley/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ski-resort-avalanche.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,blizzard,1
"Maddy Myers on Compete, shared by Maddy Myers to Kotaku","Hearthstone director Ben Brode announced today that he would be departing his job at Blizzard and plans “to help start a new company.” Brode’s departure comes as a shock to Hearthstone fans; the game designer has worked for Blizzard since 2002, starting out as an entry-level game tester and moving up the ranks and becoming one of the best-known and most popular faces of Blizzard’s games. Brode’s job often would thrust him into the spotlight, but he seemed to enjoy it. He responded to fans’ demands for more Hearthstone music by recording a rap song about the game. At PAX East earlier this month, Brode told Compete that he actively enjoyed hearing fan feedback on Twitter and Reddit, even the negative feedback. “I try to read every tweet I get,” he said. “Even if it’s emotionally charged, or sometimes rude feedback, it is still important to hear what is pissing people off as much as it is to hear what people like. More important, maybe, to hear what’s pissing people off.” When asked about whether he enjoyed being “the face” of Hearthstone, Brode insisted he delighted in his public-facing job: “I do really like it. I think I am weird and different, though. Like, when I go home after work, I spend my time on Reddit and Twitter, engaging with people. It’s what I do to relax. I don’t think most people do that to relax.” “You know, it’s weird,” he went on, “because I get a lot of credit by being public-facing that I just don’t deserve. I’m one of the 80 people on the team. So that feels bad to me. But I do like engaging with fans and talking about the game that I love. So that’s very rewarding.” Brode reiterated some of those sentiments in his goodbye letter on the Blizzard forums: “I get too much credit by virtue of being a public face, but the 80+ people on the development team are still there, and they are the ones actually making the cards, brawls, events, missions, and features. I am confident the game is in the best possible hands, and I’m excited to see where a new generation of leaders takes Hearthstone from here.” Back in January 2017, he posted on Reddit about how the job had its pitfalls, saying “there is a lot of harassment that comes with being more public” and emphasizing that fan feedback should “stay constructive… we need to stop letting the really toxic posts stew.” But that’s just about the only sign that Brode had ever given of not enjoying running Hearthstone. Just a few weeks ago, he said that The Witchwood expansion included “the craziest card” the team had ever made and sounded pretty happy and fulfilled. Even though reading every single reply and forum post from angry fans sounds like hell, it doesn’t sound like that’s what drove Brode to leave. (We reached out to Brode and haven’t received a reply yet.) At the end of his goodbye letter, Brode revealed some of his current discomfort by writing that he’s “looking forward to designing, programming, and actually creating things again.” By moving to a job at what he described as a “scrappy” startup, Brode’s new gig will be a radical departure from his current experience as a game director for one of the world’s biggest game companies. Until this new startup ships their first title, Brode won’t need to put out fan fires on Reddit or record rap songs. In other words, Ben Brode is about to become much less public-facing, whether he likes it or not.

Nathan Grayson,"“I don’t want to stream the game, because I literally get stream sniped every day,” said popular streamer TimTheTatMan of a particular griefer who kept interfering with his matches. Now Blizzard’s announced that it has banned the griefer, but only after discovering that they were using multiple accounts and “systematically ruining Overwatch games for thousands of players.” TimTheTatMan is a streamer who frequently plays Overwatch. He claimed that he was constantly hounded by a player who’d watch his stream, join his games, and purposefully try to ruin the experience—a practice known as “stream sniping” that’s become especially prevalent in games like PUBG. In this particular case, TimTheTatMan said the stream sniper slid into his matches, refused to play as anyone other than Symmetra, and made it difficult for his team to win. “Until they can figure out what they’re gonna do with an offensive Symmetra one-trick,” TimTheTatMan said in reference to Blizzard during a stream a couple days ago, “I’m not interested really in streaming it right now.” In certain corners of the Overwatch community, “one-trick” is the dirtiest of words, an insult reserved for players who lock down a single hero and have to be dragged off their pick kicking and screaming, like spoiled children. It’s also a subject of much debate, because Blizzard has rules against disrupting your team’s good time, but it also wants people to be able to play as their favorite heroes as they please. In explaining why Blizzard decided to intervene here and permanently ban all of this griefer’s accounts, it carefully noted that one-tricking wasn’t the straw that ultimately brought the banhammer down on the camel’s back. In a post on Reddit, a Blizzard rep said that this griefer is “one of the worst offenders we have come across” with multiple accounts that have “copious reports each, all of which have been previously suspended for extended periods of time.” “To be clear this player is being banned, not for their hero choice, but rather for systematically ruining Overwatch games for thousands of players,” the rep said. Thousands! And yet, Blizzard failed to perma-ban them, despite the fact that their red-handed fingerprints were apparently all over the place. Blizzard went on to call this player’s repeated offenses a “failure” of its reporting system. “We’ve already taken steps to quickly eliminate outliers like this in the future,” the rep wrote.","“I don’t want to stream the game, because I literally get stream sniped every day,” said popular streamer TimTheTatMan of a particular griefer who kept interfering with his matches.

Jeff Grubb,"Activision is planning to cut “non-development jobs” because it isn’t releasing enough games. This news comes via a Kotaku report that claims new Blizzard boss J. Allen Brack sent a letter to employees detailing the layoffs. GamesBeat has separately confirmed that Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick sent a message to employees that said layoffs are coming. He did not get into specifics in that message.
The publisher is laying off people across Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, and King. This reorganization is primarily about taking money away from non-development jobs and putting those resources into its game-creation teams.
Here’s how Brack explained the layoffs in his letter obtained by Kotaku:
Over the last few years, many of our non-development teams expanded to support various needs. Currently staffing levels on some teams are out of proportion with our current release slate. This means we need to scale down some areas of our organization. Im sorry to share that we will be parting ways with some of our colleagues in the U.S. today. In our regional offices, we anticipate similar evaluations, subject to local requirements.
I have reached out to Activision Blizzard for a statement, and I will update this story with any comment. But these layoffs come as the company is also reporting the results of its 2018 fiscal year.
Activision Blizzard generated $2.38 billion in revenue, and the company was quick to point out that was an all-time record. At the same time, the company said that making more money than ever is not enough.
While our financial results for 2018 were the best in our history, we didnt realize our full potential,” said Kotick. “To help us reach our full potential, we have made a number of important leadership changes. These changes should enable us to achieve the many opportunities our industry affords us, especially with our powerful owned franchises, our strong commercial capabilities, our direct digital connections to hundreds of millions of players, and our extraordinarily talented employees.","Activision set a new record for revenue, but it is cutting jobs.

Joshua Calixto,"Hearthstone ’s new Kobolds and Catacombs expansion may have introduced an exciting way to enjoy the game without spending money, but it also introduced a new issue that has made it difficult for some players to earn in-game currency. While Blizzard has just rolled out some new ways to counteract the problem, it still poses a major delay for players who want to play without spending money. Ever since the expansion’s launch a couple weeks ago, players have reported an issue where they don’t receive Daily Quests, which are one of Hearthstone ’s primary ways of earning new cards. For a large array of players who log in just to complete these dailies, the bug represented a major delay to Hearthstone ’s central grinding system. Yesterday, in a forum post, Blizzard took time to clarify the issue: Quests aren’t actually disappearing, it said, but the introduction of the single-player Dungeon Run mode put strain on the servers that has simply delayed them from showing up in the quest log. For now, there’s still no fix to the issue, but Blizzard has provided a few workarounds that will help players receive their daily quests faster: Check your quest log 10-30 minutes after logging in for the first time after quests reset. You need not remain logged in for that time. Manually refresh the quest log by pushing the Quest Log button. Play games in Play Mode or Arena (Note that Dungeon Run will not cause the quest log to update). Note: If you happen to complete your quest without seeing the quest log update, you’ll still be properly rewarded. For now, as Blizzard continues to hammer out longer-term fixes for the issue, it is giving all players three Kobolds and Catacombs card packs free of charge. And while the prospect of slamming Hearthstone ’s proverbial vending machine to get a quest isn’t exactly ideal, it’s better than the alternative.","Hearthstone ’s new Kobolds and Catacombs expansion may have introduced an exciting way to enjoy the game without spending money, but it also introduced a new issue that has made it difficult for some players to earn in-game currency.

Gita Jackson,"For over a year, Blizzard has insisted that Hanzo Shimada does not have prosthetic legs. Nevertheless, Overwatch fans have their doubts. Let me be frank—Hanzo Shimada has impossibly tiny ankles. Observe: As a result of this undeniable truth, Overwatch fanfiction writers have been operating under the assumption that Hanzo has prosthetic legs. The understanding was that since Hanzo and his brother Genji got in a fight that left Genji a robot and Hanzo injured, Hanzo probably got his legs chopped off before delivering the blow that nearly killed his brother. However, both Jeff Kaplan and Michael Chu from the Overwatch team have said that Hanzo does not have prosthetic legs. Kaplan went as far to say that Hanzo just has “delicate ankles” at Blizzcon in 2016. But just because the developers said this doesn’t mean fandom buys it. I mean, it’s ridiculous. Ever since that comment from Kaplan, Hanzo’s improbable legs have been a recurring topic of discussion in fandom, cropping up whenever fans recall Hanzo’s dainty ankles. I’m with fandom on this one. I mean, how does Hanzo wallrun if he has normal legs? Riddle me that, Blizzard! Although they’re unlikely to reverse the studio’s stance, I hope fandom keeps pestering the Overwatch team about this. Of all the things that blatantly don’t make sense about the lore for this game, this one is the most egregious. I mean, look at the dude’s ankles. No wonder he uses a bow and arrow. If he tried to lift a gun his legs would snap in half.","For over a year, Blizzard has insisted that Hanzo Shimada does not have prosthetic legs. Nevertheless, Overwatch fans have their doubts.

Luke Plunkett,"Blizzard and Nerf are going to release a couple of guns based on Overwatch, one being Reaper’s shotgun, the other D.Va’s pistol. They’re part of Nerf’s “Rivals” line, which is basically a series of guns made and marketed specifically at adults, and which fire small round projectiles (like squishy musketballs) instead of the traditional Nerf bullets. Reaper’s shotgun will hold eight rounds and fire them at 90 feet per second, while D.Va’s will hold three and shoot at 80 feet per second. Given D.Va’s catchphrase literally includes the word “nerf”, it’s insane it’s taken both companies this long to get something like this out there. Both will be out next year, but there’s no word on price.","Blizzard and Nerf are going to release a couple of guns based on Overwatch, one being Reaper’s shotgun, the other D.Va’s pistol.

Nathan Grayson,"Despite arriving too late to prevent what some might call a full-blown crisis, Overwatch ’s anti-toxicity efforts seem to be bearing fruit. The next step in the battle, says game director Jeff Kaplan, might be having computers, not humans, find the bad actors. “We’ve been experimenting with machine learning,” Kaplan told me during an interview at Blizzard’s offices yesterday. “We’ve been trying to teach our games what toxic language is, which is kinda fun. The thinking there is you don’t have to wait for a report to determine that something’s toxic. Our goal is to get it so you don’t have to wait for a report to happen.” Even without robots leading the charge, Blizzard is making progress. In a video released in January, Kaplan said that thanks to changes to the game’s reporting and punishment systems, abusive chat went down by 17 percent. He claimed that people use the report feature 20 percent more often, too. So basically, Overwatch ’s reporting system is functional now. But that doesn’t necessarily mitigate the problems shared by reporting systems as a whole. They’re slow. People don’t always have faith in them. They can be abused. The next step for the Overwatch team, then, is to start catching bad behavior before it’s ever reported. Enter machine learning. Already, Kaplan says, the company is teaching its AI non-English languages like Korean, and the long-term hope is that it can learn what toxic gameplay looks like. “That’s the next step,” said Kaplan. “Like, do you know when the Mei ice wall went up in the spawn room that somebody was being a jerk?” “Our goal is to get it so you don’t have to wait for a report to happen.” Of course, machines are just as fallible as the humans who built them, albeit in different ways. Machine learning can have trouble determining context, especially if you’re just teaching it words and phrases. Profanity-laden trash talk, for example, might cause you to see red and spit fire if it’s coming from a complete stranger, but laugh like an idiot if it’s coming from one of your best friends. Kaplan said that, at this point, the team has mostly tuned its AI to go after the most egregious examples of toxicity—people who, by Blizzard’s metrics, doubtless deserve punishment. It’s also not going through DMs between friends or anything like that, and it can be tuned to flag first and only punish on repeat offenses. “With anything involving reporting and player punishments, you want to start with the most extreme cases and then find your way to ease up after that,” he said. The Overwatch team—which is now part of a Blizzard-wide anti-toxicity initiative as well as a collaboration involving companies like Riot and Twitch called The Fair Play Alliance —is also examining the other side of the coin: how do you reinforce good behavior? “We can start looking toward the future and talking about things like, what’s the positive version of reporting?” said Kaplan. “Reporting is saying ‘Hey, Adrian was really bad and I want to punish him for that,’ but what’s the version where I can say ‘That Adrian guy was an awesome teammate and I’m so glad I had him’?” “We’re punishing the bad people, so how do we get people to start thinking about being better citizens within our ecosystem?”","Despite arriving too late to prevent what some might call a full-blown crisis, Overwatch ’s anti-toxicity efforts seem to be bearing fruit.

Andrew Freedman,"Residents of Southern New England are used to snowstorms, including the classic blizzards that can stalk this region like a hunter tracks prey. Such storms, known as nor'easters for the direction that the wind comes from, can shut down areas from New York City to Portland, Maine, and bring damaging coastal flooding, feet of snow, and widespread power outages. However, even the hardiest of New Englanders are likely growing weary, as the third major nor'easter in a parade of powerful storms is projected to hit beginning Monday night. SEE ALSO: What is bombogenesis? This storm is not predicted to track close enough to the coast to spread heavy snow well inland, toward New York and New Jersey, like last week's storm did. But eastern Massachusetts can expect near blizzard to blizzard conditions by Tuesday morning, with snowfall totals potentially nearing 2 feet in some locations, according to the National Weather Service. Essentially, the atmosphere is acting like a rechargeable battery, with major storms every three to five days, followed by a period of unusually cool, calm weather. Computer model projection of the nor'easter on March 13, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The new storm will hit at a time when thousands of people are still without power in the region due to the tree and power line damage the last storm caused. Some areas in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey are still littered with downed branches and even entire trees split in half. This coming storm is not likely to cause nearly as much damage to trees and the electrical infrastructure, since it will bring fluffier snow, rather than the pasty, wet cement of the last nor'easter. There's still a chance the latest nor'easter will track further away from the coast or closer to it, which would significantly change predicted snowfall amounts, but computer models are honing in on a track off the coast of Cape Cod. The latest nor'easter will likely end a remarkably stormy run of weather for early March, making this winter bookended by a frigid outbreak around New Years and a snowstorm blitz just before spring, with well above average temperatures sandwiched in between. Computer model depiction of the Greenland block, outlined by the blue square. Image: tropicaltidbits.com To understand why there has been such a barrage of storms, one must look to the large-scale weather pattern in place across the Northern Hemisphere that led up to this stormy period. As reported in February, the polar vortex, which is a semi-permanent area of low pressure at high altitudes above the Arctic with strong winds swirling around it, split into two pieces. One lobe of the polar vortex established itself over Siberia and Europe, leading to the ""Beast from the East"" cold and snow outbreak there. Another slipped into the Western U.S. for a time. Meanwhile, weird things were happening in the Arctic, where it was record-warm for the month of February. The region may soon set a record for the least amount of sea ice cover present at the end of the winter — also known as the lowest sea ice maximum. This is in keeping with trends toward rapidly increasing air temperatures during winter, and thinner, younger sea ice that covers less area over time. At the same time, conditions across the Pacific Ocean, including the tropical Pacific, set off a chain of events that altered the shape of the jet stream — the highway of air at upper levels of the atmosphere, which steers storms and helps energize them. Then, a massive block formed over Greenland, as a pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation or NAO, plunged to record negative territory. When the NAO is in a negative phase, it ups the odds for snowstorms in the eastern U.S. and Europe, although it does not guarantee them. Earlier this month, the NAO index plunged to a record low, which is indicative of how primed the atmosphere is for major storms. Together, these events set the stage for a fusillade of storms to blast the East Coast, among other parts of the world. The Greenland block is absolutely key to this, since it prevents weather systems from simply slinking off out to sea, and allows different branches of the jet stream to come together, or ""phase,"" and form a rapidly intensifying storm. Here's how Jason Furtado, an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, explained what's going on, via email: The jet stream acts as the storm track. The southward displacement of the polar jet stream across the Eastern US (trough) during Greenland blocking/negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) episodes facilitates storm systems to track across the Midwest or Southeast and eventually off the Eastern Seaboard. Placing these potent systems over the warm Atlantic waters allows them to rapidly intensify and form Nor’easters. The blocking over the North Atlantic also helps to (a) increase winds from the storm system (pressure gradient) and (b) slow the storm system’s progress to the north and east, sometimes even forcing it out to the south. The offshore tracks for these systems with the block in place allows for cold air to take hold across the Northeast and thus make for rather big snowstorms. The low pressure area forecast to hit southern New England on Monday night and Tuesday will be the third straight storm to undergo bombogenesis, meaning its minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such bomb cyclones are typically accompanied by strong winds, as the air rushes in toward the center of the storm. Without the Greenland block, it's unlikely that all the ingredients would come together three times in a row for major East Coast storms. Think of it as a matchmaker: The Greenland block is facilitating a hook up between weather disturbances pinwheeling across North America, and raising the odds that they'll meet and get busy somewhere off the Mid-Atlantic coast. ""This is not unprecedented per se given the pattern in place (e.g., Feb 2010 'Snowmaggedon' in DC/Mid-Atlantic; Dec 2010-Jan 2011 for the Northeast),"" Furtado added. ""These Greenland block patterns (and post-sudden stratospheric warming episodes) tip the scale toward more frequent and/or intense nor’easters."" A string of storms like this one is not unheard of in New England, as the atmosphere can fall into a pattern that produces a storm every four or five days. That's why some months appear to be rainy every weekend while the workweek is sunny and gorgeous. Interestingly, this next nor'easter hitting tonight is likely to help change the current weather pattern, with the Greenland block breaking down somewhat in coming days. What about global warming? Studies show that there are connections between Arctic climate change and midlatitude weather patterns, particularly cold weather outbreaks in Europe, as well as more stubborn, blocking patterns such as the one we're in the grips of now. However, this is still a contested area of climate science, with some studies showing evidence of links between declining Arctic sea ice and the jet stream, and others failing to detect such connections. Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk company, has been studying the potential links between Arctic climate change and extreme weather in the Northeast and Europe, among other areas. His work shows that as the Arctic warms, the odds of heavy snows in the Northeast somewhat paradoxically goes up. ""So though a heavy snowfall in March is not unheard of or rare, it is the frequency of the heavy snowfalls that seems to be changing,"" he said in an email. ""Also maybe a little more rarer is to have three destructive/disruptive storms in quick succession. But I do think this is consistent with the pattern that follows a polar vortex split over time,"" he said. A recent study Cohen contributed to showed that polar vortex splits have become more frequent as Arctic sea ice has declined and Arctic warming has accelerated. In addition, it's clear, that the impact of nor'easters, including the recent ones, is getting worse due to global warming. This is particularly the case with coastal flooding, since sea level rise is providing storms with a higher launching pad for floods than was the case in previous years. For example, the first of the three storms gave Boston it's third-highest tide level on record, with flooding occurring during at east five high tide cycles up and down the coast from Maine to Connecticut. Also, global warming is causing seas to warm overall, and air temperatures to increase, which results in an uptick in the amount of available water vapor in the air to power major storms like nor'easters. Precipitation extremes, including heavy snow events during the winter, are becoming more common as the climate continues to change. Interestingly, global warming might be giving people the impression that heavy snows don't occur as much anymore, making these nor'easters more surprising. As University of Georgia researcher Marshall Shepherd said in an email: ""The string of nor'easters is having a significant impact, but it is somewhat amusing that cold and nor'easters have garnered so much attention, the changes in our climate have made having winter newsworthy.""","Residents of Southern New England are used to snowstorms, including the classic blizzards that can stalk this region like a hunter tracks prey.

Ben Paynter,"The Activision Blizzard video game Overwatch is a wildly popular multiplayer video game, that features teams of players facing off against each other in battle. Earlier this summer, the company launched an inventive real life way for players and fans to combine forces and make some world change of their own, by raising $12.7 million for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The fundraising drive worked three ways. Activision Blizzard sold a limited edition “skin” or in-game pink outfit for its character named Mercy, an angelic looking female scientist across its PC, PlayStation4 and Xbox One platforms. It also hawked charity t-shirts with the Pink Mercy design, and ran an online gaming event with 14 star players on the live-stream gaming network Twitch, who agreed to donate any network-based tips or “bits” received during their sessions to the event. (That watching was incentivized, too, as the viewers who logged a certain amount of time could unlock more Overwatch-related prizes on their accounts.) [Image: Activision Blizzard] Activision Blizzard’s donation represents BCRF’s largest-ever gift from a corporate partner. For perspective, the nonprofit group was founded by Evelyn Lauder, the late chairman emeritus at Estee Lauder Companies, in 1993 and is primarily a research organization. It currently awards nearly $60 million annually to support research toward finding a cure for breast cancer. “This support of BCRF will help accelerate research advances impacting breast cancer patients worldwide,” writes group president and CEO Myra Biblowit in an email to Fast Company. Rewards offered to players for viewing Twitch streams. [Image: Activision Blizzard] But gaming for good is a trend that’s been gaining ever more influence within the philanthropic sector. Brittany Tompkins, Global Philanthropy Manager for Blizzard Entertainment notes in an email that the company has done similar efforts for groups like the American Red Cross, and Children’s Hospital of Orange County. In February, in-games sales of a pet named Mischief and related plush toy for another Blizzard game, World of Warcraft, raised $2.5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Activision Blizzard also sells in-game swag that directly supports some of its own charitable efforts. In December 2017, it offered an in-game Call of Duty Endowment consisting of a specialized helmet and in-game emblem for its same-named militaristic war game. All of the proceeds went to The Call Of Duty Endowment, which supports job placement efforts for veterans. T-shirts sold as part of the Pink Mercy promotion. [Image: Activision Blizzard] At the same time, there are plenty of other gamers generating their own philanthropic power-ups. Since 2009, The Zelda Team, which holds “ Zeldathons “–game-playing marathons inspired by the classic Nintendo game Legend of Zelda–raised nearly $2 million for many different cause groups, including Direct Relief, a disaster aid organization. Viewers contribute by watching the experts play online and pledging toward the accomplishment of various feats. The American Cancer Society also has Relay For Second Life inside that online virtual world, complete with in-game corporate sponsors. For Overwatch specifically such promotions are likely to continue gaining popularity as the game’s audience grows: Activision Blizzard just announced a deal with ESPN to televise its esports league games.","A new fundraising push on the game overwatch netted nearly $13 million for breast cancer.

Adam Bankhurst,"209 of the roughly 800 employees. 
By Adam BankhurstAccording a recently discovered report, 209 of the around 800 employees who were laid off as part of the Activision Blizzard restructuring worked on the Blizzard side of the gaming company.
As reported by Variety, records were obtained from California's Employment Development Department that stated that these 209 Blizzard layoffs impacted those around the U.S., including Irvine, Santa Monica, and Burbank in California, New York City, Austin (Texas), and Bloomington (Minnesota).
These employees were given 60 days of compensation and benefits and ""none were represented by a union, according to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification filed with the state by Blizzard on Feb. 12.""
The report indicated that the employees were given a severance package that may or may not have been in addition to the 60 days of compensation.
Blizzard's IT department saw the biggest hit with 41 employees being laid off, Marketing and Live Experiences each lost 29 employees, and a global insight department, publishing, quality assurance, mobile, marketing, customer service, finance, and Battle.Net also saw layoffs.
As for how Activision Blizzard decided who to layoff, the report claims the company ""considered multiple factors when deciding who to layoff, including business needs, job skills, redundancy, job elimination, and restructuring needs.""
The rest of the layoffs at Activision Blizzard haven't been spelled out as clearly, but we do know that King-Owned mobile game studio Z2Live was shut down, impacting its 78 employees. In addition, Vicarious Visions laid off ""a dozen people,"" 15 people were laid off from Activision's Mexico City offices and Blizzard's Versailles office in France "" will be losing 134 people.
These layoffs, which accounted for 8% of its around 9,900 full and part-time employees, will obviously have many ramifications for those affected and for Activision Blizzard, who understands that these moves could ""negatively impact [its] business.""
The layoffs arrived just ahead of Activision Blizzard's Q4 earnings call last month, in which the developer of such titles as Call of Duty and Overwatch cited ""record net revenues.""

Jason Schreier,"On November 2, 2018, Blizzard closed its annual BlizzCon keynote by announcing, to scattered applause, a Diablo game for phones. It was a baffling marketing decision that immediately set off controversy, as fans of Blizzards iconic action-role-playing game franchise loudly accused the company of neglecting its PC players. Perhaps Blizzards marketing department had expected Diablo fans to be excited about Diablo Immortal, but the announcement was yet another strange move in a string of bizarre Diablo -related decisions over the past few years. After Diablo III s disastrous launch on PC in 2012 and a road to redemption that culminated with 2014s expansion, Reaper of Souls, fans had expected long-term support and perhaps a second expansion for the third Diablo. It had sold more than 30 million copies, after all. But since 2014, updates to Diablo III have been light and sporadic, and four years later, Blizzards announcement of Diablo Immortal at a time when fans are hungry for any news of a Diablo IV has led to big questions about the future of the franchise. Whats really going on with Diablo ? What happened to Diablo III s long-term plan? Is Diablo Immortal, developed in part outside of Blizzard by the Chinese company NetEase, a sign that Blizzard has lowered its standards or abandoned its core audience? Is there a Diablo IV in development, or has Blizzard given up on PC games in favor of phones? To try to answer these questions, Ive spoken to 11 current and former Blizzard employees, all of whom spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to speak to press. Theyve told me about a canceled second expansion for Diablo III, and about Diablo IV, which is indeed in development but was rebooted in 2016. Theyve talked about the series popularity in China, which is one of the main reasons for Diablo Immortal s existence, and about how the specter of the canceled game Titan hangs over many of Blizzards decisions. Some of those people also raised questions about Activisions influence on the beloved video game company. Activision merged with the publisher Vivendi (at the time, Blizzards holding company) to become Activision Blizzard in 2008, but over the past decade Blizzard has prided itself in remaining a separate entity. With its own management structure and its own campus in Irvine, California, Blizzard has always stood out from Activisions other divisions and subsidiaries. (Activision HQ is based about an hour northwest, in Santa Monica.) Rather than sticking to strict production cycles that result in, say, annual Call of Duty games for Activision, Blizzard has traditionally given its developers as much time as possible. Thats one of the reasons the company has been renowned for making some of the greatest games in the world. This year, however, Blizzard employees say that one of the biggest ongoing conversations has been cutting costs. To fans, and even to some people who work or have worked at Blizzard, theres a concern that something deep within the companys culture may be changing. When reached for comment, Blizzard sent over an e-mailed statement, attributed to a company spokesperson, that well quote throughout this piece. Blizzard has been and continues to be a developer-driven company, the company said. All of the games we create represent ideas our game developers themselves are passionate about. This is as true for Diablo Immortal as it was for Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans, or Overwatch, or any game weve ever made. We believe that the best games to make are ones that our developers believe in. In late 2013 or perhaps early 2014, not long before the release of Reaper of Souls, Blizzard made an internal announcement that shocked the development team: Diablo III s second expansion was canceled. Team 3, the Blizzard department responsible for Diablo, hadnt done a ton of work on this second expansionthey were mostly focused on Reaper but it was planned as their next project. And now it wasnt happening. What they told the team was, Youve finished Reaper of Souls, its really good. But we think the best thing for the IP is to move to Diablo IV in whatever form thatll be, said one person who was there. The overall sense on the team, at least in my impression, was that there was a vote of no confidence from the executives. They thought Diablo III was a giant fuck-up. Had Diablo III really been a giant fuck-up? Sure, the highly anticipated action-RPG had launched in May 2012 to immediate catastrophe, as fans across the world tried to open up the game and found themselves unable to play thanks to the dreaded Error 37, a warning-turned-meme that popped up every time the game was inaccessible. There were other problems, too, like a brutal difficulty spike and the real-money auction house, which allowed players to buy and sell loot for cash, skewing Diablo III s item balance. Throughout 2012 and 2013, Blizzards Team 3 addressed many of these issues, overhauling the difficulty system and removing the auction house. Diablo III evolved into a beloved game, and with Reaper of Souls, which came out in March 2014, the team turned it into one of the most critically acclaimed action-RPGs out there. Why, then, would Blizzard cancel the second one? This is an excerpt from my upcoming book, BLOOD, SWEAT, AND PIXELS, which comes out on September 5 Read more Read A lot of people felt stunned by it, said the person who was there. I think a lot of them felt like, We made mistakes on Diablo III, but we learned and we made Reaper to show what we could do. We have fixed it, and Reaper s really good. I think a lot of people felt like wed figured it out and we know how to do this, and expansion two, whatever it wouldve been, wouldve been the highest expression of that To have them pull the plug without really seeing how Reaper did really stung. Its still not clear why Blizzard wouldnt want to support a game that had been so commercially successful, but the theory on Team 3 was that Blizzards management had lost faith in Diablo III and saw it as a failure, even before Reaper launched. The perception overall was that management thought, This team really screwed up, said one person who was there. They couldve held off a few months and seen how Reaper did, but in their mind [ Diablo III ] was irredeemable. (When Reaper launched on PC in late March, 2014, Blizzard said it sold 2.7 million copies in its first weeka big number, but only a fraction of the ~15 million copies that Diablo III had sold across PC and consoles.) When asked, Blizzard did not address the cancellation of this expansion, but as part of a broader statement, spoke about cancellations in general. As far as game cancellations, we see that as a strengtha reflection of our commitment to quality, and how weve always operated, a spokesperson said. Historically, weve launched about 50% of the total projects weve worked on over the past three decadesthose are the ones we consider representative of Blizzard quality. Not shipping a game is never an easy decision to make, but it has always been the right decision for us. Cancelling Titan led us to Overwatch, and as another example, cancelling Nomad led us to World of Warcraft. In March 2014, as fans celebrated the return of Diablo III with the triumphant Reaper of Souls, Team 3 was splitting up. Some developers left the company; others moved to different projects, like World of Warcraft or the nascent Overwatch. Some stuck around to work on patches for Diablo III, but Team 3 was no longer in full swing. At the point they had the strongest Diablo development team ever, they scattered them all to the winds, said one person who worked on Reaper of Souls. To those developers, it was a baffling move by Blizzards management. Giving the team more time to see how Reaper performed and how the second expansion was shaping up wouldve been much more Blizzard-like, that person said. Those who remained on Team 3 began talking about what Diablo IV might look like. Josh Mosqueira, the Canadian transplant who had started on the Diablo III console team before taking the franchises reins as director of Reaper of Souls, would lead development on the new project, which was code-named Hades. The goal was to take the franchise in a very different direction. Mosqueira and team designed Hades as a Diablo take on Dark Souls, according to three people familiar with the project. It would be a gothic, challenging dungeon crawler. Rather than maintain the isometric camera angle of the first three Diablo games, it would use an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective. It was such a departure from previous games, some at Blizzard thought they might not even end up calling it Diablo IV. From 2014 until 2016, it was Team 3s main project, developed alongside a handful of patches and light content updates for Diablo III. Then, like Diablo III s second expansion before it, Hades was canceled. As with any cancelation, there were likely many reasons for this move, but two people involved with Hades said it was going through rocky development. It was not shaping up at all, said one. In the middle of 2016, Mosqueira left Blizzard. Its not clear whether Mosqueira left because of Hades cancellation or if Hades was canceled because he left, but whats certain is that at that point, the project was shelved. (When reached by Kotaku, Mosqueira declined to comment on this story.) In the coming months, Blizzards Team 3 would do two things. The developers, who needed something to work on now that Hades was no more, put together downloadable content for Diablo III called Rise of the Necromancer, a character class add-on that the team hoped would satiate fans who were desperate for more Diablo. And some of them started working on a project code-named Fenris. Fenris is, all of our sources have confirmed, the current incarnation of Diablo IV. Blizzards Team 3 has been working on this version of the game since 2016, and some who have seen it say theyre optimistic about the direction. [Design director] Luis [Barriga] has a very strong vision for that game, said a former employee, one that a lot of people are excited about at Blizzard. They want to make [Diablo IV] gross, make it dark, [get rid of] anything that was considered cartoony in Diablo III. One key part of that vision is the art direction. During development of a game, many studios use what they call pillarsmantras that help define the games goals so that everyone on the team is on the same page. For Fenris, one of those pillars is simple: Embrace the darkness. Theres a lot of people who felt like Diablo III got away from what made Diablo Diablo in terms of art style and spell effects, said a current Blizzard employee, adding that Fenris is aiming to look more like the beloved Diablo II. Said another: They want to make this gross, make it dark, [get rid of] anything that was considered cartoony in Diablo III Make what people were afraid of in Diablo II, but modern. Fenris is still early in development, and likely wont be out until 2020 or later, so its safe to say that many decisions made by the team today will change over time. (We dont know if its PC-first or planned for simultaneous launch on PC and platforms, and in fact, the team may have not yet made that decision.) One ongoing conversation, for example, has been whether to keep the isometric camera angle or use the over-the-shoulder third-person view that was prototyped for Hades. Recent builds of the game have been isometric, like previous Diablo games, according to three people familiar with Fenris, but questions remain over whether that should change. Another pillar of Fenris is to make Diablo more social, taking inspiration from Destiny to add what one current Blizzard developer called light MMO elements, further drawing on Blizzards past massively multiplayer online success. Previous Diablo games have featured hub cities full of computer-controlled quest-givers and vendorsimagine if, while exploring those hubs, you could meet and group up with other players? And then what if you could go off and take on instanced dungeons with them, sort of like Destiny s strikes or World of Warcraft s instances? The question that kept getting asked is, If theres going to be a strike equivalent, where youre forced into a very story-focused, well-designed level of a dungeon, what does that look like in Diablo ? said one person familiar with the project. What if we still had a core Diablo game that just happened to have a bunch of people on the map to do other cool stuff? One lingering question is how Blizzard will monetize Fenris. Blizzards other big games, like Overwatch and Hearthstone, include ongoing revenue streams thanks to cosmetic microtransactions and card packs. With Diablo, Blizzard has not yet found a way to deliver that same sort of cash generator. (The companys always struggled as to how to have some sort of long-tail monetization for Diablo III, acknowledged one former employee.) From what weve heard, those decisions are still up in the air on Fenris, and may not be clear for a long time. Fenris is still earlyand all of these ideas may change or never make it to the final productbut with the fourth Diablo in active development, its hard not to wonder: Why wouldnt Blizzard just talk about it? The company has hinted at the games existence, insisting in blog posts and on live streams that it has multiple Diablo projects in the works, but using the words Diablo IV might have quelled much of the outrage over Diablo Immortal. Earlier this month, I reported that Blizzard had made a video for BlizzCon in which co-founder Allen Adham talked about Diablo IV. Blizzard later disputed that the video had been made for BlizzCon. In conversations since then, two sources told me that regardless of the companys statement, there had been plans throughout 2018 to announce the game this year. In January, they were still full set on, Were going to do this right, were going to have a playable demo, said one. By the time wed hit May, that game wasnt far enough along. Its normal problems. Things going slower than theyd like. By the summer, that person said, they were still under the impression that a tease was happening. I think its semantics If they changed their mind at any point, they can say, Oh, it wasnt scheduled. At least what we were told as a development team, it was supposed to get teased, that was always the intention. On the flip side, a current developer in a non- Diablo department who was involved in BlizzCon planning told me that to their knowledge, there was no Diablo IV announcement ever planned for the show. Plans or no plans, the Diablo IV announcement didnt happen. Heres one theory as to why: Blizzard is haunted by the specter of Titan. Titan was the code-name for a brand new MMO that Blizzard started developing around 2007. Envisioned as a cross between The Sims, Left 4 Dead, and Team Fortress 2, where youd run businesses during the day and turn into a superhero at night, Titan was meant to be a different twist on the genre that Blizzard had already mastered with World of Warcraft. (You can read more about Titan in our 2014 report on how it would have worked.) In the beginning of 2013, after a long and protracted development cycle, Blizzard canceled Titan. Part of the team went on to make Overwatch, which would become a big success, but the project became a black eye for Blizzarda massive sink of time and money that was also, much to some peoples dismay, public knowledge. Not only had they wasted resources on this failed gameeverybody knew about it. Blizzard had acknowledged the project in 2008, and its existence had been frequently hinted and asked about in the years that followed. So with Fenris fairly early in developmentand with the fourth Diablo already having gone through one big rebootits fair to wonder if the team was worried about another lengthy development cycle that might end in disaster. Even the words Diablo IV might have set expectations that the developers didnt want to establish just yet. The Diablo team is very paranoid about saying something too soon and then getting stuck in a loop, said one former Blizzard developer. They dont want to show the game until they have a trailer, a demo. Obviously Titan looms over all of us, said another former Blizzard developer. Despite Overwatch s emergence from Titan s ashes, the developer added, people dont look at Titan and see a success. Our preference is to have a clear announcement plan with some concrete details and hopefully a playable demo of the game when we announce. - Blizzard spokesperson I think theres a desire to announce stuff within a reasonably close proximity to when people are gonna get to play it, said a current Blizzard developer, pointing to the Titan and Blizzards other infamously canceled project, StarCraft: Ghost. [Those] just set people up for a lot of disappointment. In a statement, Blizzard confirmed as much. In terms of unannounced games, so much can change over the course of development based on how were feeling about the progress and direction of the project, the company said. So we try not to share details about unannounced projects before were ready. Our preference is to have a clear announcement plan with some concrete details and hopefully a playable demo of the game when we announce. That applies to our Diablo projects and our other games as well. Its also fair to wonder: Just how much has Titan affected Blizzards development process? Over the past few years weve seen Titan s seven to eight year cycle, Diablo III (which entered development in the early 2000s but was not released until 2012), and StarCraft II (2003 -&gt; 2010). Some veteran Blizzard developers have spent over 10 years on a single project, which has driven some of them to crave smaller, shorter games. Thats one of the reasons Blizzard now operates a secretive new departmentone that functions a little bit differently than its other divisions. In the days following BlizzCon 2018, as Diablo fans across the world raged about the announcement of Diablo Immortal and lack of news on Diablo IV, many of them wondered: Was Diablo Immortal s development detracting from other Diablo games? As it turns out, Diablo IV and Diablo Immortal are developed by different teams of people in different divisions. While the project known as Fenris is in production at Team 3, Diablo Immortal is partially developed by NetEase and partially made by a small group of Blizzard employees who work for one of the companys newest departments: incubation. In 2016, when Blizzard co-founder Allen Adham returned to the company, he announced that he was heading up that new department. Inspired by the massive success of the experimental card game Hearthstone (2014), this incubation department would help cultivate new creative projects for the company. It attracted some of Blizzards veteran developers, like Tom Chilton, who had been director of World of Warcraft for six years and a designer on the game for another six before that. (Now, Chilton is heading up a mobile game.) Another veteran designer who moved to incubation was Wyatt Cheng, who had worked on Diablo III for over a decade and wanted a break, according to two people who know him. Blizzard had partnered with a Chinese company called NetEase to publish Diablo III as a free-to-play game in China, where it was a big success. At some point in 2016 or 2017, the two companies decided to collaborate, putting together what would be called Diablo Immortal a Diablo game, with Cheng as lead designer, made only for phones. Essentially it exists because weve heard that China really wants it, said a current developer. It is really for China. Three Blizzard sources told me that the original plan for Diablo Immortal had been to release it only in China for a few months or maybe a year, in large part to test it out among Chinese fans before releasing it in the west. The quality bar in the Chinese market, especially for framerate, is extremely low, said one. You can release something thatd be considered alpha footage here and itd be a finished game there. Later, those sources said, Blizzard decided to take more time to polish the game and prepare it for a simultaneous global announcement and release. In a statement, Blizzard said that Diablo Immortal had been developed for both Western and Eastern markets but did not comment on whether the game was originally planned to launch in China first. One of our core values is think globally and our history has shown that we strive to make our games in as many languages as possible so more players can enjoy them, a spokesperson said. With that in mind, we quickly knew that we wanted to bring Diablo Immortal to the global audience. The cinematic trailer for Diablo Immortal is now one of the most downvoted videos on YouTube Diablo Immortal isnt the only mobile game in development at Blizzards incubation department, and although a skeptical fan might question the motivations behind these games, some current and former employees insist that these games are in development because Blizzards developers genuinely want to make them. There are lots of mobile game players at Blizzard, said a current developer. There are lots of people actually excited about mobile games. The reaction inside the company to Immortal is very different than the reaction outside the company. Part of the thinking on a lot of these is, people want to work on smaller projects. Smaller projects in mobile tend to make sense. For example, developers told me, quite a few people at Blizzard play Pokémon Go, the massively popular mobile game that lets you use your phones camera to catch wild creatures. As one developer explained, the iconic orc statue in the center of Blizzards campus is a Pokéstop, and staff wage war over who gets to control the landmark on a daily basis. The natural extension of that was for one of Blizzards incubation teams to develop a Warcraft version of Pokémon Go, which is in development for smartphones now. Surely it occurred to the decision-makers at Blizzard that this Warcraft spinoff could be a massive revenue generator, but the game is also in production because lead designer Cory Stockton (formerly of World of Warcraft ) is a huge fan of Pokémon. (People who have played the Warcraft mobile game say its also got a lot more to it than Pokémon Go, including single-player mechanics.) Perhaps its a win-win for Adham. With mobile games, Blizzard can please Activisions investors by appealing to burgeoning video game markets in China and India, and Blizzard can also satisfy its veteran developers by letting them work on smaller projects that they really want to make. The reality is, everything that is in incubation at Blizzard is in incubation because Allen Adham believed they were worthwhile, said another current developer. These mobile games might not appeal to as many of Blizzards hardcore fansthose who prefer to play games mainly on PCsbut they have appealed very much to the developers. Yet over the past year, Activisions influence on Blizzard has been very realand Blizzard staff say things are starting to feel a little different for the once autonomous company. In the spring of 2018, during Blizzards annual company-wide Battle Plan meeting, chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja spoke to all of the staff, according to two people who were there. In what came as a surprise to many, she told Blizzard that one of the companys goals for the coming year was to save money. This is the first year weve heard a priority being cutting costs and trying not to spend as much, said one person who was in the meeting. It was presented as, Dont spend money where it isnt necessary. Ahuja was new to Blizzard, having started as CFO that spring as a transplant from 3100 Ocean Park, the Santa Monica-based Activision headquarters where shed spent eight years working in the finance and investor relations departments. There was a perception among Blizzard staff that she had come in to clean up the spreadsheets, to save as much money as possible while at the same time bolstering Blizzards product output. (In a statement, Blizzard said, We actively recruited [Ahuja] and we chose her out of a large, very competitive, and highly-qualified set of candidates.) 2016s Overwatch had been a smash hit, but in 2017 and 2018 the company shipped very littlethere was a StarCraft remaster, a World of Warcraft expansion, and of course, patches and updates for other games. That was it. Traditionally, Blizzard has remained entirely separate from Activision, with its own quality standards and branding, to the point where they felt like two different companies. You might be able to find World of Warcraft easter eggs in StarCraft II, but youd never see an Overwatch character in Call of Duty. In recent years, however, thats changed. Blizzards digital store, Battle.net, now features Activision games like Destiny 2 and Call of Duty Black Ops 4. Bungie appeared on the BlizzCon 2018 stream to announce that Destiny 2 would be free temporarily. And theres been a perception among Blizzard developers that the two companies are growing more and more intertwined. As it turned out, 2018 would be a weak year for Activision. The publisher was unhappy with Destiny s performance and would take a major stock hit in November following fiscal third-quarter results that disappointed investors. One worrying trend for the bean-counters was the stagnancy of Blizzards MAUsmonthly active userswhich are seen as a pivotal metric for service games like Hearthstone and Overwatch. Throughout 2018, as Activision has told investors, those numbers have declined. Combined with Blizzards lack of new games, its easy to see why Activisions executives may have wanted to intervene. You wouldve thought Blizzard was going under and we had no money, said a former Blizzard staffer, who told me they left the company this year in part because of Activisions influence. The way every little thing was being scrutinized from a spend perspective. Thats obviously not the case. But this was the very first time I ever heard, We need to show growth. That was just so incredibly disheartening for me. Blizzard appears to be bolstering headcount for its development teamsone current developer said their team was encouraged to get biggerwhile cutting as many costs as possible elsewhere. Its a process that may not be done yet, as Activision seems to still be looking to boost Blizzards content output and release more games on a regular schedule. Ahujas comments in the spring of 2018 may have simply been the beginning. We are being told to spend less at every corner because we have no new IP, said one former developer. Because Overwatch set this bar of how much we could earn in a single year, theres a ton of pressure from Activision to get shit moving. They want something to show shareholders. (During an earnings call after Overwatch launched, Activision said it had brought in over a billion dollars in revenue.) Then, in October 2018, Blizzard lost its leader. Co-founder Mike Morhaime, the soft-spoken CEO who jovially addressed fans at every BlizzCon, said he was stepping down, to be replaced by veteran World of Warcraft producer J. Allen Brack. Allen Adham and chief development officer Ray Gresko also joined Blizzards executive management team, perhaps to help ensure that the studio would be helmed by game developers who lived and breathed Blizzard. It was a massive shake-up for Blizzard, and it came during a time when there were already questions about Activisions influences. Morhaime was widely beloved at the company. One former Blizzard developer described him as the anti-CEO. He doesnt care about profitability, that person said. He just wants employees to be happy, and he just wants to make good games and keep the community happy. Suddenly, there were whispers in hallways, concerns about future cost-cutting initiatives and furtive exchanges about what plans Activision CEO Bobby Kotick might have in mind for Blizzard. Theres a perception within Blizzard that finance is making more calls than they ever did in the past, said one person who left Blizzard recently. You never heard that three or four years ago. Cultural shifts arent always blatant. Anyone whos worked for a major corporation can attest to the invisible pressures that can emerge over time. Theres a temptation to cast Activision as the villain, said one current developer. I think the influences are far more subtle than that. Someone at Blizzard might make a decision with the best of intentions in mind, but if they subconsciously know that their corporate bosses at Activision want to cut costs and please investors, who knows how that might affect their judgement? With Activision and Blizzard growing less and less separate, what kind of overlaps will we see across their various divisions? These days, theres trepidation surrounding Blizzard, both externally and internally. Strange decisions surrounding the Diablo franchise have exacerbated that, and in fact, some who work or have worked at Blizzard believe that canceling Diablo III s second expansion was one of the companys biggest mistakes in recent years. Recalled one Blizzard veteran: I remember a lot of us looking at each other and saying, Man, if we had just done that second expansion instead of losing half the team as a result of the cancelation, and then all of the personnel changes, management changes, then this walk down the road of Hades If we hadnt done any of that and had just focused on doing a solid third act for Diablo, itd be out by now. There is a future for Diablo, one that isnt solely limited to mobile games. Diablo III may have wound down, but Diablo 4 is still in the works, despite the culture of secrecy that has prevented Blizzard from mentioning it by name. Theres no way to know what may happen to the project in the future, but right now, it exists. The big question is, what will Blizzard look like in two years? In five? How will corporate expectations and tensions impact what has been one of the most beloved companies in video games for nearly three decades? We may not know the answers until BlizzCon 2028.","On November 2, 2018, Blizzard closed its annual BlizzCon keynote by announcing, to scattered applause, a Diablo game for phones.

Heather Alexandra,"Overwatch, a team-based shooter about working together, isn’t always the friendliest of places. From random quitters to that one guy who won’t stop calling me a cuck, players often find ways to be toxic. To combat the issue, Blizzard is now banning players misbehaving on social media. In a developer update video yesterday, the game’s lead designer, Jeff Kaplan, outlined Blizzard’s effort to combat toxic players who can ruin the game with poor conduct and general douchebaggery. In the game’s earlier days, a confusing system for reporting players made it hard for players to call out bad behavior. The tone of multiplayer matches varies but turned more positive last year as Blizzard revised how they handled reported players. In yesterday’s video, Kaplan revealed another trick for policing the game: checking out YouTube. “We now proactively seek out social media sites like YouTube, for example and look for incidents of very toxic behavior and track down the accounts that are participating and action them often times before anyone’s even reported them,” Kaplan said. Kaplan did not specify which social media sites that Blizzard is patrolling to catch bad actors or give numbers for how toxic players the studio found from searching YouTube. Kotaku has reached out to Blizzard for details about the program. Even without the program, things might be improving. According to Kaplan, incidents of abusive chat in competitive matches dropped 17 percent while players’ reporting of poor behavior increased 20 percent. These changes came after the implementation the ability for console players to report unruly players. While it’s unclear how much of a difference the program will make, it’s definitely a little odd knowing that Big Brother Blizzard might be watching your YouTube uploads. In theory, there’s nothing to worry about so long as you’re not adding another video to your teabagging playlist but you might want to think again before shouting at Lucio to get on the damn point.","Overwatch, a team-based shooter about working together, isn’t always the friendliest of places.

Mahita Gajanan,"A “bomb cyclone” is approaching the central U.S. and is expected to bring blizzard conditions and strong winds to a major portion of the country.
Bomb cyclones occur when a quickly forming storm results in a drop in atmospheric pressure of at least 24 millibars.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned of a major winter storm ranging from the Central Rockies through the Plains. Severe blizzard conditions are expected across parts of Wyoming, western Nebraska, western South Dakota and northeast Colorado. Blizzard warnings were put into effect from northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming across western Nebraska and southwest South Dakota, according to NWS.
CNN reports 70 million people are in the path of the storm, with 45 million under a high wind threat, 10 million under winter storm threats and about 15 million facing a flood threat.
The storm, while more intense in its overall impact than other weather events that generally in hit mid-March, is not too unusual for this time of the year, says Matt Rinde, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather.
“These are early spring storms that really do show their hand in something like this quite often,” he says.
Here’s what to expect from the bomb cyclone.
Strong winds are surpassing 80 mph
Winds are predicted to blow between 50 and 70 miles per hour across the region, and heavy snow accumulating to at least 6 inches is likely in parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
In western Texas, New Mexico, parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, wind gusts are expected to exceed 60 miles per hour. Portions of western Texas have already seen winds between 70 and 80 miles per hour, with some even going beyond 80 mph, according to Rinde.
Strong winds are a hallmark of bomb cyclones, Rinde says, and he calls the scale of the one beginning to slam parts of the midwest “impressive.” Because the storm ranges across a wide swath of the U.S., the system’s impact will differ depending on where it hits.
“It’s a powerful storm system that when it starts to come together, strengthens very quickly,” Rinde says. “With severe weather on the southern side, blizzard conditions on the northern side, the concern for flooding, and then, the winds that are outside of the thunderstorms. It’s an impressive event from top to bottom.”
Heavy snow will cover the region
Widespread, heavy snows are expected between Wednesday and Thursday across the Central High Planes and Upper Mississippi Valley, according to NWS. Snow will blanket the areas where blizzard conditions are likely, such as parts of Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota. Freezing rain will also bring ice accumulation to impacted areas.
Travel plans impacted
Nearly 1,000 flights coming in and going out of Denver International Airport have been cancelled as of Wednesday morning, according to FlightAware. A blizzard warning is in effect for Denver.
Denver Public Schools cancelled classes due to the severe weather, the school district said in a tweet.
Southwest Airlines cancelled 411 flights, while SkyWest Airlines, headquartered in Utah, had cancelled 259 flights by Wednesday morning. United Airlines also cancelled 133 flights.
Rinde advises that travelers in the region give themselves as much extra time as they can and to avoid the storm, if possible.
“It’s better to be out of it,” he says.

Sam Machkovech,"Enlarge/ The kind of image that makes us immediately ask, ""What you wan'me kill?""

When we last spoke with Blizzard Entertainment about one of its biggest classics, the original Diablo, the chat came with a surprise announcement: the original PC game was now for sale online for the first time, and not on Battle.net. The game's launch on GOG prompted many technical and logistical questions, and after answering those, Blizzard confirmed an intriguing ""one more thing"" about the first two WarCraft RTS games also coming to GOG. At the time, these had no release date.
Turns out, the wait was surprisingly brief.
GOG and Blizzard have officially opened a veritable Dark Portal to the first-ever digital-download version of its first two PC RTS games, WarCraft: Orcs &amp; Humans and WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition (which includes that sequel's awesome expansion pack). Right now, you can buy both as a combo pack for $15, or buy them separately for $6 and $10, respectively. And we've played them!
GOG got axe for you
Taking it back to the days when Battle.net support required a full SKU update. 
Familiar RTS sights. Yes, you can walk on this ice, and the trolls in question won't slide around. (But they will constantly remind you that you are, indeed, the boss.) 
Post-mission taunting. (Lose one unit in battle, and they call you a slave... some nerve, Blizzard.) 
WC2's launcher, like the GOG launcher for Diablo 1, offers two versions of the EXE. The ""updated"" one includes this inset options menu for visual preferences. 
GOG's interface makes it easy to insert your newly acquired CD key, should you wish to look that info up before booting into the game. 
Trouble is, of course, that a mix of ancient netcode and port-opening requirements make this a less than ideal game to play online. 
But, hey, Battle.net still works for this game. 
Just like this month's Diablo re-launch, GOG has rebuilt WarCraft II's executable to run with modern operating systems and monitor resolutions in mind. Meaning: nothing has been remastered. Instead, players can expect ""integer scaling"" as an option for any monitor resolution they have so that the original artwork and sprites fall into a proper 4:3 ratio whether they appear in a window or full-screen mode. Other GOG-specific bonuses include optional anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering. (As with Diablo, I would advise WarCraft II players to ignore these pixel-blurring options, but if that's your jam, then by all means use them.)
The problem with this is the same as in Diablo: in many of the ""integer scaling"" modes, WC2 lets your mouse cursor float away if pushed against the right or bottom edges. This happens when you move the map around with your mouse, which is way more common in an RTS than in a Diablo game. I prefer moving an RTS map via the mouse instead of arrow keys, so this issue bums me out. The solution has been to pick the generic ""fullscreen"" option, which fixes the mouse-boundary issue but adds much blurrier pixels (and messes up my Windows desktop once the game quits out). I've asked GOG for help with this issue and will update this section with any pointers they send.
Additionally, GOG's version of WC2 includes a ""vanilla"" binary without many of the modern display adaptations. The reason is that this version includes Battle.net support, which requires leaving the executable in its ancient 2.02 state. Just like the 1999 launch of this game's ""Battle.net edition,"" it requires a valid CD key, which GOG packs into your purchase. (GOG's version of Diablo doesn't require this.) And, yep, Blizzard's WC2 servers are still alive and kickin'.
But once again, GOG has loosed a ""Battle.net"" game of old that requires a stomach-turning combination: you have to open specific ports on both your PC and your router, and you have to subject your machine to some pretty ancient netcode. As Ars' Peter Bright said last time around: ""Running this game and opening up your network to it is going to make it extraordinarily easy to hack your computer. We have built numerous safeguards over the last 15 years to try to reduce the risks of exploitable network code, and this game removes all of them."" (Click here to read the full screed.)
In good news, you can either directly connect to other computers on your LAN or fake a LAN connection by using a VPN program like Hamachi and loading an old-school online IPX session to play eight-player WarCraft II versus matches.
Bombs are great!
The original WarCraft means we're going back to DOS, baby. (Or, technically, DOSBox, a DOS emulator.) 
Gearing up to launch the orc campaign. 
Blizzard's art for the first game still looks pretty great, all things considered. But it's a pain in the butt to actually play. 
Meanwhile, the original WarCraft has been repackaged to boot into a DOSBox emulation session, essentially running DOS 3.1.1 within your OS of choice. And, you know, it works in that funky-but-functional DOSBox way. (Thanks to this DOSBox support, WC1 works in both Windows and MacOS; WC2 with its customized binaries sticks to a Windows-only release on GOG.)
But I have a hard time recommending WarCraft: Orcs &amp; Humans as anything other than a historic relic. This game saw Blizzard boldly dipping its toes into the nascent real-time strategy universe, which meant dealing with early '90s expectations that anything outside of slow, rigid, turn-based tactics was ""too fast."" The result is a painfully ponderous experience in desperate need of quality-of-life fixes across the board.
WC2 wasn't just a ""WarCraft but slightly better"" kind of sequel. It was the true fulfillment of the original game's potentialfirst on a mechanical level, then supercharged with incredible pixel art, sound design, and army balance. It's a no-brainer recommendation for every proud mouse-and-keyboard gamer in the world, from the wistful and nostalgic to the RTS-clueless, because its early take on the genre combines slower speeds with good ideas and an endearing, fresh-faced universe. There's a reason WarCraft was embraced as its own world of characters and lore, as opposed to laughed off as a Tolkien rip-off, and WC2 is the primary source of that reputation.
If you want to open your wallet to GOG and Blizzard today and dive into a DRM-free WarCraft game, skip the bundle and grab the $10 WC2 package. Its massive single-player campaign, boosted by the critically acclaimed Beyond the Dark Portal expansion pack, will keep you (or an excited kiddo) busy for fifty quintillion hours, give or take. And since it's DRM-free and the CD key is only required for the vanilla Battle.net mode (which, again, we don't necessarily recommend), you might find a way to get your paid copy of the game onto a second computer and boot some satisfying IPX-based versus combat. (Every parent who reads Ars Technica should do this with their kids. It's the responsible thing to do.)These are the remaining two games GOG and Blizzard teased earlier this month during Diablo's GOG launch.

David Lumb,"The most obvious change will be the card shift. The sets from 2016 -- Whispers of the Old Gods, One Night in Karazhan and Mean Streets of Gadgetzan -- will all pass out of Standard format to make way for the new expansion. This is has traditionally been the best time of year for new players to jump in the game, since it has the least amount of cards in play, but the switchover also refreshes the meta of competitive decks and strategies. While this year's three sets are still shrouded in mystery, they will all have free single-player adventure content -- hopefully they'll be as inventive and enjoyable as the Arena-like Dungeon Run that came with the most recent expansion Kobolds &amp; Catacombs. But 2016's cards won't be the only ones joining the Wild format. Three old favorites will be added to the Hall of Fame, the honorific category Hearthstone' s team created last year to retire cards from the previously-immune Classic set that launched with the game. 2017's entries included fan-favorites like Ragnaros the Firelord, Sylvanas Windrunner and Azure Drake, which Blizzard put out to pasture for being auto-includes in most decks that were also becoming too difficult to design around. This year's Hall of Fame slate is much the same: Ice Block and Coldlight Oracle are both being retired for defining decks for years. Curiously, Molten Giant is also getting Hall of Fame'd with his 5-mana nerf reverted to its original cost; The Hearthstone team might be doing this as a gift for veteran fans to resurrect old decks in Wild. If you own any of these cards, you'll get a full dust reward as if you'd disenchanted them -- which can result in some free dust if you manage to craft them beforehand and dismantle them after, as this guide explains. The new year and next set will probably bring back casual and absent players curious about the next smattering of cards, but those who have been away for awhile will have to play catch-up on expansions and strategies they missed out on. To get over that 'homework hump,' Hearthstone is handing out a new Druid hero portrait for free (much like they did for 2017's first new set ). Players will earn Lunara, the gleeful dryad that Heroes of the Storm fans will recognize, after winning 10 games in the Standard format. The most exciting change won't be new cards or content, but the ability for any player to create their own tournament within the game client. Just set up the rules and hit 'launch' -- Hearthstone will matchmake and check decks to make sure they fit your bonkers theme (Lorewalker Cho + Faceless Manipulator + Mirage Caller, let's go). The beta will come later this year at an undetermined time, so in all likelihood, don't expect it alongside the first expansion. Finally, the new year will bring more international stops for the 2018 Hearthstone Championship Tour, which the Hearthstone team announced beforehand. Check up their blog post to see the new schedule. That's all we know about the Year of the Raven thus far, but fans should keep an eye out for news of 2018's first expansion that's likely to drop in the coming weeks.","Blizzard has solidified Hearthstone' s annual flow of retiring old cards and welcoming new ones: For the third year in a row, a new expansion will come in April that signals a sea change in the digital card game.

Jason Schreier,"When Blizzards sole Diablo announcement at this years BlizzCon turned out to be a game for phones, it set off a firestorm of angry reactions from fans who had hoped for a new Diablo on PC. As it turns out, Kotaku has learned, Blizzard had originally planned to tease Diablo 4, but pulled those plans at the last minute. The original plan for BlizzCon 2018, according to two people familiar with Blizzards plans, was for Blizzard to announce the mobile game Diablo Immortal and then end on a video in which company co-founder Allen Adham told the audience that a proper Diablo 4 was in development but not ready to show just yet. Instead, at last Fridays keynote, Blizzard revealed Diablo Immortal to a quiet, uncomfortable crowd and then ended the show. For most of the weekend, Diablo fans raged online as a result, expressing their anger on YouTube and various forums. There were a few reasons for the controversy, but the driving factor was that the companys sole Diablo announcement was a game that appeared to be made for a very different audience than hardcore Diablo fans. The reactions could have been very different. Blizzard changed its BlizzCon plans for Diablo at some point in the last couple of weeks, those people familiar with goings-on at Blizzard said. One of those people told me that the Diablo team wasnt yet ready to commit to an announcement, as Diablo 4 has changed drastically over the past four years and may continue to change further. (Weve heard its gone through at least two different iterations under different directors.) Blizzard said it did not immediately have comment on this story. On October 17, two weeks before BlizzCon, Blizzard put out a blog post that essentially told fans Diablo 4 was in the works but would not be at the show. These are very exciting timeswe currently have multiple teams working on different Diablo projects and we cant wait to tell you all about them... when the time is right, the company said. We know what many of you are hoping for and we can only say that good things come to those who wait, but evil things often take longer. Despite that, sources said, Blizzard was still looking to assure fans that Diablo 4 was in development, until those plans changed. Diablo III launched in May 2012, and its first and only expansion, Reaper of Souls, followed in March 2014. Since then, new updates have been scarce, with an occasional new content patch arriving sporadically and a Necromancer character pack hitting in 2017. Last Friday, Diablo III also came to the Nintendo Switch. And now theres Diablo Immortal, which is still in development for smartphones. Blizzard has assured fans publicly that it has multiple Diablo games in development. One of them is the game that fans are waiting for, and it was nearly announced last week.","When Blizzard’s sole Diablo announcement at this year’s BlizzCon turned out to be a game for phones, it set off a firestorm of angry reactions from fans who had hoped for a new Diablo on PC.

Aric Jenkins,"A third Nor’easter in the past two weeks is headed up the East Coast with New England square in its path for a potential blizzard. Other states should receive snow as well from the developing system known as Winter Storm Skylar. The storm system, which was dumping snow on the Appalachian region as of Monday afternoon, according to Weather.com, will reach the Northeast by Tuesday morning and place a number of states under winter storm warnings and blizzard watches. Skylar is expected to experience rapid intensification due to the weather phenomenon known as bombogenesis, combining high winds with heavy snow in parts of New England. “This event will be a little colder, confining the heavier, wetter snow to coastal areas, where winds gusting to 40-50 mph will lead to power outages, and possible blizzard or near blizzard conditions,” Weather Channel meteorologist Carl Parker said in a statement to TIME. “At least several inches are expected from upstate New York through New England, with as much as a foot or more in the higher terrain, in southeastern Massachusetts, and through much of Maine. Minor to moderate coastal flooding is expected in coastal New England during Tuesday morning’s high tide,” he added. Here is the winter storm snow forecast for specific locations throughout New England, New York state, and New Jersey. Boston, Massachusetts Boston is expected to receive a significant amount of snow, with the latest forecast calling for up to 8 to 12 inches, according to Weather.com. Despite the heavy snowfall, the city’s downtown is not under a blizzard warning but in the most southeastern parts of the state, such as Cape Cod, a foot to 18 inches is predicted and the region is under blizzard watch. New York City Farther south down the East Coast, the snowfall is not expected to be as heavy. New York City should receive a coating, Weather.com predicts, but likely just around an inch or less. Cities upstate, though, will receive a heavier amount. Albany and Syracuse could accumulate at least 5 to 6 inches of snow. Long Island, New York Sections of Long Island closest to New York City will see little accumulation, but the snowfall increases farther to the east. The majority of the island should receive around 3 to 5 inches, according to forecasters, but towns closer to the Atlantic Ocean could get closer to 5 to 8. New Jersey The Garden State shouldn’t be too overwhelmed by Winter Storm Skylar. Northern and eastern parts of New Jersey should get around 1 to 3 inches of powder, and Central New Jersey could receive an inch or less. South Jersey, however, especially near Philadelphia, is predicted to remain totally snow-free, according to Weather.com forecasters.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind. Earther can’t really give you any insights into our big button boy’s mindset on the nuclear front, but we’ve got you covered when it comes to this bomb cyclone thing that’s about to “ blast the East Coast.” Snow is falling in northern Florida thanks to moist air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with the frigid cold hanging over the eastern U.S. The impending storm will get really organized and march up toward the Mid-Atlantic this evening, where there are rare blizzard watches already in effect. By late tonight or early tomorrow, snow, storm surge, and powerful winds will smack the Northeast. Along the way, this extratropical cyclone will undergo “explosive bombogenesis.” Or, in less nerdy terms, it will bomb out. And that has got people on edge. You’ve probably seen the Washington Post tweet that sparked the whole bomb cyclone freakout (it is a Very Good Tweet): In some ways, the freakout is warranted. This is shaping up to be a massive, dangerous storm that could fell records and cause widespread power outages. Snow in Florida is really, deeply weird and wrong. The cold air rushing in after the storm passes could be deadly. But let’s step back for a sec and talk about what’s actually going on. In simple terms, bombogenesis describes what happens when a storm’s central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The lower the pressure, the more intense the storm. Those types of rapid drops can happen in hurricanes, but only extratropical cyclones—storms that have cold air at their core—technically qualify as bomb cyclones. That means you generally only get weather bombs in winter, and often in coastal areas where cold land meets relatively warm ocean water. The bigger the difference between warm and cold air masses, the bigger the potential for bombogenesis. “The contrast between the warm and cold air gives you an indication of the energy available to intensify an extratropical cyclone,” Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, told Earther. “In this case, large contrasts in temperature between Arctic air currently over the Northeast and warm Atlantic waters suggest the potential for an intense cyclone.” This week’s bomb storm could see pressure drop an unbelievable 45 millibars in 24 hours, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration model ensemble. It’s forecast to bottom out around 950 millibars, a central pressure typically associated with Category 3 hurricanes (though this storm will not bring Category 3 winds). While this storm could be one for the record books, storms bombing out isn’t that rare. Jonathan Martin, a meteorology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told BuzzFeed that you can expect about 10 of these types of storms across the northern hemisphere in any given winter. In the Northeast, many storms that bomb out take the form of nor’easters, winter storms that have their strongest winds out of the northeast. In Europe, they’re usually wind storms. Elsewhere like the Bering Sea, they’re just really nasty storms. Scientists have been throwing around some combination of the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather”,and “climatological” since the 1940s. They somewhat entered the mainstream lexicon in 1980. That year, MIT professors Fred Sanders and John Gyakumpublished the amazingly-titled study “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb.’” It’s one of the first papers to deconstruct the process of bombogenesis. Sanders attributes the focus on rapidly dropping pressure in storms to Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who also gave us our working theory of how precipitation forms in the 1930s. So, this whole cyclone bomb thing has been a known quantity for a while. That doesn’t mean this storm won’t be bad, or that you shouldn’t be prepared for power outages, especially considering the bone-rattling cold that will follow. But make sure to allocate your freakout between meteorological and existential threats accordingly.",Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind.

Ethan Gach,"Heroes of the Storm ’s game director says Blizzard is looking into one of the game’s streamers frivolously reporting teammates after losing a match. While broadcasting earlier this week, streamer Alexander “Stalk” Melder appeared to issue reports against the other four members of his Heroes of the Storm team after losing. Melder was a pro player on teams like Epsilon eSports and GoogleIshetZont before becoming a streamer (he still occasionally competes in the lower tiers of the game, most recently as part of Always Lucky ) and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “It’s unacceptable to falsely report players,” Blizzard’s Alan Dabiri wrote in a recent Reddit thread on the topic created by one of the reported players. “We’ve made some changes to catch the most egregious abusers of the reporting system, but we’ll keep working to improve the system.” He added that this particular incident is being looked into and “appropriate action” will be taken. “As a warning to others, we’ll take action against your account if you abuse the reporting system.” Melder’s behavior is similar to another instance a couple years ago when, in a fit of rage, a streamer known Konus reported a teammate, claiming they abused the chat simply because a match was going poorly. Most online games have some system in place to try to sanction poor sportsmanship or abusive behavior, but it’s notoriously hard to separate out the genuine reports from ones that are simply trolling. Heroes in particular has a problem with players abusing its reporting system, as well as other toxic behaviors. It’s not unusual either for other players to harass one another using team chat or to try to throw matches by helping the enemy team if they’re particularly frustrated. That’s what happened with Maksym “Mopsio” Szczypa of the pro team Zealots who was caught last fall purposely trying to throw a match to spite the people he was playing with during a random match. A large outcry on social media forced Blizzard to respond to the issue, who eventually issued a seven day ban against the player, but it showed just how hard it can be to monitor matches for toxic behavior. Earlier this year in Overwatch, another of Blizzard’s competitive games, developers announced their intentions to monitor YouTube and other places for specific instances of toxic behavior that could be used to proactively censure players in the game. The community around Heroes is much smaller, but its report system has similarly been found wanting, with players criticizing it for either being too easy to exploit or not punitive enough in legitimate instances. “We generally don’t discuss actions related to individual players,” said a Blizzard spokesperson when Kotaku reached out for further clarification on the case. “But it’s worth noting that abusing the reporting system is considered against our code of conduct (available here ), and we will take action against players who we find to be violating our policies.”",Heroes of the Storm ’s game director says Blizzard is looking into one of the game’s streamers frivolously reporting teammates after losing a match.

According to Blizzard, the version of Diablo thats coming to GOG will be an authentic Diablo experience allowing players to play the game as it was in 1996, with period-appropriate 20 FPS SVGA graphics, and old-school Battle.net matchmaking. GOG offers two versions of its game one the classic build which allows you to take advantage of the aforementioned features, and one tweaked to run well on Windows 10 PCs.

 Diablo (@Diablo) March 7, 2019
Its curious to see Blizzard release this so casually this feels like what was supposed to have been announced at the end of the last Blizzcon, rather than that lackluster showing of Diablo Immortal. This is definitely worthy of that Oh, and one more thing moment in a big show, rather than a casual Thursday press release. The company also announced GOG would later get Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft 2, also the first time those two games have been made available digitally.
But if nothing else, its a good example of how a game developer can give fans a classic game, updated for the new generation, without having to remaster it with fresh graphics or features.
For those who dont know, the question of preserving authenticity in older games is a thorny one. Recent debates between game makers and gaming historians have gone as far as the Library of Congress. While preservationists have argued that games should be kept, to whatever degree is possible, intact in their original state, game developers have countered theyre keeping older games alive through remasters.
The Librarian has since offered a compromise, stating that gaming archivists can preserve the games, but only under the circumstance that they acquire a games server code legally. Archivists, speaking to Motherboard, warned that this is not likely to happen in the vast majority of cases, as the original server code is rarely saved or archived.
So that means, in the case of many classic games, it falls to the developers themselves to preserve the games in their original forms. And Blizzard is now showing that its entirely possible with this re-release of the original version of Diablo. New generations can experience the original release exactly as their predecessors did.

Joshua Calixto,"New Hearthstone expansions come out all the time, but it’s fairly rare for the base experience of the game to change outside of that. Earlier this week, Blizzard announced a few changes—including some new cards and tweaks to the ranked ladder system—that set the tone for how the game will evolve in the future. These changes should help ease new players into the competitive experience. The first of these changes is a batch of four new cards that will be added to the Classic set, Hearthstone ’s base set of collectible cards that can be used in all modes of play. These cards are meant to replace cards that were removed from the game’s Standard mode for being too powerful—a practice that Blizzard first began in early 2017. While the new cards aren’t exactly powerhouses, they help to define the identity of each class for new players. This is not typical; while Blizzard has introduced special new cards for the game’s Arena mode and tweaked the power levels of cards in the original sets, they haven’t added new cards to the Classic batch this way. Three of the cards are one-mana spells that add a random card to your hand. The Mage spell Tome of Intellect adds a random Mage spell to your hand; the Warlock spell Call of the Void adds a random Demon to your hand; and the Rogue spell Pilfer adds a random card from the opponent’s class to your hand. The fourth announced card, Icicle, is a Mage spell that deals two damage to a minion for two mana and draws a card if the minion is frozen. Two-mana deal two isn’t great, but the added benefit means this card might see play in more freeze-heavy decks. On top of these changes, Blizzard is changing the way Hearthstone ’s ranked system works for new players. Where players typically start at rank 25 and climb their way up from there, Blizzard is adding 25 more ranks so that new players start on the ladder at rank 50. This means that players who are new to ranked play will be able to face off against players who are closer to their skill level, which should make things much less frustrating for folks with lackluster card collections. Once you hit rank 25, you’ll never have to climb your way up from rank 50 again, so there’s nothing to worry about for players who are concerned that their rank might drop significantly at the end of a season.","New Hearthstone expansions come out all the time, but it’s fairly rare for the base experience of the game to change outside of that.

Nathan Grayson,"Overwatch already has one map set in Egypt, but fan Joshua llorente has made a very good case for the addition of another. llorente spent two months creating his own Cairo map from scratch in Epic’s Unreal Engine. “All assets including textures and models are created by me,” he said on Reddit. “No downloaded content.” It’s a sight to behold, so behold it. On its surface, the map looks like it has all the makings of a chill evening stroll, but look closer and you’ll see a labyrinth of alleys and side paths—paradise for a good Tracer or anyone else who likes to dart in, make war, and then peace out. The map’s been getting lots of praise on sites like Reddit and YouTube. “Why. Are. You. Not. At. Blizzard,” asked YouTube commenter Johnny Terraform. “YES PLEASE! THIS is what Egypt really looks like. A beautiful mixture of Islamic and ancient Egyptian architecture with modern touches here and there,” wrote Reddit user ABowlofMeatballs. “Source: I am Egyptian.” Cairo is the culmination of llorente’s Overwatch -themed map work so far, which also includes an impressive Favela map. Right now, llorente is wrapping up his college thesis, and while he’d be happy to work at Blizzard, he’s keeping things realistic. “ I still need to learn a lot,” he wrote in response to people saying Blizzard should hire him. “ I think I’ll gather first some experience here in our local game dev industry. And maybe in the future I’ll try to apply there.”","Overwatch already has one map set in Egypt, but fan Joshua llorente has made a very good case for the addition of another.

Andrew Webster,"One of the world’s most enduring game is getting a high-level professional league for its top players. At the Game Awards this evening, Wizards of the Coast revealed a new e-sports initiative that covers both the physical version of Magic: The Gathering, as well as the PC iteration, Arena. The competitions will include a combined $10 million in prizes. At the core of this new venture is the Magic Pro League, which will include 32 of the world’s best players, competing in a series of weekly match-ups as well as major tournaments, called Mythic Championships. Each MPL player will receive a $75,000 contract in addition to the opportunity to earn prize money. The first major MPL tournament will take place at PAX East in Boston next year, and will feature a $1 million prize purse. Photo courtesy Supercell. The Clash Royale League World Championship in Tokyo. High-level Magic competition has existed for some time, of course, but this new initiative represents a more concerted effort as WOTC looks to break into the increasingly lucrative e-sports space. “We built our system to invite and support pro e-sports team involvement,” Elaine Chase, Magic’s VP of e-sports, tells The Verge. For those looking to join the MPL, WOTC says it will be revealing details on how players can join the league early next year. “We have major aspirations for this new venture.” Competitive card games are steadily becoming a much bigger part of competitive gaming. Last month Blizzard revealed that it had paid out $2.8 million in prizes to Hearthstone players, with $4 million earmarked for 2019. Clash Royale, meanwhile, recently wrapped up the global finals of its ambitious professional league with a big match in Tokyo. And there will likely be a new player in the space as well, as Dota 2 developer Valve just released its own digital card game Artifact. As for Magic, while the new league is slated for this year, the developer says it has long-term ambitions. “We have the 2019 year planned out now and will adjust and learn as we move forward,” Chase explains. “We have major aspirations for this new venture and you can expect the excitement to continue throughout 2019 and well into the future.”","At The Game Awards, Wizards of the Coast revealed a new professional esports league for Magic: The Gathering, which will include the world’s best players and $10 million in prizes.",2018-12-07T03:47:14Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Magic: The Gathering is getting a pro league with $10 million in prizes,https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128822/magic-mtg-gathering-esports-pro-league-prizes-game-awards-2018,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymBsUVPfbqCTH27ZU9beuVm9ONs=/0x38:1920x1043/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13606190/Image1_Boros.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,blizzard,1
Sam Machkovech,"5 Announcements of a brand-new, smartphone-only Diablo and a remastered WarCraft 3 headlined a news-filled BlizzCon keynote presentation on Friday. The talk focused on games across Blizzard Entertainment's portfolioalong with a huge freebie from its corporate siblings at Bungie. Starting today, that developers Destiny 2 is now free to claim on Windows 10 PCs. Anyone who logs into Battle.net on or before November 18 can claim that game's vanilla version at this site and keep it for free. (Should you create an entirely new Battle.net account on or after November 2, you'll need to attach SMS authentication to your account to claim that copyassumedly to prevent a slew of spam accounts claiming free Destiny 2 accounts.) That version includes quite a bit of content that can be played with all other owners of the PC version, though at this point, it's effectively an elaborate demo for the game's more recent expansion packs. Enlarge / Diablo Immortal 's control scheme on smartphone. Blizzard's previous promises of ""multiple Diablo projects"" bore fruit during the keynote with the announcement of Diablo Immortal, a ""full-fledged action-RPG you can play everywhere with everyone."" This game, set between the events of Diablo II and Diablo III, is credited to developer NetEase Games, a company that primarily handles online game management of Blizzard's classic series in China on top of also making its own titles. Reveal footage of the game confirmed a pretty busy interface of touchscreen buttons that mobile players will use to manage abilities and items. That interface, seen above, may look bonkers to Diablo's PC faithful, but looks somewhat reserved compared to mega-popular mobile games like PUBG and Fortnite. Pre-registration links are already live at Google Play, and the game's listing confirms the game's inclusion of six familiar-sounding character classes (Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, and Wizard) who can join forces in online co-op dungeon-crawling. (An iOS version of the game was also announced, though no iOS listing for the game yet exists.) Blizzard did not announce information about the game's pricing structure or release window. WarCraft 3: Reforged trailer The Blizzard Classic line of video games grew one bigger on Friday with the announcement of WarCraft 3: Reforged, a 4K-minded recreation of the RTS classic slated to launch in 2019. A video presentation confirmed a top-to-bottom remake of the game's 3D assets, though the announcement didn't mention significant changes or overhauls to the campaign mode, online options, ranked ladders, orcrucially for a game like WarCraft 3 mod support. Even though it lacks a release date, the game can already be pre-bought for $30. Fans can pay an additional $10 for WarCraft-related unlocks in other Blizzard games in the meantime.

Nathan Grayson,"Aspiring video game map maker Shua Llorente had no idea what he was getting himself into when, in June, he released a video of his mockup of a Busan map for Overwatch. The video pulled in over 150,000 views thanks to just how much it felt like an actual Overwatch take on the real Korean city. This month, Blizzard surprise-revealed its own Busan map. People have questions. The comments of Llorente’s video are now a deluge of questions: How does he feel about Blizzard’s map? Did he work on it? Or, more nefariously, did Blizzard rip him off? People are hitting him up with similar questions on Twitter, to which he has not replied. Others are outright making accusations that Blizzard copied the map. There are some pretty undeniable visual similarities between Llorente’s Busan and the city portion of Blizzard’s map. Both have narrow streets, colorful signage, futuristic architecture that still feels faithful to the real-life location, and even gaming spaces. Here’s Llorente’s video: And here’s Blizzard’s Busan trailer: Llorente has created a whole series of Overwatch -inspired maps in Unreal Engine 4, and his Cairo map even caught the eye of professional proud papa and hobbyist Overwatch director Jeff Kaplan, who wrote Llorente back in January, “Amazing work! We’ll be in touch.” So it makes sense that people would wonder if Llorente had something to do with Overwatch ’s latest map. According to Llorente, Kaplan and co were not in touch with him for Busan. Llorente also doesn’t think they used his map as a point of reference for theirs. “I don’t think Blizzard was inspired by my map,” he told Kotaku in an email, “since I’m the one who was inspired by their environments, and I’m the one who uses their map as a guide in creating my own maps.” He also noted that “a lot” of people have been asking if he was involved in the map’s creation. Kotaku reached out to Blizzard to ask if the official Busan map was inspired by Llorente’s take on the idea, but as of publishing, the developer had yet to respond. For now, Llorente is mostly just happy that an official Busan map exists. “I really like the Busan map from Overwatch, since I love the Korean culture,” he said. “I think their environment team really captured the feel and look of the traditional and futuristic Busan.” When asked if there was anything he’d change about Blizzard’s map, Llorente said, “Visually, the Busan map is already perfect, and I don’t think any changes would be necessary.”","Aspiring video game map maker Shua Llorente had no idea what he was getting himself into when, in June, he released a video of his mockup of a Busan map for Overwatch.

Nathan Grayson,"When World of Warcraft first came out, it meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Now that WoW Classic ’s been announced, that’s become a problem—one that’s forced Blizzard to step in and pry people’s figurative hands off other people’s figurative throats. The central argument centers around how much current WoW people want in their WoW Classic. Some players are open to the idea of the game’s current balance and graphical techniques seeping into old-school WoW ’s beloved but cracked foundation, while purists argue that Classic should represent the vanilla experience exactly as it was, annoyances and all, because that makes progress more rewarding in the end. Many discussions on the official WoW Classic forums have turned into heated arguments. One thread about class balancing—that is, revamping old classes to make them less specialized and more broadly capable— got locked by Blizzard after things got out of hand. “We do not want players on our forums attacking each other left and right. People are free to have their opinions, on both sides of these arguments, and we will be following them closely,” wrote Blizzard community manager Bret “Ornyx” Forbus. “We will not, however, play into the hands of people directing their followers to make attacks against our community or otherwise conflagrate the community we have on these forums.” As of now, Forbus wrote, it seems like the majority of potential players are against class balance, something Blizzard will be taking into account as it irons out its vision for Classic servers. Since then, however, other threads discussing the pros and cons of everything from more convenient travel options to threat management options for tanks have popped up, some more civil than others. Kotaku reached out to Vaelanor, lead GM of the unofficial WoW legacy server Light’s Hope (and, before that, Elysium, which lost most of its staffers after a major scandal ), to ask why, in the days following Blizzard’s simple announcement of Classic, things have already reached a boiling point. “Passion,” he said over Discord. “The purists have been fighting to get Blizzard to re-release Vanilla for 12 years. Most of us have dreamed of, fought for, and cried over being told this was happening. It’s this passion that overwhelms many and prevents them from having a level-headed conversation over why a change isn’t a good idea.” While WoW Classic is still an undefined quantity, this situation has been revealing in one concrete way: it’s become clear that, no matter what, Blizzard’s official take on the legacy server idea, won’t be able to please everyone. Vaelanor knows this from personal experience, having made changes to popular unofficial legacy servers, only to see some players get up in burly, green orc arms. As a result, he thinks it’s possible that unofficial legacy servers like Light’s Hope will stick around even after Classic comes out. “Some people will feel WoW Classic wasn’t good enough,” he said. “Every legacy player has a line in the sand. If Blizzard cross enough of those lines then yes, there will be a demand from the community for unofficial legacy servers that stick more true to Vanilla.” Vaelanor, though, is planning to get out of the legacy game as soon as WoW Classic launches, regardless of its quality. Right now, he just wants to see everybody be constructive, rather than combative. More craft, less war. “I’d like to openly appeal to all members of the WoW family to be kinder to each other,” he said. “Whether you’re a purist or an enthusiast, you’re still a WoW lover. We must be able to have conversations about things that we care about without devolving into insulting each other just because we don’t agree.”","When World of Warcraft first came out, it meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

Gita Jackson,"Blizzard is releasing a special Mercy skin where all the proceeds go to breast cancer research. Fans are in love with it, and have been drawing it non-stop. This skin is part of a breast cancer awareness charity event that Blizzard is running through May 21st. Although there’s also a t-shirt, new sprays and charity streams, the fanbase is most excited for this brand new, pink Mercy skin. If you buy it, all of the proceeds go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. It’s awesome to see cancer survivors, their relatives and people enthusiastic about the cause throw in their support by drawing this skin: Some people also like the skin because it’s incredibly cute. I mean, look at it. Mercy looks straight out of an anime. Some fans even think this outfit would look good on some other characters. Honestly, I think this is a great look for Solder 76, and I’d like to see it on other characters, likeAna, Zarya or Sombra. The coolest thing would be if Blizzard made a charity skin for all the characters, as breast cancer is a disease that can affect all women, and sometimes men as well. I can’t be mad about pink Mercy, though. Call me when there’s cosplay.","Blizzard is releasing a special Mercy skin where all the proceeds go to breast cancer research.

Jason Schreier,"Why was the Diablo Immortal backlash so severe? Why didnt Blizzard see it coming? Today on Kotaku Splitscreen, we discuss. Kotaku s Maddy Myers returns to the show this week, joining me and Kirk to chat about last weeks big Diablo disaster. First we talk about some of the games weve been playing, including Assassins Creed Origins, Return of the Obra Dinn, and Red Dead 2. Then we get into the news of the week on Nintendo removing a racist animation from the new Smash, BlizzCon announcements, and the big Diablo controversy. We talk about why Diablo Immortal frustrated fans and offer some theories as to why marketing is such a large part of video game culture. Finally, off-topic talk and Kirks Music Pick Of The Week. Listen here: Get the MP3 right here, or read an excerpt: Jason: I can promise everybody that Diablo 4 is in development. I have talked to many people who have worked on it, or seen it, or played it. The game is being made right now. Thats not to say the game wont be canceled, because we have no idea whats going to happen in the coming years, but the game is in development. So to the people who freaked out, and many many people freaked out about Diablo Immortal, thinking it was going to replace Diablo 4, dont freak out any longer. So yes, there was a lot of fan backlash to Diablo Immortal, for many, many reasons. Everybody saw that guy who got on line at the Diablo Q&amp;A afterward and asked, Is this an off-season April Fools joke? Everybody saw the rage, the YouTube downvotes, the Reddit comments. And so there are a lot of questions about this rage. Heres a question I want to ask you two, and Maddy Ill throw it to you first. Blizzard has created this atmosphere where they hold BlizzCons every year, and they say, Hey, Blizzard family, get together. And they always ask the same questions at the beginningHow many of you is it your first BlizzCon? Your tenth BlizzCon? Maddy: And they started out with that trailer showing everybodys smiling faces in the audience saying, Welcome home! Jason: So heres the question. And I dont say this to justify any of the awful reactions Ive seen from some people online. But do you think Blizzard has facilitated this type of rage by creating this atmosphere where the fans think theyre part of the Blizzard family and they should be getting whatever they want because theyre part of the Blizzard family and theyre coming to BlizzCon every year? Do you think thats part of this conversation? Maddy: I think so. I dont know if Id say, Well Blizzard deserves this because they have been facilitating these kinds of cons, because Blizzard is not the only organization that does stuff like this with games and encourages this kind of mentality. I think theyre a good example, because its a convention thats PAX-esque but its run by Blizzard and its only Blizzard games, and theres a sense that if youre there you are really only a Blizzard gaming fan, and you can walk from the StarCraft bar to the Hearthstone -themed bar. Youre only playing these games is sort of the vibe of that convention, so its unique compared to PAX. But it does call up that sense of, well then how much are the fans socially permitted to ask? And is it okay for them to voice those opinions directly at a Q&amp;A where they can literally speak to the developers and insult them to their faces? And that is I guess socially normalized enough now that people feel confident about doing it and they think its funny and they can be on a Twitch clip and share it with their friends, and thats rewarded. Thats a little bit different but also kind of the same as tweeting at somebody to drag them and getting upvotes and stuff like that, but now its in person at a Q&amp;A so its a little uncomfortable. Jason: I think that because people feel like theyre part of this extended Blizzard family, because of the way Blizzard has created this atmosphere, they feel like Blizzard should be making games thats just for them. So when Blizzard is like, Hey we want to make a game that appeals to the mobile audience, and its clearly not for this crowd at BlizzCon, or for Diablo fans on the greater internet at large, they feel personally attacked. Hey, I took a day off work, flew across the country to be at BlizzCon, and this is what you give me? And that I think is really interesting and worth a conversationKirk what are your thoughts? Kirk: I have a lot of thoughts, because this captures so many parts of this discussion about video game culture thats been going on forever. So theres a ton to it. I guess Ill try to maybe zero in on one thing. Something Ive noticed over the years of covering video games is that some of the most angry and intense backlash tends to be about things that are not out yet. It tends to be more like about marketing campaigns and announcements, and things people have heard about but havent yet played for themselves or seen. I think in this case its definitely a marketing failure for a lot of reasons, and the intensity of the anger around it. Usually if people are mad about something that doesnt exist yetin this case its a mobile game thats in development, and its Diablo 4 that people dont really know about. Youve reported [ Diablo 4 ] is happening but people havent heard about from Blizzard, so they dont know what to think. Theres nowhere for that energy to go. So it builds and lingers and gets worse. Thinking back to things like the Witcher 3 downgrade controversy, which comes to mind because I wrote about it when it happened three years ago. It was so similar because there was this sense of, OK this game now looks worse, and theyre going through trailers... Basically, everyone is talking about something that isnt [yet] real. And in this case its true too. Of course there were real things herethere was a real announcement, there was a real event, there were real people on stage. But I do get the feeling that a lot of this is just a byproduct of how much of video game culture is still built around marketing. Its a marketing event, so much of what people talk about are announcements, which are basically just marketing. And in this case, it was clearly a marketing failure, only because, something as simple as putting [the Diablo Immortals announcement] at the end of a big opening event... Maddy: Treating this like the big climax youre building to. Kirk: Exactly. And then everyones like, oh its gonna be Diablo 4, surely it is... and then it super isnt. The whole thing relates back to how so much of game culture is about marketing: what youre gonna buy, and what people are telling you to buy. Maddy: To your point about how people are mad about something that doesnt exist and also that they cant really interact with yet, then what theyre mad about is the assumptions theyre making about what its going to be. And maybe those assumptions are fair, maybe it is going to be exploitative or bad or whatever. But mostly what Ive seen is people angry at the idea of Diablo being a mobile game. And some of it is more reasonable criticismsthis company is a known entity I dont likebut some of it is How dare they put Diablo on a phone, that makes no sense, and thats not for me, a core gamer. So theres definitely that as well, and even that is this idea of something that doesnt exist, and so its your own assumptions about what it should be. Itd be neat if this was an amazing phone game, but I dont think its going to be, so maybe some of this anger will end up feeling like it was justified. And thats kind of upsetting to me too, because I feel like some of it isnt founded in reasonable sentiments. Kirk: Especially because we know Diablo 4 is getting made. When you were describing their blog post, Jason, you used the word basicallybasically it said Diablo 4 was going to be there. But that basically is doing a lot of work, because it didnt say that. Jason: Thats the big concern, right? Its not only about the fact that Diablo is on phones, its about the fact that Diablo is on phones and they havent said anything about Diablo 4. All theyve used is this vague We have multiple Diablo projects in the works. And if they would just say, and its baffling, its inexplicable to me that they wouldnt say that. We are working on Diablo game for PC. You dont even have to say the namesave the big title for a cinematic or a teaser or whatever. But just say We are working on a new Diablo game for PC. Thats all you need to say. Maddy: But isnt that setting a precedent that at the following years BlizzCon there will be a cinematic? Because once youve announced that you have a game, and its a Diablo game, even if you dont say its Diablo 4, I feel like that then primes people to assume, OK so next year were going to find out about it. I feel like thats the way expectations have been built, and part of that is the way that these events have been run for so long Kirk: I wonder, itll be interesting to see how Bethesda announcing The Elder Scrolls VI 40 years in advance plays out. Because there could be a new norm established there, and it could be Yeah, well just tell people what were working on, and then next year, its Yeah were still working on that, we dont have anything to show you, sorry, but were still making it. Jason: That was brilliant, because the reason that is Fallout 76 Heres this multiplayer survival thing, but dont worry, were still making Bethesda-style games. Heres Starfield, heres Elder Scrolls VI, you wont see them for a while, but this is what were doing, dont worry, we havent abandoned our core fans. And thats what Blizzard didnt do, and thats why the core fans who feels like theyre betrayed by Blizzard are freaking out. Its been really interesting to see, and I feel like it all couldve been easily avoided. For much more, listen to the entire episode.

An outdoor surveillance camera caught this exterior shot of Maldonado running away, barefoot and wearing handcuffs. The Times found that he wasn’t properly restrained when the squad car pulled into the garage, which is how he was able to escape so easily. During arrest, Maldonado attempted his first escape, and was placed in hobble restraints as a precaution. Police noticed the restraints were loose prior to arriving at the jail, but failed to properly restrain him. According to the sheriff's office, a car reported stolen near the jail ""is believed to be connected to"" Maldonado's escape. In addition to two escape charges, Maldonado was charged with unlawful possession of a syringe, driving on a suspended license, and resisting law enforcement.

Nathan Grayson,"If not for a few oversights on Blizzard’s part, the original Diablo ’s source code would likely be lost to time. However, thanks to those oversights and some serious dedication from one coder, people can now see (and tinker around with) what makes Diablo tick. Diablo, of course, basically birthed the PC action-RPG genre as we know it today. Released at the tail end of 1996, it’s a classic in every sense of the word. People are, as you might expect, very interested in seeing how such a formative game was built. Source code—the lines of code written by programmers, which you don’t see in the final version—is a missing piece in that puzzle. Most developers do not release their games’ source code, and Blizzard has a reputation for being especially secretive about its games’ innermost workings. Galaxyhax’s “Devilution” project is a labor of love for game preservation and modding. They say it took them more than 1,200 hours over the course of four months, and they made sure that even bugs, flaws, and sloppy code were present and accounted for. Galaxyhax wants people to be able to see how Diablo ended up the way it did. “Devilution helps document the unused and cut content from the final game,” they wrote in the source code’s documentation. “Development of Diablo was rushed near the end—many ideas were scrapped and multiplayer was quickly hacked in. By examining the source, we can see various quirks of planned development.” They also noted that having access to source code means the game can continually be updated to run on newer hardware—something that’s become more and more of an issue over time. In rare instances, a game’s developer will release the source code publicly, such as id Software with the original Doom. But Blizzard doesn’t do this. In fact, last year when a fan came across a disc containing Starcraft ’s source code, Blizzard went to great lengths to get it back from him, including giving the fan a free trip to BlizzCon. Galaxyhax has reconstructed what they believe to be Diablo ’s original source code from bits and pieces that have inadvertently leaked out of Blizzard in the past. They cited a 1997 expansion to the game called Hellfire and made by Synergistic Software, as well as the PlayStation port of the game by Climax Studios. “A symbolic file was accidentally left on the Japanese port, which contained a layout of everything in the game,” said Galaxyhax. “This includes functions, data, types, and more! A beta version of the port also leaked, which contained yet another one of these files.” Galaxyhax further explained that the regular PC release of Diablo actually contains a hidden debug build, which gave them access to debug tools and more code. They then stitched all these strings of information together to recreate Diablo ’s source code. “Combining these aspects not only makes reversing the game much easier, but it makes it far more accurate,” they said. “File names, function names, and even line numbers will be fairly close to the real deal.” This should make it easier for people to modify the game if they so choose, whether that means improving on flaws that have been annoying players for decades or overhauling the whole thing. Now, a potential stumbling block: Galaxyhax says they’re not sure if Blizzard’s lawyers will come a-knocking on their door or not. They believe that Devilution’s documentation is sufficient to count as an exception to DMCA rules, but it’s still a “grey area.” I reached out to Blizzard for an answer to that looming question, but as of publishing, they had yet to give me a concrete answer. Assuming it all goes well, though, it’s hard not to wonder what’s next for someone dedicated enough to make all of this happen. For the moment, Galaxyhax only knows one thing for certain: it’s not gonna be Diablo II. “ Diablo II is still supported, sold, and maintained by Blizzard,” they said. “Setting the legal implications aside, there’s about 8x as much code, and a chance Blizzard will remaster the game soon anyway.”","If not for a few oversights on Blizzard’s part, the original Diablo ’s source code would likely be lost to time.

Nathan Grayson,"Way back in 2009, Blizzard announced that StarCraft II would include a map marketplace with options to buy and sell custom maps. Years later, the StarCraft II team is finally following through. StarCraft II ’s arcade, which allows players to create and play custom maps at no extra charge, will add premium fan-made maps alongside the game’s next big patch, version 4.3. In a lot of ways, the feature sounds similar to Bethesda’s Creation Club : Blizzard is handpicking specific “prominent community creators” and working alongside them to create new maps and modes, and “a share of the sales” will go directly to creators. In a blog post announcing all of this, Blizzard said it’s been applying its steady hand to the first batch of premium maps “over the last year.” For now, this program has resulted in two maps: “ARK Star” from creator Pirate and “Direct Strike” from Tya. The former is a turn-based RPG focused on the Protoss while the latter is an upgrade of popular tug-of-war mod “Desert Strike HotS.” Both will cost $4.99, but in Direct Strike’s case, there’ll be free and premium versions. Premium includes four new modes as well as special cosmetics. StarCraft II ’s 4.3 patch doesn’t have a release date yet, but hopefully it’ll arrive in fewer than nine years.","Way back in 2009, Blizzard announced that StarCraft II would include a map marketplace with options to buy and sell custom maps.

Weston Albert,"report this adIn the wake of the news that future Destiny games will be self-published by Bungie as the developer splits from its franchise deal with publisher Activision, Blizzard says that BattleNet will continue to support Destiny 2 on PC. In a statement today, Activision and Bungie said that both companies would be working together to transition the Destiny franchise seamlessly, and it appears that part of that will be to make sure that the current sequel gets full support on BattleNet.
Blizzard tweeted out the confirmation of support assuring those playing Destiny 2 on PC that the split between Bungie and Activision will have no impact on the current game.
Destiny 2 will still receive full support on BattleNet and we do not anticipate any disruption to our services or your gameplay experience. https://t.co/FFOE1iae3R
 BlizzardCS (@BlizzardCS) January 10, 2019
Having Destiny 2 on BattleNet was a big deal for Bungie back when it was announced prior to the launch of the game, with Blizzard and Activision giving the game strong support as a Destiny game launched for the first time on PC with the sequel. In fact, Destiny 2 was the only non-Blizzard game at its launch to be featured on BattleNet.
Obviously, while BattleNet will continue to support Destiny 2 because the game was published by Activision, its highly unlikely that Destiny 3 or future games will stay on BattleNet. With Bungie going the self-publishing route, its likely that the franchise will move towards other, more open online services such as Steam.
While its unknown just how long Destiny 2s lifespan will be, the games Annual Pass will cover add-on content to the fall of this year. One analyst says that Destiny 3 will launch in 2020, and that would be Bungies first self-published Destiny game. Based on how things went with the player population in Destiny 1 when Destiny 2 came out, its likely that the vast majority of players will jump over to Destiny 3 and leave Destiny 2 behind rather quickly. Its unknown how long BattleNet will continue to support Destiny 2, if at all, once Destiny 3 launches, but for now, the game and its players are still set to get the services full support.
Destiny 2 is available now for PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

SEE ALSO: Welp, here is your state's most popular search term on Pornhub Apparently, the Crisco didn't work all that well — instead, it became a challenge for anyone daring to test their luck at the poles.

Nathan Grayson,"“That’s a nice ult you’ve got there,” Blizzard essentially said when it changed the way Overwatch ult interruptions work last month. “It’d be a shame if something were to happen to it.” Ever since the big Halloween update on October 10, Overwatch ’s ults have worked a little differently than they used to. Prior to the update, dying or getting stunned as you used your ult would deplete some, but not all, of your ult charge. Now, death of the body means death of the ult meter as well—your entire ult charge now disappears upon death. In addition, many ults now end the instant you die or get stunned, even when they involve projectiles that should, if we’re applying principles of realism to a world full of cyborg ninjas and Bowiemancers, continue flying forward and detonating. This can lead to some pretty glaring weirdness. In the clip below, courtesy of Squidbit, Mei’s ult disappears after it’s been thrown. In this play by eskaNot, D.Va calls down her mech, only to get hooked by a Roadhog, forcing her to watch as her mech vanishes into the ether along with her entire ult charge: This instance is indicative of another problem players have with the new ult interruption system: some characters are significantly more affected by losing their whole ult charge than others. Blizzard seemingly made this change in response to complaints that some characters, such as Genji, didn’t suffer enough for dying or getting stunned mid-ult, but now some characters have to deal with the opposite problem. “I can understand losing a bit of ult for a badly timed [Lucio] Sound Barrier, but 100% of it gone is garbage because you’re so vulnerable,” a player named pandapoops2 said in a huge thread about ult cancels on Reddit. “Immediately losing all ult charge on every hero is garbage because it’s not the same for everyone. One size fits all was NOT the solution whatsoever.” “At first I thought it was fine just because, you know, to be fair to everyone,” said a player named AzshFayd on Overwatch ’s forums, “but Tracer/Mei/Hanzo/Lucio/Rein losing their ult charge when it’s clearly gone off is BS.” Sometimes, Overwatch players warm to controversial changes after they’ve been in the game for a bit, but a month later, this one is subject to more scrutiny than ever. I reached out to Blizzard to ask if it’s reevaluating ult cancels, but as of publishing, I had yet to receive a response.","“That’s a nice ult you’ve got there,” Blizzard essentially said when it changed the way Overwatch ult interruptions work last month. “It’d be a shame if something were to happen to it.” Read more...",2017-11-13T21:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kotaku.com'}",Overwatch Players Are Sick Of Ult Interruptions,https://kotaku.com/overwatch-players-are-sick-of-ult-interruptions-1820408583,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--fec6NStD--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/d6bfoh0dpylt1s54mwyx.jpg",,Kotaku.com,blizzard,1
BLAKE NICHOLSON / AP,"Blizzard warnings were posted from Colorado to Minnesota on Wednesday and wildfires were a concern in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma as the second so-called “bomb cyclone” storm in less than a month hit the central U.S., raising the prospect of renewed flooding in the already drenched Midwest.
Up to 2 ½ feet (0.61 meters) of snow was expected to fall in parts of eastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) also were expected, creating life-threatening conditions.
“We’re calling it historic because of the widespread heavy snow. We will set some records,” said Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
Snow was already falling at a rate of up to 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) per hour in northeastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota on Wednesday, with the brunt of the storm not expected until Thursday. Sheriff’s offices in the northeastern South Dakota counties of Hamlin and Deuel advised no travel through Thursday, saying visibility was down to a few feet, roads were becoming impassable and numerous traffic crashes had been reported. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as “thunder snow” — snow accompanied by thunder and lightning — was reported in central South Dakota.
“It’s essentially a thunderstorm, but it’s cold enough for snow,” Connelly said.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem closed state government offices in 52 counties. Numerous schools around the state closed, along with several Black Hills National Forest offices in western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “the National Guard stands ready” to rescue any stranded motorists.
The weather service posted an ice storm warning into Friday morning for a portion of southern Minnesota, saying up to three-fourths of an inch of ice could accumulate on power lines, leading to outages.
To the west, the looming spring blizzard in the Rockies was impacting everything from flights to school classes to baseball.
About 40 percent of Denver International Airport’s daily flights Wednesday were scratched. Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies postponed an afternoon game against the Atlanta Braves until August. A few school districts in Colorado and Wyoming canceled classes, while others opted for a shortened day and canceled evening activities.
Strong winds associated with the weather system were creating dangerous wildfire and travel conditions in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The weather service issued a high wind warning for the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) were combining with low humidity and an unstable atmosphere to create critical fire conditions in the three states. Forecasters in New Mexico said the winds also would make travel difficult on north-south oriented roads such as Interstate 25. In southern New Mexico, the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range closed Wednesday because of the high winds.
The storm technically met the scientific definition of what’s commonly known as a “bomb cyclone,” said David Roth, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.

That blast dropped heavy snow and led to massive flooding in the Midwest that caused billions of dollars in damage in Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa and South Dakota.
“Hopefully this time it will be a slow snowmelt,” Roth said.
Forecasters said this week’s storm will swell rivers again, though likely not to the levels seen last month due to the absence of a wet snowpack on frozen ground this time around.
“We’re not out of the woods,” Walz said.
Even moderate rises in the Missouri River will push more water into drenched Fremont County in southwestern Iowa, Emergency Manager Mike Crecelius said. Last month’s flooding swamped 455 houses and thousands of acres of farmland in his region.
“The problem is that we’re not getting any time for the water to recede and things to dry out, so the levees can’t be fixed; houses can’t be fixed; crops can’t be planted,” he said. “And the last spring forecast I saw does not look favorable for us at all. It looks to be a very wet spring.”

BLAKE NICHOLSON / AP,"Blizzard warnings were posted from Colorado to Minnesota on Wednesday and wildfires were a concern in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma as the second so-called “bomb cyclone” storm in less than a month hit the central U.S., raising the prospect of renewed flooding in the already drenched Midwest.Heavy snow disrupted ground and air travel Wednesday. Roads became impassable and visibility was down to a few feet in northeastern South Dakota due to heavy snowfall. About half of the daily flights at Denver International Airport were canceled.
Up to 2 ½ feet (0.61 meters) of snow was expected to fall in parts of eastern South Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, the National Weather Service said. Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) also were expected, creating life-threatening conditions.
“We’re calling it historic because of the widespread heavy snow. We will set some records,” said Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
Transportation officials closed Interstate 29 from east central South Dakota to the North Dakota border, as well as a 270-mile (434-kilometer) section of Interstate 90 between Rapid City and Mitchell, South Dakota.
Numerous traffic crashes were reported in northeastern South Dakota, and the storm knocked out power to thousands of homes and businesses in Sioux Falls.
Officials in Colorado closed a 150-mile (241-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 76 from just northeast of Denver to the Nebraska border, and Gov. Jared Polis activated the National Guard in case troops are needed to rescue stranded motorists.
Multiple crashes in Minnesota along a snowy stretch of Interstate 35 prompted officials to close about 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Minneapolis .
In Nebraska, the State Patrol was sending additional troopers into the state’s panhandle, and officials closed Interstate 80 in that region.
“This storm is going to be dangerous,” Patrol Maj. Russ Stanczyk said.
An unusual but not rare weather phenomenon known as “thunder snow” — snow accompanied by thunder and lightning — was reported in central South Dakota.
“It’s essentially a thunderstorm, but it’s cold enough for snow,” Connelly said.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem closed state government offices in 52 counties. Numerous schools around the state closed, along with several Black Hills National Forest offices in western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming.
Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts extended five weather-related executive orders until May 15 to help communities gain fast access to the state’s emergency resources. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said “the National Guard stands ready” to rescue any stranded motorists.
The weather service posted an ice storm warning into Friday morning for a portion of southern Minnesota, saying up to three-fourths of an inch of ice could accumulate on power lines, leading to outages.
To the west, the looming spring blizzard in the Rockies impacted flights, school classes, government functions and even baseball.
Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies postponed an afternoon game against the Atlanta Braves until August. Many school districts in Colorado and Wyoming canceled or shortened classes. Local governments, including in Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming, and state government in the Denver area closed offices early.
Strong winds associated with the weather system were creating dangerous wildfire and travel conditions in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The weather service issued a high wind warning for the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
Winds in excess of 50 mph (80.46 kph) were combining with low humidity and an unstable atmosphere to create critical fire conditions in the three states. Forecasters in New Mexico said the winds also would make travel difficult on north-south oriented roads such as Interstate 25. In southern New Mexico, the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range closed Wednesday because of the high winds.
The storm technically met the scientific definition of what’s commonly known as a “bomb cyclone,” said David Roth, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

Nathan Grayson,"Yesterday, during a BlizzCon Q&amp;A shortly after the announcement of mobile game Diablo Immortal, a fan in a red shirt approached the mic. Just was wondering, he said in a deadpan tone, is this an out-of-season April Fools joke? The audience cheered. It was just the beginning of a very long weekend for Blizzard, one of the companys co-founders told Kotaku in an interview today. During yesterdays on-stage Q&amp;A, a developer on stage let the fan down gently. No, he replied to the facetiously phrased question, its a fully fledged Diablo experience on mobile, which everybody will get to play, and hopefully, which will bring new heroes to Sanctuary as well as welcoming our community back into it and something were very excited about. Backlash to Diablo Immortal, however, has continued to rage across social media, YouTube, Reddit, and other sites since then. It stems, for the most part, from a pre-BlizzCon Blizzard blog post that was meant to temper fans expectations and clarify that there are multiple Diablo projects in the works, but which did say that we do intend to share some Diablo -related news with you at the show. The blog post got many fans hopes up foreven a low-level loot drop of information about Diablo IV. Failing that, they were at least holding out for a remaster of a classic Diablo game. Instead, they got a mobile game thats being developed in collaboration with Chinese company NetEase. Some fans have taken this as a sign that Blizzard has forsaken PC and console in favor of greener mobile pasturesand thus, that theyve forsaken the fans that they built their foundation on. The Diablo subreddit, especially, is an avalanche of outrage right now. Blizzard used to cancel games like Ghost and Titan for not meeting Blizzard quality, reads the current top thread, which has over 12,000 upvotes. Now they are outsourcing and reskinning games. Im not sad, just disappointed and angry. Fans are especially focused on a joking remark principal designer Wyatt Cheng made during yesterdays Q&amp;A after getting booed for saying Immortal isnt coming to PC. Do you guys not have phones? he asked the audience in a faux-incredulous tone. Fans have decided this is the ultimate example of Blizzards tone-deafness. Riffing on that comment, a thread with nearly 4,000 upvotes reads, Everyone is saying that Blizzard is out touch with their fans. Except touch is the only way youll be able to play the next Diablo game. Dont you all have phones anyway? Other threads on the subreddit accuse Blizzard of killing Diablo, call the game a slap in the face, and justify being disrespectful to Blizzard employees, while people on Diablo s official forum call for boycotts and petition to get Immortal canceled. There have also been accusations that Blizzard is removing dislikes from Diablo Immortal s cinematic and gameplayer trailerswhich currently have 215,000 and 132,000 dislikes on YouTube, respectivelybut others have suggested that the number fluctuations are an algorithm issue or an adjustment after multi-account votes were removed. Unsurprisingly, Gamergate subreddit Kotaku In Action has also lent its considerable numbers to the more culture-wars-adjacent and conspiratorial elements of this backlash wavein effect, amplifying them. Speaking to Kotaku in an interview at BlizzCon, executive producer and Blizzard co-founder Allen Adham admitted that Blizzard was expecting some backlash, but not to this degree. We know our audience here is passionately PC- and console-focused, he said. Weve also seen this before. We saw a similar response when we announced that we were bringing Diablo to console, and we saw a similar response to the announcement of Hearthstone. But, of course, theres also the elephant-sized lord of darkness and torment in the room: People thought they were going to see Diablo IV. That being said, we knew our audience here desperately wants to see and hear about one thing in particular, Adham said in reference to whatever major Diablo game is coming after Diablo III. In theory, the aforementioned blog post was supposed to head that thinking off at the pass, but it backfired. Big video game companies have a way of talking around things they havent announced, and the post exemplifies that. If you read through it with the benefit of hindsight, its pretty obvious that its telling people not to get their hopes up for anything too big at BlizzCon. However, its easy to see how fans could also interpret it as though its saying the complete opposite. Nowhere does it just directly state that people shouldnt expect to see the next big Diablo game at BlizzCon. Adham, though, feels like he and his team did the best they could. At Blizzard, we dont announce things until were ready. Its all about game quality, less about timing, all about delivering an overwhelming experience to our players, he said. We tried to get ahead of that a little bit with the blog post to let that group know that we are working on multiple things and continue to work on multiple things. But its pretty clear that their incredible passion for Diablo manifests in interesting ways. Adham also talked about the structure of the Diablo Immortal team, explaining that its a joint effort between a team at Blizzard and a team at NetEase in China. While those teams do interact with the main Diablo team, the Immortal team and the main Diablo team are separate and working on separate projects. There are actually two distinct teams, Adham said. Thats something we tried to communicate. I know our community here, theres a concern that we are focused on this instead of that. The truth is that we have multiple Diablo teams working on multiple unannounced Diablo projects even after announcing [ Immortal ]. Some fans have gone so far as to claim that Diablo Immortal is a reskin of a previous NetEase action RPG. Adham refuted that, saying that even the art and assetswhich look like they came straight from Diablo III were made for Immortal and Immortal alone. I want to assure you that Diablo Immortal is purpose-built from the ground up, he said. He went on to further clarify the similarities between NetEases old game and Diablo Immortal, especially the touch-based control scheme, which is basically identical to that of NetEases previous action-RPG: In the East, that control method is becoming ubiquitous, and its becoming ubiquitous because its very natural, and it feels great. Less so in the West, but were now starting to see some games that are bringing that mechanic to the West. So its us taking inspiration from some of the work theyve done already. Thats not to say that Diablo fans fears are entirely misplaced. The world of mobile gaming is distressingly under-regulated and rife with exploitative business practices that prey on very real issues like gambling addiction. People are worried that Blizzard will end up embracing the dark side of microtransactions with its mobile game about the dark lord. On that front, Adham wasnt able to offer any concrete reassurances and instead pointed to Blizzards track record. If you think about Blizzard over the last three decades, weve made lots of different games using different models: boxed products that we sell, digital downloads, WoW is subscription-based, Hearthstone and Overwatch have loot boxes and loot packs, he said. Heroes of the Storm is another free-to-play game. So I hope our community can see that, over that time, there are a few central themes that drive us at Blizzard, and they are always Make an amazing game and deliver overwhelming value ethically to our players. That drives the way we think about this. So whether its free-to-play or premium, that remains our north star. The explosion of outrage has many on social media discussing the extent to which video game culture enables entitlement. Its not surprising, after all, that theres been some pushback on the idea of a mobile Diablo game. Whats shocking here is the sheer amount of molten vitriol thats pouring in over what seems to be a pretty cut-and-dry situation: A proper new Diablo has been and continues to be in the works, and Diablo Immortal is its own thing thats not detracting from that. Also, the game itself is fine, if a little too shallow. No harm, no foulaside from maybe some hurt feelings over unfulfilled expectations. And yet, people have decided that this is the ultimate betrayal, all because a single game isnt hyper-focused on the diehard PC and console crowd. Adham chalked it up not to entitlement, but instead to passion. They love what they love and want what they want, he said of the fans raging at BlizzCon and across the internet. That passion, its actually what drives us, and we feel it too. Its why we make games and why weve made games for almost three decades nowand why our community is so passionate about our franchises. I understand their feeling and wish we could share more about all the amazing things were doing, not just with the Diablo franchise but across the company as a whole. Unfortunately, this kind of rhetoricobviously well-meaning and frequently employed by developers with vocal fanbasescan contribute to the problem. It positions the passion that leads to disrespect and even outright abuse as a virtue, which in turn begets subsequent cycles of vitriolic uproar when developers dont give their core crowds exactly what they demand. If even massive companies like Blizzard laud these fans outbursts, after all, they must be justified. Still, Adham hopes that, in the end, Blizzard is able to please everyone. Our hope is that our existing hardcore fans will play this game and love it, learn new things about the lore, but engage with a similar kind of gameplay that they know and love, he said. The main difference now being that they can walk around with this in their pocket and play it anytime, anywhere. But then also bring in a new, broader audience that maybe likes action-RPGs but hasnt experienced Diablo. And then if were really good at our jobs, bring in an entirely new mobile audience that has never played a mobile action-RPG or any RPG before. To get all of that right is a challenge we think about every day.","Yesterday, during a BlizzCon Q&amp;A shortly after the announcement of mobile game Diablo Immortal, a fan in a red shirt approached the mic. “Just was wondering,” he said in a deadpan tone, “is this an out-of-season April Fool’s joke?” The audience cheered.

Joshua Rivera,"A story published by the Washington PostTuesday night revealed that game publisher Activision Blizzard has been offering third-party fertility and pregnancy tracking services to its employeesand then receiving their anonymized data back in return.
Ovia Health offers a suite of wellness apps for family planning, allowing users to input their personal information to keep track of their efforts to conceive and maintain a healthy pregnancy, and for documenting a childs health once theyre born. According to The Post, Ovia also provides employers who pay for it access to anonymized, aggregate data that tells them much of what their employees put into their Ovia apps, from their trying-to-conceive months to early motherhood.
The company claims it complies with privacy laws, and Activision Blizzard also reportedly places strict controls on who can view the data. The story quotes Milt Ezzard, Activision Blizzards vice president of global benefits, as saying that Ovia was instrumental in shifting employee sentiment towards apps that ask for personal information. 
Each time we introduced something, there was a bit of an outcry: Youre prying into our lives, Ezzard told The Post, later noting that employees attitudes have improved since Ovia was first offered in 2014. Eventually people understood its all voluntary, theres no gun to your head, and were going to reward you if you choose to do it. The company reportedly offers employees a $1 gift card for each day the app is used, but didnt otherwise disclose how the anonymized data is used.
Despite its assurances of privacy, there is concern that data could still be attributed to individual employees in instances like this from clues derived from real-life interactions, and privacy experts caution that the data harvested from wellness apps could lead to insurance companies using that data to deny coverage or increase premiums. 
In an email to Kotaku, an Ovia spokesperson said that employers never see the personal, intimate information users enter into the app. Instead, it said, employers see percentage-based, aggregate, de-identified data to ensure that Ovia is helping women have healthier outcomes i.e. are outcomes improving? Are employees using the benefit?

Alex Walker,"Following the hundreds of job losses at Activision Blizzard and redundancies at Guild Wars developer ArenaNet, EA has begun a massive round of layoffs at its development studio in Melbourne.
FireMonkeys, which was created in 2012 after EA merged IronMonkey Studios and FireMint, is one of the largest development houses in Australia. Focused exclusively on mobile development, the company is responsible for making Real Racing 3, as well as The Sims: Freeplay and Need for Speed: No Limits.
In 2016, the company moved to a new office in Docklands and was hailed as the largest mobile game developer in the country, with Victorian Minister for Creative Industries Martin Foley praising the studios history as one of innovation, creativity and global success.
The studio was also developing Real Racing 4, although its understood that the project was officially cancelled earlier this week. Following that decision, executives from EA have flown in from overseas to affect wholesale changes across the studio. Those decisions included the cancellation of Real Racing 4 and a reorganisation of staff across the titles currently under their management, which includes The Sims Mobile.
Developers were notified of the layoffs earlier this week. Those impacted were told via individual meetings, while employees that remained were informed via a group meeting, Kotaku Australia understands.
One employee, who spoke under anonymity, said the current atmosphere is so grim that remaining staff are operating under the assumption the whole studio will eventually be shut down. No idea how certain tasks will be done at all if I look at who got let go, they said.
Unofficial figures on the size of the Australian games industry placed the number of staffers at Firemonkeys at close to 200. A statement from Game Workers Unite this morning says that approximately 80 to 100 staffers have been let go, although an exact figure has not been verified. EA would also not confirm precisely how many employees were impacted when contacted for comment, or what would happen with Real Racing 4 going forward.
The company did reply with a statement, however, confirming that the studio entered a consultation period to shift focus towards more on our live services.
The FireMonkeys studio is working on some of our most popular mobile games. We recently made a decision to shift teams to focus more on our live services, and have entered into a consultation period that may impact some roles in the studio. Were working to match skills with opportunities as we go through this period, identifying other opportunities at EA, and providing as much help to our employees as we possibly can.
The Australian chapter of Game Workers Unite said the suspected job losses was equivalent to nearly 10% of the entire Australian game development industry.
This is a devastating blow to local development - an extraordinarily disappointing decision which will affect the already crowded local freelancer and indie market, as well as the undergraduate student body, GWU Australia said.
GWU Australia reiterated that affected employees can gauge their expected redundancy payouts through the Fair Work Ombudsman website.","Following the hundreds of job losses at Activision Blizzard and redundancies at Guild Wars developer ArenaNet, EA has begun a massive round of layoffs at its development studio in Melbourne.

Lisa Fu,"Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 scheduled to release in October includes a new battle royale mode. Oppenheimer doesn't see that taking away from Fortnite, which appeals to a younger, broader audience. Instead, the new Call of Duty feature is better positioned to attract hardcore first-person shooter fans. Watch Activision Blizzard trade in real-time here. Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is scheduled for release on October 12, and will likely be a big hit given the franchise's large following and improvements on weaponry. The much-anticipated game will also have a battle royale mode, recently popularized by Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battleground, but it is unlikely to have the same broad appeal as Fortnite. ""We believe the game is not positioned to appeal to wider, younger players like Fortnite is,"" Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a note to clients. ""Instead, we believe this game is built to be the best-in-class hardcore [first person shooter]."" Epic Games' Fortnite shot up in popularity within recent months, capturing audiences with its battle royale mode and its ""freemium"" business model that allows the game to run 100% free on consoles. In March alone, Fortnite raked in $223 million in revenue across all platforms, according to research firm Superdata. Rather than competing head-to-head with Fortnite for young players, Uerkwitz believes the new feature is better suited to gain market share from games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Siege, PlayerUnknown's Battleground, and Battlefield which are more popular with experienced players. Black Ops 4 will be more attractive to hardcore first-person shooter fans with its ""deeper/flexible load-outs and tactical game play."" Activision Blizzard also said the PC version of Black Ops 4 will run on Battle.net, an online gaming, social media, and digital distribution platform. Battle.net currently supports games such as Overwatch, Starcraft: Remastered and Destiny 2. The push should better expand the Call of Duty player base on the PC as that version is positioned to make use of Battle.net's social features and tools, Uerkwitz said. Activision Blizzard is up 11% this year. Markets Insider","Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 scheduled to release in October includes a new battle royale mode.

Kyle Orland,"reader comments 1 Ever since Activision removed dedicated server support from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 back in 2009 (leading to a largely ineffectual attempted boycott from PC players), the popular series has had something of a reputation as a franchise focused first on console players and second on afterthought PC ports. That's especially true when compared to other contemporary shooter franchises like Battlefield. But Activision's orientation toward PC players has been changing a bit over the years, with Destiny 2 's recent move to the PC and a hybrid server model being some of the most noticeable signs. So our ears perked up this week when, in an earnings call Thursday evening, Activision Blizzard President and CEO Coddy Johnson promised that the company has ""invested significant dedicated resources and design time"" to the PC version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4. The company wants to ""make sure we can deliver a great PC game to serve that community."" Johnson didn't go into any detail on what those ""dedicated resources"" might mean for PC players, beyond pablum like the game ""continu[ing] to push the envelope in innovation"" and including ""a number of new exciting developments."" But he did specifically call out the game's ""appeal on growth platforms like PC"" as a focal point ahead of a larger gameplay reveal set for May 17. Elsewhere in the call, Activision executives addressed the rising popularity of ""Battle Royale"" shooters like PUBG and Fortnite, which have recently taken a lot of industry and player attention away from more traditional online shooters like Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard CFO Spencer Neumann acknowledged Activision was feeling a ""near-term impact from Battle Royale,"" even though Call of Duty still grew overall year-over-year. But Activision CEO Bobby Kotick added coyly that ""when we see things that appeal to our audiences, we are very good at being inspired by those,"" which could easily be seen as a hint that Battle Royale is coming to Black Ops 4. That would gel with reports by Kotaku, Eurogamer, and others suggesting the company is working on such a mode for Black Ops 4. Those reports also suggest the game will ditch the standard single-player and co-op campaign in favor of a focus on multiplayer gameplay and the ""Zombies"" survival mode. Put it all together, and you get the impression that Activision might be ready to really shake up the somewhat formulaic, console-focused design of Call of Duty this year. Now that we're over a decade on from the original Modern Warfare, that's not an unwelcome sign.",Executives also hint Battle Royale mode could come to Black Ops 4.,2018-05-04T15:55:41Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Activision shows PC some love, plans “significant” resources for Call of Duty",https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/activision-shows-pc-some-love-plans-significant-resources-for-call-of-duty/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/codblops4-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,blizzard,1
Jason Schreier,"Things have been slow in Diablo -land for the past few years, but that’s likely going to change soon, with Blizzard teasing on Twitter today that it has some Diablo projects in the works. One of them, we believe, is Diablo III Switch. In a short video, Blizzard community manager Brandy Camel promised Diablo fans that the company isn’t ignoring the popular action-adventure franchise. “We have multiple Diablo projects in the works,” she said. “Some of them are going to take longer than others, but we may have some things to show you later this year.” It’s safe to guess that one of those is the next big Diablo game—that’s likely the one that’s going to take longer than others—and we’re pretty sure that another is a port of Diablo III to Switch. In fact, Blizzard had teased as much, tweeting a photo of Diablo III ’s logo on a light switch on February 28 of this year. But the company soon denied that was the case, telling Kotaku at the time that “the tweet was meant to be a fun engagement piece. We do not have any plans to announce Diablo for Switch.” Yet Eurogamer reported shortly afterward that Diablo III was indeed in development for the Switch, and Kotaku has heard the same from a reliable source. It’s a safe bet that we’ll hear more about this port before year’s end. Diablo III, which had a rocky start when it launched in May 2012, has sold over 30 million copies across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. The game’s first expansion, Reaper of Souls, came out in March 2014, transforming it into one of the better action-RPGs out there. The game has received a regular trickle of updates and seasons since then, although there have been no new acts or substantial content updates—the biggest, 2017's Rise of the Necromancer, added a new class to the game. It’s due time for new Diablo stuff.","Things have been slow in Diablo -land for the past few years, but that’s likely going to change soon, with Blizzard teasing on Twitter today that it has some Diablo projects in the works.

Jason Schreier,"Last night, Blizzard announced plans to scale down Heroes of the Storm, moving its developers to other games and putting an end to its Heroes of the Storm Global Championship (HGC) esports league. The news came as a shock to hundreds of Heroes of the Storm players and broadcasters, many of whom say they now find themselves out of income streams with no warning. We are troubled by the way the announcement was made; namely the impolitic choice to use social media to share such a message that effectively ended the careers of hundreds of players, content creators, casters, production crews overnight - and broke the hearts of countless fans, wrote Darrie, the general manager of an eSports team called Method, on Twitter this morning, echoing the thoughts of many other former Heroes of the Storm players and managers. As someone whos commentated Heroes of the Storm since 2015, I mostly really feel for the 200+ pro players who have lost their jobs via a blog post today, wrote caster Wolf Schröder on Twitter late last night. I always loved casting Heroes, so its tragic to see it go so suddenly. Thanks for all the kind messages today, friends. Although Blizzard said in a blog post last night that Heroes of the Storm would continue to get regular updates, the death of Heroes burgeoning eSports league has wide-ranging consequences for those supported by it. The HGC, which launched in 2016, offered a base salary as well as prize pools to nearly 200 players. Some of those players are now fuming, in large part because of Blizzards lack of communication. Fuck you, honestly, wrote former player Johan Lauber on Twitter last night. Working 6 hard months with new fantastic teammates for this shit. Radio silence for weeks. I sent multiple email[s] and all i got back was that they are working on finalizing the details. I feel like this is unacceptable by any company to kick so many people in the ass using a blog option, after being constantly asked (since Blizzcon was over) about plans, wrote former player Maksym Mopsio Szczypa on Twitter this morning. I wouldnt be upset of they told me that there is an option of no HGC but at this point I wasted one month of my life and nobody will give it back. However I am grateful for opportunity to play this game competitively. I give myself some time to get back in shape in league and see if I can do well (Russian LCS for example). If not then I will pursue other career, maybe as chef. Chris Tetcher Ivermee, a British caster for Heroes, told Kotaku that hed been making around $4,000 a month during the season. He received a day rate from Blizzard that he relied upon to pay his rent and bills. It was my only source of income outside my stream, he said in a Twitter message. Ivermee, like other Heroes of the Storm casters and players, is reeling. Hes started a Patreon and said he plans to launch new initiatives with his former colleagues soon. The reduction of Heroes of the Storm comes at the end of a year in which Blizzard has prioritized cost-cutting. As we reported last month, Blizzard has been looking to both spend less money and bolster its development teams so it can ship more games. Under new chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja (who joined recently from Activision) and chief operating officer Armin Zerza, Blizzard has been shifting priorities. Scaling down Heroes of the Storm and axing the games eSports leagueas well as the collegiate league Heroes of the Dorm, which offered scholarship money to winnersare the latest moves in this plan. On November 2, 2018, Blizzard closed its annual BlizzCon keynote by announcing, to scattered Read more Read Its not clear just how much support Heroes of the Storm will get in the future. When asked how many people will remain on the Heroes of the Storm development team, a Blizzard representative wouldnt get into specifics. The Heroes team will continue to have a smaller but dedicated development team that will continue supporting the game with new content, the rep told Kotaku in an e-mail. Former Heroes player Liam Arcaner Simpson had been openly wondering about Blizzards plans earlier this week. Imagine moving region, self-funded, and investing everything into hots then 1 year later @blizzheroes gives the cold shoulder to HGC 2019, he wrote on Monday. Some courtesy to players, casters and others affiliated is expected in the form of an announcement please. When the announcement finally happened, he seemed resignedand ready to move on. No point feeling sorry for myself, he wrote yesterday. Im taking this as an opportunity to escape Blizzard esports in general.

Tim Rogers,"Blizzard added D.Va’s hometown of Busan, Korea to Overwatch. I happen to have been there in real life many times. Gita and I talk about it today on Kotaku XP, our weekly discussion of hot video game topics. It’s always exciting to see a city you know in a piece of entertainment. When my friend sent me a screenshot of my own house in Oakland, California as it appears in Watch Dogs 2, I screamed. When I first went to Seoul (and Busan) in 2003, my first destination was one of the country’s already-famous PC bangs, where I played Starcraft under indirect electric blue lighting while drinking aloe juice, surrounded by the happy noise of people of all ages grinding SOJs in Diablo II. It was magical. As a person who has loved video games since the early 1980s and still loves them now, and as a person who loves Korea, it warms my heart to see Busan as represented in Overwatch ’s new map (and the accompanying D.Va short), full of authentic, correct Korean words and meaningful cultural references. If you want to hear me say a lot more about my personal experiences in Busan, you can watch (or just listen to) this stream archive, in which Paul Tamayo and I play the new Overwatch map. Also on today’s episode: Gita talks about her interview with the developer of a dating sim in which you kill members of ISIS. I go on a bit of a rant about a “macaroni and cheese buffet table” apropos of God of War ’s new game plus mode. Gita and I talk about how we definitely can’t fix the internet.

Nathan Grayson,"“D.Va’s Nano Challenge,” a new Overwatch promotion in which Blizzard teams up with popular streamers, has been by most counts a success. Last night, over 100,000 people simultaneously watched Overwatch streamer Seagull in hopes of earning in-game drops. Streamers who aren’t part of the promotion have decided they also want a slice of that sumptuous viewer pie, even if that means faking it. D.Va’s Nano Challenge offers rewards for both winning matches in the game and for watching certain streamers outside it. These streamers, hand-picked by Blizzard, include fan favorites like Seagull and questionable selections like notorious holier-than-thou yet horny-on-main streamer Kephrii. To denote that they’re part of the promotion, included streamers have been putting “drops enabled” in their stream titles. And now streamers who didn’t win the Blizzard lottery are doing it too. Thus far, the highest-profile example of this trend is Dafran, an Overwatch streamer whose pro-level skill is offset by the fact that he’s a huge troll who’s previously been suspended from Blizzard’s Overwatch Contenders series for griefing and streaming anime porn, among other things. While it’s seemed at points like he’s taken his knocks and gotten back on the straight and narrow, he just can’t seem to resist pulling trolly stunts that piss off large portions of the community. And so, as part of his most recent stream which took place earlier today, he put “DROPS ENABLED” in his title and had a ball. He justified it by putting a GIF of raindrops in the lower left corner of his stream—which, to be fair, is kinda funny. He proceeded to stream YouTube videos and kind of play Overwatch for four hours. Then, at the very end, he hosted Blizzard-approved streamer Mirage and told his viewers to tune in to that stream for “real drops.” I did a cursory sweep of Twitch’s Overwatch directory earlier this afternoon and found more than ten other streamers who aren’t part of the promotion claiming to offer drops, all of them significantly less popular than Dafran. Here are a few: Given that their view counts aren’t particularly high, it doesn’t seem like it’s working as a troll job or a legitimate tactic. To their credit, some other big streamers like Emongg have been specifying in their titles that they do not have drops enabled—just to make sure people don’t get the wrong idea. Kotaku reached out to both Blizzard and Twitch to ask if streamers who’ve faked being part of the promotion will be punished, but so far, neither company has responded. In the meantime, a PSA: streamers who actually have drops enabled also get a green “drops enabled” graphic in their stream windows that looks like this: So if that’s there, you’re good. If not, probably steer clear.","“D.Va’s Nano Challenge,” a new Overwatch promotion in which Blizzard teams up with popular streamers, has been by most counts a success.
