Nick Douglas,"If I was setting up curriculum at a university, says engineer Foone Turing, Id make an entire semester-long class on the Challenger disaster, and make it required for any remotely STEM-oriented major. Because, says Foone, the disaster was a lot less random or simple than people tend to think. In a thread of 102 tweets, which you can read in essay form here, Foone explains the real reason behind the Challenger disaster, the 2003 Columbia disaster, the sinking of the Titanicand the last time you melted down from anxiety.
The Challenger disaster wasnt a single mistake or flaw or random chance that resulted in the death of seven people and the loss of a two billion dollar spaceship, says Foone. It was a whole series of mistakes and flaws and coincidences over a long time and at each step they figured they could get away with it because they figured the risks were minimal and they had plenty of engineering overhead. And they were right, most of the time. Then one day they werent.
Normalization of deviance
Foone describes the specific cascades of shortcuts and mistakes that led to these famous disasters, and the similar cascades that lead to horrific car crashes on supposedly safe roads. The common factor is that a system is built and stress-tested for one set of circumstances, then stretched a little further in regular use, then finally stretched so far, in a non-optimal situation, that something reaches a breaking point. And all the fudges and allowances fall apart in catastrophic failure. Foone calls this Normalization of Deviance.
A certain road, for example, is built for a 50 MPH speed limit. But because drivers will always push it, the engineer makes sure the road is safe all the way up to 70 MPH under normal conditions. Inevitably, drivers end up taking it at 60 MPH, since everyone knows thats still safe. And then a few people figure it must be safe to drive a little faster than the normal 60 MPH. And a few go even faster. And then it rains, and someone still goes 80 MPH and they crash and die.
Everyone designing a system is constantly fighting against normalization of deviance. And the more things are designed to accommodate misuse, the more the users misuse it. Were in an arms race. And not just designers and engineers, but all of uswere all designing our own lives with a normalization of deviance.
Personal disaster prep
Weve all been there at some point: failing a test because we pulled too many all-nighters, or missing a deadline because we couldnt find those extra hours we thought wed have on the weekend, or having a huge fight because we piled up too many tiny grievances with our partner, or going bankrupt for a medical bill because we spent as much as we earned and tried to live inside a rapacious capitalist system.
When it comes to following standard financial advice, how many of us can say we actually have three

Yes, the systems around us build in certain stressors and failure points, and until those systems are fixed, we have to try not to stack too many other stressors on top of them. Personally, as the father of a three-month-old baby, Im quite freshly aware of this! Before, if the laundry or dishes or grocery shopping didnt get done, enough other stuff was going smoothly that the household could function fine until the weekend. Raising a baby puts a lot more stress on the system, and it becomes crucial to run the dishwasher, or to load the laundry in time to get everything dry and folded before bedtime. A baby is a series of little catastrophes, so theres less room for the others.
Catastrophe-aware empathy
The second personal lesson (another big one for a new parent): everyone around you is also managing a whole system of pressures and impending disasters, sometimes a lot more than you are, so you should be patient and empathetic with them.
In less personal terms, this is why asking someone for just five minutes of their time or just a few bucks is a bigger ask than you think. Its why whenever you want something from someone else, you should think about every possible obstacle and sacrificetravel time, opportunity cost, incidental expensesand take them on yourself. Meet someone near their workplace, pay the tab, secretly pad out deadlines so a delay wont be a catastrophe.
In close relationships, look for each others normalizations of deviance, and help them de-escalate. Take things off each others plate, swap errands or appointments, combine resources, cover for each other during stressful periods. And give yourself that same empathy.
And then, of course, get ready to adapt, because normalization of deviance comes for us all. The best we can do is give it fewer chances to cause a disaster.

Megan Rose Dickey,"The lack of diversity issue in Silicon Valley touches all aspects of the industry — entrepreneurship, big tech company demographics and venture capital. While tech companies have been a bit more deliberate about fostering diversity and inclusion in the last few years — and have made a small bit of progress — the venture capital industry is still sorely lacking in that area. Just one percent of venture capitalists are Latinx and only three percent are black. White people, unsurprisingly, make up 70 percent of the venture capital industry, according to a recent analysis by Richard Kerby, a partner at Equal Ventures. Compared to Kerby’s 2016 analysis, women now make up 18 percent of the VC industry versus just 11 percent. At an intersectional level, black and Latinx women make up zero percent of the venture capital industry. Meanwhile, 40 percent of VCs went to either Stanford or Harvard. “Just TWO schools!,” Kerby wrote on Medium. “Why is that? Everyone wants to work with those they are most similar to, and education, gender, and race are attributes that allow people to find similarities in others.” He added, “With 82% of the industry being male, nearly 60% of the industry being white male, and 40% of the industry coming from just two academic institutions, it is no wonder that this industry feels so insular and less of meritocracy but more of a mirrortocracy.” So, in addition to a lack of racial and gender diversity, there’s also a lack of cognitive diversity. Be sure to head over to Kerby’s Medium post to learn more.","The lack of diversity issue in Silicon Valley touches all aspects of the industry — entrepreneurship, big tech company demographics and venture capital.

Devin Coldewey,"One would think that having one of the most high-profile breaches in recent memory would make a company take security to heart, but Equifax is full of surprises. The latest is that its MyEquifax.com site, to which the company invites those affected by its poor security practices to freeze and unfreeze their credit, itself has extremely poor security.
It’s all documented by security researcher Brian Krebs, who discovered the issue not in some special investigation but in the process of signing up at the site himself. What he found was that “getting an account at MyEquifax.com was easy. In fact, it was too easy.”
In matters of banking and credit, identity is a very important thing to establish. That’s why when you go to MyEquifax.com, it asks you for an email, then for your Social Security number and date of birth.
Slight problem: SSN and DOB were among the personal data leaked in the Equifax breach to begin with! And it doesn’t even check that you own the email address you submit. It does ask a few verification questions, but as Krebs points out these are often public information, such as the street you live on, or your mother’s maiden name, and as such rather worthless for security purposes.
One you have been “verified” with this process, you can immediately request a security freeze on your credit report, or unfreeze it if it’s frozen.
Oh, and don’t worry if you established a PIN for this purpose when setting this up previously, you won’t need that. Yes, this poorly secured website specifically does not require a PIN, though a PIN is required for the same requests via phone or email. When Krebs asked a company representative about this, they explained:
We deployed an experience that embraces both security standards (using a multi-factor and layered approach to verify the consumers identity) and reflects specific consumer feedback on managing security freezes and fraud alerts online without the use of a PIN. The account set-up process, which involves the creation of a username and password, relies on both user inputs and other factors to securely establish, verify, and authenticate that the consumers identity is connected to the consumer every time.
None of that is true. Even elementary security standards like confirming the email address aren’t “embraced,” and multi-factor authentication is trivial to bypass.
This is bad but at least Equifax isn’t alone: It looks like credit reporting agencies Transunion and Experian also have ways of getting around PINs. You’d just think that Equifax, having failed so badly at security before, would want to make its setup a little more robust even meeting basic standards would be good.
As Krebs points out, however, it’s in your interest to set up an account with your actual email address and information, since if you don’t, it seems pretty much anyone with a few data points on you can do so themselves, gaining the ability to freeze and unfreeze your credit.","One would think that having one of the most high-profile breaches in recent memory would make a company take security to heart, but Equifax is full of surprises.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Aarian Marshall,"On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Michael barreled through the Florida panhandle. The most powerful storm to hit the region since record-keeping began in the mid-19th century ran roughshod over the states northwest coasts, damaging two local hospitals enough that they have started evacuating their patients from the areaeven after the storm has left. At least seven people are dead, 900,000 homes and businesses have lost power, and an estimated 325,000 people who fled the storm have to find their way back home. And in a terrible twist, researchers have found that Hurricane Michael hit some of the states least prepared counties. Those researchersJohn Renne, a professor of urban and regional planning and the director of Florida Atlantic Universitys Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions, and doctoral student Andrea Ramosreviewed six sorts of emergency plans for all 67 of Floridas counties. (In Floridaas in most places in the US emergency preparations happen on the local level.) Renne and Ramos's work found the counties in Florida with the least comprehensive hurricane evacuation plans were mostly in the state's panhandlein the area hit by Hurricane Michael. Each plan that the academics evaluated deals with different sorts of incidents or populations: Special Needs Registries and Specialized Transportation Plans should give authorities information on where and how residents with special needs should travel during an emergency. Pick-up location plans are for those without access to their own vehicles or who cant drive. Pet evacuation plans are for residents with pets (and those unwilling to evacuate without them). Multihazard plans are for events that include both hurricanes and other issues like flooding or environmental contamination risk. Evacuation maps are publicly available, easily accessible plans for evacuation routes. Renne and Ramos graded the effectiveness of each of plan on a 0 to 2 point scale, for a possible 12 points in total. A well-developed scheme scored a two. Non-existent plans got a zero. In the end, ten counties, all in northern Florida or the states panhandle, got weak scoresfewer than four points. Of those, at least one county, Gulf County, is under a mandatory evacuation order this week. Four other counties under mandatory evacuation ordersBay, Dixie, Taylor, and Wakullareceived moderate scores, meaning their plans earned between five and eight points. (The research has not yet been peer reviewed.) On the face of it, these results arent so surprising, says Renne. These are some of the least inhabited areas in Florida, accounting for just 1 percent of the states total permanent population. Plus, most counties receiving weak or moderate scores arent on the coast. If youre not a coastal county, it makes sense that you dont pay as much attention to evacuation plans, Renne says. He also notes that the state of Florida on the whole is much better at disaster planning than other coastal states, many which are less frequently threatened by hurricanes. But that relative distance from the coast will become less of a safeguard as climate change stirs up slower-moving, rain dense weather events. Storms like Michael and Florence are teaching planners to expect even inland coastal flooding. (During last months deluge in the Carolinas, inland areas saw more than 10 feet of flooding after swollen rivers pushed past their banks.) Places are flooding now that may have never flooded before, Renne says. It will take months, maybe years, for authorities to fully understand what happened during this unusually catastrophic storm. Being underprepared is, of course, about risk. Just because a county didnt have complete contingencies for dealing with their most vulnerable populations doesnt mean more of them were affected during Michael. It may be that places with weak plans got lucky this time. But while rescue teams continue to rescue, and lineman work on getting communications up and running in northern Florida, Renne urges more localities to get serious about disaster planning. And for the state and federal authorities to get better about helping them to plan. Theres no measuring stick for evacuation plans, says Renne. Its time to create oneand use it.

Brian Barrett,"There are plenty of guides available on how to protect your data, how to secure yourself online, and how to stop digital snoops from tracking you across the web and then profiting from that intrusion. (Sorry, “monetization”.) You should do these things. But if a cascading series of revelations this past week has taught us anything, it's that all of those steps amount to triage. The things you can control add up to very little next to the things you can’t. It’s an obvious point, especially if you follow the privacy headlines. But a recent example of location-tracking gone wrong—in fairness, it rarely goes right—that unfolded over the last week or so underscores the severity of what you’re up against. On May 10, a New York Times report detailed a service, called Securus, that allegedly allowed a former sheriff to track people’s location, practically in real-time, without a court order. Securus technically requires legal documentation that authorizes use of its services. But senator Ron Wyden (D - Oregon) says Securus told his office that the company “never checks the legitimacy of those uploaded documents,” and that it does not feel obligated to do so. It offers a rubber stamp, then, to letting people know where virtually anyone in the US is standing at any given moment. On the heels of that report, ZDNet detailed how all four major US carriers sell location data to companies you’ve never heard of, without your explicit permission. In this specific case, Securus bought its access from a location aggregator called LocationSmart, which in turn bought it from the telecoms. All of these corporate relationships are arguably legal. ""We don’t really have federal laws that are focused on that backend sale of personal data,"" says Alan Butler, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""A lot this is just the Wild, Wild West, honestly. That’s why the companies do whatever they want."" 'If they’re going to have this data and a claim to use it, then they absolutely have a responsibility to make sure it’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox.' Robert Xiao, Carnegie Mellon University That alone would be cause enough for alarm. There’s no opt-out for any of this location sharing. It happens simply by dint of having a cell phone plan. In a very real sense, you’re powerless to prevent your location being used as chattel. Google knows where you are most of the time too, but at least it lets you turn off location tracking, and to delete your history. The company also ostensibly uses the information to help Google Maps, search, and other services that benefit consumers to some degree. The only value AT&amp;T and Verizon create by selling location data to brokers lands on their bottom line. Also, it gets worse. By Wednesday, hackers breached Securus, passing some of the data on its servers—including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords—along to tech site Motherboard. On Thursday, security reporter Brian Krebs revealed that LocationSmart had a security meltdown of its own; while the company says it abides by privacy best practices, including a requirement that someone give consent before being tracked, Carnegie Mellon researcher Robert Xiao discovered that a bug on its web site allowed anyone to locate around 200 million people in the US without their knowledge. “LocationSmart is committed to continuous improvement of its information privacy and security measures and is incorporating what it has learned from this incident into that process,” the company said in a statement Friday. LocationSmart says also that the bug has been fixed, and that it had not been exploited prior to Xiao’s discovery. When asked how they were sure that Xiao was the first to exploit the bug, LocationSmart told WIRED that it “reviewed its historical logs.” Xiao urges some skepticism regarding that last claim. “I would be curious to know how they know that,” he says. “The attack flow looks fairly normal. If they looked at their server logs, it would be hard to distinguish what I was doing from normal use.” Regardless, the absence of exploits wouldn’t excuse the sloppiness that created the bug in the first place. Xiao says it took only about 15 minutes of prodding to discover it, and that it stems from an unused feature that the company apparently never bothered to secure. It’s an unconscionable lapse, especially given the sensitive nature of LocationSmart’s business. “I’d almost prefer that they didn’t have access to this in the first place, that this business model didn’t exist,” says Xiao. “But if they’re going to have this data and a claim to use it, then they absolutely have a responsibility to make sure it’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox.” It’s a responsibility LocationSmart, and so many others who hold onto your data, abdicated. “Because they value profits above the privacy and safety of the Americans whose locations they traffic in, the wireless carriers and LocationSmart appear to have allowed nearly any hacker with a basic knowledge of websites to track the location of any American with a cell phone,” Senator Wyden said in a statement Friday. “The dangers from LocationSmart and other companies are limitless. If the FCC refuses to act after this revelation then future crimes against Americans will be the commissioners' heads.” (An FCC spokesperson says that ""the matter is being referred to the Enforcement Bureau,"" with no further comment.) Wyden’s office also confirmed that none of the four major carriers have responded to letters he sent last week, asking each of them to audit what third parties have access to location information, if and how their customers consented, and urging safeguards to better manage the fallout of these incidents. 'No individual consumer has any power to do anything about it. And where in the system does the solution come from?' Alan Butler, EPIC You couldn’t hope for a much better encapsulation of the hopeless state of data privacy in the US today. You can see the same casual security sloppiness with which LocationSmart and Securus treated your location in the countless exposed databases —revealing everything from personal information to voter records —or in the extremely, entirely, embarrassingly preventable Equifax breach. The same system that allows AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint to sell your location to companies you’ve never heard of also allows thousands of barely regulated, shadowy data brokers to know everything about not just where you are but who you are, and what you do online. And lack of tangible progress, the sense that this has all happened before and will happen again, the resignation; that’s the cumulative effect of years of breaches and leaks and carelessness that make this all feel so futile. This keeps happening, and keeps not getting fixed. ""No one takes the lead,"" says Butler. ""People acknowledge that it’s a problem, but no individual consumer has any power to do anything about it. And where in the system does the solution come from?"" Laws do restrict what consumer-facing companies can do with your data, but the data broker industry has largely slipped through the cracks. And without a centralized agency taking the lead on privacy in the US, or an omnibus law like Europe's GDPR to act as a wider safety net, that's not going to change. None of which means you should give up. You should still follow those guides, and adjust those settings. But you should also know that better privacy can only come if and when companies respect you enough to grant it. And if they continue not to, your only option is to yell loudly enough—at the FCC, at lawmakers, at anyone who will listen—that they no longer have a choice.

GAIL COLLINS,"His opponent, Nate McMurray, hoped that Collins would eventually get desperate. And if hes down, hes going to throw that Hail Mary, and if he does that, were going to intercept that ball, and were going to run it back, said the Democrat. The district is near Buffalo, where sports metaphors are very popular. Collins, who seems to rely heavily on mentioning the name of Nancy Pelosi whenever possible, is still a slight favorite to win in a district that Donald Trump won by 25 points. The voters still have more than a week to decide whether they really want a congressman who uses the Values section of his web page to define Personal Accountability as never increasing entitlement programs. Heres one bright spot: This isnt the worst year on record for indicted congressmen running to stay in office. Back in 1978, we had four. And there would have been five except that authorities in New York agreed to drop charges of soliciting sex from a minor against Representative Fred Richmond after Richmond, a Democrat, agreed to go to a counseling program. Still, two running in a general election is very unusual, said Prof. Allan Lichtman of American University. Lichtman, the author of The Embattled Vote in America, said the 1978 corruption stars included Michigan Democrat Charles Diggs, who was convicted and awaiting sentence when he won re-election. Pennsylvania boasted two indicted Democrats. One (bribery, perjury and influence-peddling) got re-elected. The other (conflict of interest) lost. Floridians voted out J.

Kirsten Korosec,"Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook. The ride-hailing company is centralizing how it responds to disasters, whether it’s flooding in North Carolina, a mass shooting in Las Vegas or an earthquake in Mexico City. Now, instead of taking a local-first (and sometimes reactionary) approach, the company’s global security center will monitor and coordinate responses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company, which announced the change in a blog post this week, has become part of the urban landscape. People use the Uber app to commute to work, attend concerts and other events, rent bikes (and eventually scooters) and even have food delivered. People have become increasingly reliant on the service, a responsibility that requires more than an app that connects drivers and riders. The GSC, as Uber calls it, monitors and flags issues that may affect its business and the communities in which it operates. From here, the GSC staff, which includes former military and security experts who speak a dozen different languages, coordinate with local Uber staff and city, county or state officials. The GSC is the entity that will make decisions on when to suspend service in an area or whether to cap surge pricing. The GSC might also lend support to local authorities, depending on their needs. This procedural change is another illustration of CEO Dara Khosrowshahis efforts to rehabilitate the company and its reputation. It also telegraphs the company’s push to work more closely with cities. In April, Khosrowshahi announced a series of new products to its app, including a deal with instant car-booking service Getaround to launch a product called UberRENT and a partnership with Masabi that lets users pay and book tickets for public transit in the Uber app. Uber also launched Movement in 2017, a tool that provides cities with traffic data.","Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook.

Adi Robertson,"Nobody expected great things out of today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing about social media platforms censoring conservatives. The hearing came on the heels of Congress’ multi-day session with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, where lawmakers exhaustively asked about the issue. Claims about large-scale censorship are basically unfalsifiable, and none of the tech companies invited even showed up. The whole thing looked potentially like a soapbox for vloggers Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson, who were invited to the hearing alongside a few policy experts. But the social media hearing was not just bland or tedious. It was depressingly, almost deliriously bad: full of bad arguments, bizarre tangents, and a lot of shouting. The hearing’s opening statements, by Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), set the tone for the next few hours. Goodlatte spoke portentously about the power and responsibility of social media platforms, invoking quotes from both Ronald Reagan and Mark Zuckerberg. Nadler, the committee’s ranking Democrat, was annoyed. “The central thesis of this hearing doesn’t hold up under even the most basic scrutiny,” he protested. “This committee can do better.” Diamond and Silk suggest Mark Zuckerberg tried to fix the election with Facebook’s ad algorithm Republican lawmakers like Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) spoke vaguely in favor of bills to make companies “liable” for their actions, while admitting that private companies could police platforms however they wanted. A few brought up Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the safe harbor rule Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) badly misinterpreted during Zuckerberg’s hearings. Most Democrats were either wearily contemptuous of the proceedings, or asked panelists unrelated questions about Cambridge Analytica and bot regulation. “This is a stupid and ridiculous hearing. The only reason I’m still here is I want to enter some facts into the record,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), plausibly speaking for a large chunk of the committee. For Republicans, the day was mostly an excuse to lecture Silicon Valley and heap praise on Hardaway and Richardson, albeit not always accurately — Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) addressed a question at one point to “Diamond and Spice.” It’s really not clear what transpired between the vloggers and Facebook’s policy team, and a ThinkProgress analysis found that their traffic dips were probably tied to broad algorithm changes. But the company’s letter dubbing them “unsafe to the community,” even if it was completely retracted, sounds plausibly sinister. Diamond and Silk escalated this complaint into a sweeping conspiracy where Mark Zuckerberg interfered in the 2018 elections (we’re not sure which ones) by manipulating conservative users’ advertising preferences so they’d be targeted with liberal ads. They proceeded to get into shouting matches with various committee members, as representatives pressed the pair about receiving money from the Trump campaign — something they claimed under oath had never happened, before admitting that they’d been reimbursed for plane tickets. “We can see that you do look at fake news,” Richardson sneered at Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), when he read out a line from an official Trump campaign finance filing, stating that Diamond and Silk had been paid for consulting. “Are you calling this FEC document fake?” Jeffries asked. Several outlets have chronicled the false or dubious statements Diamond and Silk made under oath during the hearing. They’re characterized as lying in some stories, and at the very least, they seemed indifferent to being particularly accurate. At one point Hardaway complained about people saying Facebook was a private company and not a public utility, because “they went public in 2012” — referring to the company going public on the stock market. Every member has left the Diamond & Silk hearing except Darrell Issa pic.twitter.com/OjJmtzPld2 — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) April 26, 2018 After nearly two and a half hours, the Judiciary Committee’s YouTube stream froze, cutting off the end of the hearing. Business Insider reporter Joe Perticone posted a picture of panelists sitting in front of a nearly empty row of desks, saying that only one committee member was still listening. The truncated video is now online, along with copies of panelists’ testimony, and we know the same things we did this morning: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have inappropriately banned or restricted some conservative material, but there’s little evidence that they’re singling out conservatives rather than making mistakes across the board. Beyond the able testimony of TechFreedom president Berin Szóka, NYU Law professor Ari Waldman, and News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern, the finest thing to come out of this hearing was a beautiful vision for social media’s future, delivered by Rep. Lieu: Ted Lieu: “Let’s say they want to write an algorithm that promotes cats. Can the government stop them from doing that?” Berin Szóka: “Thankfully not.” Lieu: “And let’s say Facebook figures out, you know, promoting cats gets a lot more people to sign onto Facebook than promoting Diamond and Silk. Can the government intervene and stop Facebook from doing that?” Szóka: ”No.” Lieu: “And let’s say Twitter figures out, you know, we’re going to promote nice, cuddly images of furry animals rather than dismembered body parts. Can the government say you can’t do that?” Szóka: “No.” Mr. Lieu, please sponsor a funding bill for this new cat-only internet. The world will remember you as a hero.","The hearing, featuring vloggers Diamond and Silk, was not just bland or tedious.

The deaths follow a growing number of recent American military accidents, including two deadly collisions involving American warships in 2017, and will likely sharpen the spotlight on the countrys military operations in Asia.

A.A. Newton,"Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication. In the aftermath of a destructive storm, your phone or tablet can be a literal lifeline—so it needs to actually work. Losing the ability to communicate with the outside world makes it harder to coordinate relief efforts and downright impossible to let friends and family know you’re safe. Personal safety should always take top priority, but if your family disaster plan relies on smartphones or laptops in any way, it’s crucial that you take steps to prevent them from being damaged. Here are some ways to do just that. Waterproof Your Devices Obviously, keeping your electronics dry is crucial in a hurricane, and the easiest way to do this is to pack all of your tech in airtight, watertight plastic containers. If you have a vacuum sealer, perfect; seal your backup batteries, chargers, adapters, and cords in bags before packing them. If you don’t, Ziploc bags work well. In either case, silica gel packets provide extra dryness insurance, so long as they’re not already saturated with moisture. You can recharge saturated silica in a pinch by drying it out in a 200-250ºF oven for a few hours, but if you’re unsure how dry it is, buying fresh stuff from the hardware store is your best bet. Diversify Your Charger Portfolio A phone or laptop with a dead battery is completely useless, so be sure to pack lots of different battery-replenishing options in your go bag. Fully-charged external batteries are a must, and USB-compatible car chargers let you charge devices from any car with a working battery—just be sure to unplug the adapter when you’re done. Throw in a power strip or two to make the most of any functional power outlets you encounter, plus some extra connecting cables, and you should be fully covered. Get the Most Out of Your Smartphone The pocket-sized supercomputers we all carry around are lifesavers in an emergency situation, even when cell service or wifi is unavailable. Your smartphone can handle everything from first-aid apps to downloaded maps to quick-access document storage; figure out what information you need access to and download it to your phone. While you’re at it, take necessary precautions to maximize your phone’s battery life, which could make your life much easier in an extended power outage. Generally speaking you don't want to rely on technology at all in your disaster toolkit, but… Read more Read If you haven’t already, be sure to activate your phone’s emergency contact functions. Android users can add emergency contacts to their lock screen, and the Medical ID function of Apple’s Health app allows you to make relevant medical and contact information lock screen-accessible. Opt in to emergency notifications, too: Android settings are under the “Cell Broadcast” header, and iOs settings are in the “Government Alerts” section of the Notifications menu. Back Up Absolutely Everything If you rely on a physical hard drive for important file backups—or worse, don’t back anything up at all—get a cloud backup running ASAP. I use Backblaze, which is perfectly fine, but there are a ton of options out there. If you’re not sure where to start, Lifehacker has a few guides to online backup services that will help. Don’t forget to take photos and/or video of your house, yard, and any other property you have insured in case you need to file claims—and back those up, too. Use Social Media to Your Advantage A physical meeting place is crucial to an IRL emergency plan, but you should have a social media “meeting” plan too—especially if you have out-of-towners worrying about you. Consumer Reports recommends choosing one platform for check-ins and ensuring that every family member has the relevant app installed on their phone. As for far-flung family and friends, designate one person who lives out of the disaster zone as your liaison. Ask this person to be available for check-ins and do the work of updating other concerned parties so you can focus on more important things.","Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Over the course of this conflict, President Trump has emboldened Saudi and emirati leaders. He shares their antipathy for Iran and will sell them virtually any weapon they want. Now, the Trump administration, which also supplies the coalition with intelligence, refueling capabilities and other assistance, is sending mixed signals. While the Pentagon urged the coalition not to attack, a statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday made no such explicit request. Instead, he made clear to the emirate leaders “our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and lifesaving commercial imports.” He mildly called for all sides to work with the United Nations on a political solution. The war began in 2014, when Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the ousted former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of the capital, Sana, and much of the rest of the country. In 2015, the Saudi-led coalition, with President Barack Obama’s backing, launched airstrikes against the Houthi forces. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both Sunni Arab nations, see the Al Hudaydah offensive as a way to break a stalemate in the war and deal a crippling blow to the indigenous Houthis and their backers in Shiite-led Iran, which the Sunnis consider their chief rival for regional influence. They have accused the Houthi rebels of using the port to smuggle in arms, including missiles, allegedly supplied by Iran to attack Saudi Arabia. A United Nations panel has expressed doubt that Al Hudaydah is a weapons transit point, and other experts question whether Iran provided the missiles.",Sudanese forces fighting alongside the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen pressed toward Al Hudaydah on Tuesday.,2018-06-13T02:06:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On the Brink of Disaster in Yemen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/yemen-saudi-attack-port-houthis.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/opinion/13yemenWeb/13yemenWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
ROGER COHEN,"The vote will certainly be closer as maximalist pro-Brexit zealots within her Conservative Party, who want no accommodation with the European Union, realize their insanity could end up delivering the sanity of Britain remaining. Its still more likely, however, that a deal twice defeated will be defeated a third time unless May tries this desperate gambit: Vote for the deal and I will resign March 30. She wont do that.
If her deal finally dies an irrevocable death, May will have to negotiate an extension with the European Union. The union will want to know what the extension beyond March 29 is for. It will probably favor a long extension because a short one is likely to be useless, given that nearly three years of negotiation have produced only mayhem.
Personally, I think an indefinite extension might be the solution lurking in the long grass. That way Britain could remain in the European Union forever while professing to want to leave. Brexit could be Britains Godot. Everyone would be happy.
That wont happen in this dour age. But I suspect a long extension will be granted with the reason for it getting fudged. If its not, no-deal Brexit looms again as imminent (in fact, it looms anyway as one possible outcome at the end of any long extension).
Once this whole mess goes beyond March 29 (many Brits would now prefer summary execution to more talk of Brexit), all bets are off. Britain could find itself voting in theEuropean Parliament election in May, a surreal exercise. In June, three years will have passed since the Brexit vote. Polls suggest opinion has shifted in favor of remaining. I cant imagine a long extension without either a general election or a second referendum: This will have to go back to the people.
I told you we are in Act IV, if that. Oh, yes, the Malthouse Compromise: You dont need to worry, dear reader. It was a fantasy. Whats real is that Britain is better off with more than a half-billion other people in the borderless European miracle that is the union.",This British national disaster has legs.

Aimée Lutkin,"If you have pets, you know they can create a mess. Some of that mess can be vacuumed up by your Roomba, and some of it will create an absolute disaster if it gets eaten by the robot vacuum. You know what I’m talking about. (I’m talking about poop.)

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Hello friends. Friendly reminder that while our financial lives may seem like a disaster and we’re all stressed out about not having enough money, one of the few financial vehicles that actually benefits people who use it is the 401(k). In this story about a study reporting that 66 percent of millennials have $0 saved in their 401(k)s, Vice writes that, “It is worth noting, however, that 401(k)s are generally bullshit.” (Emphasis theirs.) Where to begin. Yes, I understand that 401(k)s aren’t magic. You need money to save money, not everyone has access to them (particularly as freelancers and gig economy workers comprise ever more of the workforce), and it can be overwhelming or seemingly impossible to think about saving for retirement when you have a mountain of student loan debt and your rent eats up half of your paycheck. Employers are much less generous than they used to be, and our retirement crisis exemplifies that all people, of all age groups, have trouble saving money. Defined benefit plans (a.k.a. pensions) were nice when they existed and were properly managed. Ideally, people would be getting more money. I’m not disputing any of this. But there is a general cynicism that permeates certain areas of the web/culture that basically seems to say, well, we’re all screwed, so why even try? I don’t think this is the intent, but I can’t help but see it as a consequence, and it’s irresponsible. If a bunch of publications that you trust tell you that 401(k)s are bullshit, and you don’t know any better, are you going to prioritize contributing to your retirement account? You can be mad about the system while still encouraging people to do what’s in their best interest, which is to put some money away for retirement. Here are some of the study’s other takeaways: Most employed people aged 21 to 32 who are saving for retirement have less than $20,000 saved The average balance is $67,891 83 percent of working Latinos and 70 percent of African Americans have nothing saved Only 55 percent of Millennials are eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, compared to 77 percent of GenXers and 80 percent of Baby Boomers This puts them on par with other generations, per other studies: two-thirds of Americans across generations aren’t putting money into their 401(k) I am not trying to proselytize about 401(k)s and claim that they’re the ideal and ultimate financial product, or that you need to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and do better. As the study indicates, those working may not even have the option to use one, as our employers get ever more stingy. And I can’t make you save—particularly if you do not have the money to save—but I will say this: the system may be bullshit, but 401(k)s aren’t. Publications that are making a point to spotlight growing inequities and the dangers of permalancing and gig economy work—which they absolutely should—also need to take the time to educate people on what they can do to better their finances, particularly if employers and the government won’t. You can throw your hands up in the air and say everything sucks, but at the end of the day, you need money. It’s not something to be cavalier about. So if you are lucky enough to have access to a 401(k) at work and the ability to contribute, then contribute. Even just a tiny bit. Americans are shouldering around $1.48 trillion in student loan debt, and around 70% of college… Read more Read I’m not talking about aiming for the maximum (for 2018, that’s $18,500). But even if you contribute one or two percent of your paycheck, that’s exponentially better than contributing nothing at all. This is true for many reasons: If your employer offers a 401(k), they likely offer an employer match. And you should think of that money as part of your compensation. Would you be ok with your employer paying you $49k instead of $50k when you agreed to the latter? No? It’s the same thing with your 401(k) match. Suddenly your two percent contribution becomes four percent. They should be giving you the money anyway, but they’ve put this requirement on it, so you should do it regardless. If you don’t put in enough to get the match, you’re essentially forfeiting a portion of your salary. It lowers your taxable income, meaning you’re paying less in taxes and therefore taking home more money. Typically fees are lower than if you invested on your own, and you can gain exposure to expensive stocks you wouldn’t be able to otherwise (like the Amazons and Facebooks of the world). Compound! Interest! Please contribute something to yours, especially when you’re young. “If you go back and look at it historically, people who invested in a 401(k) have money in retirement,” says Kevin Dixon, senior market analyst at Market Traders Institute. “They’re incredibly intelligent vehicles. It’s a no-brainer, really.” So: Be mad. Understand that maxing out your retirement account alone likely still won’t be enough to live off of in retirement, and that many of us will be working long after we would like. Fight to keep the safety net in place, and push our government to expand it rather than quietly eroding it piece by piece. Understand your entire financial picture, beyond investing for retirement, and what needs to be done to put you in the best position possible. As the study suggests, lobby lawmakers to loosen ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs benefits) participation restrictions and back your workplace’s union. Demand that politicians institute the fiduciary rule. But don’t be fooled into thinking it’s better to tweet about how screwed we all are than to put a little money away in your 401(k). It might seem painful and fruitless now, but you’ll be better off. Use cynicism to demand more and better, but don’t let it harm your future finances in the meantime.","Hello friends.

Considering how much Los Angeles has been criticized for ignoring its history, this endeavor has drawn some cheers. “This is something of a victory for history, and the often fleeting life of local landmarks,” David L. Ulin, a former book critic for the Los Angeles Times, wrote in an essay celebrating the project. “For my money — or the developer’s — it’s also a welcome sign of Los Angeles growing up.” Continue reading the main story","Tuesday: California-as-Disaster, recreational marijuana, tax problems and the Formosa Cafe lives.",2017-12-26T14:00:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Dark Depictions of a Sunny State,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/us/california-today-dark-depictions-of-a-sunny-state.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/26/us/26californiatoday/26californiatoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
"A.A. Newton on Vitals, shared by A.A. Newton to Lifehacker","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does. As it turns out, a face full of painful lesions—not to mention unsolicited, tone-deaf advice from family and strangers alike—has a way of driving people into hiding. Throw in a whole internet’s worth of unverified anecdotes about banishing acne for good and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Zits are unfair. We didn’t ask for them, we certainly don’t deserve to have them into adulthood,… Read more Read Treating acne is maddening. Even if your breakouts are under control, you may be left with dark spots, red spots, dents, and/or bumps—the ghosts of hell-zits past. Today’s super-saturated skincare market offers thousands of products that claim to fade acne scars, but frankly, very few of them work. Before you drench your face in retinol and acids to fade your acne scars, you should figure out what caused them in the first place—and if they’re even scars at all. What The Heck Are Acne Scars, Anyway? Scar tissue forms when an injury or illness damages your skin’s ability to produce collagen, the protein that gives skin its structure. As Dr. Meghan Feely, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York and New Jersey, explained to me in an email, the same process causes acne scars. Inflammation—redness, pain, and/or swelling—from deep-rooted zits can injure surrounding skin cells, altering the collagen they produce to repair injured skin. Depending on the amount of collagen the damaged cells produce, she explained, patients are left with either atrophic or hypertrophic scars. Atrophic scars happen when acne-damaged skin cells don’t produce enough collagen to refill the injured area, leaving indentations in the skin. Any dimpled, dented texture you notice after a breakout heals is caused by atrophic scarring. Typically, these scars present in one of three patterns: ice-pick (deep and narrow, like pinholes), boxcar (wide and squared-off), and rolling (wide and rounded). The shape and size of atrophic scars depends on the extent of the tissue damage, as well as how your skin typically heals from injury. When acne-damaged skin cells overproduce collagen, they leave hypertrophic scars, which are raised and often shiny. Hypertrophic scars occur more frequently in severe wounds that don’t close early on in the healing process: a surgical incision is less likely to leave a raised scar than, say, a massive cyst that repeatedly gets its head scratched off. However, whether or not you get hypertrophic scars mostly comes down to genetics. If your family members tend to develop raised, bumpy scars, you probably will, too. Generally, only very severe acne leaves scars. Age and family history influence their development to some extent, but according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Diane Madfes, the biggest scarring predictors are the acne’s depth and duration. The deeper the zits, and the longer they go untreated, the more likely they are to cause permanent damage—which acne scars are, unfortunately. If you’re not sure what you’re dealing with, gently run your fingers over the spots in question. If they’re indented or raised, you have acne scars; if they’re smooth, but discolored, you have something else. If My Dark Spots Aren’t Acne Scars, What Are They? Not all breakouts leave scars. Mild lesions may not go deep enough to damage collagen-producing cells, and some deep-rooted zits don’t stick around long enough to cause permanent structural damage. However, inflammation from a breakout can piss off cells closer to the surface of your skin, causing them to function abnormally for awhile. This process is what causes some zits to leave dark or red spots when they heal. The color of a post-acne mark depends on which cells were damaged. Dark spots are caused by damaged melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment that gives our skin its color. These spots are usually brown, but can be purplish or bluish depending on your skin tone. This type of discoloration is called hyperpigmentation. Some breakouts leave red spots when they heal, which is a sign of damaged or irritated surface-level capillaries. Your body’s first response to illness or injury is usually to increase blood flow to the affected area, causing temporary redness and swelling known as erythema. Erythema usually dissipates once a wound has healed, but sometimes capillaries around the healing site are too damaged to immediately return to their normal, pre-injury state. Both of these conditions are caused by inflammation and persist after it clears, so their full names are post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or erythema—PIH or PIE for short. The superficial cell damage behind PIH and PIE is temporary, though the marks can take months or years to fade. If your post-acne marks aren’t clearly brown or red, you can figure out if they’re PIE or PIH by pushing on them gently with a fingertip. PIE temporarily disappears when pressed because doing so cuts off blood flow to the affected capillaries. Unlike blood, melanin is static, so PIH marks will look the same regardless of how much you poke at them. What Can I Do To Prevent Scarring And Pigmentation? The likelihood of developing scars, PIH, and/or PIE is mostly down to genetics, but as Dr. Madfes explains, inflicting additional trauma on already inflamed skin makes things worse: “Some people tend to pick at the acne scar, or the acne bump, because they feel a raised surface. [...] Light trauma should not cause marks, but if someone’s going to pick, try and get out the pus, or manipulate the area, [they’re] going to increase the incidence of scarring and hyperpigmentation.” Anything you can do to encourage proper healing, on the other hand, is good. Besides resisting the urge to squeeze, Dr. Madfes recommends keeping open lesions “moist and covered” until they heal—she specifically says Vaseline is a great wound protectant—and using a moisturizer with ceramides. However, she emphasizes that the best way to prevent picking—and, by extension, PIH/PIE or scars—is to resolve the acne that causes it in the first place. How Do I Get Rid of Them? Mild PIH and PIE—with no accompanying active acne—will resolve with on their own within a year. If that’s too long to wait, sunscreen is the surest way to speed up the fading process. When your skin darkens from sun exposure, your PIH does too; wearing a broad-spectrum, high-SPF formula every day protects your skin from further damage and helps it heal properly. Sunscreen is a wonder of technology. It’s the closest thing we have to an anti-aging miracle, and… Read more Read However, most people who seek treatment for PIH/PIE and scarring also have active acne—and every specialist I spoke to for this story agrees that resolving chronic acne is the first step to treating post-inflammatory marks. Mild acne can be effectively treated with over-the-counter products; Dr. Madfes recommends starting with a product containing micronized benzoyl peroxide like the Acne.org treatment or this cleanser from Differin. Non-micronized particles are too big to penetrate pores, and their irregular size and shape makes them prone to clumping together—which renders the medication less effective and more irritating. The retinoid adapalene —now available over the counter as Differin —effectively treats acne and PIH, as do ingredients like niacinamide and azelaic acid, although to a lesser extent. (I use and love Melazepam, which is a 20% azelaic acid cream.) Whichever treatment you choose, be patient: topical medications take at least three months to show results. Where’s a dermatologist when you need one? A recent investigation by Women’s Health details a… Read more Read Moderate to severe acne benefits from professional intervention, and the earlier, the better. If your insurance covers it, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. If you’re uninsured or have shitty insurance, find a skilled esthetician—a licensed professional who specializes in skincare techniques. Esthetician licensing requirements vary by state, and their individual areas of expertise range from waxing to laser resurfacing, so really do your research: check out their website, do a critical scan of Yelp reviews, and/or get recommendations from friends and family. (This also applies to dermatologists, by the way.) When you request an appointment, specifically ask to see an acne specialist. If there’s a long wait, put your name on the cancellation list and check in every few weeks. At your appointment, give the dermatologist or esthetician a detailed history of your acne—including medications you’ve tried in the past, any you take now, and your tendency to develop PIH, PIE, or scars—so they can decide how best to treat you. Both dermatologists and estheticians aim to resolve acne before treating pigmentation or scarring, but many medications and procedures do both at once. Topical retinoids (tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene) are proven multitaskers, and dermatologists frequently prescribe them to treat acne and hyperpigmentation. (Insurance companies notoriously skimp on topical prescription coverage, so if your tube of tretinoin costs two hundred dollars— not an exaggeration —look for manufacturer coupons and discount pharmacies to lower the price.) For patients with active acne and pigmentation to address, estheticians favor chemical peels. Licensed esthetician and acne specialist Mary Freihofner told me that she uses glycolic, mandelic, and salicylic acid peels for her acne clients with hyperpigmentation—but once the lesions have healed, she thinks microdermabrasion works faster. Erythema may not respond to hyperpigmentation treatments, and in those cases, Freihofner finds Vitamin C peels to be quite effective. A professional facial with a peel usually costs between eighty and two hundred dollars, depending on your location and the specific treatments you choose. If Acne Scars Are Permanent, What Can I Do About the Ones I Have? There are effective ways to treat acne scars, but they don’t come cheap. Since scarring is caused by damaged tissue in the dermis—the middle layer of skin—treating it requires some level of penetration. Many dermatologists, including Dr. Feely and Dr. Madfes, treat acne scarring by way of dermal resurfacing techniques, most of which involve lasers. Certain types of lasers can penetrate the epidermis—the outermost layer of skin—to stimulate collagen-producing cells in the dermis, reducing the appearance of scars over time. Lasers are less invasive than traditional surgical techniques, but all dermal penetration has risks: you don’t want to damage any nerves or blood vessels while you’re poking around down there. This is why laser resurfacing is performed only by specially trained, licensed professionals—and why it’s often expensive. One laser resurfacing session can cost anywhere from a hundred bucks to well over a thousand, depending on how much time under the laser you need. These procedures are elective and not technically medically necessary, so insurance won’t cover them; always get a quote before scheduling a session. You don’t necessarily have to see a dermatologist for laser therapy, though; many skincare clinics offer the same services. Raelle Levicke, a licensed esthetician and laser technician at About Face Skincare in Philadelphia, swears by fractionated lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments. She explained that surface-level treatments—chemical peels, microneedling, and microdermabrasion—are somewhat effective at fading hyperpigmentation, but they literally don’t go deep enough to treat scar tissue. Fractionated lasers are her weapon of choice for acne scars and severe hyperpigmentation, but she prefers IPL treatments for treating erythema. Depending on the case, her patients see results after two to four sessions. I know from experience how horrible it is to feel like you’re doomed to cycle between painful breakouts and scars forever, so if there’s one point I want to really hammer home, it’s this: find a licensed professional who specializes in acne treatment. A dermatologist who’s normally up to their eyeballs in melanomas—or an esthetician who mostly gives relaxing facials—will probably treat you differently than someone with years of experience treating acne. There’s someone out there who can help you—don’t give up until you find them.","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does.

If you need to evenly heat a delicate substance to a precise temperature, the microwave might seem like a horrible choice—but it’s often the best tool for the job. Your cooking and baking, especially, depend a lot on your oven's ability to regulate heat and… Read more Read Traditional heating methods—double boilers, ovens, skillets, and the like—heat food via thermal conduction, so the outer layers necessarily heat before the center does, even with constant whisking or stirring. Uneven heat is the enemy of temperature-reliant processes like tempering chocolate or caramelizing sugar, so an old electric range or uncalibrated oven can really work against you. Double boilers and bains-marie can effectively moderate finicky heat sources, but they could add excess moisture to whatever you’re cooking. In some cases, a little water is no big deal—but in others, it’s the kiss of death. If you’re trying to heat a homogenous liquid to a specific temperature as quickly and evenly as possible, the humble microwave oven won’t let you down. Microwaves work by making water, fat, and sugar molecules spin around like crazy—which releases heat—so they cook the interior of liquids at roughly the same rate as the exterior. (This isn’t true for solid foods, especially frozen items like Hot Pockets, whose molecules are tied up in rigid structures that prevent them from rotating at a consistent rate.) Even better, they’re usually so powerful that whatever temperature increase you’re after happens in mere minutes. Zapping a custard in the microwave feels like cheating—but the results will convert you. I’ve recently started cooking lemon curd in the microwave, and I’m never going back. As custards go, lemon curd is pretty chill; it doesn’t need to be tempered, and all that acid facilitates a smooth emulsion. That forgiving nature makes lemon curd a perfect poster child for this method. If the microwave significantly improves an already-simple process (and it sure does), just think of what it can do for more annoying ones; consider this a gateway drug to the wonderful, low-pressure world of microwaved custard. Microwave Lemon Curd The proportions called for below work perfectly for my tastes—super-tart, with a good hit of salt to balance the sugar, and soft enough to eat like pudding straight from the jar—but if you’re in a committed relationship with a specific lemon curd recipe, use that one. Just don’t skip the microwave, which is kind of the whole point here. A fast-read electronic thermometer will ensure you nail the temperature, but skip it if you’re confident in your ability to eyeball a perfectly-cooked custard. A note on lemon size: the lemons at ALDI have been absolute units as of late, so two of them yielded a generous half-cup of juice and a mountain of zest. If your lemons are smaller, you might need three, or even four. This will make just about a cup and a half of curd, which perfectly fills a repurposed jam jar; it scales well though, so make as much as your heart desires. Ingredients: ½ cup (200 g) granulated sugar ¼ teaspoon table salt Zest and juice of two large or three medium lemons; you need about ½ cup (120 milliliters / 120 grams) of juice 1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk ½ stick (4 ounces, 114 grams, 4 tablespoons) salted butter Instructions: Measure the sugar and salt into a large, microwave-safe bowl or measuring cup. Zest the lemons directly into the sugar and salt, then rub together with your fingertips until everything smells nice and lemony. Pour in the egg, egg yolk, and lemon juice; blitz with a stick blender to combine. (If you don’t have a stick blender, whisk aggressively.) Taste and add a bit more sugar if needed. Transfer the egg-lemon-sugar mixture to the microwave and heat on full power in one-minute increments, stirring between each zap, until it reaches 185ºF (85ºC). Depending on your microwave, this will take anywhere from three to ten minutes—this specific batch took about five. It’s pretty hard to overcook the curd a minute at a time, but if you’re worried about it, just work in 30-second increments. Stir the butter into the hot lemon-egg mixture until fully incorporated, then give the curd one final blitz with the stick blender or whisk. If you see lumps of cooked egg, or just prefer a completely smooth finished product, pour the curd through a fine mesh strainer before transferring to a storage container. Taste once more, adding more sugar, salt, or lemon juice as needed. Cover and cool to room temperature before refrigerating. It’ll keep for a couple weeks in the fridge, but if you’re worried about longevity, lemon curd freezes beautifully. Having lemon curd around in the summertime makes it easy to whip up flavorful, refreshing desserts without spending hours sweating over a hot stove. I especially love it as the main flavoring agent in a lemon cheesecake or tart filling, but it’s also great dolloped on panna cotta or vanilla ice cream. Really, though, you can put it on anything—or just eat it from the jar with a spoon.","No matter how many flawless custards or mirror glazes you’ve made in your life, some culinary techniques just seem to invite disaster, especially those that hinge on precise temperature control.

When you leave the U.S. as an American citizen traveling abroad, you have a few safety nets, and Reddit user u/baccgirl pointed ou t on LifeProTips that you should know what they are before the flight takes off. A huge one is your country’s embassy; before you arrive, make sure you know where that embassy is located in your destination, and what their hours of operation are. Commenter u/ doublestitch added that you might be better off getting that information for your country’s consulate, as embassies general attend to diplomatic matters. But hey, why not both?

U/Baccgirl writes: Have a secure email that you can access while overseas, with scans of important papers. Birth certificate, passport scan, emergency contacts.

After all, if you’ve lost everything, that might include email access. U/ madi154 wrote of their own harrowing experience saved by a paper and pen: Also write down important phone numbers of your family members and the number of the hotel or people you’re staying with and the address. Have multiple papers with this and put this everywhere! Put it in every luggage, wallet and bag you will travel with. You never know when you will need it. For example, my luggage was lost and thankfully I had a paper with the phone number and address of the people I was staying with so that the luggage could get delivered there. Check your passport expiration date You need a valid passport to leave the US, but u/baccgirl writes that many countries “require you to have a minimum of 6 months of validity remaining on your passport AFTER your departure date from that country.” Even if your vacation is only a few weeks long, you need that passport to be valid for much, much longer. Just check the numbers in advance so you don’t get sent home from the airport extremely disappointed. Register your trip in case of emergency There was also a recommendation from u/swild89, who commented, “I’ll add to that—register your travel itinerary with the government. You can plan everything you want, but if an emergency strikes, you are prepared.” In the US, this is called the STEP program, and it make the embassy in the country you’re visiting aware you’re there in case of emergency. If there is danger in the area you’ll be notified, and in the event of a natural disaster, you’ll be accounted for. Be ready to roll with the punches Some commenters complained that all these tips were actually just advising people to go overboard and ruin their vacation with worry. As u/ RunninADorito wrote: Being fully and completely prepared is both impossible and stupid. The idea that traveling to a different country requires a crazy amount of preparation is the wrong mindset. If you’re going to France you might want to do X. If you’re going to Cambodia do Y.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.

GAIL COLLINS,"Wow, Trump’s new lawyer talks just like him. So it comes down to this: The $130,000 that Stormy Daniels got to keep quiet during the campaign was from Trump. But it was not an illicit campaign contribution. Nonono, it was simply a charitable attempt to protect Melania from a broken heart. To come to this conclusion you would only have to do two things: A) Forget that on Thursday Giuliani said it had to be paid because “Imagine if that came out … in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton.” B) Conclude that in buying off Stormy, Donald Trump was much, much more concerned about his wife’s feelings than about getting elected president. Trump and Giuliani go way back. They’re New Yorkers with lots in common, including three wives each, and a history of messy public breakups. (Trump carried on the adulterous affair that ended his first marriage, a story he promoted to the New York tabloids. Giuliani once announced his separation to the press corps before he told his wife.) The president reportedly bragged that he was hiring “America’s mayor” as his first line of defense. It was, of course, a reference to Giuliani’s role leading New York City after 9/11. During a recovery made even more difficult by the fact that Rudy had insisted on putting the city’s emergency command center in the World Trade Center, which had already been bombed by terrorists once and which the police warned was a terrible location. Both men hyped their post-9/11 activities, each in his own special way. Trump seems to have imagined he visited the ruins immediately after the attack. Rudy did go there repeatedly, taking visitors to watch the workers who were laboring to clear the site in the toxic dust without protective gear. Back then, what would you have said if someone told you that Mayor Giuliani would eventually devote his legal skills to defending President Donald Trump from a porn star scandal? Yet here we are. Part of their rapidly evolving line of defense involves Trump giving Michael Cohen a kind of monthly retainer that he could dip into any time somebody needed to be paid off. “These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth,” Trump tweeted.","On Friday, President Trump added to the confusion about payments to Stormy Daniels by stating that everything said “has been said incorrectly.”",2018-05-05T00:43:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Op-Ed Columnist: Don and Rudy, Disaster Twins",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/trump-giuliani-disaster-twins.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/opinion/05collinsWeb/05collinsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

The death toll following the tsunami caused by the Anak Krakatau volcano has risen to at least 373, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says.
Saturday saw giant waves crash into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java. 
It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves.
""1,459 people are injured, while 128 remain missing,"" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a statement.
Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami.
Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke.
Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. 
What warning was given?
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami is a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. 
""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater.
On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. 
But, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.
He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. 
Why was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?
The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
Seawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.

The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.
Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing. 
Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.
How did the tsunami happen?
By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent
Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. 
In other words, it's been part of the background. 
And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.
The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. 
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit
Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.
Krakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)
Image copyrightOystein Lund Andersen
In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people
Thousands more were killed by hot ash
The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared

ELISA GABBERT,"The phrase “I do,” in the context of a marriage ceremony, is what linguists call a “performative utterance” — words that don’t simply mean or imply but actually enact a change. There are some words powerful enough that, when a president utters them, we might think they amount to a performative utterance, too: For the chief executive to call something a “disaster” in public, for instance, might suggest that a formal disaster declaration will follow. Except lately. During the Oct. 9, 2016, presidential debate, the candidate Donald Trump said “disaster” 17 times. The 17 things that Trump characterized as disasters were, in order: inner cities, Obamacare, single-payer health care plans, Obamacare, Obamacare, Iraq, taxes, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton again, Libya, Hillary Clinton’s foreign-policy record, Aleppo, Nafta, Nafta, education, Hillary Clinton’s political performance in upstate New York and jobs. Since that night, he has used the word “disaster” on Twitter with slightly less frequency — just 31 times. Last year there was a record-breaking pileup of multibillion-dollar “megadisasters,” including wildfires, tornadoes and flooding, but only three of the president’s tweets referred to such events. “Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc.,” he wrote in one, after Hurricane Irma. “A real disaster, much work to do!” The oddly cheerful tone of this tweet aside, the word “real” was an interesting addition, a seeming acknowledgment of the distance between a true disaster and Trump’s preferred, mostly rhetorical usage, which designates its recipient as a laughable mess, a high-profile embarrassment. Merriam-Webster does offer two contemporary definitions for disaster. One is “a sudden calamitous event bringing great damage, loss, or destruction,” as in “natural disasters.” The other is more hyperbolic, in the Trumpian sense: “a sudden or great misfortune or failure,” as in (the dictionary’s example) “The party was a disaster.” This second flavor leaves plenty of room for subjective evaluation of the failure in question.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months. Now the 900,000 people who settled in refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar are facing another threat: heavy rain and landslides as the monsoon season picks up. The monsoon has been dubbed one of the most important climate patterns in the world. The rains spread from southeast to northwest over the course of the summer, nourishing fields across South Asia that provide food for many of the 1.76 billion people who live there. But they also pose an existential threat to refugees. As the refugee camps swelled, the forests in and around them quickly vanished as people sought wood for housing and building fires to cook. Makeshift structures of bamboo and tarps sprung up. Ditches were also dug for sanitation. Now with the onset of monsoon season, the haphazard infrastructure and lack of ground cover has put people living in the camps in grave danger as the rains have picked up. “Last week there was a strong monsoon depression over North Bay of Bengal which cause heavy rains over Cox Bazar area,” Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, told Earther. The United Nations reported that more than 15 inches of rain fell between Sunday and Tuesday, the equivalent of what normally falls over 20 days in June. With no trees to slow the runoff, 37 landslides occurred that affected 11,000 people. The Guardian indicates at least three are dead following the rains. Aerial mapping done by the United Nations shows an estimated 200,000 refugees could be at risk of landslides and floods, and more than 41,000 of them are living in areas with a high risk of landslides. In addition to the physical dangers, waterborne diseases are a growing risk, particularly without adequate sanitation. Acharya said the forecast for the rest of the monsoon season indicates increased odds of more rainfall that normal. That increases the risk of landslides, which is why the United Nations is pushing ahead for what they’re referring to as “mid-term shelters” with concrete moorings built on flat ground that can withstand the heavy rains and some landslides. “We need government approval for mid-term shelters and in view of the current weather and urgency to quickly provide more shelters to relocate families most at risk of landslides, we are focussing [sic] on this right now,” Caroline Gluck, a senior public information officer with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in Cox’s Bazar, told Earther. The agency has also been working to help get families upgraded shelter kits including tarps, wire, rope, and bamboo. These kits have been supplied to more than 185,000 households. While they offer a modicum more security against the rains, they’re no match for landslides or winds that could come if a tropical cyclone hits the camp—a distinct risk. According to data maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 63 tropical systems have passed within 100 nautical miles of Cox’s Bazar. The most recent to make a nearby landfall was a tropical depression that hit in October 2011. One of the biggest impediments to speeding the whole process up is money. Earlier this year, the United Nations requested $951 million to “meet the immediate needs of more than 880,000 refugees and over 330,000 Bangladeshis in communities affected by the crisis.” Of that $136.6 million would be used for shelters. To date, only 13 percent of that funding has been provided.","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Maddie Stone to Gizmodo","By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of the most vulnerable among us. A landmark report released on Sunday sets the clock ticking for humanity and its quest to keep global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlines what a world warmed by 1.5 degree Celsius would look like compared with the 2 degree Celsius warmer world enshrined in the Paris Agreement, and the pathways to get there. It shows that a 1.5 degree warmer world is much less brutal than a 2 degree warmer one, and that we have a lot of work to do in a very limited time in order to achieve it. If we fail, the poorest among us will suffer the most. Our world has already warmed about 1 degree Celsius since the start of our carbon pollution bender. Based this observation and physics, scientists have crafted a carbon budget for meeting the 1.5 degree Celsius goal. In the new report, they lay out the pathways to get there. In the most hopeful scenario, innovations in efficiency and technology spur huge drops in energy demand, speeding along decarbonization of the energy system and obviating the need for unproven carbon capture technology. In another, nations harmoniously comes together and we shift to a more sustainable lifestyle and buy less tchotchke. We need a little carbon capture to help do some mop up, but with the kumbaya spirit, anything is possible. If technological innovation or emissions continue on their current trajectory, though, efforts to cap warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius become dicier. Well need more carbon capture, more reforestation and more converting crops to biofuels that sequester carbon. In one scenario, the world would have to convert slightly less than the equivalent of the entire U.S. into a biofuel sacrifice zone. All scenarios that limit warming to 1.5 degrees require massive global investments: on the order of $2.4 trillion annually from 2016-2035. For comparison, the world spent roughly $280 billion installing renewable energy last year. Were talking an order of magnitude more commitment on top of rejiggering the entire global economy, though one that could come with massive financial upside. These systems transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors, the report states. But the scientists who wrote the report are undeterred. In fact, the granular nature of the report, which looked at over 6,000 studies, white papers, and policy documents, is a helpful way to think about the various levers we have at our disposal to address carbon pollution. Theres a perspective that somehow theres one solution to climate change. Theres not, Kristie Ebi, a University of Washington scientist and lead author the summary for policymakers of the new report, told Earther. Theres a million solutions. When you look at each one of these, they can be relatively small. Its when you put them together that become large and powerful. The report also makes a powerful moral argument for reducing emissions, as well as the inevitable adaptation efforts that will be necessary. Page after page, it lays out how the poor will disproportionately suffer from global warming and how much of a difference a half a degree could make. The reports authors note that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050. We often talk about 2 degrees of warming as safe. But what 2 degrees really means is that we lose coral, see massive ecological upheaval, ocean acidification, and multiple feet of sea level rise. Its a few threads away from the complete unraveling of a planetary fabric thats allowed humans to thrive. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will still result in planet-wide suffering. Instead of losing all coral with 2 degrees Celsius, the report shows well lose 70-90 percent of them. Most low-lying islands will become uninhabitable. Both scenarios call for courage and hard work to avert the worst while still preparing to deal with some awful things. And well know if were on track in 12 years time. To keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, emissions will have to drop roughly 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030. All of us can make some lifestyle choices to start to bend the curve. But its largely government policies and actions to address the larger economic system today thatll set the course for humanity. The world 50 years ago was different from today, Natalie Mahowald, another lead author of the report from Cornell University, said. In 50 years, its going to be very different. This is our chance to decide what that world will look like. Unfortunately, good decision making has been in short supply at this crucial juncture. The Trump administrationwhich heads the worlds largest historical emitteris using the argument that a million actions are needed to address climate change to justify precisely the opposite as well as its intent to pull out of the Paris Agreement. Speaking of, most countries arent on track to meet their wholly inadequate pledges to the agreement. Current policies will result in a world thats up to 3.7 degree Celsius (a devilish 6.66 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by 2100, upping the risk that well have to put more eggs in the carbon capture basket or the even more disconcerting reflecting sunlight back into space to cool the planet basket. Kumbaya feels a long ways away. The new report comes two months before the next major international climate conference will be held in Poland. That conference is meant to outline how governments will ramp up actions to address climate change. While Im not naive enough to think a single report alone will change the course of history, Im glad that world leaders will have a reminder of the stakes of their actions.","By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of the most vulnerable among us.

KIRK SEMPLE,"The militarys handling of the throng at the pipeline revealed what he called a lack of technical capacity and policy, and said the troops should have been better prepared to handle the situation.
The circumstances in which the tragedy happened where you have massive theft, in the middle of a national battle against fuel theft made clear he doesnt know where to draw the line between protecting people and continuing the fight against the bad guys, Mr. Navalón said.
As part of the crackdown, which was launched in December, the administration shut down oft-targeted pipelines, shifting the transportation of fuel to tanker trucks. But that tactic caused distribution problems and widespread shortages at service stations.
Survivors of the pipeline explosion and other witnesses said some of the victims had gone to the pipeline rupture with their gasoline canisters because shortages had left them without fuel for their vehicles.
The widespread supply problems have left some observers with the sense the López Obrador administration had launched the crackdown without adequate planning.

ALAN HENRY,"You probably already know that you should keep supplies and an emergency kit on hand for the most common types of emergencies your community may face, but those kits are designed to be helpful only for the first hours or days — ideally just long enough for you to get help or for help to get to you. Even if you have a sizable stockpile of supplies, you’re going to need help from other people sooner rather than later. Mr. Stripling said that most search and rescue after a disaster is done by people in their communities, long before professionals arrive. However, a lot of the support structures that foster the sense of community that led people to look out for one another have degraded, Mr. Stripling said, and it’s up to individuals to bring them back to life. “We have fewer stores and more social media addicts — and that’s tough from a preparedness standpoint since disasters are inherently geographical,” he said. “In a disaster, more people will survive if your neighborhood is resilient — tightly connected, with lots of knowledge about who lives there and lots of strong institutions. ” Photo Credit Ángel Franco/The New York Times Before you go knocking on doors however, make a plan — not about how you’ll persuade your neighbors exactly, but what you’ll actually ask of them. How to get started Instead of going door-to-door to rally neighbors, you’ll find more success if you piggyback on existing institutions to organize people in times of need, Mr. Stripling said. “Disaster research shows that tight-knit communities with strong, locally driven organizations respond better in disaster situations,” he said. “That means that any work you do to build community, from strengthening a P.T.A. to starting a local business that serves as a community hub, will naturally help your neighborhood be better prepared. “That’s a key point to focus on. These civic institutions or schools or churches not only enrich our lives day to day, they help to save our lives when disaster strikes. And many of them are not as strong as they used to be.” In short, don’t reinvent the wheel. There’s little need to build something you’ll then have to persuade people to come to when you could get involved with a local P.T.A., sports team, church, book club or neighborhood watch. Mr. Stripling even suggested getting involved with a local coffee shop, day care, or just a group of friends you get drinks with periodically if you can’t find a community group to join. Your next step is to put disaster prep on the agenda of the group you’ve connected with. That doesn’t mean taking over or dragging out a stodgy set of doom-and-gloom talking points. Try to have fun, Mr. Stripling said. “You can schedule a disaster-focused P.T.A. meeting, or a bar trivia night about disasters. Honestly, people do that!” he said. “Your local coffee shop could host a Godzilla Awareness Party. Your small group can help bring people in using an ‘each one reach one’ approach around the neighborhood — and most localities have emergency management teams that would be thrilled to speak at an event like that.” Photo Credit Bryan Oller/Associated Press What to include in your community disaster plan Once you have a group of interested people and a venue to get everyone talking, it’s time to start thinking about what your community’s plan will include. That said, don’t get caught up in the specifics. The point is to get people aware of the possible disasters your community will face, and get them ready and willing to help and take care of one another in a crisis. “The most important thing to understand is that planning for these sorts of things is about the process, not any final document,” Mr. Stripling explained. “Because disasters are chaotic, you’re probably not going to have a lot of reading time, right? So, it’s important to get your group ready to improvise. Building your group into a team that can react to different types of events is more important than being ready to run any one evacuation plan.” He outlined three major components of a good community disaster prep plan: 1. Make sure everyone has more than one way to reach one another. Cellphone numbers are great, but remember that in an emergency, cellular networks will probably be overloaded. If you have a signal but can’t place a mobile call, text messages and walkie-talkie apps use far less mobile data and are more likely to get through. In every case, however, old-fashioned landlines are ideal, since they can be used without power. Mr. Stripling also suggested that getting into amateur or HAM radio is helpful, especially for times when traditional communication networks are down. Finally, don’t forget old-fashioned rendezvous points. If you have no communications at all, it’s critical to have a spot everyone knows to meet up just to make sure everyone is safe. 2. Learn about the hazards and most likely disasters in your area. Not every region is prone to the same types of disasters. If you live on the coast, make sure you talk about plans for coastal storms and flooding. If you live in the Midwest, make sure you’re all on the same page about tornadoes and catastrophic storms. Western state residents may want to talk about mudslides and wildfires. Everyone should probably discuss things like terrorism or other man-made disasters. In every case, people respond better in an emergency if they’ve talked about possible threats before they occur. “It’s also incredibly important to understand that disasters don’t impact people equally — they tend to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities,” Mr. Stripling said. “So you need to understand the vulnerabilities in your neighborhood — things like poverty, housing discrimination or unequal transportation access — since these elements often point to where the worst consequences will occur.” 3. Understand your neighborhood and how your neighbors can help one another. If everyone is going to rely on one another, think about what is convenient and makes sense for each person. “Maybe one neighbor runs a store and could help stock food supplies for the whole team, and another has a vacation home or relative’s house that could serve as a rendezvous point,” Mr. Stripling said. “The neighbor who lives within walking distance of the school could be in charge of kid pickup if transportation goes down. Or someone owns an S.U.V. or boat that could help evacuation procedures. Everyone brings something to the table — and the more diversity your team has, the more powerful it will be.” Ideally, everyone in your community will be willing to pitch in with their own unique skills, abilities and perspectives to help everyone stay safe and protected. Additionally, while everyone should pool resources in a way that makes sense, you should all be willing to back one another up, even if it doesn’t seem like a particular role is your best fit. If the neighbor responsible for kid pickup is out of town when a blizzard hits, someone else should be ready to step in. Best of all, the closer and more tight knit you are before a disaster, the more you’ll be willing to cover the gaps when one happens. Be ready before help arrives Most of us are taught that in an emergency, first responders like police officers, emergency medical personnel and firefighters will be the first ones to get there and help victims. In reality, bystanders and neighbors are usually first — and in the best position to help save lives — especially after a disaster significant enough that it may take time for those emergency workers to arrive. Mr. Stripling suggested reading the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s “ Until Help Arrives ” program and sharing it with your community group. Similarly, he pointed to the New York City Health Department’s Bystander Training Course as another useful resource even for people who don’t live in New York. Keep in mind that most disasters are much worse for people who are already the most at risk. For example, elderly neighbors, people who live alone, or people with disabilities that make evacuation difficult. Make sure people in your group know who in the area may need a helping hand if disaster strikes, and check in on them or be ready to help them evacuate. Mr. Stripling also noted that this extends beyond storms, earthquakes or catastrophic events. Consider that extreme heat waves or cold snaps claim more lives every year than many other “traditional” disasters, and plan to take care of one another accordingly.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

TRIP GABRIEL,"“They railroaded him,” said Steve Blair, a retiree who worked in mines run by Mr. Blankenship when he was the chief executive of the Massey Energy Company, once the largest coal producer in central Appalachia. “The federal government turned everybody loose to testify against him, just to get rid of him.” Mr. Blair, 61, wearing a West Virginia University cap, forked up his steak and eggs at a Bob Evans restaurant recently in Logan. The town, once a Democratic stronghold, is emblematic of how vehemently voters in Appalachia have rejected the national party: Mr. Blair voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but four years later, the sitting president lost the Democratic primary in Logan County to a protest candidate in a Texas prison. A burly man who is certain in his views, Mr. Blair had a ready explanation for the long decline of the coal industry. “One word: Obama,” he said. “I was put out of business by Obama.” Mr. Blankenship claims that the federal government, not the coal company, is to blame for the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine near Montcoal, W.Va. Investigators found no evidence to support his claims, but he is running for office in an era of nationwide voter credulity for conspiracy theories. And his candidacy is unfolding in a state where many people embrace a sense of persecution over coal’s decline. Economists say that a host of factors are responsible, chiefly the abundance of cheap natural gas, which has undercut coal in the energy marketplace. But that is not what many West Virginians choose to hear. “What hurt coal was the Obama administration and nothing else,” said Denny Harton, a retired business owner who introduced Mr. Blankenship recently at one of his rallies. Photo The explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch Coal Mine near Montcoal, W. Va., the state’s deadliest mine accident in decades, killed 29 miners. Emergency workers responded to the scene in April 2010. Credit Jeff Gentner/Associated Press Dianne Dewey White, chairwoman of the Republican Party of Logan County, said thousands of miners who once looked to Mr. Blankenship for work are likely to support him now. “You wouldn’t believe what good parties they had, and what times they had,” she said. “They spent a lot of good years with him. People don’t forget that.” Coal barons like Mr. Blankenship used to be despised in Logan County, a rugged region in southern West Virginia. The Battle of Blair Mountain happened here in 1921, when miners seeking to unionize clashed with a private army fielded by mine owners, and more than 50 people died. But as West Virginia has become a deep-red state, the sympathies of many mine families have shifted from unions to mine operators, who are portrayed as job creators. “I have heard people say, ‘When Don was in charge, we always worked,’” said R. Booth Goodwin II, who prosecuted Mr. Blankenship as a United States attorney and then ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2016. “The coal industry is still perpetuating a lie that coal mining is coming back, and it’s going to be just like it was before, when all objective evidence is to the contrary,” he said. Mr. Blankenship, 67, is up against two more conventional candidates — Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins — in the Republican primary in May. He said he is prepared to spend whatever it takes on the race, and his pockets are deep: In his last years at Massey Energy, he was reportedly paid $38.2 million. Opponents who once dismissed his candidacy now see him as a credible threat in the Trump era, positioned to appeal to many West Virginians’ resentment of elites of any kind. “There’s a pride in the state, deep inside, that comes from people dumping on it so long,” said an aide to Senator Joe Manchin III, the Democratic incumbent who will face the winner of the Republican primary in November. Mr. Manchin once said that Mr. Blankenship “has blood on his hands” because of Upper Big Branch, the worst mining disaster in the United States in 40 years. Some West Virginians speculate that Mr. Blankenship is running to pursue a vendetta against Mr. Manchin, who was governor at the time the mine exploded. Although Mr. Manchin is the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, he is still expected to face a tough re-election race in the state, where Donald J. Trump won 68 percent of the vote in 2016. Mr. Blankenship dismisses talk of a vendetta. “If I wanted to get Senator Manchin, I’d just go out and slam him, like he did me, put national TV ads on,” he said in an interview. “I’m trying to win an election.” Through a spokesman, Mr. Manchin declined to be interviewed. “Out of respect for our coal miners and their families who are still grieving the loss of their loved ones, I will not comment on Don Blankenship,’’ he said in a statement. “West Virginians know the facts, and the jury has spoken.” Mr. Blankenship was convicted of a misdemeanor count of conspiracy in 2015 after the jury heard that federal safety inspectors had written hundreds of safety violations for the Upper Big Branch mine, and former miners described unsafe conditions there. On the campaign trail, Mr. Blankenship charges that “the Obama government blew up the Upper Big Branch mine.” He maintains that the explosion happened because federal inspectors had ordered the company to install an ineffective ventilation system. Photo A memorial in Whitesville, W.Va., dedicated to the miners who died in the Upper Big Branch disaster. Some relatives of the victims have been critical of Mr. Blankenship’s Senate run. Credit Ty Wright for The New York Times None of the several investigations conducted by state, federal and independent authorities support Mr. Blankenship’s theory on the mine disaster. Instead, investigators found that mine management failed to prevent a combustible buildup of coal dust, which was ignited by faulty machinery to create a fireball. After completing his prison time at the Taft Correctional Institution in California, Mr. Blankenship declared in court papers that his primary residence was in Las Vegas. The car that brought him to a recent appearance in Parkersburg, W.Va., was a luxury BMW sedan with Tennessee plates. To many relatives of the miners who were killed, his re-emergence in coal country is a source of bitter pain. Gary and Patty Quarles, who are raising a grandson after their son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was killed at Upper Big Branch, described their anguish at watching Mr. Blankenship’s TV ads, titled “For the Sake of Coal Miners.” “We’re sitting here in our living room with our grandson, and there he sets up on TV — that’s sickening,” said Mr. Quarles, who also worked in Massey Energy coal mines. “Don can say what he wants to about safety and doing all this and that for miners — there was no safety in Massey coal. None whatever.” “All they know is to lie, cheat and outlaw,” he added. At a barbershop on Main Street in Logan, the county seat, customers with ties to mining tended to react negatively to Mr. Blankenship’s candidacy, while the barber, Chad Browning, was studiedly neutral. “Coal is king in this county,” said Mr. Browning, 45. “There’s nothing else here.” In his shop in the former bus station, a haircut is $10 and a poster for a Kiwanis pancake breakfast is taped to the mirror. The street outside is a shadowy canyon of tired brick buildings, with a tattoo parlor nearby and a pawnshop offering “Loans, Guns, Ammo.” Only one UPS truck stops to make deliveries on Main Street these days, Mr. Browning said, where once there were three. The UPS driver, Mike Workman, 46, the son of a coal miner, watched Mr. Browning apply hot lather to a customer and shave his neck with a straight razor. Mr. Workman lamented how the conflict over coal, between protecting jobs and protecting the environment, had become so bitter. “It’s a political war, but to us it’s not a political war — we’re just trying to make a living,” he said. “I don’t think there’s nobody in West Virginia that wants to see the streams tainted. I’m a fisherman and a hunter. We love this area. This is where our kids play. We drink the water here.” He said he could not vote for Mr. Blankenship. “I’ve had family in the mining industry; they know that he puts production above safety,” he said. In the barber’s chair, Bob Lucas, 52, who works in a coal processing plant, said he could not support Mr. Blankenship, either. Mr. Lucas was once an electrician at a Massey-owned mine, where he said he was asked to take shortcuts that would compromise safety. Rather than do that, he said, he quit the job. Mr. Lucas said the mine’s managers lived in fear of a visit from Mr. Blankenship, who would descend on the site by helicopter. “When Don flew in, they were terrified,” he said.

George Dvorsky,"This past Saturday, a tanker transporting oil from Iran to South Korea collided with a freighter about 160 miles off the coast of Shanghai. The tanker, filled with 130 tons of highly volatile condensate crude, has been burning for the past three days, raising fears of an environmental catastrophe. As Reuters reports, the tanker, named Sanchi, collided with a Hong Kong-registered freighter off China’s eastern coast. The tanker’s crew of 32 are missing; one unidentified body has been recovered. The freighter, which was carrying U.S. grain, experienced little damage, and all 21 of its crew members have been rescued. The Sanchi, owned by National Iranian Tanker Co, was en route to South Korea when the collision happened. The tanker has been burning for three straight days as rescue crews struggle to bring the blaze under control. It’s filled with 136,000 tons (about 1 million barrels) of highly volatile condensate oil worth about $60 million, reports Reuters. If a spill happens, it would be the worst oil spill since 1991, when 260,000 tons of oil spilled off the Angolan coast. Officials don’t yet know whether condensate has leaked from the tanker. Officials with China’s Ministry of Transport and Maritime Safety did not say when the fire might be put out. Bad weather and toxic fumes are making it difficult for crews to access the tanker. As noted, the ship is filled with an ultra-light crude condensate— a type of oil that condenses into a liquid after it’s extracted (the condensate in the Sanchi came from crude oil). Condensates are used to produce products like petrol, jet fuel, and heating fuels. It’s colorless and odorless, but more flammable than conventional oil. “Gas condensates represent the ‘light ends’ of oil—that is, the low molecular weight compounds that are highly volatile and flammable, and very similar to gasoline,” Peter Hodson, a professor in the Department of Biology and School of Environmental Studies at Queen’s University, told Gizmodo via email. “The hazards from a spill include fire and explosion (the circumstance at the site of the accident) and rapid mortality of any surface animals (marine birds and marine mammals), or fish and invertebrates just underneath the surface (top 10 meters of water).” Hodson says that, as long as the condensates continue to be released from the ship, the risk of these effects will be very high. But once the ship stops leaking (when it’s emptied of oil), these risks will decrease quickly. That’s because condensates evaporate and are diluted in air, and the condensates dissolved in water will be rapidly diluted to below the threshold of toxicity. “The risk to oil spill responders is obviously high during the spill and fire, and if there is no one left on the ship, it may be simplest to let it burn out,” added Hodson. “However, the heat of the fire may destroy the hull, allowing heavy fuel oil in the ship’s tanks to leak. The heavy fuel oil is also flammable, and could burn if exposed to the condensate fire—surface slicks at the Deepwater Horizon spill were treated with burning agents to reduce their size. If the heavy oil leaks, it will create the typical conditions that we associate with traditional ship wrecks, i.e., a heavy black oil slick, oil coating of birds and marine mammals, and a residue that may ultimately contaminate shorelines or sink and contaminate bottom sediments.” Babatunde Anifowosem, a senior lecturer in petroleum and environmental technology at the University of Coventry in the UK, told CNN that an explosion would be the worst outcome. After a blast, the oil would seep out beneath the surface of the water, making cleanup much more difficult, he said. An explosion would also spread more toxic fumes, which could spread inland and trigger respiratory problems among vulnerable populations. According to Reuters, China has sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, while South Korea has sent a helicopter. U.S. Navy military craft have also been brought into help with the rescue operations. The cause of the collision is still not known, but the Sanchi was traveling in waters not frequently traversed by large vessels, which typically travel closer to the Chinese coast or nearer to Japan.

Andrew Liptak,"Last year, Airbnb unveiled a program called Open Homes, designed to allow Airbnb hosts to provide emergency housing after a disaster. Homeowners can allow refugees or evacuees to find housing on a short notice — for free. The company is now expanding that program (via Techcrunch ) with a pilot project that will allow hosts to list their properties ahead of a disaster. The idea is to streamline the response to a disaster by allowing hosts to sign up in advance, so that when a disaster does strike, those in need don’t necessarily have to wait for said hosts to come forward in the aftermath. Presently, the program matches up users willing to donate space with emergency managers, who can then connect people who need housing with available space. Airbnb hopes that having a list prior to a disaster will allow for a quicker response from its users. The program also comes with some “in person preparedness training and recruitment events” for hosts, as well as a marketing campaign and new protocols for communicating with local emergency management to match up available space with those who need it. Airbnb made the announcement at this year’s US Conference of Mayors Annual Meeting in Boston. The pilot project is launching first with the city of San Jose, California, and the company says that it’ll be looking to expand to other cities as well. Given the rocky relations that the company has with some cities, the project has the ability to create a considerable amount of goodwill: it says that since the program launched in 2017, its collective community has donated 17,000 nights for those in need.","Last year, Airbnb unveiled a program called Open Homes, designed to allow Airbnb hosts to open their homes to those in need after an emergency.

 The blast ripped open a whole section of the block of flats
It was New Year's Eve and families were fast asleep when an explosion tore through their apartment block, bringing down 10 storeys in a matter of seconds.
Forty-eight flats were destroyed in this no-frills 1970s building typical of communist Soviet-era housing. 
""The roar woke me up and my husband shouted,"" said Yelena Kruglyakova, asleep with her husband and three-year-old son in a flat on the fourth floor.
""I rushed to the sofa-bed. It was broken and part of the floor had collapsed into the flat below. My little boy was dangling over the edge, clinging on to the bedsheet.""
Somehow the boy clawed his way up the sheet to safety and the family survived.
Thirty-nine people did not, when the block came crashing down in an apparent gas explosion shortly after 06:00 in Magnitogorsk, a bleak industrial city in Russia's Urals region.

The temperature was below -20C as shivering, dazed survivors picked their way out of the rubble in their night clothes.
Instead of celebrating the New Year, the city was plunged into mourning.
Even without such disasters life is tough in Magnitogorsk, 1,695km (1,053 miles) east of Moscow. In the 1930s Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin made it a steel production centre, closed to foreigners. 
Now the city is struggling with heavy pollution, chronic traffic jams and industrial decline.

 Flats adjacent to the devastated block were also damaged by the blast
For days the number of casualties climbed as rescuers searched the collapsed building for the missing. 
Anxious relatives had to endure a painfully long wait.
It was dangerous, painstaking work as bodies were brought out of the mountain of rubble.

Miraculously an 11-month-old boy, critically ill, was found after more than 30 hours in the freezing cold. Ivan is now recovering in intensive care in a Moscow hospital. 
But tragically just a handful of others were pulled out alive of a block that had been home to 120 people.
The official list of fatalities only appeared on 3 January.

 The mountain of debris was a daunting challenge for rescuers
Officials quickly ruled out foul play, blaming the explosion on a gas leak. No traces of explosive were found.
Six young children were among the 39 dead, including three from one family from Tajikistan. 
Only the father survived: Shukhrat Ulfatov, 26, was severely hurt and is now reported to be in a coma. 
He had been buried in the rubble for about eight hours.
His 24-year-old wife Rajabmo died along with three-year-old Mukhamad, Fotima who was four, and Akhmat, aged six.
Twenty-one of the victims were women.

Another young family was also wiped out: Anastasia and Igor Kramarenko, both aged 31, and their 18-month-old daughter, Milana.
Viktor and Tatyana Antilov, in their 30s, died with their 19-month-old daughter Ulyana.
The sixth young child who died was Danil Tinibayev, aged four and a half. 
Two brothers in their 30s - Denis and Dmitry Kremlyov - died along with their parents Yelena and Andrei.

 A makeshift memorial at the scene will be replaced eventually by a permanent one
A rescue team called Legion-SPAS published the victims' birthdates on VKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook.
Olga Skvortsova, a 43-year-old music teacher, died in the flat of a friend, who had left for work just before the blast happened. 
Another friend of Olga's, quoted by the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, remembered her as a cheerful, hard-working and self-reliant person. Now Olga's teenage daughter Katya has to cope with funeral arrangements.
Traumatised survivors are being sheltered at a local school and have received warm clothes. 
The local Chelyabinsk region is giving the families of those killed 1m-rouble (£11,600; $14,700) assistance payments. 
As the search for survivors came to an end on Thursday there was some good news from the disaster scene. Rescuers found a dog and a cat and brought them to safety.

 The dog was found in the rubble four days after the blast
Gas explosions are quite common in Russia, which struggles with much infrastructure dating from the communist era. But this was a cruelly devastating one.
A survivor called Zoya said that the loud bang woke her up, but she thought something had fallen down in her mother's room, next door.
""Mum said 'the block has collapsed'. I just thought she was being plagued by childhood memories of the war,"" Zoya said. 
""I even started arguing with her, I thought it could be a firecracker. So I went back to sleep, but then acquaintances phoned us and said our block of flats had collapsed,"" she said.

Johnny Lieu,"There's always a story out there you can't make up. It certainly applies to The Disaster Artist, which is based on the true story of the ever-enigmatic Tommy Wiseau and his best-worst movie ever, The Room. SEE ALSO: A delightful side-by-side comparison of 'The Room' and 'The Disaster Artist' The writers behind The Disaster Artist, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, unpacked the truth behind the film in an interview with Slashfilm. Much of the film was based off The Room actor Greg Sestero's memoir, but the writers also listened to audio recordings made by Wiseau, and watched behind-the-scenes footage from the making of The Room. Still, test audiences who watched the film weren't so convinced the film was based on a true story, according to Neustadter. ""I think we were fascinated by the real. In this particular case – I guess in most cases – the real is way more interesting than anything we’re going to come up with. It's crazy. It’s funny, because when we were testing this movie initially with an audience of people, the one thing that they said at the end, which we couldn’t believe, was that they didn’t think any of this was true."" It seems like the pairing of Seth Rogen and James Franco in The Disaster Artist didn't help their case. ""Even though it says, ‘Based on a True Story,’ they just thought it was another Franco/Rogen [project], making something up and a funny character they were doing. The side by sides — some people still watch this movie and cannot believe, until the side-by-sides, that there is footage out there like what we shot. So that’s something that I think we, in telling the story, were cognizant of. Truth is stranger than fiction. Let’s lean in on more of what actually went down. And there are enough mysteries that go unanswered that we kept in the soufflé also."" There's also apparently enough material from Sestero's book to make a ""six-hour miniseries,"" combined with the writers' experience of watching Franco direct in character as Wiseau, all while keeping the accent. Even that sounds too good to be true.","There's always a story out there you can't make up.

It was very unfortunate that they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nose diving, the airline said.
In the news conference, however, Ms. Moges, the transport minister, cautioned against holding any party responsible for the planes fatal plunge.
The major objective of this investigation is to make sure that there is safety in the aviation sector, she said.

Well hopefully soon there's going to be some more Fyre Festival content to gobble up — Hulu is in the early stages of developing a docuseries about the self-described luxury music festival with the help of Billboard, Mic, and The Cinemart. It's expected to come out in 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported Monday. SEE ALSO: The internet is having trouble feeling sorry for the folks at Fyre Festival If you missed the hubbub about the pseudo-festival from last spring, or need a refresher, here's how it went down: People paid exorbitant amounts of money (read: $12,000 for the weekend) to attend the Fyre Festival, which was organized by Fyre Media owner Billy McFarland and the rapper Ja Rule. It was supposed to be a luxurious weekend filled with music from bands like Blink-182 and top-tier food, all on an island in the Bahamas. Except almost everything outside of the fact that it took place on an island turned out to be false. The food was abysmal, Blink-182 pulled out thanks to lack of payment, and the lodgings and amenities might as well have been non-existent. It was so bad that Fyre Media was investigated by the FBI, and the founder, McFarland, was arrested and charged with wire fraud. The Hulu docuseries will attempt to get to bottom of exactly where and how everything went wrong with the Fyre Festival with in-depth interviews. According to THR, everyone from local Bahamians, attendees, and employees will be interviewed along with never-before-seen footage and insider information.","The Fyre Festival was one of those disasters that the world collectively couldn't keep its eyes off of, with the internet gobbling up every detail and horror story that came out of the debacle with feverish abandon.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionCyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air
Mozambique's port city of Beira is reeling from the damage inflicted by Cyclone Idai.
So far 200 people have been confirmed dead in the southern African country, but the death toll could be much higher.
Those who survived the disaster have had little reprieve to mourn the loss of their loved ones or salvage the little that is remaining of their belongings. They are in desperate need of food, shelter and clothing, as the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports.
Inside a makeshift response centre at the airport in Beira, aid agencies are scrambling to get to those still trapped across the region. 
It's the first point of call for all the teams coming in from around the world and offers the first glimpse of how heavily this operation is relying on outside help. 
A few kilometres away, panic is setting in. The people of Beira are growing anxious - help is coming, but it is really slow and not nearly enough.
""I have nothing. I have lost everything. We don't have food. I don't even have blankets. We need help,"" one woman tells me as we make our way through the village of Manhava. 
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Most of the port city of Beira is under water
Beira's geography, with parts of it lying below sea level, has always made it vulnerable to effects of extreme weather like Cyclone Ida which made landfall last week with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph).
The city bore the full brunt of the destructive storm, which triggered flooding of the whole city and knocked down buildings and cut off roads. The latter is now stalling rescuers from reaching desperate people in need. 
More on Cyclone Idai: 
Some people here are trying to salvage what they can to create shelter. Those who can are repairing their metal roofs, while others are tying together pine branches to sleep under. 
Homes have been damaged, some even completely destroyed, and there are pools of water everywhere. 
A local church has become a temporary home for scores of people. Half of its roof was blown off, but the walls have held and to some it is better than being out in the cold. 
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Floodwaters have cut off roads and knocked down buildings
The UN has said that Cyclone Idai triggered a ""massive disaster"" in southern Africa, affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. 
Neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi have also been affected by the freak storm that has caused the deaths of dozens and displacement of thousands of people.
Everyone we come across here is begging us to come into their homes to show us what they have lost and how nature has stolen from them.
We are the first people they have seen since the cyclone hit a few days ago. 
""Please help us. Tell the world we are suffering. We don't know where we are going to sleep,"" says Pedro, a father of three children all under the age of 10. 
The residents here feel like they have been forgotten. 
'100,000 people at risk'
As the full picture of this crisis slowly becomes clear, there are questions about whether the government of Mozambique could have done more to prepare for the disaster. 
The floods of the year 2000 claimed hundreds of lives and yet some here feel lessons have not been learned. 
""Our city was destroyed so easily because our infrastructure is not taken care of. Every time there is a problem here we need foreign countries to save us. What is our government doing, what is our own plan?"" our driver asks me. 
Back at the airport, a helicopter has just landed and rescue workers rush out carrying in their arms children whose eyes are wide with fear.
""Many villages have been washed away. We found women and children holding on to trees. We are doing what we can,"" said one of the rescuers. 
More rains are expected and those who made it to safety are the lucky ones. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk - and there is growing concern that help may not get to them in time.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Sewol tragedy shocked South Korea A South Korean court has ruled the government has to pay compensation for the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. It is the first time a court has acknowledged the state is liable for the deaths. The Sewol sank in 2014 killing 304 people, most of them school children. Some relatives of the victims had turned down an earlier offer of compensation, insisting the state's responsibility had to be proven. ""The court acknowledges the liability in compensating the plaintiffs, since the negligence by the state and Cheonghaejin Marine Co. has resulted in the occurrence of the accident,"" the court said on Thursday, Yonhap news agency reported. The court awarded 200m won ($177,000, £135,000) in compensation for each passenger who died. Parents of the students who lost their lives in the tragedy will receive a further 40 million won. Siblings and grandparents are to get smaller sums in compensation. Image copyright EPA Image caption Victims' relatives want more answers why the tragedy happened Investigators said the vessel was structurally unsound, overloaded and travelling too fast. It capsized while crossing to the island of Jeju on 16 April 2014. In 2015, the government offered to pay $380,000 (£256.000; €353,000) in compensation for each of the nearly 250 students who died. Many of the families rejected that offer as it would have meant an end to the investigations into the case. The tragedy shocked the country, with much of the public's anger directed at the government over poor safety standards and rescue work.

David Murphy,"A disaster from years ago still haunts this week’s Tech 911 letter-writer. She’ll explain the full details in a bit, but it makes me grateful for complicated backup setups. Anyway, let’s go put the world’s biggest Band-Aid on a potential technological catastrophe. Lifehacker reader Caroline writes: “Three or four years ago, my Macbook died, and because I was an avid user of Time Machine, I was able to retrieve virtually everything I cared about from my external hard drive, except my photos, because this tragedy happened to coincide with a software update, and thus the updated photos couldn’t access the old photo library that was stored on the other drive. Losing all of the photos from the first 27 years of my life still pains me, even years later, and I’ve kept the external hard drive with everything on it just in case I discover some miraculous way of retrieving this old iPhoto library (doubtful), but how can I prevent it from happening in the future?” Caroline: First, I just wanted to say that I completely sympathize with your issue on this one. I have folders and folders full of unorganized photos that I swear I’ll get to organizing someday—and possibly even backing up to something more than just my network-attached storage device. Regardless, if I were to lose them, I would feel absolutely horrible. And that’s just ten years or so of memories I care about. To lose 27 years’ worth of pictures, especially from the first 27 years of your life... that’s rough. I completely understand that this is something that still haunts you. That said, I’m glad you kept the hard drive, though, because I think there’s a solution to your issue. Though you’ve likely done a bunch of web searching for answers, I presume you haven’t stumbled across the main trick for getting elbow-deep in that library and pulling out all the photos it contains. As Macworld’s Glenn Fleishman wrote in a 2017 article, plug in your external drive, find the photo library, and try these steps: 1. Control-click the iPhoto Library. 2. Choose “Show Package Contents” from the contextual menu. 3. Drag (to move) or Option-drag (to copy) the Masters folder to the Desktop or to another drive. 4. Launch the latest version of iPhoto 9 and import that Masters folder. Or launch Photos and do the same. While this trick will cost you your photos’ metadata, you’ll ideally be able to import them at their full resolutions, which is much more important. Using a tool like this, if I’m right, will make the conversion process easy, but you’ll get lower-quality files. I think. It’s possible that doing the aforementioned trick might not actually show you a folder called “Masters.” That’s fine. As this Reddit post illuminates, you might instead see something called “Originals.” Try using that instead. This should hopefully allow you to import all of your old photos into your latest version of Photos. If you’re having trouble, write me another email and we can try walking through the process together. As for what to do going forward, I recommend synchronizing your photo galleries to the cloud. Whether you do that with Apple and iCloud—and pay for extra storage, I’m guessing, given how many photos you likely have—or a service like Google Photos, which is unlimited and free, is your choice. Dump everything to the cloud, and you’ll never have to worry about photos you can’t access ever again (unless Google or Apple go away someday, but I’m sure you’ll have ample warning for that). You’ll get a lot more peace of mind than just keeping your photos archived on a computer, even a Time Machine backup.","A disaster from years ago still haunts this week’s Tech 911 letter-writer.

They include managers at Autostrade, the company which managed the bridge. Forty-three people were killed in the disaster, when a 220m (656ft) section of the Morandi Bridge suddenly plunged 45m, along with dozens of vehicles. It prompted a fierce debate about the safety of Italy's infrastructure. Autostrade per l'Italia, which manages almost half the country's motorways, has not commented.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,1
Jon Fingas,"Further upgrades expand fundraiser creation to more regions (including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Europe) and blood donation searches are expanding to Bangladesh. There's a fundraiser developer toolkit to link Facebook fundraising to outside campaigns, and a community help toolkit to provide data to disaster response teams. Simultaneously, Facebook is launching a $50 million annual fund that will directly contribute to disaster relief starting in 2018. The efforts could go some way toward helping people in need, and it's easy to see the elimination of donation fees leading to more Facebook-based charity drives.

Adam Rogers,"This past year, 2017, was the worst fire season in American history. Over 9.5 million acres burned across North America. Firefighting efforts cost $2 billion. This past year, 2017, was the seventh-worst Atlantic hurricane season on record and the worst since 2005. There were six major storms. Early estimates put the costs at more than $180 billion. As the preventable disease hepatitis A spread through homeless populations in California cities in 2017, 1 million Yemenis contracted cholera amid a famine. Diphtheria killed 21 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, on the run from a genocide. Disaster, Pestilence, War, and Famine are riding as horsemen of a particular apocalypse. In 2016, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere reached 403 parts per million, higher than it has been since at least the last ice age. By the end of 2017, the United States was on track to have the most billion-dollar weather- and climate-related disasters since the government started counting in 1980. We did that. Transnational corporations and the most powerful militaries on Earth are already building to prepare for higher sea levels and more extreme weather. The FIRE complex—finance, insurance, and real estate—knows exactly what 2017 cost them ( natural and human-made disasters : $306 billion and 11,000 lives), and can calculate more of the same in 2018. They know that the radical alteration of Earth’s climate isn’t just something that’s going to happen in 100 years if we’re not careful, or in 50 years if we don’t change our economy and moonshot the crap out of science and technology. It’s here. Now. It happened. Look behind you. Let me rephrase: Absent any changes, by 2050 Earth will be a couple degrees hotter overall. Sea levels will be a foot higher. Now, 2050 seems as impossibly far away to me as 2017 did when I was 12 years old. I live in the future! And I like a lot of it. I like the magic glass slab in my pocket and the gene therapy and the robots. I mention this because in 2050, my oldest child will be the same age I am today, and I have given him a broken world. I don’t want that. So 2017 taught a lesson, at last, that scientists and futurists have been screaming about. Humanity has to reduce the amount of carbon it’s pumping into the air. Radically. Or every year will be worse from here on out. But 2017 also made plain the shape of the overall disaster. All those fires and floods and outbreaks are symptoms of the same problem, and it’s time to start dealing with that in a clear-eyed way. It’s also time to start building differently—to start making policies that understand that the American coastline is going to be redrawn by the sea, and that people can’t keep building single-family homes anywhere they can grade a flat pad. The wildland-urban interface can’t keep spreading at will. People can’t keep pumping fresh water out of aquifers without restoring them. Infrastructure for water and power has to be hardened against more frequent, more intense storms, backed up and reinforced so hundreds of thousands of people don’t go without electricity as they are in post-hurricane Puerto Rico. In short: Change, but also adapt. Fire season in the West is now a permanent condition; don’t build buildings that burn so easily in places that burn every year. Hurricanes and storm surges are going to continue to walk up the Caribbean and onto the Gulf Coast, or maybe along the seaboard. Don’t put houses on top of the wetlands that absorb those storms. Don’t insure the people who do. Build ways for people to get around without cars. Create a power grid that pulls everything it can from renewable sources like wind and solar. Keep funding public health research, surveillance, and ways to deal with mosquito-borne diseases that thrive in a hotter world. And the next time someone in a city planning meeting says that new housing shouldn’t get built in a residential area because it’s not in keeping with the sense of the community and might disrupt parking, tell them what that means: that they want young people to have lesser lives, that they don’t want poor people and people of color to have the same opportunities they did, and that they’d rather the planet’s environment get crushed by letting bad buildings spread to inhospitable places than increasing density in cities. This apocalypse doesn't hurt everyone. Some people benefit. It’s not a coincidence that the FIRE industries also donate the most money to federal political campaigns. Rich people living behind walls they think can’t be breached by any rising tide, literal or metaphoric, made this disaster. And then they gaslighted the vulnerable into distrusting anyone raising the alarm. The people who benefit have made it seem as if this dark timeline was all perfectly fine. It isn’t. And that’s why it’ll change. In 1957 Charles Fritz and Harry Williams, the research associate and technical director, respectively, of the National Academy of Sciences’ Disaster Studies Committee, wrote a paper that sparked the field of disaster sociology. Their findings were counterintuitive then, and somehow remain so. People in disasters, they said, don’t loot and riot. They help each other. “The net result of most disasters is a dramatic increase in social solidarity among the affected populace during the emergency and immediate post-emergency periods,” they wrote. “The sharing of a common threat to survival and the common suffering produced by the disaster tend to produce a breakdown of pre-existing social distinctions and a great outpouring of love, generosity, and altruism.” In a disaster, we help each other. The trick is recognizing the disaster. Through that lens, fixing the problem and protecting one another against its consequences isn’t merely inarguable. It’s human nature. We’re all in this together.","The past year was one of the worst on record for natural disasters.

"THOMAS FULLER, KIRK JOHNSON and CONOR DOUGHERTY","One possible solution, she said, would be for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide trailers that people could live in while their homes were being rebuilt. For now, though, authorities are focused on providing immediate relief.

Anthony Ha,"Netflix and Hulu have each released their own documentaries about the infamous Fyre Festival, and the hard-working hosts of the Original Content podcast have watched both of them.
We’re joined this week by Brian Heater, and the three of us are unanimous on one thing: If you’re only going to watch one of these documentaries, make it “Fyre” on Netflix. It’s the better-made movie, offering a clearer retelling of what actually went wrong at the first-time music festival in the Bahamas.
But if you’ve got the time, watching both films will give you a fuller picture. “Fyre Fraud” on Hulu is the one that scored interview with Fyre mastermind Billy McFarland though the interview becomes increasingly awkward as he evades or outright refuses to answer many of the filmmakers’ questions (and they’ve taken heat for apparently paying McFarland for the interview).
More interestingly, the Hulu film makes more of an effort to connect the Fyre Festival to the bigger picture of millennial and influencer culture. In fact, McFarland’s fake-it-till-you-make-it ethos sometimes felt uncomfortably close to what we’ve seen when writing about tech startups.
The Oscar nominations were also announced this week, so we discussed the Best Picture nods received by Netflix’s “Roma” and by “Black Panther” the first superhero film nominated in this category.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption California wildfires continue to rage Thirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the US state's deadliest wildfires to 42, officials say. The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state. At least 228 people are missing, as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk. The fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts, including Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes across the state. Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for. How did people die? Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving blaze. Paradise and its surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The town of Paradise has been obliterated by the blaze ""It was very scary,"" Paradise Mayor Jody Jones told CNN, recounting her family's escape from the town. ""It took a long time to get out. There was fire on both sides of the car. You could feel the heat coming in through the car,"" she said. Among the victims were also elderly residents with mobility issues or people who decided to stay despite evacuation orders. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Two mobile army morgues are being brought in to help to identify the dead. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. Media caption Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" What about further south? The separate Woosley Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Musician Neil Young made the same link, writing on his website: ""I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another.""

 The Iolaire had been a luxury yacht before the war
Just weeks after the slaughter of World War One ended, the Hebridean Isle of Lewis was hit by the ""crowning sorrow of the war"". 
In the early hours of 1 January 1919, naval yacht HMY Iolaire, which was carrying sailors returning from the war, hit rocks as it approached Stornoway and sank.
More than 200 people drowned, just yards from the shoreline and the safety of home.
Image caption
 More than 200 died when the Iolaire went down off Lewis
According to local historian Catriona Dunn, Lewis had a hard war with almost 1,000 men dying during the conflict.
She says the islands had already lost a higher proportion of servicemen than most other areas of Britain and this meant the Iolaire disaster was an ""unimaginable horror"".
""Small communities lost a lot of men, on top of losses during the war itself - there was just an unspeakable grief,"" she says.
Many feel that what happened contributed to future emigration from the Western Isles.
Image caption
 John Finlay Macleod managed to get a rope to shore and saved about 40 people
About 75 men managed to survive the sinking.
John Finlay Macleod, from Ness, helped save about 40 of them.
He grabbed a rope, gave one end to a man onboard, and prepared to swim ashore through the violent sea.
Image caption
 John Finlay Macleod, in his 80s, told a BBC documentary about the rescue
Speaking in an interview in 1973, he told how it was not far to the shore but the waves were terrible and pushed him back further than he had been before he started.
Mr Macleod, who was 30 at the time, said he succeeded in getting to the rocks by keeping afloat and then riding in on the crest of the wave.
He was thrown on to the rocks but managed to cling on, establishing a rescue line that others used to get to shore.
Image caption
 Donald Morrison survived by clinging to the mast of the ship
Another survivor, Donald Morrison clung to the mast of the ship all night, awaiting rescue.
He also described what happened in the 1973 documentary. 
""I could see the big sea coming, and I would squeeze myself onto the mast,"" he said.
Image caption
 A photo of what remained of the Iolaire after the tragedy
""I heard a crash, and the other mast had broken, and the two men who were on it had gone too, and there I was all by myself till daybreak.""
The survivors, and the bereaved, sought answers at the time, but a public inquiry into the disaster lasted just two days and many questions remain.
The men who died were mostly Royal Navy reservists who had been serving during the war.
Image caption
 The Iolaire was wrecked just yards from the coast
They had arrived by rail at Kyle of Lochalsh on the western Highlands mainland and were looking forward to catching the steam-ferry home.
The regular ferry, the SS Sheila, was soon packed so the Royal Navy ordered the Iolaire across the Minch from its berth in Stornoway to carry the extra men left behind. 
Image caption
 There is a monument to those who died on Lewis
The Iolaire had been a luxury yacht before the war, sailing under the name of the Amalthaea. 
It was used by the navy in anti-submarine and patrol work and was renamed the Iolaire - Gaelic for ""Eagle"".
Discussions about whether the Iolaire had enough lifeboats and lifejackets were cut short when two more trains arrived at the quay with more men hoping to get home for the new year. 
This meant the master was keen to get the sailors onto the ship.
The Iolaire set sail from Kyle of Lochalsh at about 21:30 in strong winds.
A few miles off Stornoway the weather got much worse and as the Iolaire made its final approach into Stornoway harbour in a strong gale, it is believed the boat changed course at the wrong point.
With the lights of the harbour in sight, the ship struck rocks known as the Beasts of Holm at full speed and immediately began to tilt, filling up with water.
The men were just 20 yards from the shoreline when the Iolaire hit the rocks just before 02:00.
The author of a new book on the disaster, Malcolm Macdonald, says a strengthening wind may have contributed to what happened.
'Minor navigational error'
""I think with the wind behind her, she turned to port and into Stornoway too late,"" Mr Macdonald says.
""It was a minor navigational error, but a catastrophic one as well,"" he says.
Of those known to have died, 174 came from Lewis, with seven Harrismen among the dead. A further 18 crew and two passengers on their way to the Stornoway Naval Base were killed.
At the time of the incident, such was the grief on the island that few families spoke of what happened. 
A hundred years on, attitudes are changing though, according to the Iolaire Working Group. 
'Providence robbed from us'
""Going through school I heard very little about the disaster, people didn't want to talk about it,"" explains Colin George Morrison from the group.
""Young people are certainly more aware of the incident, and hopefully that will continue in the coming years,"" he says.
The commemorations on New Year's Day will mark the culmination of a year of remembrance on the islands through different projects.
On Hogmanay there will be a torchlight procession in Stornoway, with each torch representing a life lost in the disaster.
A special ceremony near the wreck site on 1 January will bring together descendants of those lost, and dignitaries, including representatives of the Royal Family and the Scottish government.
Catriona Dunn, who herself lost relatives in the disaster, feels the events are hugely significant.
""These commemorations are bringing it to people's attention once again. We are mourning again people we never knew,"" she says.
Commenting on the impact on the island community, she added, ""We will never know what providence robbed from us.""",More than 200 sailors returning from WW1 drowned just yards from the shore and the safety of home.,2019-01-01T01:28:16Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",The Iolaire disaster: The 'crowning sorrow of the war',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46522918,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96D5/production/_104731683_iolaire-2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1

 Some residents have been returning to the area to look at cherry blossom
A Japanese town whose population fled the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster has partially reopened eight years later.
Radiation levels in parts of Okuma, west of the Daiichi plant, have been deemed safe for residents to return.
About 50 people have begun moving back to areas in the town where decontamination efforts were focused.
The plant was hit by a tsunami, causing the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
Critics have accused the Japanese government of expediting residents' return in an attempt to showcase safety standards ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Okuma's 10,000 residents were among nearly half a million people to flee the region after the disaster.
BBC Tokyo Correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says the vast majority of the town's original inhabitants are unlikely to go back. 
Only 367 people - around 3.5% of the town's original population - had registered as residents as of late March, local reports said.
Japanese authorities are hoping new infrastructure, including a town hall and state-owned housing, will attract residents to return.

Media captionIn 2016, the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes visited properties in the village of Obori, north of Okuma
However radiation remains a major concern for residents, especially those with children.
A survey by Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun found just over half of residents in Fukushima Prefecture felt that progress has been made toward recovery. 
The 2011 Fukushima disaster saw three reactors of the nuclear power plant, some 62km (39 miles) south-east of the city of Fukushima, fail after it was damaged and flooded in the tsunami.
The accident forced more than 470,000 people to be evacuated because of nuclear contamination concerns.
Just under 18,500 people were killed or went missing after an earthquake triggered the massive tsunami that led to the meltdown.

 More than 18,000 people died or went missing in the tsunami
Though no-one died as a direct result of the nuclear meltdown, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) has paid out compensation to some of those affected. 
More than 40 patients had to be evacuated from a hospital in the area and later died, while other deaths have been linked to the trauma suffered by those who lost their homes and loved ones.
In 2017, three former Tepco executives went on trial charged with professional negligence linked to the hospital evacuation.","Okuma, a town near the wrecked Fukushima power plant, has partially reopened.",2019-04-10T10:55:20Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Fukushima nuclear disaster: Abandoned town allows first residents home,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47879768,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/131E4/production/_106380387_mediaitem106380386.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1

RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — Adm. Karl L. Schultz was named the 26th commandant of the Coast Guard on Friday, taking over a military service that is in the midst of a fleet modernization as it juggles homeland security priorities like intercepting drugs and migrants and responding to disasters. President Trump attended Admiral Schultz’s change of command ceremony, held on the first day of the annual hurricane season. “I envision our heading remaining generally steady,” Admiral Schultz said. It was a compliment to his predecessor Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, who had directed the fleet modernizing effort and steered the first budget increase in years to the Coast Guard, the 227-year-old military branch that is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. Admiral Schultz had commanded the Coast Guard’s Atlantic area and last year oversaw the fleet’s response to Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey. The service rescued nearly 12,000 people along the East Coast and in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands during the deadly 2017 hurricane season.",Adm. Karl L.

Bijan Stephen,"Fyre Festival puppet master Billy McFarland isn’t going to prison, but he does owe the people he defrauded — via the beautiful, doomed disaster that was the one-percenter island music festival, and before that, the fake influencer credit card company Magnises — to the tune of $27.4 million. Following McFarland’s conviction on two counts of wire fraud by the US Attorney’s office earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission has settled with him and two of his lieutenants, Grant Margolin (his CMO) and Daniel Simon (an independent contractor), after alleging that the trio had fraudulently hoovered up money from more than 100 investors by misrepresenting themselves. The quote from the SEC’s latest press release is choice : McFarland induced investors to entrust him with tens of millions of dollars by fraudulently inflating key operational, financial metrics and successes of his companies, as well as his own personal success – including by giving investors a doctored brokerage account statement purporting to show personal stock holdings of over $2.5 million when, in reality, the account held shares worth under $1,500. Naturally, McFarland used the money he received to fund the lifestyle he’d always wanted — partying with celebs, private jets, etc. — as is the wont of the high-end scammer. “McFarland gained the trust of investors by falsely portraying himself as a skilled entrepreneur running a series of successful media companies,” said Melissa Hodgman, the associate director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, in another absolutely brutal quote. Image: Fyre Festival LLC McFarland, Margolin, and Simon were charged with “violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,” and the three have agreed to pay back the money they bilked. McFarland owes $27.4 million and has been permanently barred from serving as either an officer or a director of a public company; Margolin owes $35,000, and agreed to a 7-year ban; Simon owes a relatively reasonable $15,000, and has been banned for three years. (As the SEC deftly notes: this settlement is still subject to court approval.) It’s a fine ending to last year’s wild saga, which is remembered fondly by everyone who didn’t buy $12,000 tickets for McFarland’s “once-in-a-lifetime” concert in the Bahamas. But honestly, it could only have ended this way; any good deed that generates this much schadenfreude and embarrasses hundreds of wealthy socialites cannot go unpunished. (Jeffrey Atkins, aka Ja Rule, who promoted the festival alongside McFarland and co., has not been charged with anything.) Even if we won’t always have McFarland, we’ll always have Fyre Festival. Mark him down with Anna Sorokin as another casualty of the Summer of the Grift, as it rolls inevitably on.","Fyre Festival puppet master Billy McFarland isn’t going to prison, but he does now owe the people he defrauded — via the beautiful, doomed disaster that was the one-percenter island music festival, and before that, the fake influencer credit card company Magn…",2018-07-24T18:15:17Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Fyre Festival founder Billy McFarland settles with SEC, must repay $27.4 million",https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17608204/fyre-festival-billy-mcfarland-sec-settlement,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/354yOkherNvGXnkLly_4dOnu4OE=/322x0:2007x882/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11738021/fyrefestival_banner.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,1
EMILY COCHRANE,"Some lawmakers were optimistic that a resolution could be found quickly. Democrats in both chambers have pushed for a select group of lawmakers to draft legislation that borrows from both measures.
Im sure well start talking again, said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He compared the negotiating process to a three-legged stool: Youve got the House, youve got the Senate and the presidency.
Were hopefully at a point where we can get some serious negotiations going, he said.
Still, senators from both parties tried to used the disaster relief votes to their political advantage.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said that tonight, my colleagues had the opportunity to choose action over obstruction.
Shamefully, he added, Senate Democrats said no.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in a statement that Congress used to set politics aside after major disasters and help victims in their time of need partisan infighting wont rebuild a single home or school.
Even Puerto Rican politicians could not agree on which of the measures to support. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló, a Democrat, urged lawmakers to endorse the House legislation. But Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, a Republican, spoke out in favor of the Senate measure. Ms. González-Colón is the islands sole representative in Congress, but she cannot vote.

Rachel Becker,"Last week in the New Mexico desert, military and civilian bomb squads faced off at the 12th annual Robot Rodeo, which is a week of intense training organized by Sandia National Laboratories. To test their skills, bomb squads steered their bots to enter downed planes, explore faux-radioactive disaster sites, and climb flights of stairs. “Everybody else is running away from the bomb, and these guys are going in,” says Jake Deuel, robotics manager at Sandia and coordinator of the rodeo. His goal is for the event to help bomb squads tackle real-world situations and learn what their robots can and cannot do. “We train these guys to come home safe,” he says. Some of the crafted scenarios are designed to test the robot operators’ skills and problem-solving abilities. One exercise, for example, was based on the 1984 movie Red Dawn, where teenagers fight off invading forces in World War III. The competing robots had to go into a downed Phantom F-4 fighter jet to “retrieve the black box and some of the fancy electronics so that we can figure out what the enemy is doing,” Deuel says. Another exercise required bomb squads to work together to find the sources of an underground radiation leak and contain them. “It’s not just like driving around remote-controlled cars. It’s complicated. There are broken wings and sharp objects, challenging areas you’ve got to get the robot in,” Deuel says. That’s why this kind of training is so key. The scenarios are “about robot manipulation and control, wrapped around a fun little story.” The Verge spoke with Deuel about operating robots, alien blood collection, and why robot training is so important. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. Walk me through what a Robot Rodeo looks like. I usually have 10 to 12 teams show up, which means I usually need 10 to 12 different scenarios. Think of a scenario as a vignette. They typically only get 90 minutes. In each scenario, there’s a script that one of my evaluators would read to them. The bomb techs might ask some questions like, “Are we looking for six or seven of these items?” The evaluator may answer that question. Typically they’ll say, “We have no more information. You’ve got 90 minutes. Begin!” And then they’ve got to start solving the problem. Photo: Sandia National Laboratories A robot explores an underground facility, searching for radiation at the 12th annual Robot Rodeo. Is it BYO-robot? Instead of bringing your own bottle, you bring your own bot to the event. I’ll probably get the saying wrong, but it’s “train as you fight, fight as you train.” If I gave them something else or something different, that’s not the best way to get training value. It’s got to be your equipment — you know what it does, you know what it doesn’t do. So they’ll actually show up in their bomb truck, and these scenarios are usually geographically based around Sandia labs, which is on Kirtland Air Force Base here in Albuquerque. And so I’ll have some scenarios spread out so that the teams aren’t all seeing each other. I’ve got to find a location or something that looks like a burned-out building or a village or an underground, so you have to find a location to hold a scenario. Video: Vince Gasparich/Sandia National Laboratories Did I hear correctly in the video from last year’s Robot Rodeo that you’ve done an alien blood-collection scenario? Is there something Sandia knows that the rest of us don’t? We like to build a scenario around the Men in Black movies. And when we did it, we had access to an old C-130 airplane fuselage. And so in that one, “Galaxy Air” — that’s the airline in the Men in Black movies — was transporting aliens, and these aliens were on life support. And we had a recirculating pump that you’d have in a party with a punch bowl pumping the liquid. So we had that set up with a bunch of red Kool-Aid representing the blood. One of the things they had to do was drive into the airplane fuselage, which was non-trivial getting up in there. They had a little plastic beaker that they had to pick up in their little robot gripper and not drop it and get it under this stream of dripping blood. But then they also had to take a sample of something else. And then it’s like, “Oh wait, I’ve already got this beaker full of blood in my gripper, and I’m supposed to do something else.” It’s like, “You know what, shoot. I should have done the other task first and then gone over and picked up the beaker.” So, it might seem funny — and it was — but it’s really also training them to think about your operational sequence and to think it through. Don’t just get excited and start driving inside the airplane. Video: Vince Gasparich/Sandia National Laboratories Why is it important for bomb techs to practice driving their robots? Driving your robot is a perishable skill — just like playing a sport or playing a video game. When you’re a kid and you’re playing a video game, it takes hours and hours of practice. But you put it down for weeks or a month, and then you try to pick it up again, and it’s like, “Okay, how do I do this? Where’s the switch? Is it this switch I flip up or flip down?” You’ve got to just keep practicing it, and the robot rodeo forces them to do that. We did a scenario years ago where the basic objective of that scenario was just operator skill. They drove the robot, picked up a frisbee off the ground, hung it on a coat rack, drove across these spare tires with a mouse trap in the gripper without dropping it, all that kind of stuff. Imagine in front of you that there are lots of knobs and switches that control all the various joints of the robot and how you drive, and a joystick you can move for the camera, and a different one to fire the weapons systems. So imagine all that, and we put a Tupperware box on top of it with two holes to stick your hands in so that you couldn’t see your hands. Oh boy, were they mad at me for that one. But at the end of it, they said, “That was a fantastic one because I realized I’ve got to get better at this.” Because in a real life-or-death situation, when they’re out there with that robot, you can’t be looking down at your hands. You have to have trained enough to just know instinctively where all the buttons or the knobs are so you’re focused on the task of disabling that device or rendering it safe or saving someone.

JAMES GLANZ and THOMAS KAPLAN,"A similar series of events involving faulty sensor data and an automated system suspected in bringing down a Boeing plane in Indonesia may have also caused the crash of the same type of jet in Ethiopia in March, according to people who have been briefed on the contents of the black box in Ethiopia.
Data from a vane-like device, called an angle-of-attack sensor, incorrectly activated the automatic, computer-controlled system, called MCAS, which pushed the nose of the plane down, eventually leading to a crash that killed all 157 people aboard.
The black box, also called the flight data recorder, contains information on dozens of systems aboard the plane. The black boxes on both planes, Boeings latest generation of the 737, survived the crashes, allowing investigators to begin piecing together what caused the disasters. Both investigations are ongoing and no final determinations have been made.
There are two angle-of-attack sensors on the Boeing 737 Max, one attached to the fuselage on the pilots side and another on the co-pilots side. Investigators in Indonesia, who have produced a preliminary report and released some of the information from the box, saw that one sensor produced a reading that was at least 20 degrees different from the other as the plane took off and began its ascent.","As in the Lion Air disaster, investigators believe an automated system on the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight was set off by erroneous readings.",2019-03-29T22:48:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Ethiopia Crash, Faulty Sensors on Boeing 737 Max Are Suspected",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/business/boeing-737-max-crash.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/business/29boeing/29boeing-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
THOMAS KAPLAN,"Photo Damage from Hurricane Maria in Utuado, Puerto Rico, was still visible last week. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. Credit Alvin Baez/Reuters WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Friday for $44 billion in additional relief from this year’s devastating hurricanes but urged lawmakers to make spending cuts to offset disaster costs that are now approaching $100 billion. The White House request for more disaster relief after the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, set up a possible confrontation over whether Congress must to find spending cuts to pay for relief even as President Trump pushes for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. White House officials suggested a raft of cuts to pay for the relief, including $730 million from the Army Corps of Engineers’ operations, maintenance, flood control and coastal emergencies funds, $196 million from the Department of Agriculture’s rural economic development program, and $72 million from the Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The State Department’s Democracy Fund would lose $99 million and the Department of Transportation highway aid to states would lose $1 billion. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, immediately rebuked the White House over its requests to offset the funding. “Just one day after pushing the House to pass a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is galling that the administration is requesting offsets in exchange for helping Americans rebuild their lives,” Ms. Lowey said in a statement. “Holding vital recovery funding hostage to unrelated and often divisive spending debates is wrong, and only delays fulfillment of our obligation to help disaster victims.” Republicans have been conspicuously quiet about their concerns over adding to the ballooning national debt. The deficit for the 2017 fiscal year totaled $666 billion, an increase of $80 billion from the previous year.

Rayne Ellis,"Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control. But as communities in places like Texas and Puerto Rico are learning, disaster relief that only alleviates physical wants is not enough to put their communities back on their feet. After first responders have done their jobs to secure personal safety, an emotional recovery has to begin as well. Organizations like UNICEF are acknowledging that the damage to communities can last long after the repairs to homes are completed. Canned goods and other basic need items are given out in a disaster relief station in southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images “When the reality of the disaster sets in, the emotional and psychological responses that are seen community-wide are tremendous and overwhelming,” Center for School Behavioral Health director Janet Pozmantier said. “People simply don’t have the wherewithal to cope effectively.” That's where organizations like UNICEF are stepping in. Called psychosocial disaster relief, this kind of help comes in the weeks and months after a disaster in order to help people recover emotionally. If UNICEF can help it, these recovery efforts will be implemented after every storm. Psychosocial relief in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and Harvey are currently ongoing, and UNICEF knows that the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas will also require this kind of help in the near future. Other organizations like the Red Cross have also been championing psychological first aid measures for years, and with good reason. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century Research suggests that those who have survived catastrophe tend to start showing signs of trauma roughly three months after the event took place. Those signs can look like anything from anxiety and depression to constant irritability and anger or even complete dissociation and inattention in both children and adults. In order to combat these symptoms, Pozmantier and other staff at the center working under Mental Health America in Greater Houston developed free workshops to teach others how to effectively help people struggling in the aftermath of traumatic disaster-related events. Damaged furniture and personal belongings sit on a flooded curb in Southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images The workshop focuses on helping educators identify signs and symptoms of trauma in children while also including other useful tools like mindfulness training and how to self-regulate emotions. After Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, UNICEF reached out to the center and offered to fund a Harvey-specific trauma training workshop, which the center named Hope for Harvey. In the months after Harvey made landfall in Texas, Pozmantier would drive through neighborhoods and see the entire contents of homes in a pile on the curb — family photos and clothing laying on top of piles of water damaged furniture — all ready to be collected by waste management. She said it was easy to understand why people would be traumatized. So when the center developed Hope for Harvey, aside from training people to deal with trauma in children, they also added some training on how to deal with adults. “Going through something like this, I realized more than ever that if we can take care of the adults, the kids are going to be okay for the most part too,” Pozmantier said. Nine months later, when UNICEF approached the center again to help Puerto Rico recover, the message was the same. The center developed a workshop, completely in Spanish, to help curb the emotional impact Hurricane Maria had on the people of Puerto Rico, focusing again on children — but also providing help to adults. First, UNICEF sent hygiene kits, water, and helped with shelter. But what UNICEF President Caryl Stern said she’s most proud of is the collaborative work that UNICEF and the Center for School Behavioral Health were able to put into action. A man and a child stand in front of a destoryed house in Puerto Rico a few days after Hurricane Maria hit the island. Image: unicef usa “Now classrooms are catastrophe stations the every time it rains in Puerto Rico. The children are worried that their home is destroyed. Or they’re wondering 'Is my mother okay?'” Stern said. Even seeing adults in distress can trigger the children, Stern said. Once Stern experienced this, she said she know that the training workshops would be incredibly important. In addition to the workshops, UNICEF sent a few hundred college students from State University of New York and City University of New York to pair up with member of various Puerto Rican communities to help rebuild the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico. Through this, people were able to come together and repair their communities themselves — something that can have a strong positive effect on the psyche. Stern says everyone who has ever dealt with disaster relief knows that the psychosocial recovery is the most import aspect of relief that is widely ignored by the public. Pozmantier agreed, adding that if she could, she would mandate that all educators go through training in mental health, trauma, mindfulness, and self-help strategies. “They are the first line of defense. It’s like any other kind of illness. You wouldn’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to try and strengthen your immune system,” Pozmantier said.","Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control.

RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a budget document released by a Democratic senator late Wednesday night, diverting funds from the relief agency just as a major hurricane barrels toward the East Coast. The document, which was released by the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, shows that the money would come from FEMA’s operations and support budget and was transferred into accounts at ICE to pay for detention and removal operations. The document also shows that the Department of Homeland Security transferred money from accounts at Customs and Border Protection that pays for border fencing and technology. Mr. Merkley, appearing Tuesday night on “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC, said the Trump administration was taking money from FEMA’S “response and recovery” and “working hard to find funds for additional detention camps.” Mr. Merkley has been a vocal critic of the administration’s immigration policies. The Department of Homeland Security denies that any money transferred came from FEMA’s disasters relief accounts, which pay for work related to hurricanes and other natural disasters.",The Department of Homeland Security denies that the money came from disaster relief accounts and says it is prepared for a hurricane that will hit this week.,2018-09-12T11:57:32Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","$10 Million From FEMA Diverted to Pay for Immigration Detention Centers, Document Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/politics/fema-ice-immigration-detention.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/13/world/13dc-fema/13dc-fema-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Frederic Lardinois,"With the rise of Kubernetes as the de facto standard for container orchestration, it’s no surprise that there’s now a whole ecosystem of companies springing up around this open source project. Heptio is one of the most interesting ones, in no small part due to the fact that it was founded by Kubernetes co-founders Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie. Today, Heptio announced that it is teaming up with Microsoft on its Heptio Ark project, which it launched earlier this year. Heptio Ark is a utility for managing backups and disaster recovery that helps you bring your Kubernetes clusters and volumes back up after your run into a major issue in your data center. The plan is for Microsoft and Heptio to work together on strengthening Ark’s core capabilities, but also on making it a tool for moving Kubernetes applications across on-premise environments and — unsurprisingly — Microsoft Azure and the Azure Container Service (AKS — because Microsoft hasn’t come around to renaming it to ‘Azure Kubernetes Service’ just yet). “Few real-world companies live solely in the public cloud,” said Heptio CEO Craig McLuckie. “It is incredibly important that the tools and practices they adopt when selecting their public cloud services work on-premises as well. Microsoft ’s commitment to working with the open source community will not only benefit Azure customers, but strengthens the Kubernetes community.” What’s also interesting about this move is that it brings the three Kubernetes co-founders together, with Beda and McLuckie at Heptio, and Microsoft’s Brendan Burns, who worked with the Heptio founders at Google when they launched the Kubernetes project into open source (and who was the lead engineer for Kubernetes at Google). “I’m excited to see Heptio and Microsoft deliver a compelling solution that satisfies an important and unmet need in the Kubernetes ecosystem,” said Burns. “We’re working with Heptio to ensure that the integration of Ark and Azure is a best-of-breed solution for backing up on-premise Kubernetes clusters into the cloud.” Featured Image: alzay/Getty Images","With the rise of Kubernetes as the de facto standard for container orchestration, it’s no surprise that there’s now a whole ecosystem of companies springing up around this open source project.

Ron Miller,"Remember how VMware was supposed to be disrupted by AWS? Somewhere along the way it made a smart move. Instead of fighting the popular cloud platform, it decided to make it easier for IT to use its products on AWS. Today, at the opening of the AWS re:invent customer conference, it announced plans to expand that partnership with some new migration and disaster recovery services. As Mark Lohmeyer, VP of the VMware cloud platform business unit pointed out, it’s only been a quarter since they made the original product generally available. The new products are designed to help ease the transition to the cloud. One of the issues VWmare customers have struggled with, is simply moving their mission critical applications from their datacenters to the cloud. Lohmeyer says the new migration product is designed to move applications quickly with no down time and for a reasonable cost (although that’s probably in the eye of the beholder). If it works as advertised, it really gives IT the best of both worlds. They can move their applications lock, stock and barrel from the datacenter to AWS and continue to monitor and manage them in the way they have been. If there truly is no downtime, this makes for an easy cloud transition, whether a company wants to start slowly and move an application or two or has plans to shut down the company datacenter and needs to move everything. What’s more, VMware is sweetening the pot by offering reserved pricing discounts over the traditional hourly pricing model. That means if you sign up for a year or three years you get a discount, although the amount will vary depending on volume and other factors. They are also introducing hybrid licenses, which allow customers to continue to use their on-prem licenses when they move to the cloud. All of these factors could reduce the overall cost of transitioning to the cloud over standard pricing approaches. VMware also announced a new disaster recover product. This enables IT to keep a copy of applications and data in the cloud on AWS. In the event of a disaster like a massive hurricane, power outage or other misfortune they can keep going with minimal disruption. “If you have a failure in your on-prem cloud, you can organize a restart on AWS,” Lohmeyer explained. The disaster recovery tool also helps those companies that may be slow to move to the cloud to get more comfortable with the idea. If you can store your disaster recovery backup in the cloud, you may be ready to move the actual applications at some point too. VMware was the company that popularized the virtual machine concept and today it is the premiere datacenter product. The problem for VMware has been that the future is moving out of the datacenter and into the cloud. Its first idea was to try to build its own public cloud service and compete with AWS. When that idea fizzled, VMware had a Plan B and that was to partner with the other cloud vendors. The biggest of those is of course AWS. As Lohmeyer sees it, this partnership is good for everyone. “It’s good for customers because they can readily take advantage of the cloud model. It’s good for VMware because we are keeping the customers on our platforms and growing the workloads. And it’s good for AWS because there are more workloads running on their platform.” If it works as described, that’s the ingredients for an ideal partnership.","Remember how VMware was supposed to be disrupted by AWS?

KENNETH R. ROSEN,"“You should have a general evacuation plan as well as a communication plan. You should sit down with your family and discuss,” said Mr. Booher, the FEMA spokesman, “but also share with your friends and colleagues in case something was to happen — someone outside your immediate family would be able to track you down.” Here are some items to keep on you or at the ready in your home or office, in addition to the basics. A Multi-Tool: “I have one I bring climbing, one I bring camping/hiking and one for rafting/SUPing,” Mr. Egensteiner said, referring to stand-up paddling. “They can do everything, and the list of tools packed into the big ones today is staggering.” These tools, like The Wirecutter’s favorite, the Leatherman New Wave, can also help with performing first-aid, making fires and repairing machinery or electronics. The best come with everything from a sharp knife and pair of pliers or tweezers to a can opener. Spare Clothing: Consider your climate and pack for the most common weather. From an extra coat and gloves to a pair of walking shoes, consider the three basic layers for weatherproofing: base, insulation and shell. The base layer should include something that wicks away moisture and maintains body temperature such as synthetics or merino wool. Insulation layers can include puffy jackets stuffed with wool or down, or a fleece hooded sweatshirt or vest. The shell layer should be wind- and rain-resistant, but also breathable. A Weather/Emergency Radio: Wirecutter suggested the Midland ER310, “an emergency radio that can tune in to AM/FM and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration channel.” In the event of an emergency, especially a weather-related emergency, radio is your best bet to get up-to-date information on weather patterns, evacuation orders or official news from the authorities. A portable, easily powered radio like this one can keep you connected to the outside world even if you’re stuck in a cellar, or a shelter. This one can be powered by battery, hand crank, solar energy or USB. If you’re packing for a family, including children, build off the basics and necessities for one person, and make sure you pack enough supplies for everyone. Here are some more items to include if you’re considering more people. Mylar Blankets: Full sleeping bags are too cumbersome for an emergency kit, so these are a lighter alternative. “Mylar thermal blankets or bags are windproof, waterproof and capable of reflecting more than 90 percent of your body heat,” Mr. Paul, of The Wirecutter, said. “Inexpensive and easy to store, this should be the minimum you carry for warmth.”",It is never too early to talk with friends and family about emergency plans — and how to build the perfect go-bag in case disaster strikes.,2018-09-11T20:53:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How to Pack an Emergency Kit for Any Disaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/smarter-living/packing-emergency-kit-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/13/us/03bugout/03bugout-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Jon Russell,"Sad news for anyone into giant robots: Google is closing down Schaft, its secretive unit that develops bipedal robots aimed at helping out in disaster efforts and generally looking badass. The news was first reported by Nikkei, but Google confirmed to TechCrunch that the business will be shuttered. It said it is helping staff find new roles, most of which will likely be outside of Google and its Alphabet parent. Firstly up, many people — myself included — might have forgotten that Google owns Schaft. The company was scheduled to be sold to SoftBank alongside Boston Dynamics — another of Google’s robotics ventures — through a deal that was announced last year. Boston Dynamics made the transition but Schaft didn’t. Softbank never shouted that omission from the rooftops, but a source with knowledge of the deal told us that certain conditions agreed for the deal were not fulfilled, hence Schaft remained with Google. Our source explained that Google’s robotics focused shifted away from Schaft and instead to non-humanoid robots and industry-led solutions such as robotic arms. The departure of Andy Rubin, the controversial robotics evangelist who reportedly got a $90 million payout to leave amid sexual misconduct allegations, seemed to speed up its demise inside the organization. Google shopped the Schaft business fairly widely — since 2016 and after the SoftBank deal collapsed — but to no avail, we understand. That left closing it down as the last remaining option. Schaft was founded in 2012 by a group led by University of Tokyo professor Yuto Nakanishi. Alphabet acquired Shaft and Boston Dynamics in 2013, the former was part of a group of seven acquisitions, in undisclosed deals. There’s been plenty of attention on Boston Dynamics and its crazy, even scary, robots which can trek across all terrains and get up instantly when knocked over, but Schaft maintained a fairly quiet presence. Indeed, its first major prototypes weren’t revealed until some two years after its acquisition.","Sad news for anyone into giant robots: Google is closing down Schaft, its secretive unit that develops bipedal robots aimed at helping out in disaster efforts and generally looking badass.

Jordan Crook,"Last weekend, Epic Games put forth its first true effort at official competitive Fortnite Battle Royale. It was a disaster. The private hosts used for the tournament were about as laggy as could be, with pro players getting eliminated simply because they couldn’t move. This tournament was for a total prize of $250K. That’s big money, and big frustration for pro players who were essentially eliminated by the whims of the server gods. But on top of the lag, the whole thing was, well, boring. A cardinal sin in any sport. The fact is that when you put 100 pro players in a lobby together and tell them that the last man standing wins, most of them will simply sit in a fort and stay safe as long as possible. This does not generate a whole lot of action. And when there is action on the map, there was no way for a spectator to know about it. There are, after all, a hundred people to watch out for, and jumping from one engagement to another is not only difficult but lacks a certain narrative quality, making the whole thing feel scattered. It seems clear that a guided mode or hotspot indicator would go a long way to improving the viewing experience. Being told where the fighting was or could be happening or having a guide that flagged these opportunities could work. There could also be a documentary-style concept that followed a few top players on their entire run, with the hope that they’ll find action and maybe even be pushed into conflict to impress viewers. Epic recently published a post-mortem on the event, outlining ways that the publisher can improve on the tournament. They’ve also set forth the rules for this weekend’s event, proposing a score-based tournament where both eliminations and Victory Royales count toward players’ overall score. Whether or not this will incentivize more action will be determined following the event. It’s also worth noting that Epic scheduled today’s event during the Fortnite Friday tournament. Fortnite Friday, hosted by popular YouTuber Keemstar and facilitated by UMG, was a $20,000 elimination-based tournament with top players. In this week of the Summer Skirmish Series, worth $1 million, Epic is choosing to host a two-day tournament, effectively rendering Fortnite Friday playerless. It doesn’t have to be this way, Epic. I know that the concept of 100 of the best players in the world dropping into one map sounds incredible. It does. It sounds great, in theory. But in practice, it’s just a disorderly live stream of a bunch of highly talented players sitting around in bases, or worse lagging to the point of being frozen. And, an invitational tournament (that goes terribly wrong) doesn’t scream “inclusive,” which is what Epic repeatedly says competitive Fortnite should be. There is another way, and it’s the same way that Fortnite players have been competing for months now. A kill race. But let’s back up a bit. Right now, Fortnite is played by 100 people in a single lobby, and ‘winning’ the game is defined by being the last survivor(s). This can be played in solo mode, with 100 individuals facing off against the storm and each other, or in 50 teams of two (Duos), or 25 teams of 4 (Squads). Videogames often get tweaks for the competitive scene, whether it’s limiting the resources/gear that players can use or reducing the number of maps that can be played. When skill level is that high, most games must make changes to allow for true competition. Given it’s still early days, Fortnite Battle Royale featuring purely pro players simply hasn’t worked. But as it stands now, there are roughly two schools of thought. Whoever gets the most eliminations wins. Pros: Super fun to watch Requires skill Inclusive to non-pro players Cons: A lot of RNG More time consuming Gamebattle sites like CMG and UMG have been running minor tournaments for quite a while now using this format. Fortnite Friday, arguably one of the biggest weekly tournaments, also follows this format. Here’s how it works: Individual players load up in a Duo match on the same team, or teams of two load up into a Squad match, also on the same team, and race for who can get the most kills in a public match. This means that these opposing players can’t kill each other, but can keep track of each other’s kills and placement on the map. When you’re racing for kills, understanding where the other duo are fighting and how many kills they have is important information. Given only four players are competing at a time, that means that the rest of the 92 people on the map are regular Fortnite players. This is where RNG comes into play. RNG is a term used in gaming that means Random Number Generator. It is the gaming equivalent of Alanis Morsette’s “Ironic.” It essentially means that there is some level of random luck involved in the game. For example, you might land in a place where there is usually a weapon or chest, but that weapon or chest isn’t there, leaving you vulnerable to other players who land around you. Great players can work around or overcome a certain level of RNG, but if the opposing team comes up on a squad of noobs and your team rolls up on a squad of great players, the tide of the match will inevitably shift against you, and may even result in a loss. This is the cost of the 2v2 format that has become popularized with the vast majority of Fortnite competitive players. While it takes more time to have 100 players compete four at a time, this format allows the viewer to watch no more than four players as they traverse the map and seek eliminations. At most, the audience has to follow along with four separate stories on the map. In most cases, duos play together which brings that number down to two. In either case, it’s much easier than following along with the stories of 50 separate teams. Traditional Battle Royale Pros: Less RNG Amazing build fights Fair, in the sense that players are fighting players of equal skill level Cons: It’s boring Not inclusive Confusing and scattered for viewers This format was used during the Ninja Live tournament, the Fortnite ProAm tournament, and most recently during the $8 million Summer Skirmish series, hosted by Epic Games. Here’s how it works: 100 pro players/streamers pair off into teams of two and all load into the same lobby, with the goal of lasting the longest. As I said, Fortnite Battle Royale is built around the idea that there would be a sole survivor, but doesn’t predicate that survival on a certain level of skill. In other words, it’s relatively easy to hide, avoid fights, and survive to the near end of a game, or potentially even win. It doesn’t take much skill to squat in a bush or set traps in a house and sit in the bathroom. Obviously, with pro players, there will be gunfights, and those gunfights should be pretty interesting. But they are few and far between, and are difficult to predict and capture for the live stream. This also excludes regular players from being a part of the action. Yes, it’s a risk to construct a competitive scene on the backs of public game play. But it’s also never been done before in the pro gaming world. And it is the best way to include public players into the competitive scene. A regular player is far more likely to get interested in the competitive scene knowing that, on Friday or Saturday, they have the chance to play against the world’s greatest competitors. The best way to build on the momentum of Fortnite’s popularity, as well as support the community as a whole, is to build out tournaments focused on eliminations within public lobbies. It makes sense for Epic to want to control that experience, and it certainly makes sense for Epic to want the competitive scene to fit within the game they built, which is a Battle Royale. But thus far, competitive Battle Royale featuring purely pro players simply hasn’t worked. And it feels slightly underhanded for Epic to barrel over Fortnite Friday, given that the more competitive tournaments around Fortnite, the better for the game. The community is here, telling you what it wants, Epic. And in true Fortnite fashion, if you build it, they will come.","Last weekend, Epic Games put forth its first true effort at official competitive Fortnite Battle Royale. It was a disaster.

Jane Merrick,"Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) Given that her previous annual speech to members of her party was an unmitigated disaster for Theresa May, the bar for this year was pretty low. The British Prime Minister wanted to show her Conservative Party -- and the country -- that there is more to her government than the tortuous Brexit negotations, with some optimism about the future. Instead, she far exceeded their expectations, delighting members of Parliament and activists from the first minute: the normally rigid, awkward Prime Minister came onto the conference stage to ABBA's ""Dancing Queen, "" breaking out some moves as she approached the lectern. The idea to open her speech this way -- making light of her stilted dances during a trip to South Africa in August -- was all hers. Widely mocked for being robotic in persona and intransigent in policy, May decided to take ownership, self-deprecatingly, of her flaws. But it was also her opportunity to show the Conservative Party -- including her arch-critic Boris Johnson -- that she is still in charge of the Brexit process and has authority over her government. It was a tough ask. Privately, her allies had been just hoping she would make it to the end of the speech, and the end of the four-day conference in Birmingham, without mishap -- which last year included a persistent cough, the set behind her falling apart and a stage invasion by someone handing her the British equivalent of a pink slip. It was that last incident that seemed, at the time, the most portentous -- foreshadowing her resignation over Brexit. Yet that resignation never came. That is not to say the last year has been an easy one for May. It has been a turbulent 12 months, bookended by these two pivotal speeches. Of course, May did not resign, but seven of her Cabinet ministers walked out, for various reasons. Two of those resignations were potentially the most damaging, because they were in direct opposition to her so-called Chequers plan for withdrawal from the EU: Boris Johnson as foreign secretary and David Davis as Brexit secretary. The work of her government has seemed stymied by Brexit. Negotiations with Brussels have been slow and difficult, forcing the PM to take personal charge of the talks this summer. Last month, she took her Chequers plan to a summit in Salzburg where it was rebuffed by fellow EU leaders. Though this was a serious blow to her credibility, the next day May came out fighting, demanding respect from the EU. This lack of support has been much closer to home, too. Since his resignation in July, Johnson has engaged in regular attacks against the Prime Minister over Brexit, most recently in a packed-out event at the conference on Tuesday, when his call to ""chuck Chequers"" was cheered by pro-Brexit Tory activists. Yet despite rapturous applause for the former Foreign secretary, many of his fellow Conservative MPs saw this attempt to overshadow the PM as an act of disloyalty. Similarly, a Tory MP who lodged a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, minutes before May was due on stage, was dismissed by his colleagues as ill-timed and disloyal. The Prime Minister had two main messages: one for her party and one for the country. On the first, she made clear she would not change tack on Chequers, despite escalating calls from Brexiteer Tory MPs, and from remain supporters who want a second referendum. The result of the 2016 EU referendum must be honored and she would not shift on the issue of breaking up the United Kingdom -- something that would be under threat if the alternative plan floated by Johnson and other Brexiteers were agreed. On the second, she tried to pitch to the center ground, appealing to voters who are disaffected by the opposition Labour leader's hard left-wing, anti-business policies. She pledged the Tories would be a ""party for the whole country"" that was ""decent, moderate and patriotic."" Her performance was strong enough to see off her critics inside the Conservative Party -- for now. Yet in a week's time, the next round of Brexit negotiations between the UK and Brussels takes place at which there is supposed to be significant progress made towards a deal. During her party conference, which was being watched closely by EU chiefs back in Brussels, there were reports that the UK might agree to stay in the customs union beyond the end of the Brexit transition phase at the end of 2020. If that is on the cards, May did not make mention of it in her speech -- presumably to keep her party inside the hall onside. Yet the UK will need to make concessions to break the deadlock on Brexit next week. The Prime Minister has survived her toughest year so far -- but an even tougher one lies ahead.","Given that her previous annual speech to members of her party was an unmitigated disaster for Theresa May, the bar for this year was pretty low.",2018-10-03T12:48:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' to the rescue,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/opinions/theresa-mays-year-jane-merrick-opinion-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181003080715-theresa-may-8-3-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone. After a tsunami battered the island late last week, leaving at least 1,350 dead, a volcano has now erupted. Earlier this week, scientists forecast that Soputan, an active stratovolcano on the northeastern tip of the island, was showing signs of activity. On Wednesday, it sent an ash cloud towering nearly 20,000 feet above its summit. By night, lava was trickling down Soputans flanks. The volcano continues to be on a Level III alert, which is a watch and take precautions kind of alert, but not an evacuations are imminent one. Soputan has erupted a dozen times since 2000, so this isnt wholly a surprise. But it coming right after an earthquake that triggered a tsunami has people wondering if the geological phenomena are intertwined. The short answer: We dont know, but it seems unlikely. It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen, Kasbani, the head of Indonesias Vulcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation agency who goes by only one name, said according to NBC News. Denison University volcanologist Erik Klemetti threw even more cold water on the speculation. Soputan had already been restless for months before the earthquake and the volcano is hundreds of kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake, he said in an email to Earther. So, I invoke correlation =/= causation on this front. Indonesia is just that geologically active. Indeed, Indonesia is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world. The islands that make up the nation are home to dozens of active volcanoes owing to its proximity the edge of tectonic plates. That can allow magma to seep up from deep in the Earth to the surface more readily. This isnt the first eruption weve seen in Indonesia recently. In February, Mount Sinabung in Sumatra popped off, sending an extremely ominous-looking ash cloud towering over the countryside. Last November, Mount Agung on Bali did its thing, too.

He said building by residents between wooded areas was a ""crime"" that had resulted in blocking escape routes. Mr Kammenos was confronted by angry locals as he visited areas devastated by fires east of Athens this week. At least 81 people died and search teams fear they will find further victims as dozens more are missing. Arriving in the fire zone in the town of Mati on Thursday, Mr Kammenos was surrounded by residents who accused him of abandoning them. ""You left us alone,"" one person told the minister, who was accompanied by the local mayor and the head of the air force. One man told the BBC he had reached the fire station to ask for help, and found firefighters unaware of the blaze. Another resident complained that people had been advised to dive into the sea to escape, when most of the elderly were unable to reach the sea in the first place. Many of the survivors were saved by the sea, but a large number of the victims in Mati were trapped close to a cliff-edge, unable to reach the water. Mr Kammenos, a combative figure who leads the nationalist Independent Greeks, rejected accusations that the government had failed to protect its citizens.

Jonathan Shieber,"If the current presidential administration’s approach to climate change could be summarized in one sentence, it seems that sentence would be “smoke em if you got em.” By the administration’s own estimate, on its current course (if nations around the world do nothing more to respond to the climate change threat) the planet will warm by 7 degrees by the end of the century. It means, as one Twitter commentator pointed out, that climate change is not only real, but catastrophic… and the response is to burn more carbon because we’re all dead anyway. Well, at least they finally admitted it was real, said the man crawling out of the ensuing permanent desert hellstorm covering America into the more soothing environs of a 30 meter sea rise to quietly drown along with civilization as we know it… https://t.co/TwJ5nDwjtV — Matthew Ocko (@mattocko) September 28, 2018 If global temperatures rise 7 degrees, much of coastal America will find itself underwater. Ocean acidification will dissolve coral reefs and the world can expect dramatically more powerful and more damaging storms and more severe droughts and heatwaves. However, as The Washington Post reported, the dire assessment of the world’s climate situation wasn’t made with an eye toward trying to find solutions to the problem, merely to illustrate that the planet is already doomed. The revelations of our planet’s fate came buried in a 500-page report from the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration study that was meant to justify President Trump’s decision to drop fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks built after 2020. The administration’s argument is: if no one does anything more to combat climate change, then the world will be destroyed anyway, so there’s no point in doing anything to try and combat climate change. The (lack of) logic explains why the administration has rolled back emissions reduction requirements on methane (from oil and gas drilling and industrial animal farming), carbon dioxide (for coal fired power plants), and hydrofluorocarbons (used in refrigerators and air conditioners). The NTHSA report projects that global temperatures will rise by roughly 3.5 degrees above the last average temperature before climate change began to affect (the years between 1986 and 2005) whether or not the rules on fuel efficiency standards are enacted or not. The administration isn’t wrong in its assessment of where things stand now, but it is wrong in assuming that the current situation in any way reflects future realities. As the analysis states, the world will have to drastically slash carbon to avoid the kind of disastrous warming scenario. However, the assumption that the analysis reaches (as quoted by The Post ), that reducing emissions “would require substantial increases in technology innovation and adoption compared to today’s levels and would require the economy and the vehicle fleet to move away from the use of fossil fuels, which is not currently technologically feasible or economically feasible,” seems misplaced. It also flies in the face of repeated assertions by the President that climate change is a hoax. By acknowledging the existence of climate change and saying that nothing can be done to stop it, the new report provides a cover for all of the steps that have been taken by conservative lawmakers and the President’s cabinet to cut costs for industry. Meanwhile, the Carolinas are still underwater from flooding brought on by Hurricane Florence ( here are ways to donate ), and the risk of wildfires continues to increase in the West. This is fine.","If the current presidential administration’s approach to climate change could be summarized in one sentence, it seems that sentence would be “smoke em if you got em.” By the administration’s own estimate, on its current course (if nations around the world do …",2018-09-28T18:39:21Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","As its own reports reveal the disaster of climate inaction, Trump proposes climate inaction",http://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/as-its-own-reports-reveal-the-disaster-of-climate-inaction-trump-proposes-climate-inaction/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-28-at-8.53.34-AM.png?w=764,techcrunch,TechCrunch,1
RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Ms. Mahoney, 25, was eight months pregnant when Irma ripped away their doors and windows, allowing the blast of rain into their old apartment. It was as if someone aimed a fire hose at everything inside, and left it running for hours, she said; two weeks later, Maria turned the hose on again. They have replaced or boarded over the openings, but the walls inside are “still wet to the touch,” she said. “The bathroom roof is falling apart. There’s a lot of mold, greenish and bluish, coming out of the walls.” Nearly everything they owned was ruined. An outer wall of their apartment, in a building in the Tutu High Rise Community, shifted in one of the storms, so the rooms flood anew with each rainfall. Their only way to cook was on a campfire, and with no refrigeration, they had to be careful to buy only as much food as they could prepare and eat each day. Across the islands, mosquitoes and flies proliferate in the standing water and rotting garbage, and like many people, Ms. Mahoney, unable to close her home to the elements, worries about a disease outbreak. Now, she has an added worry, an infant to care for — Trinity Luisa Mathurin, born in a hospital on Oct. 19. The baby’s arrival helped persuade the parents that they had to move, Ms. Mahoney said, “because it’s not sanitary.” But she is acutely aware that others are less fortunate. She and Mr. Mathurin have been sheltering neighbors whose apartment lost entire walls, so that their furniture literally blew away. With many homes destroyed, their family is not high on the list to get a more intact unit in the Tutu complex, a public housing project — but that is as it should be, Ms. Mahoney said. The storms left their 2011 Toyota Yaris with shattered windows and soaked upholstery, but to her surprise, it runs. She used to work at a hotel, but the storms put it out of business. After a few weeks, roads were cleared and some cell service returned, so her husband, a painter, was able to reach his boss and return to work on repair projects. “It feels like we’re actually making a bit of progress,” she said. “But it’s still such a long, long way to go.” _____ Continue reading the main story","More than two months after the disaster on the U.S. Virgin Islands began, we checked back on some spots that we visited and photographed not long after the storms hit.",2017-11-10T10:00:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",After Irma and Maria: How 3 Spots on the U.S. Virgin Islands Are Faring,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/virgin-islands-hurricanes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/00USVI-top2/00USVI-top2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","France has turned into a bubbling cauldron of unrest over the past month as the so-called yellow vest movement has put up roadblocks and taken to the streets to protest a gas tax. Last weeks protests turned violent and facing a crisis, the government of Emmanuel Macron announced on Tuesday it would put a six-month moratorium on the tax. The tax was meant to combat climate change and reduce carbon pollution. While it likely wouldve done that, it wouldve done so on the backs of Frances rural low and middle class. The mass revolt against it doesnt mean those groups oppose climate action. It means that Macron needs to include them in discussions about the best way to address climate change as part of a just transition, something the world at-large is grappling with as it aims to get a handle on carbon emissions. More than 280,000 protesters donned yellow safety vests that motorists are required to keep in their cars and took to the streets across France last weekend. The protests have arisen organically through Facebook and other social media platforms, and span the ideological divide. Their focus has largely been on the unfairness of Macrons proposed gas tax, which wouldve raised prices by 0.029 per liter ($0.12 a gallon) on unleaded gas and 0.065 per liter ($0.24 a gallon) on diesel. Rising oil prices have pushed fuel prices higher still now was among the worst times to propose such a tax. The French government has spent years promoting diesel, and the tax wouldve left many already struggling to make ends meet with higher fuel bills on vehicles theyve been encouraged to buy. The money it raised would also have been used to combat the national deficit, which has been made worse in part by the Macron governments policies, like lifting portions of a wealth tax. In short, the gas tax was a technocratic fix without any real constituency and the benefits were poorly explained, leaving it open to criticism and protest. The yellow vests enjoy a broad base of support with a recent poll showing that 72 percent of the French public is sympathetic to the cause. California just became the first state in the U.S. to require all new buildings feature solar Read more Read The fight against the tax is not a fight against climate policy, however. We are not against the ecology, on the contrary, Benoit Julou, a spokesperson for the yellow vest movement, said on a France 3 talk show last week. Rather it shows that any policies that only consider climate benefits and are made top-down are destined to fail. Governments need to communicate clearly why change in all sectors of the economy is necessary to limit global warming and how it plans to buffer potentially negative social and economic implications, Alexander Reitzenstein, a policy advisor at the European think tank Third Generation Environmentalism, told Earther. The French government did not provide a credible plan for how to compensate particularly poorer households. Poor households are often most affected by higher fuel prices, higher electricity bills or higher costs for keeping homes warm. Reitzenstein is part of a growing group of researchers, policymakers, and advocates pushing for a just transition when it comes to climate change. Simply put, this is a way to ensure people working in the fossil fuel industry or other industries dependent on fossil fuels, as well as low income and disadvantaged communities in general, arent left holding the bag as the world tries to get a handle on carbon emissions. A just transition ensures that we create a world people want to live in and that everyones needs are accounted for. Spain recently offered a buyout for coal miners as it plans to shut down the industry by the end of the year. A just transition is also a central tenet of the Green New Deal proposed by Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And its a theme of this years climate talks in Poland. Reitzenstein, who is at the talks, said that the French protests have been a hot topic among the conference halls and meeting rooms as delegates grapple with the need to address climate change in the most equitable way possible. Ivetta Gerasimchuk, a researcher at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, pointed to policies in Indonesia that ended motor fuel subsidies in 2015 as an effective example of what transportation policy could look like. President Joko Widodo included subsidy reform in his election campaign explaining all the benefits that these budgetary savings can unlock, she told Earther while noting it came at a time of low fuel prices. Through this reform, Indonesia saved $15.6 billion and invested in budget increases for key areas including transport and other infrastructure and transfers to village. That illustrates some of the key principles Gerasimchuk said are part of just climate policies, including clearly communicating the benefits, engaging with communities, and building broad support. Macron could look at that as one avenue to build a new gas tax, but ultimately his government really needs to listen to the people in the streets. And those voices are speaking more loudly about the broader structural issues in France, many of which are found throughout the developed world associated with neoliberal policies that have driven inequality to some of the highest levels in modern history. The rising inequality also means the richest 10 percent of the world emit 50 percent of its carbon pollution, shining a potential glaring spotlight on who should pay the most to address climate change. Just transition and ambitious climate policy are two sides of the same coin, there is no choice to either do just transition or climate ambition, Reitzenstein said.","France has turned into a bubbling cauldron of unrest over the past month as the so-called yellow vest movement has put up roadblocks and taken to the streets to protest a gas tax.

KATIE ROGERS,"“Reagan’s experience with various statewide and national campaigns will be a big asset as the first lady and her team prepare to roll out her official platform in the coming months,” Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, said in an email. Mrs. Trump has given few clues to where she may focus her efforts, but she has publicly expressed interest in helping children affected by the opioid crisis, advocating anti-bullying measures and aiding disaster relief efforts. (The first lady’s previous promise to combat cyberbullying seems to have fallen on the list of priorities.) First ladies have often taken a deliberate approach to rolling out initiatives. Michelle Obama unveiled “Let’s Move,” her signature campaign to combat child obesity, about a year into her tenure. Laura Bush took about that much time organizing the first National Book Festival. Compared with her predecessors, Mrs. Trump is still keeping her East Wing staff small: At 12 people, the head count is roughly less than half the number of people who worked for previous first ladies. In addition to Ms. Thompson, the other new East Wing aides are Annie LeHardy, who will move from the West Wing to serve as a communications coordinator for Mrs. Trump, and Justin Caporale, a veteran of the Trump campaign and an aide in the White House advance office, who will serve as the first lady’s director of operations. As a student at Stanford University, Ms. Thompson served as the president of a student group supporting Mitt Romney’s run for president in 2012. During her time with Mr. Pompeo, she appears to have worked closely with him, including during his preparations to become C.I.A. director. “Proud of my friend &amp; colleague,” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, wrote on Twitter last January, “who helped her boss @repmikepompeo get confirmed for CIA.” In winning a “30 Under 30” award from the website Red Alert Politics in 2016, Ms. Thompson told the site that “our party has to dig deep and recommit to our founding principles.” “I feel that time is short — we no longer have the option to just get along, to be popular, and take the easy way out,” she added. The announcement of Mrs. Trump’s staff additions comes days after the White House was put on the defensive by the new book, “Fire and Fury,” by Michael Wolff, which described President Trump as someone with a short attention span, lack of grasp of policy details and slapdash approach to the presidency. In the book, Mr. Wolff wrote that the first lady had cried on election night — a claim that two people close to her have denied — and had not supported Mr. Trump’s bid for the presidency. Mr. Trump’s response to the book has been decidedly more pugilistic than his wife’s, but, according to people who know her well, she shares the president’s grievances about the book and has instructed her staff to forcefully push back against it. “Mrs. Trump has always been supportive of her husband’s run for president and that continues a year into his presidency,” Ms. Grisham wrote in an email shortly after excerpts from the book were published last week. “She knows how much he loves this country and supports him fully. He consistently seeks her advice and counsel on many subjects.” Ms. Grisham did not go into specifics.

Natasha Lomas,"Move over Twitter, President Trump now has the power to send every phone in the land a simultaneous message — thanks to the new “presidential alert”, tested by FEMA yesterday. What’s it for? The idea is to enable the president of the United States to warn the nation of major threats — such as a natural disaster or terrorist attack. FEMA did already have the power to mass text US phones, via the National Wireless Emergency Alert System devised by the Bush administration in 2006, which has been used for sending alerts about national emergencies like weather events or missing children at a local level. But now the system has been expanded to allow for the White House to compose and send its own ‘presidential alert’ to all phones in a national emergency situation. There is no opt-out. Repeat: No opt-out. Fortunately Congress did limit the substance of these alerts — to “natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made disasters or threats to public safety”, further stipulating that: Except to the extent necessary for testing the public alert and warning system, the public alert and warning system shall not be used to transmit a message that does not relate to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety. But bearing in mind the ‘rip it up’ record of the current holder of office of the president of the US, there are no copper-bottomed guarantees about how ‘threat to public safety’ might be interpreted by president Trump. So it remains a slightly mind-bending concept that the president could, say after a 3am binge-watch of his favorite TV show, fire out an alert entirely of his framing to EVERY US PHONE. Technology is indeed a double-edged sword. Here are a few ideas of presidential alerts we really hope Trump won’t be sending… an accidental photo of a body part after he couldn’t figure out how to use the system and hit send accidentally a text message intended for his son-in-law “Donald Trump” covfefe an even worse spelling mistake, e.g. mangling the name of another world leader — like French president “Manuel Macaroon” actual insults directed at other world leaders, e.g. suggesting Emmanuel Macron has a dandruff problem threats of thermonuclear war an unfortunate spoonerism, e.g. ‘the rockets are cot numbing’ a love sonnet to president Kim Jong-Un encouragement to Russia to hack political opponents’ emails a recipe for a “beautiful” chocolate cake his golf handicap an affiliate link to a brochure of Trump Tower US stock market numbers investment advice an affiliate link to buy The Art of The Deal any other book recommendations at all a love sonnet to Ivanka Trump a claim that the hurricane isn’t actually as bad as FEMA’s alert says it is #MAGA “Lock her up” “His testimony was very credible, very credible” “You also had some very fine people on both sides” any claim about the size of the crowds at his inauguration any claim about historical precedence and what his administration has achieved all forms of self congratulation his thoughts on the UN his thoughts on NATO his thoughts on the EU his thoughts on China his thoughts on the Queen anything at all about women “Melanie” all insults about “the failing New York Times” a heart emoji + the words “Tucker Carlson” any text that includes the words “Fox &amp; Friends” any text that includes the phrase “America first” a photo of Melania reclining on gilt furniture, in a gilt room, with some gilt statues a selfie with anyone, especially Nigel Farage any text written in ALL CAPS any text ending with the word “Sad!” his travel itinerary for his next trip to the Winter White House a love sonnet to president Putin ‘exciting’ real estate opportunities credit for Brexit a threat to Twitter not to shadowban conservative voices “You’re fired!” “Build the wall!” “Mission accomplished!” anything at all about president Obama all sports commentary anything containing the word “winning” his thoughts on climate change his thoughts on environmental protection his thoughts on the safety of radioactive substances a list of reasons why the Iran deal was a mistake his thoughts on anything at all to do with the rest of the world a photoshopped picture of Justin Trudeau to make him look ugly diet advice travel advice fashion advice complaints that Google is biased anything about tax — unless it’s his own tax returns a message to Peter Thiel asking him to come back a message asking where the nearest KFC is a message asking where he left his last bucket of KFC a really boring and slightly blurred photo of the inside of Air Force One any message about anything at all he saw on TV last night “Ha-ha you can’t opt out!” “Genius” his thoughts","Move over Twitter, President Trump now has the power to send every phone in the land a simultaneous message — thanks to the new “presidential alert”, tested by FEMA yesterday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In what may be the first bit of good news in a while for Northern California, rain could be on the way by the end of this week.

Fire authorities have made good progress in containing the Camp Fire. As of Monday morning, it was 66 percent contained and fire activity has been minimal to moderate as winds that fanned the blaze have died down, according to Cal Fire. A dry summeralready Californias driest seasonand a dry start to the rainy season are in part responsible for the fires destructive behavior. From September until the fire began in early November, rainfall was five inches below normal. But welcome relief is en route. Major weather models show a series of storms, including an atmospheric river event, will usher in rain and snow to Northern California. The first blast of precipitation could come as early as Tuesday night, but the real rainmaker is expected to arrive on Thanksgiving and last through the weekend in the form of an atmospheric river. Tapping moisture from the tropics, its likely to send copious amounts of rain and mountain snow to the area around Paradise, the town basically wiped out by the Camp Fire, as well as points further north into Oregon. In fact, Oregon is likely to get whacked with the brunt of the storm, but the National Weather Service is still calling it a potential high impact event across Northern California. Up to 6 inches of rain could fall near Paradise and the surrounding area. That would tamp down flames, allowing firefighters to get an even better handle on containing the Camp Fire. The storm will also come with gusty winds, which should blow smoke out of not just the Paradise area but all of Northern California. That will be a welcome relief for people hundreds of miles from the fire who have been choking on smoke. The rain also comes with downsides, though. Debris flows are among the high impacts that the National Weather Service is forecasting. That could hamper the search and rescue operations that are still ongoing with more than 1,000 people missing and thousands of homes being assessed for damage. A Cal Fire spokesperson told Earther it could clog roads, impeding firefighters access to where they need to dig fire lines and assess damage. It could also wash away bone fragments and other signs of victims who were essentially cremated by the Camp Fire. Because of that and the already tall task of sifting through ash for signs of human remains, the Butte County sheriff said its possible well never know the full toll of the fire. Theres also the concern for the thousands of people who are homeless. An impromptu tent city popped up in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Chico, about 15 miles to the west of Paradise. The rain could swamp the encampment, and organizers are rushing to get people settled into sheltered with roofs that are more solid than tarps and rain flies, according to CNN. A number of shelters have reported outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug that can cause vomiting and diarrhea. The whole situation may sound like something more familiar in the developing world than the richest nation on the planet, but here we are. It makes clear how the effects of climate change, which has worsened wildfire season, can cascade to create a disaster on top of a disaster. This is a dress rehearsal for the future, one which no amount of raking the forest can stop.","In what may be the first bit of good news in a while for Northern California, rain could be on the way by the end of this week.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and DAVID ZUCCHINO","Around lunchtime, Steven Swank, 23, was packing a few cases of water into a little sedan. In 1999, the Grid was inundated by river flooding after Hurricane Floyd, and Mr. Swank wanted none of it. He and his girlfriend were going to his sister’s house for a while. “She lives over behind the Cracker Barrel, not near any water,” he said. “We don’t want to be stuck here.” Worries were running equally high in inland South Carolina. Fifteen miles northwest of the gaudy spectacle of Myrtle Beach sits the quiet county seat of Conway, a nearly 290-year-old town shaded by live oaks and straddling the Waccamaw River. Time and again — in Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew, to name just two occasions — Myrtle Beach has been spared the worst damage, while Conway has taken a heavy hit: flash floods with the storm itself, then river floods in the days that followed. “The water collects really quickly, and people think that’s the flooding, but it’s flash flooding,” said Le Hendricks, the Conway fire chief. “That goes down pretty quick, and then they think they’re free. B ut then what happens is, the Waccamaw River gets backed up.” Chief Hendricks described a kind of hydrological traffic jam: Water trying to leave the Waccamaw meets flooded waterways and a surging ocean at capacity. The river has nowhere to go but over its banks, onto highways and roads and into people’s homes. This kind of flooding might not happen at its worst until two days after the hurricane hits, but when it does, the water can sit for weeks. Meanwhile, places on the coast might have already begun rebuilding from any damage wrought by the winds and the initial surge. “Myrtle Beach, they did fairly will during Matthew,” Chief Hendricks said. “They had damage but were back up and running within a couple of days.” Conway, at first, thought it had dodged a bullet, as well, he said. “But it was the flooding. And it took about 18 days for us to get back out of that.”","The storm surge in the Carolinas could be deadly.

Aimée Lutkin,"Hurricane Florence has hit the North Carolina coast, already causing massive flooding in inland towns along rivers. Meteorologists are anticipating that Florence will linger and move further inland over the weekend, which means a lot of people are going to need rescue and relief. Here’s how you can help. Local Organizations Though it’s quite easy to donate to the American Red Cross via text, and they’re incredibly well-known across the country, they’re also an organization that’s been plagued with accusations of mismanagement and other mistakes. In general, it’s often best to contribute to local groups who have a better idea of what’s needed and a smaller internal infrastructure sucking up money. For the purposes of this article, we’re focusing on those. The North Carolina Community Foundation (NCCF) is a “highly-rated charity currently providing aid to the Carolinas ahead of Florence” according to ABC News, and it partners with local charities, so you know your money is being directed by people most familiar with the area. Here’s their website for donations. There are also South Carolina and Georgia state chapters of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster who each offer recommendations of which relief organizations they would choose, if you want to investigate where your money is headed. Finally, there’s The North Carolina Disaster Fund, which purports to assist with “unmet needs in the aftermath of a disaster.” These are the groups that will be in the Carolinas helping people get back on their feet long after the waters recede. Team Rubicon Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. According to their website, they have 9,979 volunteers across VA, NC, SC, and GA and have already positioned equipment and boats along the coast to sweep in where they’re needed. Americares Americares focuses on health in disaster relief, and they currently have a response team ready for North Carolina: “The storm is on track to make a direct hit on the East Coast and impact much of the southern United States in the coming days,” Americares Director of Emergency Response Brian Scheel said in a statement Monday. “Our response team has been activated and is ready to meet the immediate health needs in affected communities.” Donations to Americares are directed to emergency medicine and other health supplies, and you can contribute here. GlobalGiving GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots groups working to restore areas hit by disasters, and they’ve already started their Hurricane Florence relief fund. Some of that money will be directed towards immediate needs, but much of it will go towards long term projects restoring the community once the storm has passed. Things are… not great now.

Vulnerable animals will need to be rescued from homes where they are abandoned and shelter animals will also be in need.

SCOTT CACCIOLA,"Then there was James, who had been incredibly durable in his 16-year career. But during the Lakers Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors, he limped off the court with a strained groin and missed the next 17 games. Without him, the Lakers struggled. The hope was that they could regain their footing once he returned, but he was not the cure-all anyone imagined. The Lakers continued to lose with James back in the lineup, even though he said he had activated himself for a playoff push.
It had become clear by then, however, that the Lakers lacked any discernible chemistry or cohesion, especially after Johnson and Rob Pelinka, their general manager, tried and failed to acquire the All-Star center Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans ahead of Februarys trade deadline. (It was no coincidence, perhaps, that Davis and James shared the same agent, Rich Paul.) The Lakers were willing to send the Pelicans several of their promising young players, including Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Ball, but were rebuffed in their attempts to swing a blockbuster deal.
The result was a team that seemed distracted at best and fractured at worst. With their playoff hopes spiraling, the Lakers appeared to hit rock bottom on March 2 when they lost to the Phoenix Suns, one of the worst teams in the league. In a moment that quickly went viral online and appeared a fitting symbol for everything that had gone wrong for the Lakers James carelessly threw the ball off the underside of the backboard on an out-of-bounds play, leading to a turnover. Walton glowered from the bench.
Yet about two weeks later, it somehow did get worse for the Lakers: a late-game collapse and a loss to the Knicks (who were the worst team in the league) at Madison Square Garden. Not long after that, the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention. James did not dress for the final six games of the season, as the team aimed to preserve him for more meaningful games in the future.
Walton, who spent most of his 10-year N.B.A. playing career with the Lakers, winning two championships as a reserve forward, was hired as their head coach in 2016 after two seasons as an assistant with the Warriors. In 2015-16, he began the season as the Warriors interim coach while Steve Kerr recovered from debilitating back issues, and guided the team to a 39-4 record, which included a league-record 24 straight wins to start the season.
It was certainly an achievement, but the Warriors were coming off a championship and primed to excel. With the Lakers, Walton was trying to build something. Now, that massive project however onerous will continue without him.","Walton had coached the team for the past three seasons, but 2018-19, with LeBron James on board, was a disaster and brought the franchise’s sixth consecutive missed postseason.",2019-04-12T20:37:41Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Los Angeles Lakers ‘Mutually’ Part Ways With Coach Luke Walton,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/sports/luke-walton-fired-lakers.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/sports/12walton/12walton-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
ZACH SCHONBRUN,"Roberts, who also had a 43-yard punt return in the first quarter, would take punter Sam Martin’s kick to the distance a few minutes later, tiptoeing down the sideline as he eluded Lions defenders. The first game for Detroit’s new coach, Matt Patricia, looked eerily familiar to the porous performance in last year’s Super Bowl by the New England Patriots, where Patricia was the defensive coordinator. But it turned into Darnold’s night after he rebounded to complete his first N.F.L. pass, on a slant to tight end Neal Sterling. After he converted his first four third-down conversions. After he delivered a teardrop throw to Robby Anderson for 41 yards, and his first career touchdown pass, in the second quarter. By then that first horrendous interception was long forgotten. It had been a curious play call. On first down at the 25, Darnold faked the handoff to running back Bilal Powell and then rolled out to his right. He was chased by a defender. Then he looked all the way left, where Powell had leaked out down the sideline, and that’s where Darnold would throw. But his pass floated in the air for what seemed an eternity. A throw back across the full width of the field is rarely advised. In this case, it was a disaster. Safety Quandre Diggs picked it off with ease and raced into the end zone. One play, one error. Darnold walked slowly to the sideline and stood with his hands on his hips. Coach Todd Bowles passed by. So did the offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates, who gave Darnold an encouraging tap. There was a lot of game left. “I was licking my chops a little bit too much,” Darnold said. “Right when I released it, I saw the defender. I just thought, ‘Oh shoot.’ But it is what it is. You put it behind you and play the game.” It is helpful to remember that Stafford was once in a position not unlike his opponent on Monday. As a 21-year-old rookie in 2009, he started the season-opener on the road in New Orleans and threw three interceptions in a 45-27 loss. He would go on to throw 20 interceptions with 13 touchdowns passes in a 2-14 season.","Darnold’s first professional throw was an interception returned for a touchdown, but he bounced back to lead the Jets to a big win.",2018-09-11T03:37:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Jets 48, Lions 17: Jets’ Sam Darnold Turns Disaster Into Dominance in Win Over Lions",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/sports/sam-darnold-jets-lions.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/sports/11JETSprint/11JETSprint-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Megan Farokhmanesh,"In June, alongside annual creator conference VidCon, YouTuber Tana Mongeau held her own event called TanaCon. Despite promises of free concerts, talks, and meet-and-greets with stars like Shane Dawson and Bella Thorne, the event spiraled into a disaster that was canceled after its first day. Dawson later released a three-part series featuring interviews with Mongeau and TanaCon organizer Michael Weist. Now, Weist has released his own version of events. The tedious hour-and-a-half video, “TanaCon: What Really Happened,” is a no-flair affair featuring meetings between Mongeau, Weist, and other organizers involved with the event. (Embedded shares of the video have been prohibited by the YouTube channel.) While some of the footage was previously featured in Dawson’s documentary — including a moment in which Mongeau declares that “people love to be oppressed outside” in lines — Weist’s version is, at times, excruciating in its detail. “I think TanaCon is going to provide an experience that VidCon’s not going to,” says Weist in the video. Unfortunately for everyone involved, he was correct. “TanaCon is going to provide an experience that VidCon’s not going to.” The video crawls through early meetings and into the day’s events, which largely focus on what happened inside TanaCon, rather than outside, where fans were trapped in hellish lines for hours. There is no additional commentary to add context to TanaCon, whether it’s footage of the embarrassingly sparse swag bags (including the infamous “TanaCondom,” for an event largely filled with young fans) to footage of a venue that is clearly inadequate. The video also repeatedly sticks to incorrect claims that 15,000 or even 20,000 people showed up to the event. According to Garden Grove Police after the event, officers estimated there were around 4,000 to 5,000 people. Weist has said previously that the event was disastrous for his personal finances. On October 17th, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy after claiming to have lost $700,000. His video only briefly addresses the Dawson documentary and further claims that after Weist, Dawson, and Mongeau sat down to discuss the damage done, “the responsibility was left on Michael.” It concludes with a message that “Michael and Tana are no longer friends and do not speak.”","In June, alongside annual creator conference VidCon, YouTuber Tana Mongeau held her own event called TanaCon.

Victoria Song,"In an about face, Netflix has decided to pull footage of the tragic Lac-Mégantic rail accident from its original film Bird Boxalmost two months after a spokesperson said the clip will stay in the movie.
In an emailed statement to Gizmodo, a Netflix spokesperson said, Netflix and the filmmakers of Bird Box have decided to replace the clip. Were sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Mégantic community. The company declined to publicly comment further on the reason behind its sudden reversal. 
Quebecs culture and communications minister Nathalie Roy praised Netflixs decision in a tweet. Translated, the tweet reads: This gesture was expected out of respect for the victims of this horrible tragedy, their loved ones and the entire Lac-Mégantic community. This result shows that by being united and pooling our efforts, everything is possible.
Lac-Mégantic Mayor Julie Morin is also satisfied with the outcome. Yes, there was a delay, Morin told The Canadian Press, but in the end, the most important thing is that people came to the conclusion that the situation was significant enough to settle. 
Earlier this year, Netflix issued an apology for including footage of the fatal 2013 accident that claimed 47 lives. In the apology, Netflix noted that the imagery had been unwittingly sourced from stock footage, and because it was so widespread, the company could not make changes to finished content. In January, a spokesperson told the Associated Press that it will keep the clip in the movie. The clip in question was featured early on in the movie, during a breaking news montage detailing fictional mass suicides.
Needless to say, Netflixs decision did not sit well with Canadians. Roy wrote a stern letter to Netflix in January, which was also posted to Twitter. Written in French, a portion translated by The Canadian Press reads: These archives should never be used for any purpose other than for news or documentaries. We should never tolerate the use of human tragedies, whatever they are, for entertainment. Its not moral or ethical.
The Canadian Parliament also didnt take Netflixs initial refusal lightly. In January, it passed a motion in the House of Commons demanding Netflix remove the images and pay compensation to the Lac-Mégantic community. 
According to the CBC, a version of Bird Box without the controversial footage will be released in two weeks.

Victoria Song,"When Samsung announced the Galaxy Watch Active smartwatch at its Unpacked Event a few weeks ago, I was cautiously optimistic. Sure, it did away with the companys signature rotating bezel, but otherwise, it was sleek, had all the right specs, and honestly, Samsung has consistently put out some of the best Android-friendly smartwatches over the past few years. It just always seems to struggle with the leap from pretty good, to really great.
The Galaxy Watch Active is a streamlined version of its rebranded Galaxy Watch, which came out last fall. As in, its got most of the same features but in a much smaller design. You could also say its the spiritual successor to the fitness-focused Samsung Gear Sport.
Samsung Galaxy Watch Active
What is it?
Samsung's streamlined fitness watch
Like
Gorgeous design. Lightweight. Good price.
No Like
Mixed accuracy. RIP rotating bezel.
But where the Gear Sport added some much-needed app partnerships to Samsungs Tizen operating system, and the Galaxy Watch advanced Samsungs overall wellness offerings and battery life, the Active doesnt really take any meaningful steps forwardaside from design.
Whatever else you want to say about the Galaxy Watch Active, this is a bee-yoo-tiful smartwatch. The 1.1-inch, 40mm AMOLED circular screen didnt overpower my lady wrist, which is a problem I run into a lot. For instance, the smaller version of the Galaxy Watch is still 42mm and while it looks nice, it was still somewhat bulky and heavy. Not so with the Active. Its light enough that I barely notice it unless Ive got it strapped on too tight. Color wise, its also got some attractive options in black, silver, rose gold, and green. I opted to test the rose gold version, because why not, and also to see how it stacked up against some other fashionable, Android-friendly watches.
Compared to the Fossil Sport, the Active just has a sleeker profile and its a bit more comfortable as the two buttons on the right side dont protrude quite as much. Side-by-side, the Active looks a bit thicker, but it also looks less chintzythe Sports nylon case really doesnt do it any favors. Meanwhile, the Misfit Vapor 2 is heavier, and has more of an industrial look overall. But where I could see the Fossil Sport and Misfit Vapor 2 working as unisex watcheseven in rose goldthe Galaxy Watch Active might just be the first smartwatch thats better suited to women.
There are two reasons for that. First, the small case size is great on petite wrists but might look downright tiny on larger wrist sizes. Second, Samsung got rid of the rotating bezel. As much as it made Tizen stand out by being the most intuitive of smartwatch operating systems, it did give all of Samsungs wearables a distinctly masculine vibe. If anything, the photo above proves that by getting rid of it, the Galaxy Watch Active is looks just as sophisticated, if not more so, than some of the best-looking smartwatches out there.
That said, nixing the rotating bezel doesnt mean the Galaxy Watch Active doesnt have one. Its frustrating, but there is a thick black ring around the Actives display. Its not as egregious as say, the border on the Fitbit Ionic or even on the Versamost of the screens and widgets utilize a black background to mask that its even there. It just highlights the fact there seems to have been plenty of room for the rotating bezel that could have been.
Does Tizen actually suffer though? Surprisingly, not reallytheres just a lot less to differentiate it from Wear OS right now. But in terms of performance, its quite snappy, and swiping between screens is fast and easy. You swipe left to view notifications, right to scroll through pre-set widgets (of which, Samsung has provided plenty), and down to view a quick settings menu. Pressing down, meanwhile, will let you choose between Samsungs preloaded clock faceswhich for me, were varied enough to find one I liked. That said, Tizen isnt quite as stacked when it comes to available apps as, say, the Apple Watch. Plus, it doesnt matter how hard Samsung triesBixby just isnt good and its not happening.
The Active does decently well on battery life as well. Samsung estimates about 45 hours with typical usage, and that about tracks if you keep continuous heart rate monitoring on. (You can get a bit more mileage if you go into settings and opt for more intermittent heart rate readings.) The most I got with the Active was roughly two full days, including one night of sleep. I gave it a quick juice before sleep tracking the next night, and 50 percent battery was enough to get me through to the next morning. Two days isnt great per se, when you consider the Fitbit Versa gets about 5 days on a single charge and the Galaxy Watch gets a superb 4-5 days depending on which version you get. But its roughly the same amount you get with the Apple Watch Series 4, and given the compact designforgivable.
To take the sting out of the two-day battery life, Samsung says you can wirelessly charge the device via a Galaxy S10 phone. And that is coolkinda. It just requires that youre already in the Samsung ecosystem, have an S10, and dont mind incapacitating both your phone and watch while it charges. I tried it out and the Wireless Power Sharing feature definitely worksits just not fast and you do need to position it in exactly the right way to keep it charging. At the end of the day, the idea of waiting 58 minutes with my phone face down to charge 38 percent seems more of a gimmick than practical.
Inside, the Active is packing an accelerometer, built-in GPS, gyroscope, barometer, and heart rate monitor. Its rated for 5 ATM of water resistance, which is basically what a smartwatch needs to be called swim-proof. Its also got NFC payments and on-board music storage up to 4GB. In 2019, this is the basic spec soup you need for a decent fitness-minded smartwatch.
On the fitness front, there are a few things the Active does really well. For starters, Im a fan of its automatic activity tracking for running and walking. Basically, if youre out and about for roughly 10 minutes, the watch notices and starts recording. Thats great if youre absent-minded, like yours truly. Its also got 39 different activities you can choose from, which is a nice change from the limited options that you get with some other, more expensive smartwatches.
So if kicking the rotating bezel wasnt the end of the world, the battery life is decent, the hardware is solid, and the design is goodwhat gives? Sadly, the same thing thats held back every Samsung wearable to date: The software.
On a one-mile treadmill walk at 3.5 miles per hour, the Galaxy Watch Active tracked 1,705 steps compared to the 2,126 steps logged by my control pedometer, the Yamax SW-200 Digi-Walker. Thats a cringe-worthy difference of 19.8 percent. Running didnt fare much better. A one-mile run at 5mph resulted in 1,664 steps to the Yamaxs 1,951 stepsa difference of 14.7 percent. Thats also not great. Generally, most fitness trackers and smartwatches I test tend to be somewhere in the 2-5 percent range. For instance, I tested the Fitbit Ionic Adidas Edition at the same time and got much more accurate 1.08 percent and 1.03 percent differentials for walking and running, respectively.
When it came to heart rate, the Active did somewhat better. During mid-run checks, it was within 5 beats per minute of my Polar H10 chest strap. It was also roughly on par with the Fitbit Ionic Adidas Edition. That said, on a separate, open-ended 17-minute interval run, I encountered an odd glitch. The watch just could not get a read on my heart rate at all. The entirety of the run was recorded as a flat-line 120 beats per minute, which I know to be untrue because: 1) the only time your heart rate is static is when youre dead; and 2) I have data from other trackers worn simultaneously that prove otherwise.
This struck me as odd because itd done fine on my treadmill tests just minutes before. Later in the day, I noticed the watch was struggling to get consistent reads on my heart rate in general. I was futzing around with the stress monitoring, and I was surprised to see that three hours after my run, it was still pegging me as highly stressed out when in fact, I was super chill on my couch. I cleaned off the optical heart rate monitor just in case it was my greasy sweat that was mucking up readings, but it wasnt until I hard rebooted the watch that it started functioning normally again.
This inconsistency bled over into sleep tracking. While you can get a breakdown of your sleep stages, I had multiple nights where the Active just could not get a read on my heart rate and thus, did not track my sleep. When it did manage to track my sleep, it was a mixed bag. One night it was just wildly wrong. The next, it was basically on par with the results of my Fitbit.
None of this gave me much hope for the watchs blood pressure monitoring feature. The company was suspiciously silent about it at the Unpacked event, and for good reason. It requires a separate appMy BP Lab 2.0which launched late on March 15 and did not seem to meet some consumer expectations if reviews on Google Play Store are to be believed. The app itself also requires users to take an initial reading via a traditional blood pressure cuff before it uses the optical sensor to measure your heart rate and stress levels to monitor readings going forward. Its not exactly fair to ding Samsung on that, however, as the company has been transparent about the feature being part of beta research and not a full-blown, FDA-cleared blood pressure monitoring tool.
The good news is a lot of these issues are software related, and theres a chance that Samsung will push out fixes to make the Galaxy Watch Active a more consistent health wearable in the next few weeks. If it can manage that, then the $200 Active is an excellent buy. The GPS-only Apple Watch Series 4 costs twice as much, and in terms of design, the Active is just way more appealing than Fitbits Versa. Tizen, even with its slightly scantier app offerings, delivers a better OS experience than Googles Wear OS. So honestly, if health tracking takes a backseat, the Active is still a decently good option. Most of my beef is that it could have been a great one.

Beautifully designedso much so you can forgive Samsung for nixing the rotating bezel.
Tizen is pretty snappy and works well enough with swipes, even if its app offerings are scanty.
While the hardware is solid, the software is a mixed bag. Health tracking tests delivered mixed accuracy, and there were a few issues with heart rate monitoring.

Catie Keck,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency may have put the personally identifying information of millions of disaster survivors at risk of fraud and identity theft, according to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Securitys Office of Inspector General.
The March 15 report said that during an audit of FEMAs Transitional Sheltering Assistance program, it found that the agency shared and subsequently exposed the personal data of 2.3 million survivors of a number of natural disasters that included the 2017 California wildfires as well as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
Survivors of these incidents provided their private information to FEMA in order to obtain assistance such as temporary housing. The audit found that FEMA jeopardized private information that the agency collected about applicants when it unnecessarily released some of that information to an undisclosed contractor handling its TSA program.
FEMA, the report stated, shared with the contractor more than 20 unnecessary data fields for survivors participating in the TSA program, including bank names, account numbers, and home addresses.
FEMA Press Secretary Lizzie Litzow told Gizmodo in a statement by email on Friday that since becoming aware of the issue, the agency has has taken aggressive measures to correct this error, including by conducting its own audit of the contractors information system. Litzow also said FEMA is no longer sharing what the OIG identified as unnecessary information with the contractor.
To date, FEMA has found no indicators to suggest survivor data has been compromised, Litzow said. FEMA has also worked with the contractor to remove the unnecessary data from the system and updated its contract to ensure compliance with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cybersecurity and information-sharing standards. As an added measure, FEMA instructed contracted staff to complete additional DHS privacy training.
A DHS official who spoke with the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity said that it did not have information that any data had been compromised. He did, however, tell the Post that the banking information of 1.8 million individuals had been exposed in the breach, with roughly three-quarters of a million addresses also exposed.
The agency said Friday its goal remains protecting and strengthening the integrity, effectiveness, and security of our disaster programs that help people before, during, and after disasters.

AJ Dellinger,"The old adage about a lie traveling halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on has been made true thanks to Twitter. According to a new study, the vast majority of people using the platform during disasters and breaking news events spread false information without ever getting it a second thought. Researchers at the University at Buffalo examined more than 20,000 tweets sent during Hurricane Sandy and the Boston Marathon bombing. In their findings published in the journal Natural Hazards, they revealed between 86 to 91 percent of the users spread misinformation by retweeting or liking tweets, and less than one in five people tried to correct the falsehoods. The researchers honed in on four specific widespread, false rumors that made the rounds during the two major events. It found that Twitter users often expressed little to no skepticism when presented with those bits of fake news—most just clicked like or retweet and moved on. Just five to nine percent of people sought to confirm the information by asking if it was correct, while as little as one percent of users expressed doubt or said the original tweet was inaccurate. Even once the tweets were debunked by trustworthy sources, users made little effort to make sure their followers were properly informed. Less than 20 percent of users clarified the false information with a new tweet, and less than 10 percent bothered to delete the tweet. “These findings are important because they show how easily people are deceived during times when they are most vulnerable and the role social media platforms play in these deceptions,” Jun Zhuang, the study’s lead author, said in a statement. The findings of the University at Buffalo seem to jibe with an MIT study earlier this year that found false news stories were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than true stories. MIT researchers also looked at tweets from the Boston Marathon bombing and found that facts took six times as long to reach 1,500 people as it does for falsehoods. Much has been made of fake news since the 2016 presidential election, and companies like Twitter and Facebook have been urged to take action to prevent malicious actors from hijacking the platforms and using them for misinformation campaigns and propaganda. The problem is, it’s often regular, everyday people spreading fake news with no real regard for whether it’s real or not. Social media platforms make it easier to spread that information, but people are inherently drawn to headlines that are sensational and cause an emotional rise. Often times, those stories just aren’t true. Facebook has gone through a number of iterations in its attempts to limit the spread of fake news on its platform, occasionally to disastrous results. At one point the company placed red warning labels on debunked articles to discourage people from spreading them. That upset users who believed the stories to be true and resulted in the articles being shared even more. Social media companies like Twitter and Facebook play a weird role here. They enable the spread of information, both real and fake. It just so happens users are much better at spreading the fake stuff, and now the companies are being pressed to serve as fact-checkers and gatekeepers when that was never their express intent. Social networks need to do better, sure. But so do the people who use those platforms.

Indonesian and American authorities are also focusing on whether MCAS contributed to the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people.

George Dvorsky,"Earlier today, the VSS Unity went supersonic during crewed tests, reaching speeds of 1,220 miles per hour. It’s the first powered flight of Virgin Galactic’s new SpaceShipTwo aircraft, and the first flight since the 2014 disaster in which a pilot was killed and a co-pilot severely injured. After detaching from the carrier mothership VMS Eve, and gliding above the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, the VSS Unity fired its rocket engines for about 30 seconds, attaining a maximum speed of Mach 1.6. The experimental spaceplane, with its crew of two, landed shortly thereafter at around 12:05 pm ET, according to Virgin Galactic. Though just a test, it’s an important milestone for the Richard Branson-led company, which aims to eventually offer suborbital flights to space tourists. Back on October 31, 2014, Unity ’s predecessor, the VSS Enterprise, crashed, killing the pilot and badly injuring the co-pilot, who survived by deploying his parachute. An official investigation found that the craft’s braking system had been deployed prematurely by the co-pilot, resulting in the “in-flight anomaly.” All ensuing flight tests were canceled as Virgin Galactic worked to remedy the various deficiencies, both procedural and mechanical. Two years ago, the private company introduced an updated version of the spaceplane that would replace the destroyed SpaceShipTwo craft. The Enterprise was built by aircraft developer Scaled Composites, but the updated version was manufactured by The Spaceship Company, a California-based subsidiary of Virgin Galactic. The VSS Unity, named by the late physicist Stephen Hawking, had been undergoing engine and gliding tests over the past several months. Today’s successful test, with pilots Mark Stucky and Dave Mackay at the helm, means the company can continue to move forward with its plans. Eventually, Virgin Galactic would like to have a fleet of these SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplanes, each capable of carrying paying customers 68 miles above the Earth’s surface—a full six miles higher than the so-called Kármán line, which is conventionally used to mark the edge of space—and back. The estimated price tag for a single trip will be $250,000, but the spaceplane could also be used to carry science equipment and measuring devices to high altitudes for NASA and other organizations.

Tom McKay,"Authorities said this weekend that the death toll from an industrial disaster in Brumadinho, Brazil in Minas Gerais state has climbed to at least 34, with some officials saying that the true toll could reach the hundreds, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.
Thats a sharp increase from a prior count of 11 deaths from the disaster on Friday, in which a 280-foot dam owned by multinational mining giant Vale S.A. collapsed, flooding the area with almost 12 million cubic meters of sludge-like mining waste (known as tailings). The Journal wrote that one congresswoman, Áurea Carolina, referred to Vales destroyed dining facility as a cemetery. There cant be any life there, only hundreds of bodies.
The paper added that prospects of rescuing more survivors are fading quickly:
The sludge that buried the area is hardening fast, rescue officials told Ms. Carolina and other lawmakers visiting the site, making rescue attempts even more difficult and dimming the chances of finding survivors.
 Rescue workers have also pulled dozens of survivors from the thick, slippery mud. The number of people who are unaccounted for continues to change, as more people are reported missing and others get in touch with co-workers, family members or authorities. The current estimate is that about 300 people are still missing.
Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said at a press conference on Friday that Vales work facilities and nearby living areas were flooded so quickly that anyone alerted to the disaster would have no time to escape, the Journal added. At least 256 people remain missing, CNN reported.
I saw a gigantic cloud of dust and a wave of mud, contractor Mayke Ferreira told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper, according to the Observer. It was one wave on top of another.
We know now that the chances of having survivors are minimal and that we will probably rescue bodies, state governor Romeu Zema said, the Observer wrote.
While the cause of the accident has not yet been determined, the Brazilian environmental agency, Ibama, has already slapped Vale with a 250 million reais (about $66 million USD) fine for causing pollution, destroying the habitability of the environment, and other other regulatory violations, the Observer noted. Prosecutors have also moved to freeze roughly $1.3 billion in Vale funds for relief efforts.
As the Journal noted, a dam failure at a joint Vale-BHP Billiton Ltd facility in November 2015 killed at least 19 people, resulting in tens of billions of dollars in compensation claims. Lindsay Newland Bowker, founder of dam failure World Mine Tailing Failures, which studies such disasters, told the Journal that local authorities and Vale didnt learn anything from the first accident, other than that they were much quicker to form a response team, to rescue people and to evaluate the environmental damage.
 Per the Observer, Vale said the mine was judged safe during inspections and that it was being decommissioned at the time of the disaster, though the National Civil Society Forum for Hydrographic Basins said it had urged authorities to deny Vale a license renewal. An Ibama official also said during a meeting last year that some locals were very worried, with good reason. Another Ibama official, speaking anonymously to the Observer, questioned how a company reckless enough to build an administrative complex at the bottom of a mining-waste dam continued to get approval.
The New York Times noted that the mining disaster is also a political crisis for new President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who openly mocked environmental regulations on the campaign trail. He labeled environmental fines an industry that must be eliminated and promised to open up large swathes of protected land to mining operations, the Times wrote.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"You alright, Spain? In what is most certainly a contender for worst art restoration project, a 500-year-old wooden effigy of San Jorge de Estella in the Spanish city of Estella-Lizarra has been, uh, restored by a “handicrafts teacher,” according to the Guardian. The end result isn’t a pretty sight, and has left some people more than upset, myself included. The 500-year-old wooden effigy of San Jorge de Estella stands in the Chapel of San Jorge, located in the Church of San Miguel. San Jorge himself is clad in armor and mounted on a horse, trampling a dragon. The statue can only be seen during hours of worship. The restoration itself, commissioned by one of the parish’s priests, was done by Karmacolor, a school in the nearby town of Navarra. The school has since removed its Facebook page, which previously contained images and videos showcasing the restoration in progress, according to ArtUs. San Jorge de Estella’s new look completely erases the subtle features of the original (like the rosy cheeks and lips, and the shading and wear of the armor). His restored face addresses the admittedly faded shading and coloring, but makes San Jorge look more like a Moral Orel character instead of a knight in conflict with a giant mythical creature. In addition, aspects of the sculpture were recolored, like the red harness which was originally silver with gold leaf, according to art restoration expert Carmen Usua, who spoke to Spanish newspaper ABC. Usua suggested that a proper re-restoration could be impossible, because the wood was sanded incorrectly and the plaster work was subpar. Spain, judging from this and past catastrophes alone, it would seem like art restoration isn’t exactly your bag. Remember Elias Garcia Martinez’s 18th century Ecce Homo fresco in Borja, Spain? You’re probably more familiar with its Ecce Mono designation after its botched restoration. You also had that 2016 disaster involving the statue of Saint Michael the Archangel from the 17th century. Ouch. Like the Ecce Mono, San Jorge de Estella was reportedly restored in the absence of discussion with cultural institutions or restoration experts. The Association of Conservators and Restauradores of Spain (ACRE) has denounced the restoration project, and says it will bring the issue to the Prosecutor’s Office of Navarra to determine the scope of the damages and see that a penalty is imposed in the form of a fine for the destruction of property with cultural and historical value. To be fair, it’s hard to be too mad at someone who made a good faith effort to restore priceless cultural artifacts. It could be worse, you know? Imagine if they broke it.","You alright, Spain?

Sean Hollister,"Netflix has finally decided that its original horror movie Bird Box doesn’t need to contain footage of the real-life train disaster that killed 47 people in Lac-Mégantic, Canada in 2013. Originally, in the face of protests from the Canadian town and online supporters, Netflix tacitly refused to remove footage of the exploding train, which the film used in a fictional news report at the beginning of the movie. But now, nearly three months after Bird Box started streaming on Netflix and nearly two months after the protest, the company agreed to remove the material. A new version, which will replace the real-life derailment with fictional footage from an unspecified older TV series, should be available on Netflix globally in a matter of weeks. “Netflix and the filmmakers of Bird Box have decided to replace the clip,” reads part of a company statement provided to The Verge and other publications. “We’re sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Mégantic community.” According to The Canadian Press, Lac-Mégantic’s Mayor Julie Morin is satisfied with the outcome: “Yes, there was a delay, but in the end, the most important thing is that people came to the conclusion that the situation was significant enough to settle.” “This result shows that by being in solidarity and by putting our efforts together, anything is possible,” tweeted Nathalie Roy, the town’s minister of culture and communications. It’s possible Netflix benefitted from the delay Still, the late response means it’s possible that Bird Box has already had the lion’s share of its viewership. Scandals often tend to make people rush to see something quicker than they might normally have, and Bird Box had more than one — in additional to the train derailment outcry, there was also the potentially dangerous, viral Bird Box challenge that saw YouTube creators trying to spend 24 hours living their lives with a blindfold on.

Income inequality continues to plague us.

Sasha Lekach,"Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate. Florence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday before being downgraded to a tropical storm. SEE ALSO: There's a glaring weakness in electric vehicles. (It's range anxiety.) As NPR reported, Tesla can remotely tap into the max capacity of its 75 kWh batteries in Model S and X vehicles, adding about 30 more miles of range. In any natural disaster situation like this, our policy is to make Superchargers free of use in order to optimize evacuation routes for affected customers https://t.co/SOUlKv3UUZ — Tesla (@Tesla) September 13, 2018 Tesla owners were notified that Tesla had enabled the additional battery capacity. They were also offered free Supercharging, which gets batteries to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. ""We hope that this gives you the peace of mind to get to a safe location,"" the notification read. Normal battery configurations will return mid-October. Tesla also extended battery range last year during Hurricane Irma. On GM vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac, all OnStar members have access to Crisis Assist services during disasters like Florence even if they don't usually subscribe. That means people can use their cars to navigate out of disaster zones, find hotels, gas, or use their vehicles as a WiFi hotspot. Mary Ann Adams, disaster response and crisis incident manager for OnStar, said in a phone call Friday that 25,000 calls had come in since Tuesday through the Crisis Assist service to always-available response teams. ""Since cars are connected they provide connections they may not have,"" she said about people in the storm zone. For many the OnStar tools mean access to a working phone and a charging source. For others it's a way to find a hotel or the latest storm updates. ""I think of it as another tool to survive the storm and navigate the storm,"" she said. After a storm, calls tick up again as damage is assessed and further evacuations may be required. For some it's a matter of checking to see if they can return home. If they can, signage and roads may be destroyed, prompting more calls to the command center. As of Friday afternoon, according to the New York Times, four deaths have been linked to the storm.

Rhett Jones,"It’s almost been a year since the White House held its last big tech summit. On Thursday, it will reportedly host representatives from 38 of the biggest companies in the US to discuss the future of artificial intelligence and how the government can help us avoid disaster. The anti-science Trump administration has been slow to address many of the issues that technology poses in our current time and the complex problems it promises for the future. According to the Washington Post, it’s slowly realizing that it doesn’t have the option to turn a blind eye to tech and it wants to get serious about what the government needs to do to address the coming AI revolution. From the report: The Trump administration intends to ask academics, government officials and AI developers about ways to adapt regulations to advance AI in such fields as agriculture, health care and transportation, according to a draft schedule of the event. And they’re set to discuss the U.S. government’s power to fund cutting-edge research into such technologies as machine learning. Among those expected to be in the room for that private gathering Thursday will be representatives from tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia and Oracle, as well as other businesses like Ford, Land O’Lakes, Mastercard, Pfizer and United Airlines, according to the White House. Slated to represent Facebook is Jerome Pesenti, its vice president of AI, the company confirmed. Amazon plans to send Rohit Prasad, the head scientist for its voice-assistant Alexa. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich is also expected to attend. The administration has done its best to purge scientific and technical expertise from the EPA, the White House, NASA, and other agencies. And just one year ago, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told a reporter that job automation wasn’t even on his radar and he believes its a problem that’s “50 to 100"" years away. But that flippancy can’t hold. The US government suddenly seems quite alarmed by China’s tech advances and it has been ramping up a cold war with companies it believes have Chinese interests at heart. At the same time, job automation poses a threat to the economy—one of the few ongoing talking points that Trump points to as a success for his team. Thursday’s summit is being framed as a first step in getting everyone on the same page about what has to be done for investment and innovation to keep pace with our rivals and anticipate the consequences of an AI-driven world. Any talk of universal basic income or free college tuition seems unlikely, but the Post says discussions about increased funding and potential regulatory barriers are likely on the table. Companies like Facebook and Amazon may be sending their best and their brightest, but it doesn’t seem like the CEOs will be putting themselves through the humiliation of being in Trump’s vicinity this time around. We’re not even sure if Trump will be there. The White House hasn’t released a statement on the summit yet, and Gizmodo has requested more information. Getting a bunch of tech experts in a room with people who could actually affect some sort of change could be the best option. The last big tech summit was reportedly spent buttering up Trump’s ego in order to get him to listen to the most basic issues. There’s also no word if Jared Kushner will be there. Kushner was originally the White House’s tech guy, but he hasn’t been in the public eye lately. What’s up with that?

Tom McKay,"On Monday night, President Donald Trump announced his second Supreme Court nominee of his term: the DC Court of Appeals’ Judge Brett Kavanaugh. On a range of issues—but particularly net neutrality, the principle that service providers should be required to treat all data on their networks equally—he is likely to be a total disaster if confirmed by the Senate. For the National Security Agency and big businesses that hate regulation, though, he’ll be great. Kavanaugh is a steadfast conservative, the New York Times wrote, particularly in his decisions on the “Second Amendment, religious freedom, [and] campaign finance.” He’s also issued “vigorous opinions hostile to administrative agencies, a central concern of the modern conservative legal movement.” That included the Barack Obama-era decision by the Federal Communications Commission to enforce net neutrality rules on the service providers that act as gatekeepers to the modern internet, the same rules the Republican-controlled FCC recently revoked. According to a rundown from Politico earlier on Monday, Kavanaugh dissented from a ruling upholding the FCC’s net neutrality rules in May 2017. Kavanaugh wrote that the FCC mandate was “unlawful and must be vacated.” In particular, Kavanaugh believes that the FCC did not have the power to impose the rules by itself—which would require congressional intervention to fix—and contended that its actions also violated the First Amendment. Kavanaugh wrote: First, Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule. Congress has debated net neutrality for many years, but Congress has never enacted net neutrality legislation or clearly authorized the FCC to impose commoncarrier obligations on Internet service providers. The lack of clear congressional authorization matters. As for the First Amendment issue, he argued that ISPs essentially act as editorial operations when they make decisions about content and the government needs to clear high hurdles to regulate those decisions: Second and in the alternative, the net neutrality rule violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Under the Supreme Court’s landmark decisions in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180 (1997), the First Amendment bars the Government from restricting the editorial discretion of Internet service providers, absent a showing that an Internet service provider possesses market power in a relevant geographic market. Here, however, the FCC has not even tried to make a market power showing. Therefore, under the Supreme Court’s precedents applying the First Amendment, the net neutrality rule violates the First Amendment.... The threshold question is whether the First Amendment applies to Internet service providers when they exercise editorial discretion and choose what content to carry and not to carry. The answer is yes. Later in the decision, Kavanaugh wrote that ISPs are not fundamentally different in this manner from cable companies and bookstores, both of which make decisions about what kind of content to carry or not. He argued that while exceptions exist in situations where “market-distorting monopoly power” threaten to limit the availability of content to consumers, the FCC did not bother to prove that was the case, and warned of a slippery slope if regulators were allowed to impose rules without demonstrating so: Consider the implications if the law were otherwise. If market power need not be shown, the Government could regulate the editorial decisions of Facebook and Google, of MSNBC and Fox, of NYTimes.com and WSJ.com, of YouTube and Twitter. Can the Government really force Facebook and Google and all of those other entities to operate as common carriers? Can the Government really impose forced-carriage or equal-access obligations on YouTube and Twitter? If the Government’s theory in this case were accepted, then the answers would be yes. After all, if the Government could force Internet service providers to carry unwanted content even absent a showing of market power, then it could do the same to all those other entities as well. 2016 FCC data shows that 56 million American households out of 118 million have no access to or only one choice of high-speed broadband provider, while only 6.9 million have a choice of three or more. But Kavanaugh conveniently cited an article arguing that “vibrant competition” exists in the form of wireless providers. (The argument that wireless internet is a substitute for broadband is too much even for Ajit Pai’s FCC, which backed down on a boneheaded plan to redefine service standards this way in January.) Beyond net neutrality, Kavanaugh seems like he would be a reliable enemy to proponents of digital privacy and federal regulatory agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency. As Politico noted in a separate article, Kavanaugh upheld rulings that the NSA’s massive metadata collection program was legal, citing the “third-party doctrine” that collecting records from service providers does not constitute a search of the customer. He added that the program constituted a “special need” overriding individual privacy protections. ( CNET wrote that the Supreme Court “recently ruled against the third-party doctrine for location history data,” though it is possible a court with Kavanaugh on it could go the other way.) Kavanaugh additionally argued in another case that monitoring the movements of a criminal suspect’s car via GPS surveillance device without a warrant was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, Politico wrote, since there is no reasonable presumption of privacy in a person’s public movements. However, the site noted he wrote an additional statement arguing that actually tampering with the car itself without a warrant was illegal. Per TechCrunch, Kavanaugh also believes that the CFPB—the agency created in 2011 as part of the Dodd–Frank financial reform law—is unconstitutional. Kavanaugh’s opposition is based on the independent agency being managed by a single director who cannot be fired by the president, which proponents say allows it to aggressively respond to potential wrongdoing (say, the Equifax hack ) and conservatives argue makes the agency unaccountable. The agency is currently managed by Mick Mulvaney, who is doing his best to destroy it with or without Kavanaugh’s help. In another case, the Washington Post noted, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPA should have to consider how much it costs for coal- and oil-fired power plants to reduce their emissions of toxic chemicals like mercury, dissenting from other justices who upheld the pollution standards. As noted by ThinkProgress, in another case regarding the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, he appeared amenable to neutering the EPA’s authority to enforce new regulations. Other tech-related arguments by Kavanaugh flagged by Bloomberg BNA include throwing out Federal Aviation Authority rules requiring drone registration. If confirmed, he may also have the opportunity to weigh in on a case regarding whether public access TV channels count as public forums. Republicans in the Senate are gearing up to push Kavanaugh through before the 2018 midterm elections, and it is very likely they will succeed. Confirmation is not assured, with a number of GOP swing votes potentially capable of tanking his nomination. However, a number of Democrats could also cave. The New York Times noted that pushback from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell arguing that some of Kavanaugh’s rivals for the nomination would face easier confirmation processes only seems to have deepened Trump’s resolve.","On Monday night, President Donald Trump announced his second Supreme Court nominee of his term: the DC Court of Appeals’ Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Mark Kaufman,"Last weekend, Ellicott City's quaint Main Street, with red, white, and blue decorations draped from storefronts, became a churning brown river. While several factors resulted in this Maryland town's second ""1,000-year storm"" occurring in just the last 22 months, one increasingly significant contribution to the flooding is the amount of water vapor accumulating in Earth's warming atmosphere. The flooding in Maryland fits within the broader context of how human-caused climate change is altering our atmosphere, making these extreme events more commonplace in the future. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year NASA scientists say that average global temperatures have been on a ""rapid warming trend"" in the last four decades. This warming means that the air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. Accordingly, this loads storm systems with more water. ""So when it rains, it really, really pours, in the future — and now,"" Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview. ""This is super basic physics and chemistry,"" said Marvel of increased temperatures allowing the air to absorb more water. Today, the consequences of this elementary science are pummeling the U.S. ""We’ve already observed an increase in heavy precipitation events,"" said Marvel. In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report showing extreme, single day downpours have been on the rise since the late 1970s. The United States' 2014 National Climate Assessment — guided by 13 federal agencies — found that ""Across most of the United States, the heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent."" ""Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions,"" the report added. Image: U.S. government/National climate assessment That said, Marvel emphasizes it's inaccurate to say that any extreme downpour was the direct or single result of more water vapor being held in the warmer air. Destructive weather will still happen — but now it has an added kick — human-induced global warming. ""Unlucky, bad things happen all the time,"" said Marvel. ""Weather happens, but we know what climate change is doing."" Tropical cyclones, for example, have ravaged U.S. coastlines throughout history, and will continue to do so. The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto — which is not a hurricane but is still carrying bounties of water — has now causing flooding so severe in North Carolina that the National Weather Service tweeted ""HEED ALL EVACUATION ORDERS IMMEDIATELY!"" in areas around the Lake Tahoma dam.

KIRK JOHNSON,"By giving scientists, officials and the people who live nearby so much time to stew over what could be happening, the slow-motion nature of the slide — at least so far — has already created tensions. About 75 people have been evacuated from nearby houses that may or may not ever be damaged. The local road at the foot of the hillside has been closed. Irrigation canal operators stand ready to open dams and take water from the river if it is blocked by a rock slide. Alternate highway routes have been mapped out, in case the interstate becomes impassable. Current projections, based on dozens of motion sensors that have been installed on the ridge, suggest that the collapse is most likely to happen sometime in late February. “In a lot of disasters, you don’t have as much warning as months — hardly any,” said Jeff Emmons, the emergency management director for Yakima County. “It’s a unique thing.” CANADA Spokane Seattle WASHINGTON Union Gap OREGON Portland 100 Miles BIRCHFIELD RD. 82 97 THORP RD. 1 mile In the last few weeks, the main mass of rock has been moving toward a gravel quarry at the base of the ridge. The company that runs the quarry has stopped operations and has voluntarily offered to put up evacuated residents in nearby hotels for five weeks at its own expense, though the cause of the crack has yet to be formally determined. Some things, though, are clear. The slide is occurring in a rumpled layer cake of volcanic rock, or basalt, laid down by eruptions that began about 17 million years ago, interspersed with thin deposits of silt and other sediments. Over time, the layers have folded upward, forming the ridge, and the topmost basalt layer is now sliding over the sedimentary layer beneath it. Many landslides are caused by infiltration of rainwater or groundwater, but geologists think that water is not involved in this case at all, just gravity. That makes Rattlesnake Ridge a sharp contrast to the recent mudslides in California, which were caused by rain and erosion on lands loosened by fires — at least 21 people dead, with many more still missing — or the devastating Oso landslide in northern Washington State nearly four years ago, which killed 43 people, after weeks of heavy rain. Still, all these events reflect the restlessness of the earth and nature that is part of Pacific Rim life. Even the name of the town, Union Gap, is a testament to natural violence: It refers to the huge gash in the ridgeline carved thousands of years ago by a colossal flood from ancient Lake Missoula.

"Daniel Setiawan on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Huaraz, Peru –From a stone hut perched on the edge of the glacial lake Palcacocha, 14,980 feet above sea level, Juan Victor Morales radios down to a dispatcher in the city of Huaraz below. He is all that stands between the city and disaster. Today, it’s just a routine call, one the wind-chapped lookout makes every two hours during his fifteen day shift. Speaking into the handset of the CB radio, Morales reports the temperature, the amount of precipitation, and the level of the lake, then pauses to listen to the sound of a distant avalanche. “Don’t worry, that one is far away,” he says after the last echo of the avalanche’s rumble has faded out. He isn’t spooked: After all, there are avalanches here practically every day. Morales is one of two men tasked with standing sentinel over Lake Palcacocha, which sits high in the Cordillera Blanca mountains east of the 120,000-strong city of Huaraz. His job is to warn the residents of Huaraz in the event of a glacial lake outburst flood—a sudden breach in the lake’s natural dam, which could be caused by large chunks of glacial ice from an avalanche falling into the lake. The displacement of water would create a wave that some University of Texas models predict could be as tall as 100 feet. Such a wave would easily smash through the moraine dam, an accumulation of rocks and sediment that forms along a glacier’s edge. Billions of gallons of water would rush down the valley into the city of Huaraz some 12 miles (20 km) away and 3,200 feet (1,000 meters) below, destroying everything in its path. “We have to be ready for anything,” Morales says. “There could be a big avalanche or an earthquake, the moraine could fall, then there would be a big flood.” It’s a problem threatening not only Huarez, but mountainous communities around the world. As global warming continues unchecked, alpine glaciers from the Andes to the Alps are melting at record speeds, creating a host of challenges for the people that depend on them for water, energy, and food. Now, NGOs and government officials are scrambling to shore up Huarez’s defenses while some residents are taking on big energy companies directly—a strategy which could serve as a template for similarly-threatened communities around the world. Just before dawn on December 13th, 1941 an avalanche sent large blocks of ice into Lake Palcacocha, creating waves that crashed through the moraine dam. The water that rushed out of the ever-increasing rupture poured into another lake called Jircacocha located just over a mile below, also destroying its dam. The combined contents of the two lakes then rushed into the town of Huaraz, appearing to the sleepy residents as a 50 to 100-foot high wall of water and ice, mud, rock, trees, houses, livestock, and human bodies that crashed through the city with unrelenting force. Up to 5000 people died and nearly a third of the city was destroyed in the glacial lake outburst flood of 1941. Today, it’s hard to imagine that such a disaster took place. Fueled by tourism, Huaraz has grown into the second largest city in the central Peruvian Andes—its population has quadrupled since 1941. The streets bustle with hikers, climbers, and other adventure seeking tourists from around the world. A host of businesses cater to them, offering everything from knock-off North Face jackets to roasted Guinea pig. Meanwhile, unseen in the mountains to the east of the city, Lake Palcacocha has also grown. Today the volume of the lake is 34 times greater than it was in 1941, according to national authorities, a ticking time bomb of 4.5 billion gallons of water. Lake levels rose so high in 2011 that authorities declared a state of emergency and installed flexible tubes to siphon water out of the lake. This emergency measure succeeded in lowering the lake by 20 feet (six meters), but many glaciologists believe that’s not nearly enough. “The regular citizen of Huaraz does not think, oh we need to do something about this lake because I need to save my life. They don’t see the risk,” Jahir Anicama Diaz, the regional coordinator for CARE, an NGO working to implement an early defense warning system at Lake Palcacocha, tells me. On the walls of his office are maps of the city showing evacuation routes, the high risk neighborhoods painted in yellow, orange, and red. “We don’t only need to control the lake,” he says, “but also increase the resilience of the people.” After more than a decade of delay, the early defense warning system at Lake Palcacocha should be in place by the end of this year, but a reinforced dam is still years down the line. The $4 million dollar scheme to secure the lake has been slow moving, plagued by government corruption and bogged down by negotiations between competing interests, including national and regional governments, local communities, farmers, glaciologists, engineers, NGOs, and hydroelectric companies. “This is climate injustice.” Unable to just sit and watch from the sidelines, some, like local farmer and mountain guide Saul Luciano LLiuya, have taken matters into their own hands. In 2015, LLiuya sued Germany energy company RWE, one of the world’s largest producers of greenhouse gases. Although RWE has no presence in Peru, LLiuya argues that the energy giant has still played a major role in causing climate change and the loss of Peru’s glaciers. “What I want is for the companies that contribute to climate change to take responsibility,” says LLiuya, whose case is supported by the NGO Germanwatch. “Here we suffer the consequences for something that we are not responsible for. This is climate injustice.” After a district court in Essen, Germany dismissed LLiuya’s case in December 2015, a higher court in Hamm agreed to hear it, making it the first time a company will be tried for climate change-related charges in Europe. The case is largely symbolic. LLiuya is only asking $20,000 dollars from RWE—an amount proportionate to the.05 percent of global CO2 emissions that the company is purportedly responsible for. If he wins, the money would go to the national government to be used for the lake securitization project currently underway. Even if he doesn’t win, LLiuya is happy that the case has brought international attention to the immediate threat climate change is posing to vulnerable communities not just in Peru, but in countries around the world. “Every time I go up into the mountains, every year, I see the glaciers are less and less,” says Lliuya, who has been guiding tourists into the mountains for 17 years. “I felt I had an obligation to do something. We all do.” Scientists estimate that Andean glaciers have lost 1600 years of ice in the last 25 years alone, and in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru’s highest and most glaciated mountain range, glaciers have shrunk 35 percent in the past forty years, according to authorities. Beyond Huaraz, these glaciers supply water to the farms and cities in the desert lowlands. With that was supply today melting faster than it can be replenished, many experts fear shortages down the line. “In not a very long time, 10 years maybe, we are going to have really big problems, conflicts with water,” says Cesar Portocarrero Rodriguez, former head of the National Glacier Unit in Huaraz. “We already have problems with water in some parts of Peru,” he says, “but the big problem is coming. These are just the small signs.” Those small signs, though, matter tremendously to front-lines communities like Huaraz. Looking out upon Palcacocha, Morales is hopeful that glacial experts will be able to divert disaster. The new early warning system is nearing installation, and preliminary studies for the dam are moving along. It’s a bright, sunny day, and the clouds sweeping over the mountains are unthreatening. You can see the snow capped peaks reflected in the azure waters of the lake. It is hard to believe something so beautiful could also be so deadly. “But who knows how much time we have,” Morales muses. He admits that he fears for the safety of his family and friends who live in the valley below. “Every day I see the glacier changing,” he says. “And it appears it is a problem around the world.

Rhett Jones,"Coinbase, one of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, has apparently had a nasty bug lurking in its system that would allow users to collect unlimited ether through a few simple steps. Thanks to a bug report, however, the company avoided disaster. VI Company, a Dutch firm specializing in FinTech, publicly disclosed the vulnerability on its HackerOne account on Wednesday. According to the report, a string of digital wallets controlled by a smart contract could be manipulated to trick Coinbase into believing a transfer had occurred. The issue was first reported in late December, and Coinbase responded on January 25th saying the issue had been resolved and that the company would be rewarded with a $10,000 bounty. Smart contracts have been touted as one of the main arguments for why the Ethereum blockchain technology could have more potential than Bitcoin. In the most basic terms, a smart contract is a set of if/then conditions regulating the transfer of cryptocurrency funds. VI Company wanted to give its employees a unique Christmas present last year, and familiarize them with smart contracts. It set up a smart contract that would distribute a small amount of ether to everyone on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. But it noticed something weird. The people handling the project realized that if one of the internal transactions of the contract failed, all the transactions were reversed, which is how the smart contract should work. But Coinbase’s internal accounts didn’t register the reversal. So, Coinbase thought the wallet had been credited with additional ether, but checking the wallet outside of Coinbase showed that no deposit had occurred. VI Company uploaded screenshots of its transactions and outlined the simple steps to collecting all the ether you could ever spend: 1. Setup a smart contract with a few valid Coinbase wallets and [one] final faulty wallet 2. Transfer appropriate funds to smart contract 3. Execute smart contract adding the set amount of ether to the Coinbase wallets without ever actually leaving the smart contract wallet because the complete transaction fails at the last wallet 4. Repeat until you have more than enough ethereum in your Coinbase wallet. 5. Cash out Just to be clear, the Coinbase account would show the funds as being present even though they were never transferred to the wallets. So the “ether” that could be collected was just part of Coinbase’s records. A bad actor could then either transfer that out to a wallet not tied to Coinbase, or they could just convert that cryptocurrency to fiat money in a bank account. Had someone decided they wanted to millions of dollars worth of Ether, red flags surely would’ve gone up at Coinbase. And if they managed to transfer the money out, they’d still have to go through a laundering process. Coinbase is also pretty strict about verifying your real-world identity. We don’t know if anyone managed to game the system, but we’ve reached out to Coinbase for comment and will update this post when we receive a reply.

ADAM NAGOURNEY,"As the fires began, Mr. Garcetti, who has lived through his share of fires and earthquakes, sought to reassure a city watching the fast spread of out-of-control fires, whipped by Santa Ana winds and with the potential to inflict catastrophic damage across wide swaths of the city. “These are days that break your heart,” he said. “These are also days that show the resilience of our city.” By Thursday night, with the smoke cleared and most of the flames gone, Mr. Garcetti appeared visibly relieved over how Los Angeles had been, at least relatively, spared. This was hardly the most severe disaster California has endured — fires in other parts of the state were more challenging to their elected leaders — and if one believes the predictions of geologists, the worst may be yet to come. But it offered some insight into the style of this mayor, something of a test after six years in charge — and at a time when Mr. Garcetti has encouraged a bit of national attention by suggesting he may want to run for president. In Los Angeles, especially at moments like this, there are few jobs as critical as fire chief. And it was Ralph M. Terrazas, whom Mr. Garcetti promoted to fire chief soon after he became mayor, who appeared most at his side, offering technical updates on fire conditions and reports on how he was dispatching his 3,200-member force across this 500-square-mile city, where the speed of a response can determine whether a fire is a passing brusher or a conflagration that forces the evacuation of thousands of homes. At the height of the disaster, 900 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department were spread out across the region, fighting three major fires and battling back scores of other outbursts. They were among an army of 2,000 firefighters, many of whom had come in from across the state to assist in the effort. Six-hundred members of the city’s police department were also assigned to the fires. Raphael J. Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles, said that this episode had spotlighted, at least for now, the strong relationship Mr. Garcetti had with his police commissioner and the fire commissioner. Those relations have frequently been strained with mayors in the past, and that has caused problems when the city had to come together. “When the relationship between mayor and chief is toxic — think Bradley-Gates — it’s not good of either of them when disaster strikes,” Mr. Sonenshein said, referring to Tom Bradley, who was mayor of Los Angeles from 1973 to 1993, and Daryl Gates, his police commissioner. By the time Mr. Garcetti arrived on Thursday morning for a private briefing by fire and police officials at the command center for the Skirball Fire, the blaze — which at one point loomed as a potentially major threat to some of Los Angeles’ most affluent neighborhoods — was considered to be far less of a threat. But danger still loomed. The command post at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs campus, just off the 405 freeway, was bustling with firefighters and police officers. Mr. Garcetti, wearing a blue City Hall windbreaker emblazoned with his name, mingled with firefighters in front of the command post, comparing photographs of the fire on their phones and trading information on what they had heard in the field. Mr. Garcetti walked over to to a map of the fire taped onto the wall as an assistant chief, Corey Rose, brought him up-to-date. The the mayor dutifully scribbled notes, asking questions that reflected the decidedly technocratic spirit he has brought to City Hall. (Example: “What is the containment in Rye, do you know?” the mayor asked, inquiring about a fire in Santa Clarita.) The role of mayor in Los Angeles is almost vague by design, reflecting a cumbersome government system in Southern California that would seem to confound any attempt to manage a complicated crisis. There are 88 cities in Los Angeles County, with Los Angeles being the largest. The county is controlled by a five-member board of supervisors. That means, more often than not, that it is the mayor who becomes the face of a crisis. But the mayor doesn’t have the overall authority over the response. So when millions of Mr. Garcetti’s constituents were startled Wednesday night by their phones buzzing with an emergency alert warning of “extreme fire danger,” the mayor had nothing to do with it: That alert was sent out by the state. Not that he would have blocked it, Mr. Garcetti said. “I said overcommunicate,” he said. “You saw how many people died up north,” he added, referring to the Northern California fires in October. Mr. Garcetti has never been much of a showman, at least in the tradition of, say, Edward I. Koch or Rudolph W. Giuliani, two New York mayors who regularly became identified with the biggest crises of their cities. But when he turned up Tuesday morning for the first fire, he wore protective gear — the yellow jacket — and an official “mayor” firefighter’s helmet. That was out of necessity, he said later, recalling the embers raining down from the sky. In this mayor’s view, politicians in these kinds of settings should wear civilian clothes, and leave the uniforms to the officers. As he spoke, he picked up his firefighter helmet from the seat, and moved it to the back of the S.U.V.

Kristen V. Brown,"For the native species of New Zealand, European settlement was particularly cruel. The country has no endemic land predators, so many of its birds evolved without the typical avian aptitude for flight. Then came Western settlers, and along with them rats, mice, opossums, stoats, cats, and the occasional misbehaving dog. For these invaders, New Zealand’s flightless birds were a veritable feast. Numbers dwindled. Despite conservation efforts, the country still loses about 20 of its namesake kiwi birds every week. Then, in 2014, a young Harvard scientist published a paper that caught the attention of conservationists around the world, New Zealand included. Using the genetic engineering technique CRISPR, he suggested that scientists could create something called a gene drive to override natural selection’s typical 50-50 mix. Among other things, this technique might be used to engineer invasive pests to breed themselves out of existence. No kiwi-killing stoats. Presto. Earlier this year, typically GMO-wary New Zealand signaled it was interested in giving gene drives a whirl. Now, a pair of papers published Thursday suggest there’s just one potentially significant hitch: Gene drives do not appear to be safe to use for conservation—at least not yet. The problem, it turns out, is that gene drives might actually work a little too well. “Our models show that standard drive systems are highly invasive,” Kevin Esvelt, the synthetic biologist who published the original CRISPR gene drive paper back in 2014, told Gizmodo. Gene drives thwart natural selection by creating a “selfish gene” that gets passed down to offspring with more consistency than the rules of inheritance typically allow, eventually—in theory—spreading through an entire population. If New Zealand decided to use a gene drive to rid itself of rats, for example, it’s possible that those genetically altered rats would eventually make their way to other unintended locations, either by stowing away on ships like they did to get to New Zealand in the first place or by other humans not-so-keen on their own rat populations purposefully moving them. “[Modified organisms] probably can’t be safely tested in the field because they’re likely to spread to most populations of the target species throughout the world,” Esvelt said. As you might imagine, genetically altering the world’s entire rat population might wind up being a pretty big problem. “I badly misled many conservationists who are desperately in need of hope. My mistake was in miserably failing to communicate clearly.” The notion of using genetic engineering to thwart natural selection was first proposed in 2003, but it was with the advent of CRISPR and Esvelt’s 2014 paper that the prospect of gene drives seemed within the realm of possibility. The 2014 paper inspired a rush of enthusiasm and fear within the broader public, and spurred a heated debate within the scientific community about whether it would really work. Ever since first putting the idea out there, Esvelt has worked hard to warn the world just how dangerous it might be. He occupies a weird space: a scientist at the forefront of genetic engineering who is also probably the foremost critic of technology he creates. Esvelt, who now has his own lab at MIT, said that the pair of papers published Thursday— one in PLoS, the other as a preprint on bioRxiv —amount to a “ mea culpa ” of sorts. He said his original paper made a compelling case for all of the potential benefits of gene drives—conservation! eradicating disease!—without spelling out the risks and challenges clearly. New Zealand is not the first place to get excited about gene drives for conservation. In Hawaii, for one, the idea has been floated as a solution to the disease-carrying mosquitoes that threaten native bird populations. Last year, the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity concluded that the potential benefits are too great to not proceed with “carefully controlled field trials.” A report from the National Academies of Sciences gave a cautious go-ahead to gene drives as well. “I badly misled many conservationists who are desperately in need of hope,” Esvelt said. “My mistake was in miserably failing to communicate clearly.” Some recent research has suggested that wild populations will naturally develop resistance to lab-engineered modifications before a gene drive really has a chance to work its magic. In one 2015 study, researchers reported a CRISPR gene drive had allowed an infertility mutation in female mosquitoes to be passed on to all offspring, but as the mutation increased in frequency over several generations, resistance to the gene drive also emerged, making it unlikely for the mosquitoes to invade wild populations. But Esvelt has floated potential ways around this problem, such as inserting the gene drive gene at several important places in a species’ genome so that it’s unlikely to develop resistance. Even with an inefficient gene drive though, the bioRxiv paper suggests a model in which a small number of altered species could spread to unintended populations. “This is part of an ongoing conversation about the balances of risk and benefits of gene drive technology,” said Jason Delborne, a scientist who works on gene drives at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the recent work. “These new papers signal that we should be even more cautious about gene drive technology.” The PLoS paper, co-authored with New Zealand geneticist Neil Gemmell, warns that releasing a standard gene-drive is “likely equivalent to creating a new, highly invasive species.” In other words: It could be very, very bad. “There are these natural mutations that will cause gene drive to stop working, that’s true. But the reason we’re concerned is people are already figuring out solutions to those natural mutations,” Gemmell said. “If you do that, then how do you stop it?” Even experimenting in a contained lab could be dangerous. For example, if an engineered lab mouse escaped and that lab was in the vicinity of other mice it might breed with, the gene drive could spread accidentally. (An exception to all this, Esvelt said, might be engineering malaria-resistant mosquitoes, which most of the world might agree to even if there was a potential for the engineered mosquitoes to spread globally.) “As it stands, there’s still a very large gap in understanding between gene drives in the lab and gene drives in the field, and of course field trials are complicated by substantial ethical and political issues,” Gabriel Zentner, a scientist at Indiana University, told Gizmodo. “The article states that ‘now is the time to be bold in our caution,’ and I tend to agree.” “The tools we have right now are not optimal.” None of this means anyone is giving up hope on using gene drives as a tool for conservation. It’s just that excitement over the technology got a little ahead of the technology itself. Esvelt and other scientists are working on developing systems that could limit the spread of a gene drive. One potential solution, proposed by Esvelt, creates limits to the number of generations that inherit an engineered trait. Another being developed by a group called the Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodent’s Partnership seeks to find and target genetic sequences unique to a desired population so that the gene could not spread beyond it. The hope is that these new papers move more scientists to focus efforts on designing localized or self-limiting drives that might one day actually have real-world applications, rather than experiment with standard drives that might be too dangerous to ever deploy. “I think some of my colleagues think we just shot them in the foot. We’re still excited about what gene drive has to offer,” Gemmell said. “But the tools we have right now are not optimal. We need something you can turn on and off or has a finite life.” In New Zealand, the gene drive is being considered as part of a bold plan announced in 2015 by the New Zealand government to eradicate all wild predators by 2050. Gemmell is part of the team of scientists exploring the use of the technology in New Zealand, and he said the early research can still proceed as planned, alongside work to develop a safer gene drive. But, the PLoS paper points out, if any gene drive is ever to be deployed at all, transparent conversations about gene drive technology and its potential consequences need to happen with the public now. “This is a technology that socially and ethically we’re unprepared for, but technologically, we can do,” Gemmell said. “That’s disturbing. These conversations are overdue.” [ PLoS, bioRxiv ]","For the native species of New Zealand, European settlement was particularly cruel.

To make blazing past those pesky inhibitors possible, Decenturion is issuing 30,000,000 tokens ""tied to Ethereum."" And, as a super cheesy doom-and-gloom promotional video embedded below a countdown clock posits: ""what if the state pays its citizens, not the citizens pay the state."" Deep. My passport. Image: Jack Morse/mashable But even though all of the above sounds totally legit and normal, you might still want to slow your roll on applying for citizenship. The Decenturion booth at Consensus was staffed by a large group of people who, strangely enough, couldn't really provide any details on who is behind the project. Sure, one booth attendant told me that Singapore, Tokyo, and Paris are all possible sites for future embassies, but she definitely couldn't tell me anything else about the group's property buying plans. Another booth staffer mentioned that there are even moves to ""go to the UN,"" whatever that means. I asked one of the attendants about her connection to the company and she explained that she's a student in New York City and just started working for Decenturion on Monday of this week. Although ""working"" is perhaps the not the right word, as she claimed to be there in a ""volunteer"" capacity. Was John Galt a Bitcoin maximalist? Image: Jack Morse/mashable She further explained that another so-called volunteer trained her on the talking points, and that she had to sign an NDA. We reached out to the media email address provided, but, perhaps unsurprisingly, didn't hear back. A quick Whois lookup of the website shows that it was registered in January of this year and updated in May, but not much else. So what, really, is going on here?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The island chain of Socotra, famed for unique plants and animals found nowhere else on the planet, is coping with the aftermath of a powerful cyclone. The archipelago was struck by Cyclone Mekunu on Wednesday night, leaving at least 17 people missing and forcing its native population to flee floodwaters. Socotra is part of Yemen, which is embroiled in a lengthy civil war - something from which the four islands have largely been spared. But after two boats capsized during the cyclone, and at least three cars were washed away by powerful floods, the government has declared Socotra a disaster zone. Media caption Residents sought shelter from the knee-deep torrential floodwaters Coastal areas ""were submerged by floods causing heavy damage to homes,"" a spokesman told AFP. Hundreds have been evacuated from villages, but rescue workers are reportedly unable to reach many people in isolated parts of the main island. Officials have appealed to international aid agencies for help. Home of the blood dragon Socotra is famed for its natural beauty. Its startling biodiversity has earned it the nickname ""Galapagos of the Indian Ocean"" - a nod to Ecuador's famous Pacific island chain whose ecosystem is so unique it inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Image copyright Getty Images The link to the famed Galapagos is not purely marketing either. Since it was first surveyed by United Nations' biologists in 1997, Socotra has been considered one of the most biologically diverse and distinct places on Earth. It's estimated that 37% of its plants and 90% of its reptiles (along with almost all of its snails) are found nowhere else on earth, and the entire island chain is a registered Unesco World Heritage site. One of the most iconic of its native species is the blood dragon tree - a striking, umbrella-shaped tree with a thick trunk. Image copyright Getty Images It gets its name from the deep red sap within, which is gathered as a resin - and has a wide range of uses including as a dye, as incense, and in traditional medicine. Inaccessible island beauty The island's status as an ecological gem, however, has caused some problems for its residents. As its population battles the torrential floods left behind by Cyclone Mekunu, reaching those in need is a major problem - partly because Socotra has few roads stretching into its biodiversity areas. A 2007 travel article in the New York Times said a journey in a four-wheel-drive vehicle with an expert local driver as guide was ""a struggle to the death"", covering five miles in an hour and a half. It was, the author writes, worth it. But plans to build and expand access roads on Socotra's main island have been controversial for years. Unesco considers the building of roads in the protected areas ""a serious threat"" to the island's value, and no improvements have been made since 2010. Image copyright Getty Images Unesco had also expressed concern about how exactly humanitarian funds were being spent, amid reports they could be used to build ""residential cities, ports, hotels, and roads"". But some construction work is sorely needed - because this week's cyclone is the third in recent years. Chapala and Megh Two cyclones - the name given to hurricanes when they form in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans - battered Socotra in November 2015. Cyclone Chapala brought powerful winds similar to a category four hurricane, damaging homes, vehicles, and injuring dozens. Image copyright EPA Image caption Cyclone Chapala, seen from the International Space Station in 2015 Less than a week later, Cyclone Megh passed directly over the main island, triggering flash floods and killing another two people. Thousands were displaced from their homes. The damage was not limited to buildings and infrastructure. Soil erosion and habitat damage were also probable, and Unesco approved $75,000 (£56,000) in assistance last year to help mitigate the impact on threatened plants. Yemen's wider crisis Socotra remains under the control of the internationally-backed government, whose President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi is in exile in Saudi Arabia. His government called for all ""urgent aid"" possible for the people of Socotra. But the mainland continues to be plagued by a complex civil war involving several regional titans. The result is that mainland Yemen is suffering the worst humanitarian disaster on Earth, according to the United Nations. Since March 2015, 9,559 people have been killed and 55,616 injured in the conflict. The vast majority are men, but 791 children are reported among the dead - and the UN believes the actual numbers of the dead, including those not formally recorded, ""are likely to be much higher"". Cyclone Mekunu could hit the mainland this weekend near the border with neighbouring Oman, and could gain strength before making landfall.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Tech billionaire Elon Musk has been known to offer help, from donating solar batteries to Puerto Rico to building a tiny ‘submarine’ to rescue that Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave. (It was never put to use.) The latest disaster to land on Musk’s radar? The water crisis in Flint, Michigan. The predominantly black city of Flint has been reeling from a manmade water crisis since 2014 when the city switched its water source, exposing everyone to lead-contaminated water. Twelve people died as a result of a Legionnaires outbreak from the same water source switch. Given how many times the state and city told residents the water was safe when it wasn’t, people have a hard time trusting their water even today. Now, Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, wants to help. He hopped on Twitter Wednesday to affirm his “commitment” to “fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination.” And the city’s mayor is ready to work with him. “This would be the first time for someone at [Musk’s] level to have taken interest in Flint and say, ‘I want to help,’” Mayor Karen Weaver told Earther. The mayor’s office told Earther it has been in touch with Musk’s team for preliminary conversations about what this partnership or donation or whatever Musk is offering could look like. Weaver said she still hasn’t gotten Musk on the phone, but the plan is for that to happen by Friday. “They’re interested in workforce development. They’re interested in environmental justice issues. That’s what makes it so exciting.” First on her agenda? To tell Musk what the city actually needs. Musk had tweeted about water filters, but the state already offers free filters to Flint residents. And Weaver said Musk’s team is listening, which is a good sign. If this billionaire wants to parachute into a complex environmental disaster, listening is an important first step. The mayor wouldn’t mind some help with Flint’s ongoing pipe replacement. The city currently plans to replace all its lead service pipes by 2019, a feat that is expected to cost nearly $200 million (which the city is funding through a legal settlement and with state and federal help). “If we could finish that sooner, that would be a wonderful thing,” Weaver said. “This year would be great!” That’s one potential avenue. Economic development is another. Growing economic opportunities in this city, where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line, would immensely aid its recovery, Weaver said. The mayor hopes their conversation will include opportunities in tech, given Musk’s role in the sector. Her conversation with his team didn’t shy away from that option. “They’re interested in tech,” she said. “They’re interested in workforce development. They’re interested in environmental justice issues. That’s what makes it so exciting.” Weaver isn’t worried about a private entity intervening in public affairs: After all, the city’s accepted donations from major companies ( like Nestlé ) and celebrities ( like Will Smith ) before. But Musk’s enthusiasm has been known to lead to disappointment or, well, nothing at all, from failed projections for his auto company to a so-called self-sustaining city on Mars that still lacks solid plans. So until we see some results, Musk’s newfound commitment to solving Flint’s water crisis should be met with some skepticism. Seems like Michigan learned its lesson on lead exposure after what happened in the city of Flint.… Read more Read Ultimately, trust lies at the heart of what’s going on in Flint. Residents are slowly regaining trust in city officials, Weaver said, but they’ve lost faith in the state of Michigan. Especially after it ended a free water bottle distribution program in April. The mayor doesn’t advise any of her constituents to drink the tap water, and she even seems wary about filtered water. “I use filtered water, as well, but most of the time, I’m using bottled water,” Weaver said.","Tech billionaire Elon Musk has been known to offer help, from donating solar batteries to Puerto Rico to building a tiny ‘submarine’ to rescue that Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave.

Tom McKay,"A Japanese nuclear power station in Hokkaido is operating on emergency power after the region was hit by a 6.7-magnitude quake in the early hours of Thursday morning, Reuters reported. However, though the event carries unsettling overtones of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, authorities say there is currently no danger of any similar radioactive release occurring. 100 people are injured and 19 missing following the quake on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK. The seismic event knocked out local power, forcing Hokkaido Electric Power’s Tomari nuclear plant to switch to emergency generators to keep its three reactors from overloading. Reuters wrote: The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. The Fukushima incident occurred after an earthquake off the coast of Tōhoku prefecture on Honshu, Japan’s largest island, caused a tsunami. The disaster killed some 19,000 people, as well as knocked out power to and swamped backup generators at the Fukushima facility. The result was three nuclear meltdowns and hydrogen-air explosions that spread a radioactive plume up to 25 miles away, as well as resulted in authorities dumping massive amounts of contaminated material into the oceans. Scientists say most of that radiation quickly faded or was otherwise diluted. Most, but not all, also agree that there is likely a low risk to public health outside of the immediate region of the plant. The primary danger is to the thousands of workers involved in its cleanup. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported, the Japanese government acknowledged the first death of a worker from radiation exposure at the plant, a subcontractor for its operator Tokyo Electric Power Company that developed lung cancer in 2016. Japan idled all of its 54 nuclear power facilities after the incident, but seven have since been reactivated “after a protracted relicensing process,” Reuters wrote. The Conversation wrote last year that the Japanese government estimated the total cost of the Fukushima at around $188 billion, while polls indicated the Japanese public had lost faith in the safety of nuclear power. The cleanup effort at the facility still generates huge amounts of nuclear waste, and Tokyo Electric doesn’t expect to begin clearing fuel debris from the destroyed reactor cores until into the next decade. According to Reuters, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that he is coordinating emergency response for the earthquake on Thursday. A government spokesman added that a Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing plant in the city of Muroran also caught fire, but is being brought under control.

JONATHAN MARTIN,"Many California Republicans also believe the open primary law, which was adopted in a 2010 referendum, has proved to be a political science experiment gone terribly awry. “I hate the top-two,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and California’s most prominent Republican. In the tradition of many reforms enacted by voters in the state that helped pioneer direct democracy, the move to do away with partisan primaries has triggered a host of unforeseen consequences. “It has created mass confusion,” said Dave Gilliard, a longtime Republican strategist here. “And the people who have been empowered are not people from the districts. It has really just increased the power of outside forces.” It is, however, the people from the districts who are the most frustrated. When one of the lagging Democrats, Omar Siddiqui, took his turn on the microphone at the candidate forum, applause filled the synagogue when he was asked if he would consider dropping out.

AJ Dellinger,"Here’s a fun thing to think about as you plan your next vacation: researchers at a number of government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security believe that a cyberattack against an airplane is inevitable and could lead to a “catastrophic disaster.” Have a nice trip! Motherboard got its hands on a number of government documents via Freedom of Information Act request, which yielded internal presentations and risk assessments from DHS. The agency has been looking into potential vulnerabilities in commercial aircraft and found that most planes lack necessary cybersecurity protections, which is not reassuring. A portion of the documents come from a presentation put together by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a research group that is part of the Department of Energy. The lab conducted tests earlier this year in which it attempted hack an aircraft via its wifi internet service. The presentation, dated January 10, 2018, seems to suggest PNNL succeeded in part, noting that researchers were able to “establish actionable and unauthorized presence on one or more onboard systems.” However, another slide noted the group was “unable to penetrate via selected access vector,” leaving it unclear just how successful the simulated attack was. What the research does make clear is the fact that they view a potential hack of an airplane as a viable threat and one that should be taken seriously. “Potential of catastrophic disaster is inherently greater in an airborne vehicle,” part of the presentation said. Another troubling part claims that it’s just “a matter of time before a cyber security breach on an airline occurs,” the document adds. While the PNNL documents come from earlier this year, DHS has been probing the possibility of a cyberattack against commercial airplanes for some time now. A document from 2017 reported that “early testing indicates that viable attack vectors exist that could impact flight operations.” A team of researchers at the agency reportedly successfully hacked the electronics systems of a commercial aircraft last year, bolstering concerns that malicious actors could make planes a target for attack. Making the situation all the more worrisome is that DHS stated in a 2016 presentation that “most commercial aircraft currently in use have little to no cyber protections in place.” Per the presentation, most current aircraft have about a 20-year or longer lifecycle, which means “15-20 years of higher cyber vulnerability.” That is a significant period of time to rely on the existing cybersecurity protections on planes, which the DHS describes as “a network of trust,” suggesting companies are basically just banking on the idea that they won’t get hacked. DHS also warned in a presentation that it expects “significant reluctance by the commercial world to expend resources” to prevent cyberattacks. (Boeing, in a statement to Motherboard, said it is “confident in the cyber-security measures of its airplanes.”) If a hack were to occur, it could spell a considerable amount of trouble for the industry. Not only could it do damage to the plane itself, but DHS warns that it could “create conditions where public perceives there is risk to aircraft operations.” The agency also raises the possibility of a hack causing a disruption to the operation of commercial and military flights and could have a significant economic impact on plane manufacturers. In a statement to Motherboard, DHS said it “takes aviation cybersecurity seriously” and is working with researchers and vendors to “identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the aviation sector.” One document notes the agency has moved from penetration testing to mitigation development last year, suggesting it is helping companies develop defenses against attacks. The spokesperson for DHS also noted, “The aviation industry, including manufacturers and airlines, has invested heavily in cybersecurity and built robust testing and maintenance procedures to manage risks.” [ Motherboard ]",Here’s a fun thing to think about as you plan your next vacation: researchers at a number of government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security believe that a cyberattack against an airplane is inevitable and could lead to a “catastrophic disas…,2018-06-07T03:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Government Researchers Say It's Only a 'Matter of Time' Until a Commercial Airline is Hacked,https://gizmodo.com/government-researchers-say-its-only-a-matter-of-time-un-1826623974,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--uoIqOc1V--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/qdednjn8i1qe8huas8f9.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,1

Rhett Jones,"Verizon recently started offering a VPN service to make users feel more secure when connecting to public wi-fi, but the premium feature’s associated privacy policy is a disaster. The company is reportedly trying to fix it and says the whole thing was just a mistake. The age of the privacy grift is upon us. Over the last couple of years, the public has become more aware of massive data collection by corporations and the steady drumbeat of leaks and hacks of personal information has people looking for a quick fix. If you ever find yourself tuned into Fox News, you’ll see commercials advertising dubious VPN services claiming to anonymize your online activities crammed between spots for buying gold and penis pills. That’s why many people might see a VPN option offered by their wireless carrier and consider it a simple solution to a problem they’re vaguely aware of. This is a bad idea. Case in point, Verizon’s “ Safe Wi-Fi ” plan offers users “a VPN which protects your privacy when you use public Wi-Fi, so you can connect confidently and securely” for the low cost of $3.99 per month. As Motherboard first reported, it appears the service is a privacy problem itself. The Safe Wi-Fi terms of service on Verizon’s website offers little explanation and encourages users to read the privacy policy on McAfee’s website “carefully and completely.” If you make it that far, you’ll find the sentence, “We may use Personal Data for which we have a legitimate interest, such as direct marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Data or with your consent.” That gives McAfee a lot of room to collect, use, and share your data. The policy goes on to outline more ways that your personal data could be used, all under the caveat that McAfee will “generally” disclose how it uses that information before it does anything. When we contacted Verizon about the issue, a spokesperson told us that a mistake was made and McAfee’s website only has its standard generic privacy policy posted at the moment. “We’re working with McAfee to post their privacy policy specific to Safe WiFi,” the spokesperson said. They added that “it will reflect the fact that neither Verizon nor McAfee collects any personal data regarding users or [their] use of the Safe WiFi VPN.” We’ll update this post when we receive a link to the revised policy. Assuming Verizon is being forthcoming, it gives little comfort to know that Motherboard had to inform the company of what its publicly posted policy actually said. The thing is, Verizon is the kind of company you want to protect yourself from if you’re concerned enough about privacy to be using a mobile VPN. The big stories that circulate in the media about reckless privacy standards are more often than not about big companies like Verizon, Facebook, and Equifax being data-hungry money machines. Facebook has also offered its own suspect VPN service that you should definitely not use. You can read up on what you should look for in a VPN here, but different services can change and you should always do some research before using one. Even if this VPN is the greatest service in its field, do you really want to add to the heap of little fees that Verizon turns into big money?

The confusing wording of the tweet has led some outlets to report that the president already ordered FEMA to cut off funding to the state of California. But as we should all be well aware at this point, Trump has a habit of sounding off about matters of national importance without bothering to inform the parties involved, whether hes firing the secretary of state via Tweet or attempting to kick transgender people out of the military.
FEMA told Earther that a statement was being prepared in response to Trumps supposed order, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details. The spokesperson did say that FEMA has continued to pay for disaster recovery despite the government shutdown. There are no disaster projects on hold presently and we are not aware of any that will have to be put on hold in the near future, FEMA said.
The California Governors Office of Emergency Services and state fire agency CalFire, which coordinate with FEMA on wildfire responses, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Trumps tweet.
Its not the first time Trump has at least threatened to pull federal aid to California as fires in the state spiral out of control. He issued a similar ultimatum back in November as firefighters were in still battling the Camp Fire. Its also hardly the first time Trump has pointed a finger at state environmental policies or forest management as the cause of Californias fire woes. Hes been doing so months, although Trumps fallacious fire culprit seems to have evolved over time from environmentalists who are wasting the rivers by diverting them into the ocean to state forest managers who cant be bothered to rake enough. 
Every version of these wild-ass claims has been thoroughly debunked by everyone from state firefighters who say they have plenty of water to fight the blazes, to Republican voters in Malibu who have correctly observed that better forest management wouldnt have prevented wildfires in their forest-free backyards to the president of Finland who said he never told Trump good forest management is the result of raking.
A charitable read on Trumps thought-salad about forest management is that hes heard about how the antiquated Forest Service practice of stamping out small brush fires has caused fuel loads to increase on forests throughout the West, priming them for larger fires.
But as University of New Mexico fire scientist Matthew Hurteau explained in a Guardian article in November, this is not the predominant cause of the recent fires that have scorched California.
Rather, human development at the wildlife urban interface has upped the number of fires being sparked, whether due to poorly-maintained power lines or an errant cigarette butt, in addition to putting more people and property in harms way. And climate change has primed landscapes to burn more frequently and more intensely, with hot weather and persistent drought turning landscapes into tinderboxes and causing fire season to start earlier in the spring and extend later into the fall.
Whats more, as Axios notes, more than half of Californias forests are federally-managed, and more fires burned on federal land than state land last year.
Hopefully, this latest threat to cut off FEMA aid will turn out to be as empty as the last one. 2018's wildfires took a devastating toll on California, and the state needs all the help it can get. Since President Trump issued disaster declarations for Ventura, Los Angeles, and Butte counties, FEMA has approved nearly 49 million in federal aid, according to a data tracker on the agency website. On Tuesday, newly-elected Governor Newson, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington state sent a letter to the federal government asking for more collaboration on managing the unprecedented fires the West faces.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions. The multibillion disaster centered in Nebraska will spread this spring, with above average rainfall expected to cause floods to impact some 200 million Americans living near rivers. And it wont necessarily end once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
This springs floods will shape this summers dead zone. The area of low oxygen is an annual occurrence driven in large part by nutrient-laden runoff that washes down the Mississippi River and its many tributaries, fueling algae blooms when it reaches the Gulf. The dead zone in 2017 was the largest thats ever been recorded at nearly 9,000 square miles, and while its much too early to say exactly how big this summers dead zone will be, the flooding weve seen so far doesnt bode well. Another enormous dead zone would put pressure on Gulf marine life and fisheries
The flooding we see this month, in March, may ultimately determine the size of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone in August, Kimberly Van Meter, a researcher who studies water and ecosystems at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Earther.
And this years floods are already shaping up to record setting. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the upper Mississippi and Red River of the North basins have doubled their normal spring rainfall totals. That includes areas that were smacked by a rare bomb cyclone earlier this month that dumped rain on snow and set the flooding overtaking the region in motion. NOAA forecasts indicate areas all along the Mississippi River basin could face major flooding through Mayas snow continues to melt amid a forecast for heavier than normal rainfall over the next few months.
As the floodwater wash over farmers fields, theyll do more than strip soil. They can also scoop up fertilizer and other organic matter and transport it downriver. The nutrient-rich water will reach the Gulf of Mexico sometime in June, which will kickstart the dead zone.
In the simplest terms, the more nitrate that is transported downstream to the Gulf, the larger the size of the dead zone, Van Meter said. Nitrate is food for algae, and spring floods essentially deliver a large, delicious meal to the Gulf just as temperatures start to rise and the algae start to grow. Decades of fertilizer application and intensive livestock production across the Mississippi River Basin have created large stores of nitrate in the landscape, just waiting for the next flood to carry them to the Gulf.
As that algae bloom grows, it hoovers up all the oxygen that marine life needs to survive. The process is known as hypoxia, and chokes marine life to death. But they also take a toll on humans as well. Separate algae blooms in Lake Erie have befouled drinking water. Those along Floridas coasts have harmed the tourism industry. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone creates its own hardships.
Weve got data that its essentially a doughnut hole that forms with brown shrimp where they are avoiding areas that are low oxygen and theyre congregating on the edge, David Kidwell, a researcher at NOAAs National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, told Earther.
Recent NOAA-funded research has shown that the dead zone can cause small and large shrimp prices to fluctuate, with fishermen catching fewer high-value large shrimp when a dead zone is present. Climate change is liable to make blooms worse by intensifying the hydrological cycle and warming waters. Whether the historic flooding that just hit the Midwest leads to a historic dead zone is not set in stone, though. 
Kidwell said that the annual dead zone forecast NOAA and the U.S. Geological Service puts out in early summer is based in large part on discharge of the Mississippi River as well as the pure nutrient levels in the river at that time, but other factors could dull their impact. A hurricanewhich would offer its own set of problemscould churn up the Gulf and staunch the algae bloom.
Regardless of what happens this season, its clear that something has to change in how we manage land and floodwaters. Nancy Rabalais, a marine ecologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, told Earther that it does not make sense is to rebuild in floodplains if the end goal is to limit the Gulf dead zone (to say nothing of exposing communities upstream to floodwaters). Reducing the amount of farmland in the floodplain so would ultimately cut down on fertilizer and animal waste being swept into streams and eventually the Gulf. Rabalais said, though, that she knew what this means economically to the agriculture community if floodplains were put off limits.
That neatly illustrates the tradeoffs and hard discussions society will be forced to havefarmers or fishermen? Midwest or Gulf Coast?the longer we put off addressing climate change, which is set to make heavy downpours and flooding even worse. Starting those conversations now makes a lot more sense than, say, holding sham votes.","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions.

Dozens of people died and hundreds are still missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in Brazil. 
The rupture released a sea of contaminated muddy sludge, in some places up to 15m (50ft) deep, sliding towards the town of Brumadinho, eventually covering an area the size of 300 football pitches. 
The mud buried the dam site's cafeteria, where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads.
As hopes of finding anyone alive dwindle, thoughts are now turning to how to deal with the 12 million cubic metres of mud that was released. 
Built in 1976, the dam was used to hold residue from the mine, which it is feared may contain harmful chemical substances.
So, how will it be cleared up and how could the operation be guided by lessons from past disasters?
Before and after photos show the vast scale of the destruction caused by the sliding mud.
Vale, the mining company responsible for the dam, has announced plans to deal with the debris. 
These include building barriers to contain the mud in the area around the dam, dredging a section of the nearby river and constructing barriers to sift out the fine residue.
This case is especially sensitive because of the number of bodies thought to be buried by the mudslide. 
""It isn't just mud there, it's people's families. Everything will depend on how rescue efforts go. And it will take a long time,"" says Anderson Amparo, from Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama), which, along with other agencies, is responsible for determining what to do with the waste.
And he says even if the authorities were certain that there were no more bodies in the mud, it would not necessarily be cleared in its entirety. 
""In some areas it is best to plant over the land to restore it to its original use, whether it be agriculture or forest,"" Mr Amparo says.

 Experts are concerned the collapsed dam released harmful substances
Miguel Felippe, a professor of geoscience at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, disagrees. Although it is not yet clear if the mud in Brumadinho is toxic, he says some environmental damage is to be expected. 
""This debris is very likely to contain harmful chemical substances,"" he says.
""Even if there are no traces of heavy metals, which are the most worrisome, like arsenic, there are others which are sure to be there and will float downstream, as the mud has already reached a river, so, environmentally speaking, it would be best to remove the material.""
Vale says an analysis is under way and the results are expected within the next two weeks but it is too soon to say for sure that the mud is toxic. 
The mine waste, known as tailings, may contain traces of nickel, magnesium, cadmium, iron oxide, ammonia, silica, silt, clay, mercury and arsenic, says Bráulio Magalhães Fonseca, a geologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. 
And experts say the level of toxicity will depend on the concentration of each substance.
Roger Doome, director general of the Industrial Minerals Association Europe, in Brussels, says that implementing an appropriate clean-up response depends on assessing the specific type of contamination. 
If that can't be removed, it needs to be neutralised, he says.
""And if the elements are flowing down the river, it is almost impossible [to avoid contamination].""
Different cleaning techniques will need to be applied to different types of mud. 
Image copyrightAFPImage caption
 Hundreds of people are still missing
Prof Felippe says the top layer of mud could be removed through dredging or using excavators. 
""As you get closer to the soil, more sophisticated technology is required because heavy machinery may damage the soil, exposing it to erosive processes,"" he says.
Brazil went through a similar tragedy in 2015, in what was considered to be the country's worst environmental disaster. 
A dam burst in the nearby town of Mariana, also owned by Vale, in partnership with BHP Billiton, releasing 43.7 million cubic meters of mining waste and killing 19 people. 
Most of that waste - about 90%, according to the environment agency - was never removed.
That disaster led to a public campaign to introduce tough legislation on the mining industry. 
But campaigners were disappointed by the regulations eventually passed, saying they failed to address their demands for stricter safety measures.
They had also called for a ban on the type of dam involved in the Brumadinho disaster. 
Lessons from Europe?
Mr Doome recalls two accidents he says set a precedent for how the mining industry in Europe responds to accidents where dangerous substances are involved. 
In April 1998, a dam burst in Aznalcóllar, Spain, releasing almost seven million cubic meters of mine tailings. 
The acidic mud and water were tainted with heavy metals and travelled for over 40km (25 miles) down the Guadiamar river, contaminating 4,500 hectares (17 sq miles) of land on the Doñana National Park, a Unesco world heritage site. 
The clean-up operation took over three years and cost 240m euros (£210m), according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.
In 2000, tragedy hit the Romanian town of Baia Mare. A dam partially collapsed, releasing about 100,000 cubic metres of water contaminated with cyanide. The water ran down streams towards the Tisza river, reaching the Danube and the Black Sea. 
""Since those tragedies, we have adapted European legislation so that now we have a strict action plan and legal requirements,"" Mr Doome says.
""For instance, if we assess that there is a minor risk [of spilling], by law we have the obligation to provide an emergency plan, internal and external. 
""The plan must be ready and in place even before the mine starts operating.""
The Brumadinho dam had passed safety inspections. Five people involved in the inspections have been arrested as part of an investigation to find out whether the process was fraudulent.

Matt Petronzio,"Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewing company, is devoting two Super Bowl ads this year not to beer, but water. The new TV spots, from the brewer's popular brands Budweiser and Stella Artois, both focus on the need for clean water in different parts of the world. It's undoubtedly an effort by Anheuser-Busch to show off its accomplishments in corporate social responsibility, but it's also an example of trends in Super Bowl ad spend toward promoting good causes, rather than simply trying to sell products. And this year, these ads could spread some much-needed awareness. SEE ALSO: How Apple, Anheuser-Busch, and other companies are helping Harvey victims The Super Bowl has long offered the best TV ad real estate of the year. More than 112 million people are expected to watch the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots on Sunday, with coveted advertising spots costing "" north of $5 million "" for 30 seconds. That's a lot of eyes, which is why ""Stand By You"" — the one-minute, heartwarming Budweiser ad that stops just short of being emotionally overwrought — is an important use of airtime. It shows Kevin Fahrenkrog, general manager of Anheuser-Busch's Cartersville, Georgia, brewery, waking up in the middle of the night to lead emergency operations during a natural disaster. We see the brewery switch gears; beer cans are filled with water for people in need, while singer-songwriter Skylar Grey's crooning cover of Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"" plays in the background. As Budweiser tractor-trailers set out to deliver the cans, the words ""TEXAS,"" ""FLORIDA,"" ""PUERTO RICO,"" and ""CALIFORNIA"" flash across the screen. ""Stand By You"" hits close to home, after Americans witnessed one catastrophic natural disaster after another in 2017, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria, and the Northern California wildfires. SEE ALSO: Anheuser-Busch brewery halts beer to bottle water for flood victims But the ad also highlights something that many people — and perhaps the average Super Bowl viewer — may not know. In partnership with the American Red Cross, Anheuser-Busch has used its Cartersville brewery to deliver clean drinking water to disaster victims and communities in need for nearly 30 years. In that time, the emergency water program has provided more than 79 million cans of water across the country. Last year alone, Anheuser-Busch and the Red Cross delivered 2 million cans of water to people in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and California. There’s no bigger stage than #SBLII to recognize our real life heroes. Our Cartersville, GA employees and wholesaler partners have helped provide 79 million+ cans of emergency drinking water since 1988. Cheers to them, and to expanding this program in 2018. https://t.co/HjCZA6HNLU https://t.co/uvljAOBade — Anheuser-Busch (@AnheuserBusch) January 26, 2018 The commercial primarily celebrates Anheuser-Busch's efforts, sure. But it also hopefully reminds the millions of people watching the Super Bowl (and other powerful corporations) of the importance of disaster relief at all levels. It should also serve as a reminder that communities are still in need of assistance. One-third of Puerto Rico residents, for example, are still living without electricity and, in some areas, without running water. ""We believe we can make an even greater impact."" A huge conglomerate like Anheuser-Busch halting beer production at one of its locations to help those in need is admirable, but it's also strategically difficult for one brewery in Georgia to serve everyone across the country. That's why Anheuser-Busch just announced it would be converting another brewery into an emergency water response location in 2018. The brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, will be able to fill cans with water, helping Anheuser-Busch and the Red Cross to reach more people on the West Coast in shorter amounts of time. ""Anheuser-Busch has a long history of giving back, and not only are we continuing to support in the short-term, but we also want to use our upcoming 30th anniversary of the emergency water program to announce our long-term commitment for natural disaster relief,"" said Bill Bradley, vice president of community affairs at Anheuser-Busch, in a statement. ""By adding our Fort Collins, Colorado, brewery to the program, we believe we can make an even greater impact,"" he said. ""Taps,"" the 30-second Stella Artois ad featuring Matt Damon, shifts the focus to developing countries. In partnership with Water.org, the water and sanitation organization Damon cofounded in 2009, the campaign encourages beer lovers to ""Make Your Super Bowl Party Matter"" and help end the global water crisis affecting more than 663 million around the world. ""Such a simple thing,"" Damon says in the spot. ""Clean water at the turn of a tap. It's like magic. It takes no time at all. And yet millions of people in the developing world walk up to six hours every day for water."" ""Millions of people in the developing world walk up to six hours every day for water."" It's a worthy cause, and could change some American viewers' perceptions about global haves and have-nots. But the ad is more transparent in selling a product than Budweiser, driving viewers to buy a $13 chalice, with $3.13 of each purchase going toward Water.org's efforts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. That's less than 25 percent of each chalice going to clean water initiatives — but Damon does make a decent point: ""If just 1 percent of you watching this buys one, we could give clean water to 1 million people for five years,"" he says in the ad. Proceeds from other Stella Artois purchases will benefit clean water efforts, too — the campaign claims the purchase of a 12-pack will provide clean water to someone for 12 months. (A portion of proceeds from the Budweiser ad's ""Stand By Me"" single will also be directly donated to the American Red Cross.) These aren't the first socially conscious Super Bowl ads by a long shot. Notable recent examples include the powerful 2016 ad from anti-domestic violence organization NO MORE, and Colgate's recurring campaign to get Americans to use less water when they brush their teeth. In 2017, several ads seemed to comment on issues like immigration and the Trump administration, though many marketing teams (of course) claimed any political statements were unintentional. Whether a Super Bowl ad is a well-done, altruistic campaign or a transparent, capitalist gimmick (or some unintended statement in between), the big game continues to offer the perfect time to send a message directly into millions of Americans' homes. There are already predictions that most of Super Bowl LII's ads will focus more on humor than politics or social issues this year, but the potential for social impact remains huge.","Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewing company, is devoting two Super Bowl ads this year not to beer, but water.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters. While it was still assessing the fallout from Augusts deadly Lombok earthquake, a major earthquake on September 28 triggered a tsunami that slammed into Central Sulawesi. According to the latest UN reports, this disaster robbed at least 2,010 people of their lives, with 700 still reported missing. The tragedy in Sulawesi may be falling out of the news cycle, but the recovery efforts there are now in full swing. For emergency responders, the hard work of getting supplies, shelter, healthcare and education to those in need is just beginning. It hasnt been easy. The population is in shock, to be quite frank, Susan Mangicaro, the Indonesia response management team leader at International Medical Corps, told Earther. The quake, tsunami and associated landslides in late September destroyed or severely damaged 67,000 homes, leaving 330,000 people without proper shelters. Marc Vergara, chief of communications for UNICEF, said that entire neighborhoods in Central Sulawesi have simply vanished, literally erased from the map. Tens of thousands of displaced people are being packed into temporary emergency shelters where limited aid can be administered. State officials with Indonesias national disaster management authority (BNPB) and the military are leading the recovery efforts. Right now, those officials are still working out what type of aid needs prioritizing and who might be best placed to help hand it out. Meanwhile, international NGOs and local partners that have received permission to work alongside the BNPB are working round the clock to fill in the gaps and do what they can. Maya Kroitoru, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee s director of operations for disaster relief and development, told Earther that upon arrival in Sulawesi in the days following the tsunami, the scene was desperate and grim. The population is in shock. She described how people lacking food and water plundered aid trucks, how the bodies of the dead were still scattered along the road, and how her team of aid workers waited in line for seven hours to enter the city of Palu where the full force of the tsunami struck. She described the city as paralyzed. Several weeks later, getting help to the afflicted sites is still proving immensely difficult. The airport at Palu was extensively damaged, and roads leading to the city are covered in mudslides. Journeys that should take 8-10 hours are taking 20-25 instead, according to Mangicaro. The dire situation has been exacerbated by heavy disruption to the regions already sub-standard infrastructure. Water and sewerage systems have been knocked out completely in tsunami-hit Palu and Donggala. In plenty of regions, electricity is down and cell phone communications are been extremely limited. The main priorities for all actors on the ground is to prevent further emergencies from happening, Daniel von Rège, the Doctors Without Borders country director for Indonesia, told Earther. Here were talking about mainly reducing the spread of diseases linked to lack of clean water for drinking, washing and cooking. Electrical generators, water purification kits, health servicesboth mental and physicaland the management of vector-borne diseases are at the top of the list. Vergara said that food is now somewhat less of a problem that it was in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, although various aid agencies have said that there are still reports of communities being cut off from basic supplies. UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Education to get kids back to school as quickly as possibleno easy feat after 2,700 schools were damaged. The plan is to set up temporary tent classrooms while training teachers to cater to the children who need their education to continue. Education is a tool for recovery, Vergara said, adding that restoring a sense of normalcy is important. This is difficult for many reasons, including the fact that many residents are now afraid of being so close to the sea. The ocean isnt all they have to fear. During disasters like these, crime rates also rise, exacerbated by the willful spread of hoaxes and misinformation. According to a study by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, gender-based violence can rise following natural disasters, too. And a high number of children have been separated from their families, placing them at risk of sexual exploitation, violence and trafficking. So far, working alongside the Ministry of Social Affairs, UNICEF has helped to identify 61 such children, and three have been reunited with their parents. Sadly, many are feared to have been orphaned. As is always the case, these disasters didnt affect everyone equally. It is the very vulnerable and poor who are most in danger when these disasters strike, Kroitoru said. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone. Plenty of NGOs hire local staff, as they know the affected population, language, customs and culture best. Sadly, some of those local aid workers have been swept up in the disaster too. Mangicaro of International Medical Corps said that one of their in-country aid workers homes was destroyed by the tsunami, but that he and his family were physically unharmed. Immediately after the disaster struck, he began an on-site assessment, even though he had to sleep outside. Its not clear how long recovery will take. Lessons can be drawn from the past disasterslike the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed 230,000 people across 14 countriesbut only to a certain extent. No two disasters are exactly alike. Despite the unknowns, first responders do know that certain things must always be done after a disaster strikes. Building resilience is vital. Training, education and assisting the local population is the best way you can help out, Mangicaro explained. Indeed, although theres a debate as to what extent Indonesias current early warning system may have failed and contributed to the crisis, seismologists have stressed that plays second fiddle to public awareness of natural hazards. Effective safety advice, tailored to the regions specific geology and society, needs to be properly disseminated through community-driven initiatives. Long term, infrastructural reconstruction and restoration will also be vital. In an ideal world, earthquake-proof building codes would be applied and reinforced, and tsunami barriers would be set up in vulnerable areas. This, however, depends entirely on resource availability and the governments willingness to act, both of which are lacking at present in Indonesia. Kroitoru explained that its critical for everyone to understand that the emergency does not end when the headlines recede. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone, Vergara said. Practical help is required for communities in Sulawesi, but they also value dignity and emotional support too.","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami. More than 1,200 deaths have been confirmed, and the city of Palu needs help. There are a number of ways to donate, but according to the New York Times, money is a much more immediate way to help rather than canned goods, water, or clothes. Its very easy for those items to be misplaced. NPR reports that the scale of the disaster was at first difficult to determine, because communications were knocked out. The U.N. is now estimating that 1.6 million have been or will be affected in the coming recovery. The NYT and NPR suggest ed a number of organizations you can send money to who have people on the ground (to make sure it gets where it needs to go). GlobalGiving This group focuses on local organizations and currently have a goal of $1 million to help people in Sulawesi. They focus on emergency supplies first, then long-term recovery assistance. CARE CARE is also focusing on immediate needs north of Palu and towards the center of the cityespecially clean drink water, sanitation and shelter.Their county director in Indonesia, Helen Vanwel, told NPR that its a difficult project, because access is limited. A landslide has blocked the main road into Palu, flights are restricted into the airport, there is a destruction of major seaports and a general lack of communication, she said. Indonesian Red Cross According to the group, theyve mobilized 70 tons of supplies, including baby kits, mattresses and tents as well as water trucks and 15 ambulances. They say they have 179 staffers in the area already. Humanity &amp; Inclusion This organization has been in Indonesia since 2005. The theme continues to be working on immediate relief, especially medical care and psychosocial support. Save the Children There are Save the Children volunteers in Palu who are trying to establish temporary shelters from ropes and tarps, and also clearing away areas for children to safely play, because kids continue to need some normalcy and freedom when their worlds are turned upside down. UNICEF This group is also working on clean water by bringing in a mobile water treatment facility. Theyve also been working with local authorities to find the families of children who were separated from them during the disaster. The Jakarta Post also shared a few groups that are much more local, and shared a message from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency saying things like fuel (diesel fuel and gasoline), drinking water, medical personnel, medicines and field hospitals, tents, tarps, blankets, stretchers, water tanks, food, lamps, generator sets, emergency kitchens, body bags, shrouds and baby food were all needed. They also boosted the Indonesian Red Cross as an option for immediate relief. Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT Indonesia) ACT Indonesia as been around since 2005 as well, and are extremely transparent with their money.

Hayato Huseman,"The Find X feels like a direct response from OPPO to all of the jaded critics that love to say that smartphone designs have become ""boring"" or ""iterative."" It's hard to call this phone either of those things, with its incredibly unique slide-out camera panel and jaw-dropping bezel-less display. From a hardware perspective, this is probably the most interesting phone of the year, and maybe even a milestone for smartphones as a whole. As with any industry-leading design, though, the phone isn't perfect, and that's before you even turn it on. Once you do, the Find X's software isn't nearly as futuristic as its hardware, and some of the ways OPPO changes the fundamental Android experience with ColorOS are hard to look past. Price: $960 Bottom line: The Find X has a jaw-dropping, innovative design and an almost entirely bezel-less display, but the ColorOS software is pretty hard to look past and its cameras are subpar for the price. Pros: Gorgeous, unique design with high screen-to-body ratio Long-lasting battery Huge, bright display Cons: ColorOS is a travesty Notifications are disabled on most apps by default Cameras aren't great for the money No water resistance or wireless charging About this review I (Hayato Huseman) am writing this review after using the Find X (PAFM00) for two weeks in Indianapolis and New York City on the AT&amp;T network. The phone was running firmware version PAFM00_11_A.23_7cd29206 with ColorOS v5.1 based on Android 8.1 Oreo, and hasn't received any updates over the course of the review. The unit was purchased by Mobile Nations. OPPO Find X Hardware The Find X is one of the most unique phones I've ever used from a hardware perspective. There's just nothing like it, and that starts with its curved 6.4-inch display, front and center. It's a great Full HD+ AMOLED panel with good color reproduction and outdoor viewing angles, but that's clearly not its headline characteristic. The display occupies an insane 93.8% of the face of the phone. Read that back, that's just a few points shy of a completely bezel-less, 100% screen-to-body ratio. That absolutely topples over phones like the Galaxy Note 9, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, and even the Vivo NEX — the latter of which is closest in design to the Find X. While having virtually nothing but screen up front isn't always entirely practical (we'll get to that later), watching videos on this phone is nothing short of stunning, and it's an experience unlike using any other phone. The biggest problem with the coveted bezel-less design tech enthusiasts lust over is that phones still need somewhere to put all of the various sensors that typically sit above the display — things like the ambient light and proximity sensors, the earpiece speaker, and the front-facing camera. Most manufacturers have started cramming those sensors into a notch at the top of the display, but OPPO had something different in mind. The Find X's motorized camera panel is a stunning hardware component, but moving parts still give me pause. At the top of the Find X is a motorized hidden panel that raises whenever you need to access the cameras and automatically tucks itself away when you're done. It's just as crazy as it sounds; you can actually hear and feel the motors whirring as the panel raises and lowers, and it's just wild to watch. While the Vivo NEX pulled off a similar design first with its motorized camera tab, this is the first phone with a raising panel spanning the entire width of the phone. Now if you're worried about hardware longevity with a motorized panel … well, you're right to be. OPPO says it's tested its motor for up to 300,000 actuations, but at the end of the day it's still a moving part, and moving parts eventually break. If that happens with the Find X, you're not just out a cool party trick, you won't be able to access your cameras. That's not just a big deal for photographers, either. Since the Find X doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, it instead relies on facial recognition for authentication. Just like the iPhone X, when you first set up the phone, it uses infrared to map out your face, including depth, then the panel quickly slides out to read your face every time you turn on the display. The whole system works surprisingly well; the motor is fairly quick to extend and retract the panel as necessary, and the facial recognition is almost instant once the panel is out. The process isn't quite as fast as OnePlus's facial recognition or even Apple's Face ID, but we're talking a second longer at most — this is perfectly fine for daily use. Just like the alternatives, the Find X won't unlock if you're looking away, which is a good security measure. The only time the phone gives me any trouble is when I'm wearing glasses; it'll still recognize me eventually, but it often takes much longer than usual. Specs OPPO Find X Screen 6.4-inch 19.5:9 (2340x1080) AMOLED Chipset Snapdragon 845 RAM 8GB Storage 128GB/256GB Software Android 8.1 Oreo, ColorOS 5.1 Rear Camera 1 16MP, ƒ/2.0 Rear Camera 2 20MP, ƒ/2.0 Front Camera 25MP, ƒ/2.0 Security Face unlock Battery 3730mAh Connectivity Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5.0 Colors Bordeaux Red, Glacier Blue Dimensions 156.7 x 74.2 x 9.6mm Weight 186g Price $960 It's almost a shame how much the motorized panel and bezel-less display steer the conversation away from the rest of the phone, because it's just as unique and gorgeous elsewhere. With all the cameras hidden away, the back of the phone is completely barren, with only the OPPO and Find X branding interrupting the otherwise blank slate. By this point, we're all programmed to avoid touching the upper third of the backs of our phones to keep from accidentally smudging the cameras, but it's oddly relieving to not have to worry about that here. The Find X also has some pretty eye-catching, beautiful finishes. On my Glacier Blue unit, the center of the glass back is a glossy deep black, but the edges subtly fade into a gorgeous dark blue that permeates to the metal frame. The Bordeaux Red model features the same gradient effect, but with more of a dark magenta hue. They're both incredible finishes that are unlike anything I've seen on other phones. Now despite all of the Find X's opulent hardware traits, there are a few letdowns here, too. There's no headphone jack, nor are there front-facing speakers — instead, there's a small speaker grill on the bottom edge that puts out disappointingly tinny audio. You also don't get wireless charging, despite this phone having a glass backing, but most damning of all, it isn't water resistant. This is obviously a necessary trade-off to achieve the motorized panel, but it's disappointing nonetheless — this phone is far too costly to be wiped out by a rainstorm or spilled glass. OPPO Find X Software I've gushed on for nearly a thousand words about the Find X's incredible hardware, but the software is a different story entirely. OPPO's ColorOS software runs on top of Android 8.1 Oreo, but you'd never know it from using the phone. This is a fundamentally different Android experience than any Western user will be accustomed to, and the vast majority of OPPO's changes do much more to harm the experience than improve it. From the moment you first set up the Find X, all of your apps are scattered across multiple pages of the home screen without an app drawer, iOS-style, and what would typically be the Google Feed to the left of the home screens has instead been replaced with OPPO's Smart Assistant. The latter makes sense, since Google's services aren't available in China, where OPPO originates, and Smart Assistant actually isn't bad; you can use it to quickly check the weather, track steps, see upcoming calendar events, and so on. Android Oreo on the Find X is completely unrecognizable through all of ColorOS's changes. The problems begin when you start trying to install … well, pretty much anything. OPPO has its own app store, but it's all in Chinese, even if you set the phone up in English, and the selection is miserable at best. Instead, you'll want to side-load the Google Play Store, which is as simple as downloading and installing the APK, but finding it takes a bit of work, no thanks to OPPO's browser, which — you guessed it — is all in Chinese. Once you've installed the Play Store and started downloading your favorite apps, you'll likely start running into other problems. Using a third-party keyboard like Gboard works well enough; but much like iOS, the Find X reverts to its default keyboard any time you input passwords — a somewhat reasonable security measure, if a bit annoying. If, however, you try to install a third-party launcher, you'll quickly find out that the Find X doesn't let you change launchers. The default launcher option in the system settings leads to a completely blank menu, no matter what you try, so … get used to ColorOS, I suppose. In fairness, OPPO says that's been fixed in a new software update, but I have yet to receive it on my unit. I also had a ton of trouble with Google Maps on the Find X. On a recent trip to New York, I was trying to pull up directions to my hotel from the airport, but the phone simply couldn't lock onto my location. Despite having a solid 4G connection, I waited almost five minutes before the phone could pull up directions, which were completely inaccurate because the phone had pinpointed me at a completely different part of town. Eventually I had to just give up and grab my Galaxy S9 to navigate around, but most people who buy this phone won't have a spare to fall back on, and I can't say I'd be confident getting around town with the Find X. It's easy enough to shrug these issues off and say that the phone wasn't intended for Western markets or Google Play services in the first place, but the troubles with ColorOS aren't exclusive to third-party apps. Dismissing individual notifications is a multi-step process now; you can't just swipe them away like most other phones. Instead, you'll have to swipe them to the left, which then slides out a trash icon you can tap to dismiss the notification. Every single time. For every notification. ColorOS has a few convenient features, but it's so broken in its current state that it makes the Find X hard to use. That's not so bad though, since you'll hardly receive notifications in the first place — at least, by default. After a few minutes with the Find X, you'll quickly start to notice that push notifications from apps aren't coming in. That's not because of aggressive background task management or a poor network connection; it's because by default, notifications are disabled for every third-party app. You actually have to go into the system settings and enable push notifications for each app individually. I can't overstate how awful of an experience this is, especially without a way to mass-approve every app at once. These issues are a real shame because the phone actually runs extremely smoothly — though that's no surprise, given the Snapdragon 845 and whopping 8GB of RAM in tow. The software has some genuinely convenient and useful features, like the swipe-up gesture navigation that replaces the three-button layout to regain the bottom of the screen, or the app cloning that allows for multiple accounts on a single service like Facebook or Instagram. Sadly, though, the benefits of ColorOS are far outweighed by its shortcomings. OPPO Find X Cameras The Find X features two cameras on the backside of its motorized module, one a 16MP primary sensor (1.22µm) and the other a 20MP sensory (1.0µm) that aids in portrait mode photography — both with an ƒ/2.0 aperture. Considering the Find X is priced similarly to the Galaxy Note 9 and iPhone X, I was comparatively underwhelmed by its cameras, but they're still impressive given just how narrow the sliding enclosure for the cameras is. Dynamic range is pretty great; I went on a hike with a few friends the other week, and even on darker paths shrouded from the sun by trees, the bright sky still came out blue in photos, rather than a blown out white. Colors are decent as well, if not a bit undersaturated, but I noticed a tendency for the cameras to overexpose. It's a quick enough fix in post, but I'd rather the phone just properly expose in the first place. I'm mostly happy with the Find X's cameras in daylight, but it gets pretty rough in even the slightest of dark conditions. While on that hike, I missed a lot of shots later in the evening because the cameras are just too slow in the dark, and despite the 16MP sensor's built-in OIS, most of my photos came out blurry and undefined. Take the Find X into a truly dark environment like a bar, and it just gets worse. Colors become muddy and clarity becomes all but nonexistent. Low light is a weakness of any phone's cameras, but I had hoped for better from a thousand dollar phone. What annoyed me most about shooting on the Find X is that the camera app has absolutely no settings. Save for the small bits of iconography strewn across the viewfinder, OPPO's camera software is a mostly take-it-or-leave-it experience, though I'm happy there's still at least a pro mode (OPPO calls it ""expert mode"") for manual controls. As far as video goes, you can shoot in 4K despite the display only reaching 1080p, but I more appreciated the option to shoot in 1080p at up to 120fps for smooth slow-motion shots. OPPO Find X Battery Life Battery life is actually one of the Find X's high points. It's a sizable 3730mAh, and combined with ColorOS's aggressive app management and the relatively low-resolution display (that's not a knock — 1080p is plenty good enough for most people), it's pretty hard to kill the phone in a single day. Even with the unavoidable constant gaps in service of riding the New York City Subway, which are notorious for running down any phone's battery, the Find X always made it through the day for me, typically with 20 or 30% to spare by midnight. ColorOS doesn't show screen-on time, but the Find X has no trouble making it through the day and then some. If you don't like how often ColorOS closes out idle background tasks, you can actually disable its app management in the system settings, though that'll likely impact battery life pretty significantly. Then again, you're still working with almost 4000mAh, so while endurance may be a bit worse without what OPPO calls ""app freezing,"" it'll still likely last you through the day without a hitch. When the phone does run down, it features OPPO's VOOC rapid charging for quick top-ups. If you've ever used another phone from OPPO or OnePlus, you already know all about VOOC charging — it's insanely fast; even with a 3730mAh battery, the Find X can reach a full charge in less than an hour, so long as you use the included charger. Even with a different charger, though, I was impressed with the charge times. I use my 15-inch MacBook Pro's 87W USB-C charger interchangeably with my laptop and phones, and I've found that the Find X charges fully in about 80 minutes. The only letdown with the Find X's battery life is standby time. If I leave the phone off the charger overnight, it loses nearly 10% of its charge. With such aggressive throttling of idle apps, I'm really not sure what could be draining the battery so much with the screen off, but it's definitely been disappointing whenever I pull the Find X out of my bag after a flight and notice how much it's lost. Should you buy it? Probably not This far in, it's pretty to guess my feelings on the Find X. I can't remember the last time a phone's design has captivated me the way this one has, from its unprecedented sliding mechanism to the incredible 93.8% screen-to-body ratio. It's not flawless — the camera panel traps dirt and dust pretty easily, and there's no telling how long the hardware will last, both because moving parts eventually fail and because the phone isn't water resistant in any way. But it's no stretch to say that the Find X has some of the most fascinating and impressive hardware of 2018. Sadly, great hardware doesn't get you very far when the accompanying software is as big a disaster as ColorOS. From annoying systemwide quirks to downright broken third-party app support and a complete disabling of notifications out of the box, the software on the Find X seems to combine all the worst parts of iOS and Android into a jumbled mess that make the phone hard to use — and even harder to recommend. If you're a hardware enthusiast with considerable money to spend, and you just want to marvel at the stunning design of the Find X, you can order one straight from Amazon for about $960. With future updates that promise to fix broken features like the inability to use third-party launchers, the Find X might eventually offer a better software experience. Until then, though, you can do a lot better than the Find X for a lot less money.

Ed Cara,"In the face of the Purge prequel we’re living out right now, it should come as a tiny bit reassuring that not every federal agency has closed—at least not completely—during this government shutdown. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will keep fighting and tracking the flu virus, which is important, because this year’s flu season is a disaster. Per Reuters : Earlier, the Department of Health and Human Services had released a contingency plan in case the Senate failed to pass a stopgap spending measure by a midnight deadline. According to that plan, the CDC’s flu tracking program would be suspended during a shutdown. But late Friday night, officials told reporters on a conference call that the program would continue. Along with collecting flu data from states, hospitals, and other sources, a CDC official said, they will be reporting “critical information needed for state and local health authorities to provide, track, prevent and treat the disease.” The decision comes into the midst of one of the worst flu seasons in recent time. Hospitals in California have set up triage units in their parking lots to deal with the overabundance of ER patients, and the flu has been classified as widespread throughout 49 states and Puerto Rico. More than 800 people died from flu in December alone, and there have been 30 pediatric deaths, as of last week, according to CDC data. Not all the lights are on at the CDC, though. Just this morning, the @CDCFlu account on Twitter announced it will be silent until the government is up and running again: If you haven’t already, it’s not too late to get the flu shot.","In the face of the Purge prequel we’re living out right now, it should come as a tiny bit reassuring that not every federal agency has closed—at least not completely—during this government shutdown.

When the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after its Jan. 28, 1986 launch, McAuliffe perished along with the six other astronauts aboard. The 37-year-old social studies teacher from Boston was selected for NASA's Teacher in Space Project. She was to fly into space as a civilian ""Payload Specialist"" and teach lessons from the confines of the Challenger.

The lessons will be conducted by astronauts Joe Acaba, who is currently aboard the ISS, and Ricky Arnold, who launches in March. Both men will deliver the to-be-filmed lessons as part of a year-long NASA education initiative that started in September.

Rebecca Ruiz,"When historians look back on 2017 and try to describe the profound cultural upheaval that brought down Hollywood titans and powerful politicians, they'll no doubt struggle to capture the ache and fury of women who spent their lives silenced by abusive men and finally decided they'd had enough. There's no tidy or sober way to describe the rot that women knew festered in our social, professional, and political institutions — a decay that once couldn't be named or fully exposed, until it was. SEE ALSO: 2017 was the year middle-aged women fought back When the accounts are written by those with more hindsight than we currently have, one man should play the starring role, and it's not movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. It's another master showman, the one we call president of the United States. The election of Donald Trump, who admitted to grabbing women's genitals against their will, to the nation's highest office confirmed what many women knew, and triggered a visceral awakening for others. Despite being well into the 21st century, America still clings to the notion that women are vessels whose bodies can be owned by men for pleasure. These bellwether moments are evidence of how women are increasingly embracing a pose of cultural and political defiance. As it turns out, though, confronting that ugly reality helped produce a dramatic shift in attitudes about gender. This might seem obvious based on the blockbuster success of the film Wonder Woman, or the unapologetic reckoning of the #MeToo movement, whose "" silence breakers "" were named ""Person of the Year"" by Time. It was clear in the defeat of accused pedophile and Trump-backed Senate candidate Roy Moore, whose retrograde policy views and racially divisive beliefs led to critical voter turnout among black women in Alabama. These bellwether moments are evidence of how women are increasingly embracing a pose of cultural and political defiance. They also collectively suggest women show no signs of tempering their outrage in 2018, a year that will bring Congressional midterm elections, the possible end to Robert Mueller's investigation of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, and new clashes over issues like immigration, health care, and race. That's not to mention any unforeseeable conflict sparked by Donald Trump's penchant for publicly demeaning women who oppose him. If the newfound enlightenment when it comes to gender equality and politics seems like a passing fad or a liberal fever dream, that shift is showing up in a way we can quantify: public opinion. Tresa Undem, partner in the polling firm PerryUndem, has spent the past 17 years asking people about their views, and she's used to tracking the slow pendulum of change swing toward a new consensus. But in the past year, Undem has witnessed an intriguing phenomenon. When she polled 1,058 voters from across the nation and political spectrum in late November, she discovered a surprising percentage of people altered their views in the past year. A new majority of voters thinks the country would be better off with more women in office, a figure that jumped from 52 percent to 69 percent between 2016 and 2017. Those who said sexism is a ""big"" problem in American society increased from 30 percent to 44 percent during the same time period. People aren't keeping these feelings private, either. Seven in 10 respondents in Undem's poll said they've talked to a friend or family member about issues related to gender equality. That marks a major increase from last year, when just 49 percent said they'd had similar conversations. ""I don’t know that I’ve seen these kinds of differences in my career in polling."" We can arguably trace this transformation partly back to Donald Trump, says Undem. When she analyzed the results of her nationally representative December 2016 poll of 1,302 adults, she found that the number one predictor of engaging in activism after the presidential election was feeling upset by Trump's behavior on the Access Hollywood tape. Undem believes that Hillary Clinton's loss, despite the tape's existence, played a significant role in the increased percentage of people who believe the country would be better off with more women in office. While these are just two polls, Undem is struck by the swift evolution in participants' opinions. ""I don’t know that I’ve seen these kinds of differences in my career in polling,"" she says. ""In my view, what’s happening right now is a result of a lot of things, but one of the biggest things was the Access Hollywood tape."" Neera Tanden, an informal adviser to Clinton's presidential campaign and president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, knows what Undem means. In April, Tanden tweeted, ""I don't think the country has understood how psychologically wounding it was to so many women that Trump won after the Access Hollywood tape."" The observation has remained her pinned tweet for months. It's received 33,000 likes and 16,000 retweets. I don't think the country has understood how psychologically wounding it was to so many women that Trump won after the Access Hollywood tape https://t.co/asbo4Z1uWR — Neera Tanden🖖🏼 (@neeratanden) April 2, 2017 ""If you look at this year, the beginning, middle, and end of the year, it's fueled by what I hear as a primal scream for women’s equality,"" Tanden says. Indeed, people demonstrated by the millions in January's Women's March. Women were prominent voices in protests against Trump's travel ban, the decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and Congress' attempt to repeal Obamacare, among other political battles. They dressed up as characters from The Handmaid's Tale to protest restrictions on reproductive rights, and they confronted racism on the left in tense exchanges on the private Facebook group Pantsuit Nation. ""If you look at this year, it's fueled by what I hear as a primal scream for women’s equality."" Women ran for office in unprecedented numbers and notched historic victories. Charlotte, North Carolina, elected its first black female mayor in the city's history. A transgender woman unseated a conservative Virginia lawmaker who authored a ""bathroom bill"" that would've required people to use the restroom that matched the gender listed on their birth certificates. And when the media's attention wasn't trained on the liberal women who form the backbone of the resistance movement, Trump's own tweets reminded the public why they oppose him in the first place. Whether he was harassing and insulting women like Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski, Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fl.), or Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Trump frequently found ways to illustrate his taste for uniquely berating women who defy his authority. It's a wonder, then, that national news organizations barely revisited the dozens of accusations of sexual harassment and assault against Trump for the first half of the year, even as they helped drive women's opposition to Trump's agenda. (The White House maintains all of the women are lying.) ""This man did this terrible thing, he wins, and the media treated it like everything got wiped out by the election,"" Tanden says. ""But women said: 'I didn't forget what he did.'"" Tanden believes that Democratic elected officials, including a star like Sen. Al Franken, should also be held accountable for sexual misconduct. SEE ALSO: Female senators lead the way in calling for Al Franken's resignation on Twitter When people warn Tanden about the possibility of a backlash against the #MeToo movement, she offers a different take: ""#MeToo, in my view, is a backlash to Donald Trump. I don’t think it’s an accident that we had a gigantic discussion of sexual harassment and assault, and what it means for women reaching their potential. It's a cultural response to misogyny taking over the White House."" ""It's a cultural response to misogyny taking over the White House."" The fact that Republican leaders haven't taken women's opposition to Trump seriously worries Evan Siegfried, a Republican strategist and author of GOP GPS: How to Find the Millennials and Urban Voters the Republican Party Needs to Survive. In January, Siegfried wrote a New York Times op-ed imploring his party's leadership to learn from participants in the Women's March. That advice, he says, has gone unheeded and may help spell the party's doom in the 2018 midterm elections. Siegfried finds that particularly troubling, since the GOP has long faced criticism that it wages a ""war on women,"" and Trump isn't helping the party's case. Instead, Siegfried describes Trump as ""steroids"" that are making the symptoms of that problem far worse. ""Women are disgusted with the Republican party for myriad reasons,"" he says, noting the impact of the Access Hollywood tape and the #MeToo movement. ""At the same time, among Democrats and progressives, organizations are taking anger, the most abundant renewal energy source invented in the world, and harnessing it and making it productive."" Trump’s disapproval with women- 68% and millennials- 61%. Both were groups that have helped Dems win in NJ, VA, Alabama and other 2017 races https://t.co/pjCK2nJr1b — Evan Siegfried (@evansiegfried) December 13, 2017 That poses a real threat to the GOP's grip on Congressional power. If women who oppose Trump help drive Republicans from office in the midterm elections, it could put the House of Representatives in the control of Democrats, who'd be willing to investigate the assault allegations against the president, and have indicated they're considering the possibility of impeaching him. Neither Undem nor Tanden see an imminent end to the current cultural and political moment. Undem continues to be surprised by sentiments shared in focus groups, including the feeling that people are still energized to fight Trump's agenda. Tanden believes that women, including those who are entering politics and activism for the first time, are only just getting started. ""There are backlashes and forward movements, but my basic view is Donald Trump is giving rise to a new wave of feminism that will transform the country,"" Tanden says. ""It will be women that defeat that him.""","When historians look back on 2017 and try to describe the profound cultural upheaval that brought down Hollywood titans and powerful politicians, they'll no doubt struggle to capture the ache and fury of women who spent their lives silenced by abusive men and…",2017-12-22T16:54:59Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",Trump was a disaster for women in 2017.

FRANCES ROBLES and SHERI FINK,"Following public debate over the Trump administration’s initial reluctance to deploy it, the Comfort arrived two weeks into the disaster, after some of the medical urgency had abated. Its mission and capabilities were opaque to many doctors on the island. It lacked the ability to treat some important areas of need, and the complex referral procedures made little sense on a battered island with scant power or telephone service. Photo Staffed with 800 medical personnel, the hospital ship admitted about 290 patients. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times The result, combined with the reluctance of some hospitals to lose their own patients, fell far short of what the Comfort could have provided, medical experts said. “They were prepared for anything other than the reality of Puerto Rico,” said José Vargas Vidot, a doctor and independent senator in the Puerto Rican Senate whose charitable organization, Iniciativa Comunitaria, supported the post-hurricane medical clinic directed by Dr. Rosado. “It was like a vision in the harbor. Everybody was looking at the Comfort, like trying to build hope. But in the reality it was very frustrating to get access.” Staffed with 800 personnel and costing $180,000 a day, the ship received an average of 36 people a day as outpatients or inpatients. (A New York Times reporter was one of them, given an X-ray and medicine for an asthmatic cough). And that number swelled only after a public furor erupted over the ship’s empty beds. “That’s not the right question,” said Capt. Kevin Buckley, the commander of the ship’s medical facility, when asked how many patients were admitted. The right question, he said, was: “What kind of patients do you have?” The patients who arrived in the early weeks “were as sick as the sickest patient in any I.C.U. where I’ve worked,” said Capt. José A. Acosta, the United States Third Fleet surgeon, a Puerto Rican-trained physician who served as a liaison with the Comfort. In all, 191 surgeries, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the ship. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed seven people with cancer. One woman had a double mastectomy, and the ship filled the oxygen tanks for dozens of patients who needed help breathing. It took in some patients from hospitals where generators had failed. It treated 98 critically ill patients, eleven of whom died. The Comfort’s deployment was not the only federal health care initiative after Maria hit. Federal field hospitals, clinics and medical shelters saw more than 30,000 patients, and more than 1,400 uninsured people filled their prescriptions at pharmacies for free thanks to a federal reimbursement program. Photo Medical staff took a blood sample from a patient in the emergency room aboard the Comfort. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times A mid-November visit to the ship found dozens of people waiting to see doctors in the tents set up outside, but inside most of the beds were empty. Only a handful of patients were on board, and most of the doctors were milling about. But those who were getting treatment appeared satisfied. Olga Quezada’s knee had swollen up as if someone had pumped air into it. She had been turned away by her local hospital, and she worried about the pain, the bill and finding care. Ship doctors stuck a frighteningly long needle into her knee to drain the fluid, for free. “At first, I went to hospital in Bayamón, and they told me to come back,” Ms. Quezada said. She added: “I really like the doctors here.” The Comfort is used on relief missions about every two years. It served off the coast of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991 and provided aid during the rescue of Cuban and Haitian migrants in 1994. The Comfort was deployed in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, the Comfort provided much-needed surgical care, but communication with referring doctors and with family members was problematic. Some patients died during laborious, multistep transfers, and some doctors felt the ship left too soon. Doctors in Puerto Rico said the Comfort could have been of enormous help directly after the storm, because at first many hospitals were damaged or shuttered. Without air-conditioning, temperatures soared dangerously, and operating rooms were closed as generators failed. Emergency room staff sewed wounds, lanced boils and examined patients by the light of cellphones and flashlights. They lacked access to CT scans. In the 10 days after the Sept. 20 storm, the number of deaths in Puerto Rico jumped to an average of 118 a day, 36 more than usual. Photo A radiology specialist prepared a patient for an X-ray aboard the Comfort, which deployed to Puerto Rico for 53 days. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times But the ship did not leave Virginia until Sept. 29, arriving in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3. Problems quickly emerged. For starters, the Comfort lacked critical capacities, including the ability to treat premature babies and patients with common antibiotic-resistant infections, head trauma and strokes requiring neurosurgery, or heart conditions needing bypass surgery. One doctor was heard complaining about receiving so-called “social cases”— patients who would be difficult to discharge because they lost their homes or lacked caregivers. When the ship docked in San Juan, residents were thrilled. “People saw the big, white ship and came running,” said Murad Raheem, a regional emergency coordinator for the Department of Health and Human Services who oversaw the federal government’s health response to the disaster. The Comfort cared for 67 patients in its first two days, but wasn’t set up to receive unscreened patients, Mr. Raheem said. Soon after the ship’s arrival, Puerto Rican and federal officials and local medical professionals met on the Comfort. They decided the ship should move around the island to assist “wherever the needs were at the time,” Mr. Raheem said. But they agreed that doctors around the island would need to vet potential patient transfers through the Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration, the large and overburdened public hospital in San Juan that normally served as a referral center. Only if the hospital was full would a case be reviewed for possible referral to the Comfort. Patient flow slowed to a trickle. According to the Navy, only 137 patients were delivered over a period of three weeks. The first phone numbers provided by the public hospital did not work, and others had to be established. Callers overwhelmed the cellphone of the emergency department director after his number was posted on Facebook. Photo In all, 191 surgeries, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the Comfort. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed seven people with cancer. Credit Dennis M. Rivera Pichardo for The New York Times In areas without working cellphones, land lines or satellite phones, and with only ambulance radios to communicate, “referring patients to the Comfort was impossible,” said Dr. Rene Purcell-Jordan, an emergency room physician in Yauco, in southwest Puerto Rico. Dr. Purcell and other doctors said they also had little information about what type of patients the Comfort could or would treat. Some problems were beyond the Comfort’s control. Poor weather grounded helicopters. Some local hospital administrators were reluctant to give up their patients, and sometimes patients themselves wanted to stay near home, even when conditions at their hospitals appeared dangerous. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló petitioned for changes. He said the ship’s roving mission was appropriate immediately after the storm when roads were impassable, but that as time passed it made more sense to allow seven hub hospitals to refer patients directly and ultimately for patients to refer themselves. The Comfort returned to the port in Old San Juan. This time, federal Disaster Medical Assistance Teams set up in tents outside the ship, and thousands of people went for prescriptions and care. Those who needed something the tents could not provide, like surgery or X-rays, were taken on to the ship. “No one who walked up to the ship has been denied care,” Captain Buckley said. Officials at the public hospital defended the Comfort’s operation. “The Comfort was not a party boat,” said Dr. Carlos A. Gómez, the head of the hospital’s emergency room. “You need criteria to go to a hospital, whether it’s at sea or on land.” Still, the mission to the end remained murky. On Nov. 15 the Comfort left the dock, with a spokesman saying the ship planned to restock at sea and then resume treating patients. On Nov. 17, the ship was ordered home, for good, without warning.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set. On Monday, Kittleman said the flooding of 2018 was much nastier. Authorities were still in the assessment stage on a soggy Memorial Day, trying to determine exactly how much worse. Particularly worrying, Kittleman said, is a 25- to 30-foot-wide hole just north of Main Street, where the ground appears to have buckled under the weight of the flooding. ""There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they've been working so hard to come back and we just need to be there for them and to tell them... all of our resources are there to help them,"" Kittleman said. ""I can't imagine what they're going through. I couldn't imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it's even worse."" The first concern is people. Emergency responders conducted 30 rescues Monday morning as they continued their search for a missing man, identified as Eddison Hermond. Sarah Lopez was at a restaurant, attending a birthday party with Hermond when the flooding began, she told CNN. Hermond left to help a woman rescue her cat from a pet store. Witnesses returned and said Hermond slipped into the river and was carried away, said Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. As rescuers continue searching for Hermond, there were no reports of deaths or major injuries as of early Monday, Kittleman said. The 2016 flood killed two people, when floodwaters swept away their vehicles. Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco River, which swelled to record levels during Sunday's storms. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric said it will need to survey the damage to its infrastructure before providing a timeline for restoring service. Flooding claimed the old courthouse, Kittleman said, and there are homes on the west end of downtown whose foundations and basements are gone. ""A lot of the businesses, the first floors are gone, like they were two years ago,"" he said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency Sunday in Howard County. Marked by quaint shops in the bottom floors of brick, stone slab and siding-clad buildings, the historic downtown is a major draw in this community of about 66,000 people located about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Main Street, also known as Frederick Road, was transformed into a waterway over the weekend, as brown water sluiced through town, destroying shops and upending cars. In some areas, the water rose above the buildings' first floors. To understand what authorities were surveying Monday, it's perhaps helpful to understand what happened fewer than two years ago. After 6 inches of rain fell on the flood-prone community in about two hours, residents say the flooding came from nowhere in 2016. In addition to the two people killed, more than two dozen buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. Residents formed human chains to pluck their neighbors from the rushing waters. Kittleman said at the time that it was the worst devastation in Howard County in 50 years, but the town rallied around the slogan ""Ellicott City Strong"" and got to the arduous work of putting their community back together again. When the rain came Sunday, many residents remained in the throes of recovery. The county was working on stormwater retention ponds and preparing to install additional piping. Money from a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant had just arrived and was slated for repairs and construction, Kittleman said. ""There are things that we are doing. It just can't be done in less than two years,"" he said. ""After the flood in 2016 and working on the recovery there, you can't get things done in a year or two. It just can't happen. And you saw, we get the money from FEMA two years later. That's how it works."" More than 8 inches in 15 hours The river rose 17.8 feet in two hours Sunday afternoon, to 24.1 feet, a record from the previous high of 23.6 feet. The National Weather Service, which issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County through early Monday, reported that parts of the greater Baltimore area got isolated rainfall of more than 9 inches. Three to 6 inches was common throughout the metro area. In parts of Ellicott, more than 8 inches fell between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said. The eastern portion of the community saw more than 7 inches in that timespan, while the southwestern side of town received more than 5 inches of the wet stuff. There are possibilities that another inch could fall, the NWS said, and though that doesn't sound like much rain, it means trouble for the already saturated ground and burgeoning rivers. Aside from the Patapsco River, there are four other smaller waterways running through and around the Ellicott. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate downtown or move to higher ground while rescue teams fanned out through the area. They're being asked to stay away from Main Street until authorities can ensure buildings are safe to enter. The Roger Carter Community Center is open for those who need a place to shelter. Gov. Hogan toured the area Sunday with Kittleman. He lamented the destruction, noting that just two weeks earlier, he had visited the historic downtown and spoken with business owners about rebuilding efforts. ""The place looked terrific,"" he said. ""It's just devastating because people have their lives tied up in this and went through a heck of a lot and came back and now they're starting all over again."" Kittleman expressed confidence Monday that Ellicott could make another comeback. ""This is where we're one Howard again, and we'll be one Ellicott City,"" he said. ""We will be stronger in the future. We really will, folks. This is not a place that gives in. We didn't give in in 2016. We're not going to give in in 2018."" Asked what he'd say to downtown business owners who have their doubts about reopening after being hammered twice in 22 months, Kittleman said he sees their side of things. ""I can totally understand what they're saying. If I was in their shoes, I'd probably be reassessing that myself."" CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Lindy Royce, Emanuella Grinberg and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

Mark Kelly,"Captain Mark Kelly (US Navy, retired) is a combat veteran and former NASA astronaut. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) In 2001, I flew my first flight into space aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. Roughly a decade later, I commanded that same space shuttle on its final flight. That trip was my fourth journey -- and at least for now, my final one -- from this planet into space. To see our planet as this majestic blue ball floating in the blackness of space is breathtaking. It is truly the most amazing thing I've ever seen. When you see it for the first time it appears perfect. Bright and mostly blue, it's a literal island in our solar system. And make no mistake -- right now, we have no place else to go. Too often, we forget that this remarkable and fragile place is our only home, a point that was underscored earlier this month at the largest gathering of Earth scientists in New Orleans. At the conference, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) made a sobering announcement. It came as part of a study of climate change on 2016's weather. The scientists behind the study concluded that without climate change, three of the most severe weather events that took place that year would not have happened. Which events? 1. Heat waves that scorched parts of Asia, including India and Thailand, killing more than 500 people. 2. A patch of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean that's had harmful effects on marine life along the coast of North America. 3. And rising air temperatures that made 2016 the hottest in recorded history. The impact of climate change -- the scars that it's leaving on our planet -- is visible from above, too. There is visible pollution over large portions of the Earth. You often see this over the Asian sub-continent. The burning of wood and plastic and other materials to heat the homes of hundreds of millions of Indians creates a thick smoke over thousands of square miles. In China, the problem is more industrialized and more severe. Coal power plants and millions of cars have polluted the skies over eastern China to the extent that I can honestly say I don't believe I have seen the terra firma of eastern China during my four missions into space. It is hidden by a constant blanket of tiny airborne particles of despair. Perhaps the thing that worries me the most is the massive deforestation underway in areas like Asia and Latin America. Countless trees and millions of square miles of jungle and forest have been removed to accommodate our desires for more -- more wood, more farmland, more pasture, more meat. When I first looked down upon the Amazon rainforest in 2001, I saw vast areas of jungle and a wide and winding copper colored river that went on and on and on. A river that was impossible to miss and like no other on the planet. By 2011, however, the part that was most noticeable wasn't the river or the jungle but the large swaths of empty land. From space, it looks empty because we are far away. We don't see the crops or the cattle but we do see the loss. We see the loss of an incredibly diverse ecosystem that once held endless possibilities for new medicines and other discoveries. We see the loss of a home for so many species that will now have to learn to adapt and survive somewhere else -- or not. And we see the loss of a large amount of carbon, sequestered in a living and breathing ecosystem which created massive amounts of oxygen for all of us. That carbon, once the giver of life to millions of species all over our planet, now has a new role: greenhouse gas. It will sit in our atmosphere as CO and CO2 for millennia, but in this case as an invisible blanket, warming our planet, changing our climate and creating a cataclysmic mess for future generations. As an astronaut, I'm often asked about the climate, our environment, and how we are destroying the Earth. My response often surprises people. ""Don't worry about the planet, the Earth will be just fine,"" I tell them. ""What you need to worry about is us -- all of us."" This year has been an unequivocal disaster for the future of the planet. President Donald Trump has managed to take a wrecking ball to years' worth of hard work and painstaking negotiations. If not undone, our retreat from the Paris Climate Accords and the EPA's Clean Power Plan alone mean our planet's temperature will rise at a greater rate and our citizen's health will degrade. Other changes in environmental regulations on drilling and auto and appliance efficiency will only make matters worse. The United States was handed the mantle of leadership on this and so many other issues decades ago for a reason. It is because we are good at it. Our President has an obligation to look closely at the raw data on climate change. If he does, I think he will reach the same conclusion that I and so many others have reached. As you pass over the United States in space at night you can see, with your own naked eye, the bright lights that prove we lead the world in energy consumption. It is very obvious. What's not obvious is whether our country will adequately respond to this reality. As the largest consumer of energy we must lead the way in solving this problem. If we don't do this, who will?","In 2001, I flew my first flight into space aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. Roughly a decade later, I commanded that same space shuttle on its final flight.

Fergus Jensen,"CIGONDONG/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - As Indonesia reels from the carnage of yet another natural disaster, authorities around the globe are working on how they can prepare for the kind of freak tsunami that battered coasts west of Jakarta this month. 
The Dec. 23 tsunami killed around 430 people along the coastlines of the Sunda Strait, capping a year of earthquakes and tsunamis in the vast archipelago, which straddles the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire. 
No sirens were heard in those towns and beaches to alert people before the deadly series of waves hit shore. 
Seismologists and authorities say a perfect storm of factors caused the tsunami and made early detection near impossible given the equipment in place. 
But the disaster should be a wake-up call to step up research on tsunami triggers and preparedness, said several of the experts, some of whom have traveled to the Southeast Asian nation to investigate what happened. 
“Indonesia has demonstrated to the rest of the world the huge variety of sources that have the potential to cause tsunamis. More research is needed to understand those less-expected events,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton. 
Most tsunamis on record have been triggered by earthquakes. But this time it was an eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano that caused its crater to partially collapse into the sea at high tide, sending waves up to 5 metres (16 feet) high smashing into densely populated coastal areas on Java and Sumatra islands. 
During the eruption, an estimated 180 million cubic metres, or around two-thirds of the less-than-100-year-old volcanic island, collapsed into the sea. 
But the eruption didn’t rattle seismic monitors significantly, and the absence of seismic signals normally associated with tsunamis led Indonesia’s geophysics agency (BMKG) initially to tweet there was no tsunami. 
Muhamad Sadly, head of geophysics at BMKG, later told Reuters its tidal monitors were not set up to trigger tsunami warnings from non-seismic events. 
The head of Japan’s International Research Institute of Disaster, Fumihiko Imamura, told Reuters he did not believe Japan’s current warning system would have detected a tsunami like the one in the Sunda Strait. 
“We still have some risks of this in Japan...because there’s 111 active volcanoes and low capacity to monitor eruptions generating a tsunami,” he said in Jakarta. 
Scientists have long flagged the collapse of Anak Krakatau, around 155 km (100 miles) west of the capital, as a concern. A 2012 study published by the Geological Society of London deemed it a “tsunami hazard.” 
Anak Krakatau has emerged from the Krakatoa volcano, which in 1883 erupted in one of the biggest explosions in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunamis and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. 
BROKEN WARNING SYSTEM 
Some experts believe there was enough time for at least a partial detection of last week’s tsunami in the 24 minutes it took waves to hit land after the landslide on Anak Krakatau. 
But a country-wide tsunami warning system of buoys connected to seabed sensors has been out of order since 2012 due to vandalism, neglect and a lack of public funds, authorities say. 
“The lack of an early warning system is why Saturday’s tsunami was not detected,” said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho, adding that of 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place. 
“Signs that a tsunami was coming weren’t detected and so people did not have time to evacuate.” 
President Joko Widodo this week ordered BMKG to purchase new early warning systems, and the agency later said it planned to install three tsunami buoys on the islands surrounding Anak Krakatau. 
The cost of covering the country is estimated at 7 trillion rupiah ($481.10 million). That is roughly equivalent to Indonesia’s total disaster response budget of 7.19 trillion rupiah for 2018, according to Nugroho. 
But other experts say even if this network had been working, averting disaster would have been difficult. 
“The tsunami was very much a worst-case scenario for any hope of a clear tsunami warning: a lack of an obvious earthquake to trigger a warning, shallow water, rough seabed, and the close proximity to nearby coastlines,” said seismologist Hicks. 
In the Philippines, Renato Solidum, undersecretary for disaster risk reduction, said eruptions from the country’s Taal volcano had caused tsunami waves before in the surrounding Taal Lake. 
He told Reuters that what happened in Indonesia showed the need to “re-emphasize awareness and preparedness” regarding volcanic activity and its potential to trigger tsunamis in the Philippines. 
The United States has also suffered several tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, according to the national weather service. 
MORE EDUCATION 
In Indonesia earlier this year, a double quake-and-tsunami disaster killed over 2,000 people on Sulawesi island, while at least 500 died when an earthquake flattened much of the northern coastline of the holiday island of Lombok. 
In a country where, according to government data, 62.4 percent of the population is at risk of being struck by earthquakes and 1.6 percent by tsunamis, attention is now focused on a continued lack of preparedness. 
“Given the potential for disasters in the country, it’s time to have disaster education be part of the national curriculum,” Widodo told reporters after the latest tsunami. 
For Ramdi Tualfredi, a high school teacher who survived last week’s waves, these improvements cannot come soon enough. 
He told Reuters that people in his village of Cigondong on the west coast of Java and close to Krakatau had never received any safety drills or evacuation training. 
“I’ve never received education on safety steps,” he said. 
“The system...totally failed.”

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"After an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia on Friday left more than 800 people dead, a spokesperson for the nations board of national disaster affairs revealed that a critical part of its warning and detection system hasnt been working for years. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said a network of 22 early-detection buoys havent been operational since 2012, Australias ABC News reported. The buoys, which communicate with seafloor sensors, are supposed to send tsunami warnings to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, but are now ineffective due to vandalism and a lack of funding, according to the report. The tide gauges are operating, but they are limited in providing any advance warning, Louise Comfort, a disaster management expert, told the Associated Press. None of the 22 buoys are functioning. In the Sulawesi incident, BMKG (the meteorology and geophysics agency) canceled the tsunami warning too soon, because it did not have data from Palu. This is the data the tsunami detection system could provide. BMKG reportedly sent out a tsunami warning on Friday evening after the earthquake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. Efforts to create better advance tsunami warning systems started after 230,00 people died in a 2004 tsunami, with a majority of those deaths occurring in Indonesia. The buoys were among those effortsGermany and the U.S. reportedly provided 12 of them. However, an earthquake that hit an Indonesian island in 2016 revealed that none of the buoys were working. The buoys have been stalled in a prototype phase for years, reportedly failing to receive the funding needed because of budget cuts and a failure for agencies to agree on project decisions. The buoys reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each on top of the funding needed to maintain their operations. Now we have no buoys in Indonesia, Iyan Turyana, an ocean engineer at BPPT, Indonesias Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told Phys.org in an article published in January 2017.

The Times reports over 1,000 people in Okayama found themselves trapped on rooftops after the Oda River burst, with many rescued by helicopter or boat. It's hard to imagine this happening to you, but photographs taken of the affected areas bring these tragic events a little closer to home.

Morgan Sung,"Guy Fieri isn't just the mayor of Flavortown. He's a national hero. As the Carr fire scorches through Northern California, becoming the seventh most destructive fire in the state's history, Guy Fieri rushed to feed the thousands of first responders and evacuees. Some people think the celebrity chef has been more helpful during this disaster than Elon Musk was during the Thai cave rescue. SEE ALSO: Elon Musk's kid-submarine was 'a PR stunt,' Thailand cave rescue diver says The Carr fire started on July 23, torching more than 112,000 acres and sweeping through the city of Redding. Fieri drove from Napa Valley on Saturday, and José Andrés' nonprofit World Central Kitchen joined him two days later. Since Monday, Fieri and his team have prepared over 1,000 meals twice a day with the disaster aid organization Operation BBQ Relief. ""My son and I, and his buddies, and a bunch of mine, we loaded up our caravan from wine country and drove four hours up here,"" Fieri told ABC7. ""We're in tough times... with all of the things going on, you take a moment like this and you really see America is made of a lot of great people coming together."" This is the second time that Fieri has volunteered to feed victims of California wildfires. Last October, he and his family had to evacuate their Santa Rosa home when fires threatened his neighborhood. Three days later, he arrived at the evacuation center with a smoker and a wood fire oven to cook for the displaced shelter residents, preparing 1,200 meals in one lunch. He told KQED that the move wasn't a ""PR stunt."" ""If that's what you think and you're that shallow at a time like this with what we're facing, then there's no changing your mind about that,"" he said during the October fires. ""I'm not promoting anything. I'm just here cooking. This is feeding people. People need help, and I'm here to help. That's it."" And some Twitter users pointed out that unlike certain rich celebrities who try to swoop in during disasters, Fieri's efforts were genuine. In a now-deleted tweet, @BowieWhale said, ""Guy Fieri has, with no publicity, been feeding 5000 wildfire evacuees, proving that he is much more decent and altruistic than Elon Musk."" They're referring to the cave debacle, when Musk tried to save a team of boys who were stranded in an underwater cave in Thailand. Musk commissioned a kid-size submarine, went on a Twitter rant when it was criticized as ""not practical,"" and then called Vern Unsworth — one of the lead rescuers — a ""pedo"" after he dismissed the mini sub as a ""PR stunt"" that had ""absolutely no chance of working."" Musk managed to make the rescue mission about himself, and then when he couldn't be the hero, still managed to make it about himself. Which is why Guy Fieri is the internet's new darling. With his bleached spiky hair and weird affinity for flame-printed button up shirts, Fieri has been written off as a cheesy dad way past his prime. But compared to Musk's ridiculous narcissistic Twitter feuds with pretty much anyone who criticizes him, Fieri's once tacky quirks are actually kind of endearing. Guy Fieri out here feeding thousands of wildfire refugees, after feeding thousands in Puerto Rico, without publicity and y'all still trying to dunk on the Mayor of Flavortown. If Elon Musk did this, he'd be grilling on a 5,000 foot statue of himself. https://t.co/odyOyGWGOc — Clausewitz's Razor (@TankCPTNemo) July 31, 2018 Guy Fieri is the real hero. Not Elon Musk. “This isn’t a PR stunt. You don’t see my banners up. I’m not promoting anything. I’m just here cooking. This is feeding people. People need help, and I’m here to help. That’s it.” https://t.co/CLPuPL4a9b — Paris Marx (@parismarx) August 1, 2018 Twitter users, probably tired of Musk's antics (like complaining about the word ""billionaire"" basically being a slur) have found a new icon to stan. honestly in utter shock that guy fieri responded to the carr fire faster than our fucking president — ryan (@ryantempletn) July 28, 2018 And even though the two celebrities are in totally different industries — and very different tax brackets — it's hard not to compare them when Fieri is literally cooking hot meals for displaced wildfire victims, and Musk had to be shooed out of the Thai cave.

Tom McKay,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will test a system at 2:18pm ET on Thursday afternoon that lets the president send a message to most cell phones across the U.S. following a disaster, terrorist attack, or other serious threat to public safety. Yes, that means Donald Trump can now put your phone on blast. No, he probably won’t use the system to text you throughout the day with rambling bullshit about “ 13 Angry Democrats ” or wishing “the haters and losers” a “special” September 11th, at least according to experts who spoke with NBC News. The wireless emergency alerts (WEA) system was first approved by Congress in 2015 and restricts usage of the system to instances of “a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety.” According to NBC, those experts say the system is a good idea in a time when people are glued to their phones and the internet: “If you separate this from the politics and personality of any individual president then this is a great idea and an amazing use of technology to reach everybody if they’re in harms way,” said Karen North, director of the Annenberg Digital Social Media program at the University of Southern California. UCLA communications professor Tim Groeling agreed, writing via email, “broadcast-based emergency alert systems... have remained professional and impartial over decades... A system like this seems necessary in an era where most people are disconnected from ‘live’ media like radio and television.” If Trump were to order FEMA to warn the nation of the emergency threat posed by the cowardly Jeff Sessions and the very corrupt and unfair Robert Mueller, he would probably be in violation of the law—which, granted, is something he doesn’t seem particularly concerned about. However, anyone actually attempting to use the system would have to go through FEMA (namely, its Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System) and rely on support staff trained in the complicated process necessary to transmit the message. As Vox reported, even those suspicious the president would abuse WEA generally agree it is a good idea: Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told me that the wireless alert system is a good idea, as is testing it — but having someone as volatile as Trump with control over it is concerning. “I’m not sure that the system would protect us from rogue announcements by a president who has exhibited the kind of behavior President Trump has over the last two years,” Redlener said. “I personally would not give this microphone to Donald Trump.”...“We need to accept the fact that any of these systems can fail, miscommunications can go out when the wrong button’s being pushed. That’s a given for any system of this type,” Redlener said. “What I’m more concerned about is the president of the United States taking control over such a system intentionally to create havoc, to make some sort of highly disruptive, highly political announcement.” FEMA itself noted that the alert system is “only for national emergencies” on Twitter: To the extent WEA has been criticized, it’s mainly been that the system has inherent limitations like a 90 character limit—partially as a result of pushback from carriers and smartphone manufacturers resistant to spending time and money on it. It’s not possible to opt out of the system, and one shouldn’t, unless they like being caught off guard by potentially life-threatening disasters. However, it is possible to tweak an individual phone’s settings to simply ignore it (not recommended). Regional WEA systems are already in place—for example, those AMBER Alert messages advising residents of the details of child abductions as well as flash flood, tornado, and hurricane warnings already go out using the system. Hundreds of agencies have access to the system. As Mashable noted, the national WEA test is new, but there have been three prior national tests of the predecessor Emergency Alert System, which goes out over television and radio. Tests of the system are required every three years or less under the law, according to CNN. The message going out on Thursday will read an English-only message stating “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” [ NBC News ]","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will test a system at 2:18pm ET on Thursday afternoon that lets the president send a message to most cell phones across the U.S. following a disaster, terrorist attack, or other serious threat to public safety.

Jonathan Shieber,"The Room has been ranked with Plan 9 From Outer Space as a strong contender for the “best” worst movie ever made — and it’s now available in its entirety on YouTube. Written, directed, and starring Tommy Wiseau, The Room belongs in the same category as Plan 9, and Coven (which was immortalized in the 1999 documentary American Movie ) as a paean to moviemaking by people who have no idea how to make a movie. The combination of passion and ineptitude is what made The Room a cult classic after its release, and what made The Disaster Artist — the James Franco film it inspired so compelling ( Ed Wood, the biopic from Tim Burton about the director behind Plan 9 is also amazing). Writer, actor, and director Tommy Wiseau in a still from “The Room” In “The Room” Wiseau plays Johnny, an investment banker caught in a bizarre love triangle with his best friend, Mark, played by Greg Sestero, and his fiancee, Lisa, played by Juliette Danielle.

Andrew Krok,"Hyundai started 2019 off right by teasing a concept vehicle that could allegedly walk and climb. Now, Hyundai has brought this concept to CES 2019, and it's every bit as wild as we hoped.
Hyundai used CES 2019 as the backdrop to debut its Elevate walking car concept. While it's primarily designed to give first responders an additional edge in rescuing people, it can also be used to enhance mobility options for all sorts of citizens. 
The pictures make it pretty obvious how this car gained the ability to move less like a vehicle and more like a creepy robot animal -- while it does have traditional wheels on each corner, they're connected to the vehicle by way of mechanical ""legs."" Those legs have multiple axes of articulation, and since the electric motors that power the concept are in the wheels themselves, there are no powertrain linkages complicating matters.
According to Hyundai, the Elevate is capable of driving at highway speeds, but it can also allegedly climb a 5-foot wall, step over a 5-foot gap and have a track width up to 15 feet. So, it's basically an AT-AT from Star Wars that has, as Hyundai puts it, ""both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits."" 
The model on display at CES is just a 1:8 scale model, sadly, but it's still absolutely nuts.
Hyundai
""Imagine a car stranded in a snow ditch just 10 feet off the highway being able to walk or climb over the treacherous terrain, back to the road potentially saving its injured passengers,"" said David Byron, design manager of Sundberg-Ferar, which worked on the concept, in a statement. ""This is the future of vehicular mobility.""
The Elevate rides on an electric ""skateboard"" platform, onto which the body is attached. This gives the concept a little extra flexibility, with bodies that can be removed and swapped out depending on the needs of the moment. To keep things efficient, the legs can cut power to its joints when acting like a normal vehicle. 
Of course, first responders are the first group I think of when it comes to the Hyundai Elevate. Being able to better traverse rubble and other detritus, which could be the result of a natural disaster, could allow emergency personnel a better chance of saving as many people as possible. But there are other use cases, too -- Hyundai has an example image with a New York taxi livery, lifting itself up to make ingress easier for a person in a wheelchair. The sky's the limit, which I guess makes sense given the concept's name.

Frederic Lardinois,"If you know about Synology, chances are you know about its network attaches storage (NAS) hardware. Over the course of the last few years, the company made a name for itself as one of the premiere NAS providers for consumers and small businesses who want to make local backups of their data or make it easy for users in an office to share local drive space. Now, the company is making a major move into the cloud with the worldwide launch of its C2 Backup service for its NAS systems, which was previously only available in Europe. To be clear, C2 Backup is all about backing up your Synology NAS system in the cloud. It’s not a competitor to online backup services like iDrive, Carbonite or Backblaze. If you are a Synology NAS users, though, this service gives you yet another degree of security. Backing up your data locally is a good first step, after all, but if a disaster strikes your office, your backups are gone, too. Synology has long offered the ability to store backups in the cloud (on Amazon’s S3 service, for example), but it clearly wants a piece of this business, too. “The flexibility of cloud backup in terms of low barrier to entry and strong future scalability plays a key role in the rapid growth of this market. With the demand for offsite data protection on the rise, we have received numerous requests from regions outside EMEA to expand our C2 Backup coverage,” said Jia-Yu Liu, Director of the Application Group at Synology. “We are happy to announce that all users around the world can now enjoy the same seamless backup experience designed specifically for Synology NAS.” Pricing for the service seems pretty fair, with plans that start at €9.99/year for 100 GB of backed up data. Prices go up to €59.99/year for a terabyte. Under these plans, you can store 11 backup versions which remain in the system for 30 days. What’s nice here is that only the size of the source data counts against your storage usage, not the individual backups. For users who need more flexibility, the company also offers a €69.99/TB/year plan with flexible backup schedules and customizable retention policies. The company is also offering a 30-day free trial. A subscription business is obviously a smart move for Synology. The company mostly relied on its hardware sales for its business so far, but with the C2 Backup and the existing C2 Disaster Recovery services, it now offers two subscription services with recurring revenue.","If you know about Synology, chances are you know about its network attaches storage (NAS) hardware.

If they had known, they never would have bought the house on Bayou Glen Road. Sure, it was a beautiful lot, tucked in a bend of the creek, backyard woodsy and wild, the neighbors friendly and the street quiet. A little piece of nature just 20 minutes from downtown Houston. It was exactly what John and Heather Papadopoulos recently married, hoping to start a family were looking for in 2007. They didn't think much about the creek that ran along their yard, aside from appreciating the birds it attracted to the neighborhood.
Across town, the Evans family was similarly indifferent to the wooded bayous that cut through their neighborhood. Janice Perry-Evans chose the house she rented because it was conveniently located near the local high school, which made it easy for her two boys to get to class and home from football practice. Her commute to the post office wasn't far either. Plus, at $800 per month, the rent was affordable. By 2017, the family had lived there for four years, and didn't have any plans to move. 
And then, in August of that year, both homes were destroyed. Both families had to start over from nothing. But today, one family is financially stable. The other is facing bankruptcy.
John Papadopoulos stands in the rental home in Houston where he and his family moved after their house flooded. The taxidermied deer are among the few items they were able to rescue from their flooded home.

Disasters are becoming more common in America. In the early and mid-20th century, fewer than 20 percent of U.S. counties experienced a disaster each year. Today, it's about 50 percent. According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, climate change is already driving more severe droughts, floods and wildfires in the U.S. And those disasters are expensive. The federal government spends billions of dollars annually helping communities rebuild and prevent future damage. But an NPR investigation has found that across the country, white Americans and those with more wealth often receive more federal dollars after a disaster than do minorities and those with less wealth.Federal aid isn't necessarily allocated to those who need it most; it's allocated according to cost-benefit calculations meant to minimize taxpayer risk.
Put another way, after a disaster, rich people get richer and poor people get poorer. And federal disaster spending appears to exacerbate that wealth inequality.

Nowhere are the economic and racial inequities of disaster aid more apparent than in communities that have experienced one of the most costly and widespread disasters: urban flooding.
Houston is arguably ground zero for urban flooding a sprawling city built on low and marshy flatlands exposed to hurricanes blowing in from the Gulf of Mexico. In the past decade, there have been five major floods in the city, culminating in the largest amount of rain ever recorded from a single storm: Hurricane Harvey in August 2017.
The Papadopoulos and Evans families were two of the hundreds of thousands of families who evacuated their homes during the storm.
After Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast in August 2017, the storm stalled over Houston and dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on some parts of the region.

""We were the first ones to evacuate out of our house, up the street,"" remembers John Papadopoulos. In the years before the hurricane, their home had gone from a refuge to a nightmare. It flooded in 2009, in 2015 and in 2016. By 2017, they knew what to do: Put the valuables up high, and get out. They went to a neighbor's house first, and then to a hotel.
It was a new experience for the Evans family. ""When the water started coming up, we thought we were going to have to go on the roof,"" says Janice Perry-Evans. ""But we ended up not going on the roof. We ended up, me and the kids, packing up a little bit of stuff"" in a plastic container.
""We got out and we walked in that water,"" she remembers. The water was up to her armpits in places. Eventually, a dump truck carried them to a bus, and the bus dropped them at the convention center downtown.
The next morning, Perry-Evans and Papadopoulos took the same first step to start rebuilding their lives they turned to the federal government for help. But almost immediately, their experiences diverged.

From the beginning, a lot of things went right for the Papadopoulos family. John's employer, Microsoft, gave him as much time off as he needed and more than $10,000 to help with rent and other bills that piled up after the flood. The Papadopouloses rented a townhouse nearby and, within a few months, the federal aid they had applied for began to arrive.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency gave them $30,000; because the family owned a home that had been destroyed in the flood, the Internal Revenue Service sent checks for more than $100,000 in refunded taxes a perk of having a relatively high income. The Small Business Administration gave the family a low-interest loan.
About a year after the storm, Papadopoulos said, his family was financially stable.
The Evans family was not.

Janice Perry-Evans had one goal after the floodwaters receded: find a place to stay. She didn't have any savings for a hotel or a new apartment, so when a co-worker offered her a room in his house, she took it, even though it was one room for her and her three kids and it was a 45-minute drive from work and school.
Then, she started applying for help from FEMA.
The agency gave her about $2,500, enough to cover a deposit and first month's rent in a new place, but Perry-Evans needed the money for something else. Her oldest son was hoping for a college football scholarship. He couldn't afford to miss school or football practice that fall, and the family couldn't afford for Perry-Evans to miss shifts as a mail carrier for the post office.
""I had to go to work, and I had to get these boys back and forth to school. So I took that [money] and I put it for a car,"" she explains.
With her immediate transportation needs met, Perry-Evans went back to FEMA to see about getting more money for housing, but she says agency representatives reprimanded her for incorrectly using the money she had been given.
Perry-Evans never missed a day of work as a mail carrier for the USPS in the months she spent applying for disaster funds.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""Some of them were kind of rude,"" she remembers. ""Some of them felt sorry for me because I would be crying, [saying] 'Hey, I have nowhere to go. I don't have no money. You guys are not helping me like I thought.' ""
FEMA didn't block Perry-Evans from reapplying for housing money, but she says after the scolding she turned to other potential sources of federal aid, unsuccessfully. Her income wasn't high enough to claim a significant tax refund. She says she was denied a low-interest loan from the Small Business Administration because her credit score was too low. A FEMA representative suggested she try to get housing money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but after she used her day off to go to an information session, she was informed that her income was too high to qualify.
""It was like every time I tried something, it was an obstacle in the way,"" she says.
The entire time, Perry-Evans says, she never missed a shift at the post office. She even worked the week that Hurricane Harvey hit Houston. She often worked six days a week. But her paycheck just wasn't enough to cover all her bills, and her co-worker said it was time for the family to move out of the spare room.
Six months after the flood, Perry-Evans did the only thing she felt she could: She signed a lease to rent a house that cost 50 percent more than where they used to live, for less space. The electricity didn't always work. For more than a year after the flood, Perry-Evans was still sleeping on a cot she took from the convention center.
The Rich Get Richer; The Poor Get Poorer
Perry-Evans is not alone in her struggle. ""Recovery for vulnerable families [looks] a lot different than it does for more affluent neighborhoods,"" says Kathy Payton, the director of the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corp., a neighborhood nonprofit that works a few miles from where Perry-Evans lives.

Payton grew up in Houston and has spent decades supporting the basic needs of her neighbors, many of whom live on fixed incomes or do not have a cushion of savings to fall back on after a disaster.
""We had loss of income because people lost their jobs. We had increased health issues as a result of them living in bad situations,"" she says, ticking off the cascade of challenges lower-income families have contended with since the flood. Many families struggle to successfully apply for money because they do not have access to a computer, she says, or do not have all the paperwork they need, or can't take time off from work to meet with a FEMA representative.
Payton says wealthier families are more able to comply with the rigid application requirements. ""There shouldn't be a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all template,"" she says. ""You've got to make adjustments based on the vulnerabilities and the needs of the families. And that's not what we do.""
Those application requirements are not explicitly designed to favor some citizens over others. Under the 1988 federal disaster relief law, the requirements exist to protect taxpayers from fraudulent or improper payouts after a storm, by keeping track of who has been given money for what.
But Payton says the upshot in Houston is that the more affluent parts of the city have recovered more quickly and deeply since the flood. Private insurance accounts for some of that, but Payton also believes residents in those areas have been more successful at getting federal money.
""Those families who are more apt to be able to respond to that [funding] will do so quickly, will do so more efficiently and the funds will be available on a first come, first serve basis,"" she says. Families who cannot, she says, ""will be left behind again.""

Claire Harbage/NPR
A new and growing body of research backs up Payton's observations. Studies by sociologists, as well as climate scientists, urban planners and economists, suggest that disasters, and the federal aid that follows, disproportionately benefit wealthier Americans. The same is also true along racial lines, with white communities benefiting disproportionately.
""Cities are often very unequal to begin with,"" says James Elliott, a sociologist at Rice University. ""They're segregated and there are lots of income disparities, but what seems to happen after natural hazards hit is these things become exacerbated.""
""We see these same patterns of wealth inequality being exacerbated in communities that receive more FEMA aid,"" explains sociologist Junia Howell of the University of Pittsburgh. Howell and Elliott have published multiple studies that find a pattern in who wins and who loses after floods and other disasters: Rich people get richer after a storm, and poor people get poorer.
""That's particularly true along racial lines, along lines of education, as well as homeownership versus renting,"" explains Howell. And rather than mitigating the inequity, federal aid exacerbates it, in part because of the biases Payton has noticed that are baked into how federal money is distributed.
NPR examined one federal disaster program and found evidence of exactly that phenomenon. The program uses federal and local money to purchase homes that have flooded or been affected by other natural disasters and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
The buyouts are voluntary, and the homeowner can use the money to move to a safer place. As climate change drives more extreme rain, David Maurstad of FEMA says he expects the program to grow more in the coming years.
But buyouts have disproportionately gone to whiter communities. NPR analyzed records of about 40,000 property buyouts funded by FEMA and state and local governments and found that most of them were in neighborhoods that were more than 85 percent white and non-Hispanic. (For context, the nation as a whole is 62 percent white/non-Hispanic, and disasters affect communities of all demographics.)

A Tale of Two Cities
Hurricane Harvey in Houston was a cataclysmic event. But more extreme rainfall is falling all over the United States, and that means more flooding. The trend will continue in the coming years, and so will the need for disaster relief programs and programs designed to mitigate damage. But even when those programs work as designed, NPR has found that inequality persists.
More than 1,500 miles northeast of Houston, two towns show how disaster relief efforts are determined and who wins and who loses in the calculation.
Manville, N.J., an hour outside Manhattan, has flooded repeatedly since the 1970s. On a recent tour, Superintendent of Schools Robert Beers drove over a bridge and into a neighborhood called Lost Valley, a suburban enclave of Cape Cod-style homes built in a compact grid along the Raritan River.
The numbers spray-painted on the front of this house in the Lost Valley neighborhood in Manville, N.J., indicate that it was bought as part of a federal disaster program. The program uses federal and local money to purchase houses that have flooded multiple times and permanently turn the lots into green space to reduce flood risk.
Claire Harbage/NPR
""This area was hit the hardest,"" he says. ""And as we drive through you're going to be able to see a lot of vacant homes, and areas that were bulldozed. Some of these open, these vacant lots here, there were homes here.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. A drop in household incomes followed, and home values lagged behind nearby towns.
""After the first flood, people began thinking, 'Is it time to get out?' "" says Eleanor Nieliwocki, who lived in Lost Valley for more than 30 years. ""After the second flood, not again. And the third flood, we've had it."" She finalized the sale of her house to a government buyout in 2015.
""We've had to cut programs; class sizes have grown; and, quite frankly, we haven't been able to offer the supports that our students so desperately need,"" said Robert Beers, the superintendent of Manville School District.
Claire Harbage/NPR
And buyouts like Nieliwocki's matter to Beers. All those vacant lots affect how much money his schools get. Fewer homes overall mean less tax revenue to fund education. Last year, Manville's public school system found itself battling large budget shortfalls. At the same time, Beers says, the schools faced new demands: Since 1999's Hurricane Floyd, Manville's Hispanic population had risen from 5 percent to 23 percent.
""Nearly 30 percent of our students speak only Spanish at home, so we need to fund additional positions to transition these children and provide them with the services they need,"" Beers said last spring. (By summer, after an intense lobbying effort, Beers was able to get the state government to increase funding for Manville's schools.)
And even though the buyouts in Manville hurt the tax base, FEMA says the strategy actually saves money in the long run. The agency says for every dollar spent on buyouts and other hazard mitigation programs, federal taxpayers save $6 in future disaster losses. The agency has allocated more than $15 billion on those strategies since 1989.
Students walk through the hallways of Manville High School between class periods. Fewer homes have meant fewer tax dollars to fund education, and the public school system has found itself battling large budget shortfalls.

""I think our program is achieving in Manville what it's intended to achieve,"" says Maurstad, who oversees FEMA's buyout program. He says FEMA is meeting its goals if it makes a community less risky, saves property and potentially saves lives.
And he points out that while FEMA pays 75 percent of the cost to buy out homes in disaster-prone areas, states and localities decide where they want those buyouts to occur, so demographic changes aren't on the federal agency's radar.
""I'm not aware that there's been a specific study by FEMA or anyone else on the demographic distribution of [the buyout] approach,"" says Maurstad. ""But the approach itself is not one that would necessarily, intentionally lead to those outcomes.""

Reeling from repeated floods, Manville asked the Army Corps of Engineers to build a flood control system to protect it. In 2016, the Corps said no.
Catherine Kling, an economist at Cornell University, studies the kind of benefit-cost analysis the Corps does to decide which property is worth saving. ""The whole idea of a benefit-cost analysis is actually very simple,"" Kling says. ""It simply seeks to answer the question: If we do this project, is the total value from this project greater than the total costs?""
That means that protecting 10 families in $1 million houses has the same value as protecting 100 families in $100,000 houses.
In Manville, the Corps counted about 500 homes and businesses in flood zones and said it could protect them for about $67 million. But for every dollar spent on the project, only 40 cents' worth of property would be saved. Under federal guidelines, that's not enough.
""It is completely agnostic as to who receives those benefits and those costs,"" says Kling. And, she says, economists assume the people displaced and the economic activity they generate will simply move somewhere else.

Still, even if the approach is designed to avoid picking winners and losers, it ends up doing so anyway, favoring wealthier neighborhoods. ""It's also going to be [choosing] more valuable businesses,"" Kling says. ""More valuable real estate.""
Indeed, if there were a climate change lottery with public funding as the prize, you could say Bound Brook, N.J., just 4 miles from Manville, hit the jackpot: a sweeping, $650 million flood control project whose local portion was completed in 2016. Developers followed, investing tens of millions of dollars.
In Bound Brook, on a very different tour around town last summer, Councilman Abel Gomez detailed plans for hundreds of upscale apartments, new restaurants and an expanded Main Street. ""Without flood control,"" he said, ""you were always the next natural disaster before you were wiped out.""

But some residents worry how they will afford to live there once the new projects are completed. Bound Brook has one of the nation's largest concentrations of Costa Ricans enough that the country's president visited in 2014 and a history of alleged housing discrimination. The Justice Department sued the town in 2004, saying its housing policies discriminated against Latinos, and for years its housing and development practices were regulated by a consent decree. In 2017, a local government analysis found that households in the most heavily Latino neighborhoods had lower incomes and spent a greater portion of their incomes on housing than those in the majority-white area.
Some of the newer apartments are already renting for hundreds more than the town's median rent.
Francisco Morales Mora, who emigrated from Costa Rica in 1994 and owns a restaurant downtown, says that's too much. ""The people of Bound Brook are poor,"" he says. ""And unless the new [apartments] are cheaper, people will leave.""
Francisco Morales Mora, a Costa Rican immigrant, owns a restaurant called Frank's in downtown Bound Brook. Morales says more development in town, fueled by feelings of relative safety from floods, will be good for business and make the town more vibrant. But he worries about affordability.

Robert Greco, the project's manager for the Corps, says the flood control project in and around Bound Brook protects a highly dense area with a range of income levels. He says it isn't intended to favor the wealthy but acknowledges that the project is changing the area.
""The Borough of Bound Brook is not wealthy,"" Greco says. ""But guess what, now they're building and the economic vitality is picking up, and it's beautiful, actually.""
Pressed on what the new, expensive development plan might mean for the Latino community, Gomez, the councilman, says, ""We really, really hope that the Latino identity that's here remains here. ... Because that's key to this. It sets us apart.""

The bigger picture around the country is that some Americans will be more vulnerable and some will be more resilient in the face of climate change. And who wins and who loses appears to mirror existing inequalities.
""Hardworking Americans who are working class are going to find their communities stressed even more than they are now,"" says Andrew Light, an editor of the 2018 National Climate Assessment. ""If you're already a community at risk, you're going to be at more risk.""
In Houston, the Papadopouloses have applied for a buyout and are likely to be offered one if they wait long enough. It may take years. 
Janice Perry-Evans and her family are still in their rental but, ""It is really a struggle now to stay afloat,"" she says. She plans to file for bankruptcy.
And in Manville, even as the Army Corps of Engineers declined to build a flood control project, it predicted that ""significant flooding can result in municipal infrastructure damage, loss of jobs, and closure of businesses,"" as well as ""continued potential for loss of life.""
Over the past two decades about 150 homeowners in Manville have taken disaster buyouts, and 80 more abandoned their homes. This house in Lost Valley was bought out.

Megan Geuss,"Enlarge / GILLETTE, Wyo.: A truck loaded with coal is viewed from the Eagle Butte Coal Mine Overlook which is operated by Alpha Coal. The area is a large producer of coal. Gillette uses the moniker of ""The Energy Capital of the Nation"". (Photo by reader comments 2 On Wednesday, Wyoming's Land Quality Advisory Board voted to limit so-called ""self-bonding"" in the state, a practice that allows coal and other mining companies to avoid putting up any collateral to reclaim land when the company is done with the mine. The new proposed rules will go through a public comment period and then need to be signed by the governor of the state to take effect, according to the Casper Star-Tribune. The board's passage of the proposed rules is somewhat surprising in a coal-heavy state, because it could potentially raise the cost of coal mining in Wyoming for some companies. However, there is political support for more stringent environmental rules after a number of coal companies filed for bankruptcy in recent years. Although no companies ended up abandoning mine cleanup to the state, the specter of hundreds of millions of dollars of cleanup in the event of another coal downturn has left regulators eager to limit how much damage the state could be on the hook for. The five-person advisory board voted 4-1 in favor of limiting self-bonding. The board member who voted against limits to self-bonding works for Peabody Energy, a major coal producer in the state. The limits wouldn't do away with self-bonding in Wyoming. Instead, to qualify for self-bonding, a coal company would have to have a strong credit-rating and would be expected to run the mine for at least five more years. The Star-Tribune notes that credit ratings for coal firms also factor in the health of the market, so the state of Wyoming wouldn't have to independently evaluate the larger economic risks to a mine going under. If a company doesn't qualify for self-bonding, it could still open a coal mine, but it would have to purchase some sort of surety bond or collateral bond to pay for mine reclamation after the mine has reached the end of its life, according to the US Department of the Interior (DOI). That requirement would increase the cost of starting a new mine, compared to a coal-mining company simply showing the state its financial statements under self-bonding. Wyoming's proposed amendments to its self-bonding rules are long in the making. In March, the Land Quality Advisory Board reviewed similar restrictions on the practice, but, amid pressure from major coal companies, the board sent the rules back to legislators to rewrite. The proposal that the Board passed this week seems to be only mildly less stringent than its March predecessor, which required 10 years of mine life left to self-bond instead of five, in addition to a strong credit-rating. Wyoming is not the only state that allows self-bonding for mining companies. In fact, 19 states allow it, and of those, 10 states plus the Navajo Nation currently host self-bonded surface-mining operations, the DOI notes. But the financial troubles of the coal-mining industry have highlighted the risks involved with self-bonding in a way that previous operations have not. At a federal level, self-bonding is not illegal, and the US government has largely allowed states to legislate the matter as they see fit. In April, however, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the federal government end its tacit approval of self-bonding.",Legislators are eager to avoid financial disaster if coal companies default again.,2018-09-20T21:20:14Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","As coal stalls, Wyoming considers new environmental-protection rules",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/wyoming-proposes-making-cleanup-funding-rules-stricter-for-coal-companies/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-691404934-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,1
Adam Clark Estes,"Software updates are exciting. I keep telling my friends this, and when they get behind on their updates, I’m all, “Hey, you’re missing out on good stuff!” This is part of the reason why I’m sometimes the guy who downloads beta versions of software. The bugs are annoying, but hey, the features are better. This approach recently backfired on me with macOS and iOS 12. Unexpectedly, I think the resulting disaster made me a better computer user. It’s honestly a really stupid story. (Emphasis on “stupid” and also emphasis on me being the stupid one.) After seeing several coworkers running the beta version of macOS Mojave and looking super cool with the new dark mode, I decided I had to have it. And while I was at it, why not join the public beta for iOS 12 and see what that was all about? Because you should always pivot from dependable software to unpredictable adventures when your daily life depends on it. Definitely do it with the laptop and phone you use every day! Again, I did a dumb thing, but I learned a lesson from it. Within 24 hours of downloading macOS Mojave and iOS 12 onto my primary laptop and phone, my world was turned upside down. I didn’t receive notifications properly on my phone any more, and I couldn’t send text messages. My laptop wouldn’t connect to wifi on a regular basis. Battery life was a gut-punching tragedy. And it was my fault. It was also a little bit Apple’s fault, says my vindictive side. For the sake of learning lessons, though, let’s look at all this mess from a historical perspective and see if we can make sense of anything. This isn’t the first time Downloading beta versions of integral operating systems is not a new thing for me. A few years ago, I did my first Gizmodo review: an anguished tome about iOS 7. It was a silly thing to review, since most people would eventually upgrade their iPhone software out of necessity, but I think my editor was trying to ease me into the waters of Gizmodo reviews as gently as possible. “Download the developer beta,” he told me, “and check out the new features.” It felt thrilling at the time. I quickly realized why anyone who knows anything about software discourages non-developers from using betas on a regular basis. At the very least, wise computer users will tell you that you should never download beta versions of operating systems on your primary computer or smartphone. The software is called beta for a reason! Beta versions are unfinished, full of bugs, and guaranteed to be unpredictable. If you’re really curious about how the new iOS works, install it on your old phone and save yourself some heartache. When I did the iOS 7 review, I only had one iPhone. I was also somehow dumber than I am today, so I signed up for a developer account, nuked my trusty iOS 6, and dove headfirst in the glorious, new, flat design. I’d go out to bars, hoping someone would see how different my iPhone looked and ask me how I did it. (No one ever did.) During work hours, I would miss emails, tear through my battery by 10am, and struggle to stay sane. The review turned out fine, I think, and I swore never to do it again. Until iOS 8 came out, and I did it again. That time, though, I had an old phone and followed the advice of the sage developers. I followed that pattern for the next several versions. Then, this year happened. Thanks to a clumsy friend, my backup phone got destroyed a few months ago, so I’ve been depending solely on my iPhone X. My backup computer also bit the dust, so my primary machine is a work laptop. Given what I’ve just said about only loading beta operating systems onto backup phones and computers, you’d think that I would skip this year’s public beta. I did not. A week ago, I downloaded both of them at once and felt proud of myself for being bold. That feeling lasted less than a day. This isn’t the worst time, either It turns out iOS 12 isn’t much different than iOS 11. We knew this would be the case a while back when reports suggested that the next version of Apple’s mobile software would focus on stability and clean up the buggy mess that was its previous version. Similarly, macOS Mojave is a gentle upgrade at best. Aside from the new dark mode, many of the improvements can only be spotted when you’re looking for them. They’re great—I really like the quick editing options macOS Mojave lets you do in Finder—but there’s nothing I couldn’t live without. Like I said before, the primary motivating factor for my joining the public beta program was to get the dark mode. It is, as I’d hoped, dark and, as a result, deeply badass. The bugs in these early version of macOS Mojave and iOS 12 are not badass. They’re awful. As I write this post, I’m using my iPhone as a hotspot because my Mojave-powered laptop will only connect to wifi sometimes, and I’m about to lose my mind, because my company’s security software clearly hasn’t been updated for macOS Mojave and is freaking out as a result. Meanwhile, my iPhone is about to die, even though it was fully charged about 90 minutes ago. I still can’t receive most text messages, and my contact list seems to nuke itself at will, so even if I do get one, I usually have no idea who sent it. These kinds of bugs reminded me of my earlier forays into beta versions of Apple’s operating systems, although the problems weren’t as catastrophic as some I’ve encountered in the past. I could honestly deal with a lot of these annoyances, if Apple offered an exceptionally better experience in this new software. While I do believe the new versions of macOS and iOS are better than their predecessors, there’s nothing mind-blowing, at least not in the way that iOS 7 and its slick design was mind-blowing so many years ago. Sure, macOS Mojave has dark mode, but half of my other software doesn’t yet support it. Meanwhile, iOS 12 promises some cool innovations with Siri Shortcuts and ARKit 2, but those platforms need third party apps to make the features shine. Those apps won’t be available until the official release. It seems like Memoji is the splashiest new thing available in the iOS 12 public beta, so far. Which is gross. The really tricky thing about using with early beta software—especially an operating system—is that some bugs rear their ugly heads at the weirdest times. Some of them, like that messaging one I mentioned above, are fixable. (It’s an iMessage bug, and all you have to do is completely sign out of iCloud on your iOS device and sign back in.) The wifi issue also isn’t the end of the world. (It has to do with public wifi networks, and there’s a specific webpage you can visit in Safari to skirt around the problem.) The trouble with my company-specific software, unfortunately, won’t go away. This headache mainly amounts to getting a lot of random pop-ups throughout the day which is annoying at best. At worst, my computer is slightly less secure than it was when I was running the official release of macOS High Sierra. So after a week of suffering, I decided to turn back. The new-ish public beta programs come with a sort of handy rip cord that lets you unenroll in the public beta. If you don’t like the glitchy software, you can delete your public beta profile, put your device in recovery mode, and restore your device from the backup you were supposed to make before installing the public beta. Apple even built a handy little website to walk you through the process. Problem is, the macOS backup only works if you use Time Machine. I back everything up with Google Drive, so that was useless. But since macOS Mojave isn’t all that buggy, I decided to live with it. Getting out of iOS 12 was harder than I thought. Luckily, I did back up my iPhone through iTunes. So I erased it and went for the full restore, excited to get back to my crappy old iOS 11 experience. Unfortunately, the macOS Mojave beta version of iTunes wouldn’t recognize my phone, so I couldn’t restore it that way. Thanks to a slew of adaptors and some deep digging in the mobile backup folder in Finder, I got the backup file and restored it from a different computer. Well, first I just simply wiped and restored the device without putting it in recovery mode first. This simply restored the iPhone from the backup but did not get rid of iOS 12. To do that, you have to put your device in recovery mode before you restore from the backup. It took—I’m not exaggerating—an entire day to accomplish this. There won’t be a next time After many wasted hours tinkering with this unfinished software, I’m done. My iPhone is basically back to normal, minus a few days of lost data. My MacBook Pro is a bit of a flickering mess, but I’ll deal with it. (At least it didn’t turn blue, like my coworker’s did.) Me, I’m a bit embarrassed. All of the inconveniences that come with using beta software for my daily life were completely avoidable, and I knew it. Apple is also very careful to express you should be prepared for bugs, and you should absolutely back everything up before you start. This got me thinking hard about how I used computers these days. I’m frankly a little overconfident sometimes. While I take pride in fixing problems myself and even doing basic hardware repairs, I’m not a developer. I honestly don’t have any business spotting bugs for Apple, especially when I’m just using my iPhone and my MacBook to keep in touch with friends and do my job. And also, I suck at following instructions. I didn’t backup my MacBook when Apple told me to, and that was almost as stupid as thinking I needed dark mode immediately. So I’m stuck. I’m stuck with this beta version of macOS until the fall when the official release will drop. I’m stuck with the bugs, and I’m stuck with the frustration. If there’s a silver lining to any of this, it’s the simple fact that I will not make this mistake again. I’ll stop thinking I’m some kind of super user and that I’m capable of using half-finished software for the fun of it. I’ll even be better about backing up my devices in the ways that Apple wants me to, in case I ever do need to restore them. I might even be a better computer user one day. Doubt I’ll ever recover from being a dumbass, though.","Software updates are exciting. I keep telling my friends this, and when they get behind on their updates, I’m all, “Hey, you’re missing out on good stuff!” This is part of the reason why I’m sometimes the guy who downloads beta versions of software.

Reuters Editorial,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela arrested five state police officials for their alleged role in a riot and fire that killed 68 people in an overcrowded police station cell, the country’s public prosecutor said on Saturday. “The prosecutor’s office has issued arrest warrants for five officials of PoliCarabobo who have been signaled as responsible for the tragic incident that led to the death of 68 citizens in the cells of the headquarters of said regional police: THEY HAVE BEEN DETAINED #Justice,” tweeted prosecutor Tarek Saab. Saab, a former Socialist Party governor close to leftist President Nicolas Maduro, did not provide any further details on the cause of the disaster, the worst to affect Venezuela’s notoriously violent jails in over two decades. Relatives of dead inmates and one surviving prisoner told Reuters there was a shoot-out with police on Wednesday morning in the jail in Carabobo state capital Valencia. One inmate’s widow said officials had doused the area with gasoline, which fueled a fire through the small cells strung with hammocks and divided with sheets. There was no immediate comment from Carabobo state police. Venezuela’s opposition blames the tragedy on Maduro’s inability to reform Venezuela’s lawless jails, where inmates strut around with weapons and orchestrate crimes from cells. “The situation in detention centers and police jail cells in Venezuela is unacceptable!” said opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro. Opposition politicians have also criticized the government for its long silence about the incident. Maduro’s administration only issued a statement late on Friday night expressing its condolences to relatives and the president has yet to publicly speak about the deaths. A former bus driver and union leader who has grown widely unpopular, Maduro is running for re-election in a May election largely boycotted by the opposition. With heavy use of state resources and a compliant electoral council, he is expected to win a six-year term despite salary-destroying hyperinflation, a fifth straight year of recession, and rampant crime. State television focused on showing images of Venezuelans on the beach during the Easter holiday, while Maduro’s ministers also largely remained mum on the Valencia disaster. But Delcy Rodriguez, the president of the pro-government legislative super body known as the constituent assembly, struck back at criticism of the government’s handling of the jail fire. “We repudiate the use of Venezuelans’ pain as a political tool,” tweeted Rodriguez.

Shannon Connellan,"James Franco was pressed for answers by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show on Tuesday, following accusations of sexual misconduct since his Golden Globe win. The Disaster Artist star was interviewed by the talk show host, broadcast mere hours after The New York Times cancelled a TimesTalks event with Franco scheduled for Wednesday. SEE ALSO: Seth Meyers slays Golden Globes monologue then gives women the mic A public supporter of the Time's Up movement against systemic sexual abuse in Hollywood and other industries, Franco wore one of the widely publicized pins to the Globes on Sunday. But during and after the ceremony, in which Franco won a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role in The Disaster Artist, several women posted accusations of sexual misconduct on Twitter. Tweets included those of The Breakfast Club actor Ally Sheedy, who Franco directed in a 2014 off-Broadway play. She wrote in now-deleted tweets, “James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business,"" then posted #MeToo at the end of another tweet. Actress Violet Paley claimed that Franco had tried to force her to perform oral sex, tweeting that, ""A couple weeks ago, James offered me &amp; a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone “apology”. I don’t accept."" Cute #TIMESUP pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis &amp; that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old? — Violet Paley (@VioletPaley) January 8, 2018 Colbert asked Franco about these accusations of sexual misconduct on the Late Show. “First, I want to say I do support it,"" said Franco, speaking of the Time's Up and #MeToo movements. ""Look, I was so excited to win but being in that room that night was incredible. It was powerful, and there were incredible voices and I support it, I support change."" ""There were some things on Twitter, I haven’t read them. I’ve heard about them,"" he said, turning his attention to the accusations against him. ""OK, first of all, I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy. I directed her in a play off-Broadway. I had nothing but a great time with her. Total respect for her. I have no idea why she was upset. She took the tweet down, I don't know, I can’t speak for her."" ""The others, look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I’ve done. I have to to that to maintain my wellbeing. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed. I make it a point to do it."" ""The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn’t have a voice for so long. So, I don’t want to shut them down in anyway. It's, I think, a good thing and I support it."" Colbert asked Franco whether there was some way to have the discussion that wasn't held on social media, and whether there could be some kind of reconciliation for two people who have different views of a situation. “If there’s restitution to be made, I will make it. So, if I’ve done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to. I mean, I think that's how that works. I don’t know what else to do. ""As far as the bigger issues, you know, how we do it, look, I really don’t have the answers and I think the point of this whole thing is that we listen.

Victoria Rodriguez,"Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press. The hurricane made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday and then weakened as it moved through Georgia. Now designated a tropical storm, Michael is headed toward North and South Carolina, which were both recently devastated by Hurricane Florence. SEE ALSO: Photos show widespread destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael Although the full scope of the damage is still being evaluated, preliminary reports have included power outages, uprooted trees, flooding, and demolished homes. At least six people have died as a result of the hurricane. CoreLogic, a financial data company, estimates insured storm losses could reach $4.5 billion. Recovery work has started in Florida, so if you'd like to help the survivors there and in Georgia, here's our list of ways you can provide support: 1. Donate to disaster-relief organizations. The nonprofit Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities, compiled a list of organizations providing general aid and relief, as well as food, shelter, medical care, and other necessities. If you want to ensure that your donation goes directly to Hurricane Michael relief, check first with the nonprofit about how they earmark financial gifts. Here are the organizations listed by Charity Navigator: GlobalGiving, International Relief Teams, International Medical Corps, Save the Children, Direct Relief, American Kidney Fund, DonorsChoose.org, World Help, American Red Cross, LeSea Global Feed the Hungry, SBP, Americares, Good360, World Hope International, First Book, Christian Relief Fund, World Vision, Matthew 25: Ministries, Heart to Heart International, Catholic Charities Diocese of St. Petersburg, Big Cat Rescue, Feeding the Gulf Coast, and Feeding Tampa Bay. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Habitat for Humanity is taking donations to carry out their recovery plan following the storm. Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies, which receives donations, is working to assist people with disabilities, older adults, and other people with access and functional needs. 2. Help provide emergency supplies. Several of the above organizations are focused on meeting the urgent need for food, water, clothing, and shelter. World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, is delivering supplies, such as food, hygiene kits, clean water, blankets, diapers, and other personal care items to those affected and displaced by Hurricane Michael. You can donate here. Global Giving, an international crowdfunding community that supports local nonprofits, launched a Hurricane Michael relief fund to provide emergency supplies as well as long-term assistance. 3. Donate to GoFundMe campaigns. GoFundMe has created a general relief fund to raise $50,000. The funds will be managed by The Direct Impact Fund, an independent nonprofit that distributes funds to verified campaigns and aid organizations. GoFundMe has also created a hub for verified individual campaigns related to Michael. If you're looking for additional resources on how to assess nonprofits and their work providing relief aid, consider consulting Charity Navigator or other charity watchdogs, like GuideStar, Charity Watch, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.","Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press.

Andy Sullivan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida last September, the top U.S. disaster-response official ordered all hands on deck. With 4,500 Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers already helping survivors of Hurricane Harvey in Texas, FEMA chief Brock Long told managers in an internal memo to ready every member of the agency’s on-call reservist workforce for deployment. In the following months, thousands of FEMA reservists, who account for about half of the agency’s disaster-response personnel, would descend on Florida, Puerto Rico, California and elsewhere to help recovery efforts after an unprecedented string of natural disasters. But not all would respond. About 500 reservists, or one of every twelve workers, ignored FEMA’s deployment request, current and former officials told Reuters. “We didn’t even hear from them,” Patrick Hernandez, who oversees FEMA’s disaster workforce, said in an interview. “We need to get people in here who understand the system and adhere to the protocols.” With the 2018 hurricane season already underway, FEMA is scrambling to hire more people who are willing to depart at a moment’s notice for assignments that can last months at a stretch. Internal documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show the agency's disaster-response force is understaffed by 26 percent. And as last year revealed, many of those who sign up don't always respond when needed. (For graphic, see tmsnrt.rs/2Juw4LV ) That comes at a cost. At times, staffing shortages force FEMA to shuffle personnel from one disaster to the next and in some cases rely on workers who do not know how to do the job effectively, according to interviews with 15 current and former FEMA workers. Some local officials say the agency’s central mission - getting federal aid where it is needed - is undercut by the constant turnover. “They had no knowledge of the system. They had no knowledge about how to do anything but fill out forms,” said Junior Shelton, mayor of Central, Louisiana, which experienced catastrophic flooding in 2016. “We’re still sitting around waiting for that money to get here.” Hernandez said staffing issues have not affected FEMA’s ability to get the job done. “I would not agree with that statement wholeheartedly,” he said. Help wanted at FEMA: tmsnrt.rs/2Jxn6O1 ‘A VERY LOW NUMBER’ The extraordinary string of domestic disasters in 2017 continues to weigh on the U.S. agency. With thousands of workers still out in the field, official figures show that 33 percent of FEMA’s disaster-response workforce is available for deployment, down from 56 percent at this time last year. Some specialties are stretched especially thin: Only 13 percent of the workers who direct federal aid to pay for rebuilding costs after a disaster hits are currently available. “That’s a very low number, and that would be very scary going into more disasters,” said Elizabeth Zimmerman, a former senior FEMA official. Unlike military reservists, those who work for FEMA don’t have a guarantee that their regular jobs will be available when they return home. As a result, most are retirees who don’t need steady work or recent college graduates who don’t yet have a full-time job, current and former managers say. Reservists are allowed to turn down up to three assignments each year, meaning FEMA cannot count on a full reserve force during peak periods. According to internal figures, FEMA’s reservist corps has grown by roughly 1,000 workers over the past year. Still, it remains 3,700 workers short of the 10,949 reservists it has determined it needs to be able to respond to several disasters at once. Some reservists say they are not in a position to accept months-long assignments far from their homes. “I could get a phone call tomorrow telling me to go to Puerto Rico, but the truth is I’m not going to go,” said Alessandra Jerolleman, who said family obligations prevent her from leaving Louisiana. FEMA officials point out they can pull in other types of workers when needed. Some 22,000 federal employees from agencies like the Defense Department participated in disaster-relief work with FEMA in 2017, for example. “We rely on our reservists and we love them,” said FEMA’s Hernandez. “But FEMA’s made up of a lot of different elements.” SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS FEMA also hires residents of disaster zones to help out, a practice that is widely praised for boosting employment and harnessing local knowledge. But some say it can hinder FEMA’s effectiveness. Carlos Mercader, Puerto Rico’s top lobbyist in Washington, said he received numerous complaints of poorly trained FEMA workers who assess damaged houses in a seemingly arbitrary manner. While one might be declared a total loss, another that appeared to suffer similar damage might be denied reconstruction assistance, he said. Local hires accounted for more than half of the 2,878 FEMA employees in Puerto Rico in May, according to agency figures obtained by Reuters. Only 100 are permanent FEMA employees. “They probably should be sending us more people with as much experience as possible,” Mercader said. FEMA officials say Congress could help with recruiting and retaining reservists by guaranteeing they can keep their regular jobs while on assignment, as is the case with military reservists. Officials have also asked Congress to change hiring laws to give reservists preferential status when they apply for a full-time FEMA job. Congress has yet to act on those requests. But FEMA’s own actions may also drive away some who are willing to serve, reservists say. Paul Seldes, 59, said he tried unsuccessfully since 2011 to find an assignment that matched his background in field operations. Instead, the agency repeatedly asked him to report to a telephone call center to screen financial-aid requests from disaster survivors. By last fall, he no longer bothered to respond to such deployment requests, he said. “I have this capability, I have this knowledge, I have this training - why don’t you want to listen to me?” he said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption A symbol of hope or bad PR for Fukushima? Fukushima residents have reacted angrily to the statue of a boy in protective gear, saying it gives the impression of a city still contaminated after the 2011 nuclear disaster. Fukushima's nuclear plant was hit by a tsunami in 2011, causing the most serious such accident since Chernobyl. The statue was erected in early August and its creator said it was about hope for a world free from nuclear disaster. Artist Kenji Yanobe has since apologised for making residents uneasy. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo, angry citizens took to Twitter and called the authorities directly, demanding for the statue to be removed as it would harm the reputation of Fukushima. The statue is named ""Sun Child"" and can be found outside Fukushima's train station. It depicts a boy wearing a yellow hazmat suit, holding his helmet in one hand and a sun symbol in the other. A monitor counter on his chest displays the numbers ""000"" to show there is no radiation. ""I wanted to make a work that encourages people… and made the statue of a child standing up bravely and strongly against any difficulties it faces,"" Mr Yanobe said, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo. Image copyright AFP Image caption The nuclear plant remains contaminated and in ruins The 2011 Fukushima disaster saw three reactors of the nuclear power plant, some 100km (62 miles) southeast of the city of Fukushima, fail after it was damaged and flooded in the tsunami. The accident forced more than 200,000 people to leave their homes because of nuclear contamination concerns. More than 18,500 people were killed or went missing after an earthquake triggered the massive tsunami that led to the meltdown. Parts of the damaged reactors are still highly contaminated but most of the prefecture has been declared safe again. The artist Mr Yanobe said he ""should have paid more attention to the fact that accurate knowledge about radiation is needed much more now than before the disaster"". Image copyright AFP He also said he wanted to discuss the future of his statue with the city. The city's mayor defended the decision to put up the statue, arguing it had been well received at exhibitions in Japan and around the world before it was installed permanently in Fukushima. On Twitter he called for understanding saying that unlike science, contemporary art was abstract.","For angry Fukushima residents, the statue gives the impression of a city still contaminated.",2018-08-14T06:36:52Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Fukushima child statue: Residents complain about radiation suit,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45179095,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/42DC/production/_102961171_044df30c-44db-4682-a84b-295ac0cde9df.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1

Gram Slattery,"BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Residents of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais reacted with indifference and in many cases dismissal at a raft of measures mining giant Vale SA pledged to adopt in recent days in the wake of a dam burst that likely killed over 300 people. 
“Too Late” read the newspaper of record here, O Estado de Minas, after Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, said it would take up to 10 percent of its production offline and spend 5 billion reais ($1.36 billion) to decommission 10 dams like the one that collapsed at its Corrego do Feijao mine on Friday. 
With some 99 people confirmed dead and another 250 missing, according to firefighters, the tailings dam collapse in the town of Brumadinho may be Brazil’s deadliest ever mine disaster. In recent days, Vale has vowed to keep paying taxes on the paralyze mine and donate 100,000 reais to the family of each victim.

MARTIN FACKLER,"A Tepco guide explained this was because the central plant grounds had been deforested and paved over, sealing in contaminated soil. During a recent visit, the mood within the plant was noticeably more relaxed, though movements were still tightly controlled and everyone was required to wear radiation-measuring badges. Inside a “resting building,” workers ate in a large cafeteria and bought snacks in a convenience store. At the plant’s entrance, a sign warned: “Games like Pokemon GO are forbidden within the facility.” “We have finished the debris cleanup and gotten the plant under control,” said the guide, Daisuke Hirose, a spokesman for Tepco’s subsidiary in charge of decommissioning the plant. “Now, we are finally preparing for decommissioning.” In September, the prime minister’s office set a target date of 2021 — the 10th anniversary of the disaster — for the next significant stage, when workers begin extracting the melted fuel from at least one of the three destroyed reactors, though they have yet to choose which one. The government admits that cleaning up the plant will take at least another three to four decades and tens of billions of dollars. A $100 million research center has been built nearby to help scientists and engineers develop a new generation of robots to enter the reactor buildings and scoop up the melted fuel. At Chernobyl, the Soviets simply entombed the charred reactor in concrete after the deadly 1986 accident. But Japan has pledged to dismantle the Fukushima plant and decontaminate the surrounding countryside, which was home to about 160,000 people who were evacuated after accident. Many of them have been allowed to return as the rural towns around the plant have been decontaminated. But without at least starting a cleanup of the plant itself, officials admit they will find it difficult to convince the public that the accident is truly over. They also hope that beginning the cleanup will help them win the public’s consent to restart Japan’s undamaged nuclear plants, most of which remain shut down since the disaster. Tepco and the government are treading cautiously to avoid further mishaps that could raise doubts that the plant is under control. “They are being very methodical — too slow, some would say — in making a careful effort to avoid any missteps or nasty surprises,” said David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was a co-author of a book on the disaster. “They want to regain trust. They have learned that trust can be lost much quicker than it can be recovered.” Continue reading the main story","Daisuke Hirose, a Tepco spokesman, inside the Unit 5 reactor at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.

Tom McKay,"Electronic Art’s Star Wars Battlefront II, one of the biggest video game titles of the year, debuted to disaster in recent weeks after both consumers and the gaming press revolted against the $60 game’s reliance on microtransaction-fueled, pay-to-win loot boxes. At launch, the title prevented players from accessing key features of the game like playing as Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader without either grueling grinds or shelling out extra cash to help bypass its confusing internal economy. Crucially, some elements of the system like loot box contents were randomized—meaning even players who chose to give EA more money could still walk away frustrated. Last week, the Belgian Gaming Commission reportedly launched an investigation into whether the system constituted a violation of gambling laws. According to PC Gamer and VTM Nieuws, the commission’s decision is clear: It considers inserting randomized pay-to-win schemes into video games as equivalent to the “mixing of money and addiction” and thus a form of gambling like video slot machines. Belgian Minister of Justice Koen Geens added, “Mixing gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.” He noted that Belgium would have to work through the European Union’s process to achieve a total ban. This has potentially huge ramifications for the video game industry, which has seen some of its biggest players turn to milking players for micro-transaction revenue even after they’ve shelled out money for the original product. The Belgian ruling doesn’t address that issue directly—consumers would still be allowed to pay for specific bonuses or items—but it does suggest that the trend is starting to become abusive enough that regulators are setting limits to how far it can extend its grimy tentacles. It’s also likely to be particularly embarrassing for EA, which has already seen such an incredible backlash to Battlefront II’s model that it’s in the uncomfortable position of tanking a flagship Star Wars game in the middle of a rebooted franchise. While gamers are notoriously rabid opponents of government infringement on the industry, it’s hard to see them sticking their nose up at this one.

Catie Keck,"The release of a damning report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this week predicting unprecedented climate disaster within the next decade was no doubt a sobering reminder of the fragile state of our planet. But new forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for the future of global renewable energy capacity offers a far more hopeful picture, predicting a massive spike in clean energy over the next five years if, that is, necessary policy and regulation are acted upon now. In an October 8 press release on its Renewables 2018 report, the IEA highlighted modern bioenergy which the International Renewable Energy Agency describes as including liquid biofuels produced from plants, biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, and wood pellet heating systems, which is of particular importance for industries as having the potential for the greatest growth in renewable resources between now and 2023. The IEA also noted the importance of modern bioenergy in developing a robust renewable portfolio and ensuring a more secure and sustainable energy system. Modern bioenergy is the overlooked giant of the renewable energy field, the IEAs executive director Dr. Fatih Birol said in a statement. Its share in the worlds total renewables consumption is about 50% today, in other words as much as hydro, wind, solar and all other renewables combined. We expect modern bioenergy will continue to lead the field, and has huge prospects for further growth. Whats more, Bloomberg reported Sunday that one forecast scenario from the report could see as much as an extra 1.3 terawatts of clean energy being installed by 2023. Part of this predicted renewable energy boom is thanks to solar power, for which the Renewables report states: Solar PV capacity is forecast to expand by almost 600 GW more than all other renewable power technologies combined, or as much as twice Japans total capacity, reaching 1 terawatt (TW) by the end of the forecast period. Despite recent policy changes, China remains the absolute solar PV leader by far, holding almost 40% of global installed PV capacity in 2023. The United States remains the second-largest growth market for solar PV, followed by India, whose capacity quadruples. [ sic ] If all this sounds great, the report does underscore the importance of appropriate policies and market design as paramount to the success of continued renewable energy growth. As Birol noted in his statement on the report, [T]he right policies and rigorous sustainability regulations will be essential to meet its full potential. Gizmodo reached out to IEA for comment and will update this report should we hear back.

Brendan M. Egan,"Launching a startup takes courage -- and cash. About one-third of new businesses fail within their first two years, and about 50 percent of new businesses are no longer around after the five-year mark. Why? According to U.S. Bank, it is estimated that 82 percent of businesses that don’t make it fail because of cash flow problems. It’s no secret that it takes a significant amount of money to launch and operate a startup. But sometimes, entrepreneurs underestimate how much they will need to cover their expenses. Here’s a look at the top five expenses that startup founders fear the most. Related: 6 Entrepreneurs Share the Brilliant, Crazy Ways They Took Their Companies From Pennies to Profit 1. Legal fees Entrepreneurs will need a lawyer to assist with a number of different legal matters. For example, lawyers can assist with the formation and incorporation of your business. Lawyers can also help entrepreneurs protect the intellectual property that the company relies on to do business. Lawyers are invaluable assets who can help entrepreneurs overcome legal obstacles on their path to success. But unfortunately, their services do not come cheap. Legal fees can add up quickly, so this is an expense that every entrepreneur fears. To save on legal, consider researching online templates and documents that can give you a head start on your legal planning. Things like operating agreements, form contracts and terms of service can all be found online by doing a quick Google search. Get these documents to where you feel they are 90 percent of what you need, then bring on a lawyer to bring things to the finish line. 2. Taxes Entrepreneurs are usually well aware that they will have to pay taxes, but they may be surprised by the amount they will have to pay. Even if you are not making a huge profit, you will still probably owe something. To minimize these expenses, it’s best to work with an accountant year-round. An accountant can make sure you are taking advantage of all of the deductions available to lower your tax bill. Having a sound tax strategy will help you maximize the amount of money you have to reinvest each year in your startup. Related: Founders Keep Making These 9 Common Mistakes That Crush Promising Startups 3. Interest and funding A lot of entrepreneurs have no other choice but to take out a business loan to finance their dreams. In fact, the National Small Business Association estimates that 69 percent of small businesses used loans or another type of financing in 2016. These loans may seem like a quick and easy way to inject cash into the business. However, many entrepreneurs forget to factor in interest payments when deciding whether or not it’s a good idea to take out a loan. The exact interest rate will vary depending on the type of loan and your current situation. Don’t get caught off guard by an unexpected interest payment. If you are planning on taking out a loan, be sure to read the fine print carefully before signing on the dotted line. Another popular route many startups are taking is turning to crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. These sites allow startups to crowdsource funds often at a much more attractive term than a traditional loan. 4. Shrinkage Startup companies that are selling products in a brick-and-mortar setting, or even online, may experience a surprising amount of shrinkage. The 2016 National Retail Security Survey revealed that shrinkage costs companies in the U.S. about $45 billion every year. To prevent shrinkage, entrepreneurs must first determine where their products are the most vulnerable to shrinkage. Shrinkage can occur because of shoplifting, employee theft and errors. Shoplifting is by far the most common cause, so you may want to start by here. For example, a retail business owner will need to consider installing a security system, hiring enough people to watch over customers, and training employees to look for signs that someone is shoplifting. Preparing in this manner can help entrepreneurs fight shrinkage and protect their finances. Ecommerce businesses should ensure they have a proper auditing system in place to prevent errors and lost product. There are only so many hours in the day, so time is by far the most valuable resource that you cannot afford to waste. Entrepreneurs often fear that they will hurt their business by not managing their time wisely. Are you spending too much time on activities that could be outsourced? Are you not spending enough time on networking and acquiring new clients? These are the questions that haunt every entrepreneur. Related: How Small Businesses Are Solving Big Business Challenges The way you spend your time can also impact your personal life. Entrepreneurs must be committed to launching their business, which often means working long hours and leaving little time for their loved ones. Because of this, many entrepreneurs fear that their new venture could affect their personal relationships. There’s no reason for startup founders to fear how much time they will spend on their business. There is a way to find a balance between work and your personal life, and that is good time management. Make the most out of every moment in your day so you can get more work done and leave more time for loved ones. Eliminate distractions in the workplace, delegate low-value tasks to others, and take advantage of scheduling and time management apps to keep you on track. By preparing for these expenses, entrepreneurs can ensure their startup is part of the one-third of businesses that hit their 10 year anniversary.

GLENN THRUSH,"Traditionally states, and not the federal government, have been responsible for hashing out the details of assessing damage, processing claims and distributing funding in the wake of national disasters, a system intended to give local decision makers control over how their communities are rebuilt. But states and cities, unaccustomed to dealing with the complex logistical and oversight issues of administering programs geared at fast-tracking billions in capital projects, are now finding themselves overwhelmed by the demands, even though such challenges have been well-documented since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many of the areas most prone to repeated hurricanes, especially Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and now North Carolina, have all experienced similar problems as they adjust to a new normal in which disaster agencies are permanently mobilized and f ederal disaster money is now one of the single biggest sources of government money used to help rehabilitate or preserve low-income housing. We are really good at disaster recovery programs, hazard mitigation, helping individual people who are in trouble, but not at this kind of thing, said the states emergency management director, Michael A. Sprayberry, who contends that the lessons learned under Matthew will help the state more efficiently distribute post-Florence disaster funding. We have had to hire and stand up a completely new staff roughly 50, 60 new people so this is a whole new ballgame. It took more than 10 months to comply with federally mandated environmental reviews and other red tape, Mr. Sprayberry said, which is contributing to the frustration.

In short, our talented team members were determined to keep the operation running without anyone on the leadership team having to micromanage. The whole experience validated my belief that a great company needs to prioritize cultivating talented, self-motivated and resourceful people. It also taught me that whether a company makes this a priority may become the measure of its resilience. When storm clouds hit, this is what will decide whether your company will swim or sink. Have a dependable disaster plan -- and stick to it. Almost every company has a business plan. Some companies (especially well-established ones) have business continuity plans and policies. But few companies ever consider apocalyptic scenarios. Hurricane María taught me that every company -- and tech companies in particular -- need a plan for when key infrastructure fails. Logistical challenges, such as losing electricity or internet, might seem impossible for a tech company to overcome. Operations come to a screeching halt; banking is frozen; client account executives are pushed into survival mode; and development (a constant driving force at any tech company) is put on the back burner. So, what will your company do when a disaster brings about unimaginable logistical challenges? For me, a good disaster plan should include: 1. An emergency home base. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, many of our team members worked from my co-founder’s apartment, which had a stable source of power and internet, and wasn’t severely impacted by the storm. Some team members even made it a temporary home. The level of bonding this brought about was remarkable. Because you can’t foresee how long you might be unable to operate from your normal place of business, the value of having an emergency home base when things go haywire cannot be understated. 2. A designated person to leave before a predicted disaster. Before María brought catastrophic conditions, some team members left the island in order to maintain communication with our clients. My co-founder left for Atlanta where her family is from, and our lead architect went to Miami. This helped ensure that we’d have dependable communication with our clients as well as the peace of mind that our systems would continue to run smoothly. For tech companies, having team players who are strong communicators, competent both in the big picture of your company as well as the finer technical points and individual relationships is always an asset. 3. Logistical and technical considerations made beforehand. Electricity is something we all take for granted. But what do you do -- especially if you’re a tech company -- if the power goes out? We were fortunate that a board member had access to generators through a personal connection. We also purchased and delivered several generators for our team in the aftermath of the storm. Having a back-up plan for logistical needs in the face of calamity will provide much-needed aid in maintaining business operations and help staffers regain a sense of normalcy. 4. A means for maintaining contact with clients (and leads). Facing and overcoming unexpected challenges when it comes to delivering for a client is a natural part of entrepreneurship. If we hadn't appreciated this before Hurricane María, we could have been in serious trouble. As the hurricane approached, we were right in the middle of closing a major client. Before the storm made landfall, I forwarded my co-founder (who'd left for Atlanta) every piece of client communication I had, knowing that we would be without electricity for a few days (that loss would last for months for much of the island ). Not only was she able to close the deal, she also communicated the new client’s needs to our lead architect in Miami. Of course, some clients were dealing with the same catastrophe as we were. To give their businesses peace of mind,my co-founder called and emailed these clients to tell them their data was safe. The bottom line is that disasters happen. You need to maintain your calm with clients and maintain as much normalcy as possible. 5. Sensitivity to your team’s needs. A disaster like this can put everything into perspective. As important as it is to maintain normalcy with clients, providing support for your co-workers is just as important, if not more. Start by understanding the needs of every team member on a personal level. When María struck, the last thing we wanted was for our colleagues to have to choose between being there for their families and meeting a deadline at work. Our VP of engineering, for example, lives in a remote area of the island and has two small children at home. After the hurricane, he had to fill up his own water tank for months on end just to have water in his house. This often required him to leave the office early and, sometimes, he could make it in only a few times per week. Not only were we happy to make this concession, but we provided support for him and his family in other ways as well. The lesson is, if the leaders of a company don’t have genuine concern for the well-being of their team members, they can’t expect them to perform their jobs at a high level. This may seem obvious, but once again, the advent of disaster put this notion into stark relief. In sum, disasters are, by their nature, unpredictable. Even when we knew Hurricane María was coming, before the storm made landfall, the impact was far greater than we could have anticipated.

Ultimately, the storm tested the integrity of our business and our ability to be resilient. It also made me more aware than ever that resilience is probably the single greatest predictor of a company’s success.

Jon Fingas,"While there were no known casualties or property damage, this doesn't mean it was safe. For one thing, China normally plans booster drop zones carefully and alerts (or in some cases, evacuates) areas to make sure no one gets hurt. This didn't entirely go according to plan. Moreover, the highly toxic rocket fuel and secondary explosions posed risks to curious onlookers. Not that China has much choice in the matter. As the Atlantic explained, three of China's launch facilities were opened during the Cold War, when concerns about attacks took precedence over absolute safety. That meant setting up shop as far away from international borders as possible, guaranteeing that some launches would pose a risk to populated areas. A 1996 disaster even sent a rocket directly into the town of Xichang, killing at least six and injuring dozens more. China is building in safer areas (such as on the island of Hainan), but it could be a while before these sorts of incidents are a thing of the past.

Roger Cheng,"The intricate network of small metal pipes, capped off by six-foot-high metal scaffolding, shouldn't stand out amid the numerous pieces of industrial equipment littered throughout the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. After all, it's a power plant. 
I take a closer look, and notice spheres of ice perched upon the smaller pipes, which line the center of the structure. The facility sits at the water's edge, and there's a brisk breeze blowing through. 
Fixing Fukushima is a CNET multi-part series that explores the role technology plays in cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster in history.
But not that brisk.
It turns out, coolant is running through the pipes, freezing the soil below and creating an impermeable ice wall that's nearly 100 feet deep and a mile long, encircling the reactors.
It's like a smaller-scale subterranean version of the Wall in Game of Thrones, but instead of keeping out White Walkers and wights, this line of defense keeps in a far more realistic danger: radioactive contaminants from melted-down reactors that threaten to spill into the water by Fukushima Daiichi.
Daiichi is the site of the worst nuclear disaster, which happened after an earthquake hit on March 11, 2011, triggering a tsunami that devastated the facility. Two 50-foot-high waves knocked out the power generators that were keeping three of the six reactors' fuel rods cool, triggering explosions and meltdowns that forced more than 160,000 people to flee their homes. Many of them still haven't returned.
I came to Fukushima to check out the robots tasked with the near-impossible task of cleaning up Fukushima Daiichi.  While here, I encountered this underground wall of ice.
The structure, which cost roughly $300 million, paid for by public funds, serves as critical protection, defending the Fukushima area from one of the most radioactive hotspots in the world. While Tokyo Electric Power Co., also known as Tepco, struggles to find a way to remove radioactive material from the facility a process the government estimates could take more than four decades -- the more immediate concern is what to do with the contaminated water leaking out from the facility.
Nobody has taken on a project of this scale.
 Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit
One of the solutions has been to put up (down?) this underground ice wall, which prevents much of the surrounding groundwater from getting in. And while the practice of freezing soil to create a barrier has been around for more than 150 years, the magnitude of the application that stands before me is quite literally groundbreaking.
""Nobody has taken on a project of this scale,"" Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit, tells me through an interpreter.
Ice cold
While the term ""ice wall"" has a colorful ring to it, engineers use the more academic-sounding term Artificial Ground Freezing. The technique came out of France in 1862 as a way to help with the construction of mine shafts before German engineer F.H. Poetsch patented it. Since then, it's been used to aid in building underwater tunnels or vertical shafts, as well as to cut off groundwater or redirect contaminated materials.
Little balls of ice line the pipes that go underground and form the ice wall. 
James Martin/CNET
At Fukushima, my eyes follow the path of the pipes, which stretch around the reactor building. A Tepco employee tells me that a calcium chloride solution is pumped down through a smaller inner pipe, and circulated back up a large outer pipe.
The coolant brings down the temperature of each pipe to -30 degrees Celsius, or -22 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pipes are spaced about three feet apart. The cold emanating from each one hardens the soil around it.
The point of the ice wall is to keep the groundwater that runs down from the mountains to the west from entering Fukushima Daiichi and mixing with the toxic water leaking out of the Unit 1, 2 and 3 reactors. That is,  keep the clean water on the outside of the wall, while the contaminated water stays inside.  
Tepco and manufacturing partners, such as Toshiba and Mitsubishi, are working on robots to identify and determine how to clear out the radioactive materials in each of the reactors' primary containment vessels, essentially the heart of each facility.
Until then, they need a way to slow or stop the flow of water into the facility. At least initially, Tepco wasn't even sure if the project was feasible.
The coolant is -22 degrees Fahrenheit -- cold enough to solidify the surround soil.
James Martin/CNET
""One of the challenges was how they would inject the pipes into the earth at such a deep level without impacting the other operations around it, and whether it would work,"" Yagi says.
With the wall in place, Tepco says it has been able to reduce the level of contaminated water generated from Daiichi. But a Reuters report in March 2018 found that the wall still let a fair amount of clean water in, adding to the volume of toxic water the company needs to deal with. Tepco, however, says it's been effective in reducing the volume.
""We know this is not the end of our effort,"" says a company spokesman. ""We will be continuously working hard to reduce the amount of  generation of contaminated water.""
The leaky bucket
Imagine a leaky bucket that constantly needs to be filled with water. At the same time, the water from the leak needs to be collected and stored. And there's no end in sight to this cycle.
That essentially is the problem that Tepco faces at Daiichi. The fuel rods stored in the three radioactive units constantly have to be cooled with fresh water, but leaks mean the company needs to be vigilant about keeping the tainted liquid from getting out of the facility's grounds.  
The pipes go nearly 100 feet deep underground, and contain a coolant that freezes the soil into a wall. 
James Martin/CNET
Since the accident nearly eight years ago, Tepco has collected 1.1 million tons of contaminated water in 900 tanks stored on the grounds at Daiichi. The company estimates it has enough space in the 37.7-million-square-foot facility to house an additional 270,000 tons of water, which means it would run out sometime in 2020.
""We're conscious of the fact that we can't keep storing more and more water,"" Kenji Abe, a spokesman for Tepco's decommissioning and decontamination unit, says through an interpreter.
Tepco has worked on several solutions to decrease the level of contaminated water generated by the facility. The company has switched from tanks sealed with bolts to welded tanks, which offer greater storage capacity and less risk of leaks. There's a steel wall by the water to keep the contaminants from flowing into the ocean. Tepco has also covered 96 percent of the surface of most of the facility with concrete, preventing rainwater from seeping in.
Then there's the ice wall, which has done its share of lowering the amount of contaminated water generated from the facility by keeping out most of the groundwater.
Over the past three and a half years, Tepco has seen the amount of polluted water generated fall by a quarter to just under 3,900 cubic feet of water per day, with occasional spikes during periods of rainfall.
The final element
I'm in full protective gear, including a Tyvek coverall, hardhat and full-face respirator mask, walking through one of three water treatment facilities at Daiichi. I move hastily, trying to keep up with my Tepco guides, when my suit gets snagged on an exposed bolt.
Did the suit rip? My eyes shoot back at my photographer and widen with fear. This is usually the part in an outbreak movie that dooms a key character. I look down and see the suit is still intact, and breathe a sigh of relief.
Massive tanks of water litter the grounds of Fukushima Daicchi. 
James Martin/CNET
It turns out, I didn't need to panic. The facility, called the Advanced Liquid Processing System, isn't radioactive, although it's designed to remove radioactive elements from the collected water. There are three such facilities, which can process a total of 70,630 cubic feet of water a day.
So far, treatment technology from partner companies like Kurion and Sarry have enabled Tepco to remove 62 of the 63 radioactive elements from the water, but one, tritium, remains.
An inside look at Fukushima Daiichi's Ice Wall
It's this one element, which is bonded to the water at an atomic level, that means Tepco needs to keep collecting and storing the water.
Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco who previously served as acting director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the US Department of Energy, notes that reactors in China and Canada already discharge water with tritium.

James Martin/CNET
""It's fundamentally safe,"" Barrett says.
But given the sensitivities around Fukushima, Tepco must continue to store the water.
The Japanese government is still working out what to do.
""Resolving the issue of the contaminated water is something we haven't yet reached a final solution on,"" Yagi says.
Analyzing the data
Underneath the building housing the restaurant and employee rest area is a water treatment analysis center, a super-clean area that requires us to go through numerous radiation tests and four sets of boot changes.
There are glass beakers containing sea water, groundwater and water from the ALPS facilities. Scientists walk around in silence, moving beakers from one machine to another. A dozen machines in a second room measure the gamma ray levels.
Inside the water treatment center. 
James Martin/CNET
The facility was originally built underground in 2014 because it needed to be on the Daiichi site, but couldn't be exposed to radiation because of the nature of the tests. The walls are 8 inches thick, with the more sensitive labs hardened with an additional 20 inches. The facility has grown by 16 times over the past four years as it expanded the number of workers and machines.

James Martin/CNET
""No other facility in Japan can handle the amount of data and work we do here,"" says a Tepco scientist working at the facility who preferred not to identify himself.
He adds that all of the data is released publicly. ""That's because society demands work with a high level of trust,"" he says.
The scientist explains that Japan has set a legal radioactivity limit of 60,000 becquerel per liter of tritium. But the treated water is still at 1.7 million Bq per liter, or roughly 30 times what's deemed safe.
So, for now, Tepco must continue collecting the water. And the ice wall continues to stand, invisible to onlookers, as one of the most important lines of defense.","Think Game of Thrones, but this one is underground and defends against a far more realistic threat.",2019-03-05T13:00:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Fukushima's nuclear disaster defense?

Roger Cheng,"My nose itches. I instinctively reach up, but my fingers, wrapped in three gloves one made of cloth, two of latex hit the clear plastic shield of my full-face respirator mask. 
My hand clumsily holds a reporter's notebook and pen. I'm wearing white Tyvek coveralls over my trousers, shirt and head, which is capped off by a bright yellow hard hat.  I'm also wearing two layers of socks and heavy rubber boots. Walking around isn't easy, and the gear feels like an awkward second and third, and fourth skin. The claustrophobic gear seems straight out of a thriller about a zombie apocalypse. 
Fixing Fukushima is a CNET multi-part series that explores the role technology plays in cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster in history.
And then there's that itch I just can't scratch. 
There's a good reason for all that protection I'm inside the cavernous top of the Unit 3 reactor in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Yes, that Fukushima Daiichi, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. 
Unit 3 was one of three reactors crippled on March 11, 2011, after a 9.0 earthquake struck 80 miles off the coast of Japan. (Units 4, 5 and 6 at Daiichi weren't operating at the time.) The temblor shook so violently it shifted the Earth's axis by nearly 4 inches and moved the coast of Japan by 8 feet. Eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants throughout the region were operating at the time. All shut down automatically. All reported no significant damage.  
An hour later, the tsunami reached shore. 
Two 50-foot-high waves barreled straight at Fukushima Daiichi, washing over coastal seawalls and disabling the diesel generators powering the plant's seawater cooling systems. Temperatures inside the reactors skyrocketed to as high as 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Fuel rods became molten puddles of uranium that chewed through the floors below, leaving a radioactive cocktail of fuel rods, concrete, steel and melted debris. Molten fuel ultimately sank into the three reactors' primary containment vessels, designed to catch and secure contaminated material. 
Next Monday marks the eighth anniversary of the earthquake. After all this time, Japanese energy giant Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, has barely scratched the surface of the problem. It's cleared enough of the rubble on the top floor of the Unit 3 building to allow for my 10-minute visit. 
I gaze up at the massive barrel vault ceiling, trying to get a handle on the sheer scale of everything. Radiation levels are too high for me to linger. My quickening pace and breath are betrayed by rapid flapping noises coming from the purple filters on both sides of my respirator mask. 
At the far end of the room, there's an enormous orange platform known as a fuel-handling machine. It has four giant metal legs that taper down, giving the structure a sort of animalistic look. Thin steel cables suspend a chrome robot in the center of the frame. The robot, largely obscured by a pink plastic wrapper, is equipped with so-called manipulators that can cut rubble and grab fuel rods. The robot will eventually pull radioactive wreckage out of a 39-foot-deep pool in the center of the room. 
It's just one of the many robots Tepco is using to clean up the power plant. It's why I came to Japan this past November to see how robots are working in one of the most extreme situations imaginable. 
The Japanese government estimates it will cost $75.7 billion and take 40 years to fully decommission and tear down the facility. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency even built a research center nearby to mock up conditions inside the power plant, allowing experts from around the country to try out new robot designs for clearing away the wreckage. 
The hope is that the research facility along with a drone-testing field an hour away can clean up Daiichi and revitalize Fukushima Prefecture, once known for everything from seafood to sake. The effort will take so long that Tepco and government organizations are grooming the next generation of robotics experts to finish the job. 
Fukushima was a humbling moment. It showed the limits of robot technologies.
 Rian Whitton, ABI Research
""It's of the magnitude of putting a man on the moon,"" says Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco who previously served as acting director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the US Department of Energy. ""Unless there's an acceleration, I would not be surprised if it takes 60 years or so."" 
Everything's relative
There's something quintessentially Japanese about hearing the jingle to the 1970s anime classic Space Battleship Yamato while taking an elevator to the top of a nuclear reactor.   
CNET photographer James Martin and I lock eyes when the tune plays, stirring memories from our childhoods. It's a brief moment of whimsy in such deadly surroundings. 
Two years ago, Tepco erected a dome over the Unit 3 reactor and fuel pool so that engineers could bring in heavy equipment and now, us. 
Roughly 60 feet below me, radiation is being emitted at 1 sievert per hour. A single dose at that level is enough to cause radiation sickness such as nausea, vomiting and hemorrhaging. One dose of 5 sieverts an hour would kill about half of those exposed to it within a month, while exposure to 10 sieverts in an hour would be fatal within weeks. 
Unit 3 is the least contaminated of the three destroyed reactors.   
Radiation in Unit 1 has been measured at 4.1 to 9.7 sieverts per hour. And two years ago, a reading taken at the deepest level of Unit 2 was an ""unimaginable"" 530 sieverts, according to The Guardian. Readings elsewhere in Unit 2 are typically closer to 70 sieverts an hour, still making it the hottest of Daiichi's hotspots.   
Bundled up for a 10-minute visit to Unit 3.

The reactors' hostile environments brought most of the early robots to their figurative knees: High gamma radiation levels scrambled the electrons within the semiconductors serving as the robots' brains ruling out machines that are too sophisticated. Autonomous robots would either shut down or get snared by misshapen obstacles in unexpected places. 
The robots also had to be nimble enough to avoid disturbing the volatile melted fuel rods, essentially playing the world's deadliest game of ""Operation."" At least initially, they weren't.  
""Fukushima was a humbling moment,"" says Rian Whitton, an analyst at ABI Research. ""It showed the limits of robot technologies."" 
Robot love
Consider the Scorpion, a 24-inch-long robot that could curl up its camera-mounted tail for better viewing angles. In December 2016, workers cut out a hole in the PCV of Unit 2 for the Scorpion to enter. Tepco hoped the robot, with its two cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels and temperatures, would finally provide a glimpse inside the reactor.   
The Scorpion became stuck after just two hours in what was supposed to have been a 10-hour mission, blocked by lumps of melted metal. It had taken Toshiba over two and a half years, and an undisclosed sum, to develop the robot. 
Touring the Fukushima power plant requires a near-constant change of rubber boots. 
James Martin/CNET
""Even if the [Scorpion] failed in its mission, the data that we received from the robot has been beneficial,"" Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit, tells me through an interpreter, noting that engineers have since added guide pipes and other design elements to help new machines get around. 
Still, the failure underscores the inherent weakness of flashy robots with multiple parts versus simpler, purpose-built alternatives. ""They're trying to develop sophisticated technology without understanding the full solution,"" says an industry expert who isn't authorized to talk publicly about the decontamination process. 
Barrett lays part of the blame on Tepco's sole reliance on established Japanese manufacturers like Toshiba and Hitachi, saying the utility needs to embrace more of an experimental, Silicon Valley mentality. 
""Where's the long-haired kid with the body piercings?"" he says. ""You got to have one or two of them."" 
(For the record, I never saw anyone with long hair or body piercings on my trip.) 
 Success after failure 
Seven months after the Scorpion setback, in July 2017, Toshiba sent a small (12 inches long and 5 inches around) submersible robot, nicknamed Sunfish, into the flooded PCV of Unit 3. On its second day of reconnaissance, Sunfish Sunfish recorded the first signs of melted fuel inside a reactor. 
Toshiba returned to the heavily contaminated Unit 2 in January 2018 with a new machine carrying one camera that could pan and tilt and another attached to the tip of a telescopic guide pipe, offering a bird's-eye view. Once that machine reached the heart of the PCV, workers remotely lowered the pan-and-tilt camera an additional seven and a half feet to take photos. 
Some of the robots being used for reconnaissance missions inside Daiichi's reactors. 
James Martin/CNET
""This has to all be created to address specific challenges,"" says Takayuki Nakahara, a specialist for Toshiba who helped create the structure to lower the robot. 
The robot not only survived Unit 2's mega-radioactivity, it showed Tepco that the floor of the PCV held mud and pebbles thought to be melted fuel debris, adding new wrinkles to the cleanup task. 
In February, Tepco sent a modified version of the same robot back down, where it was able to touch some of the pebbles for the first time. The company said the robot was able to take more photos and get radiation and temperature readings without disturbing the surrounding environment.  
 Reconnaissance mission 
Hushed conversations echo from around the off-white control room in a building 350 meters (about 1,150 feet) from Unit 2. Bare ceiling pipes, office chairs and racks of computer equipment break up the otherwise sparse space. There's a quiet intensity from the nearly two dozen men. All wear jumpsuits color-coded to their company affiliations, like military officers preparing for war. 
Two special chairs have been outfitted with joysticks at the end of each armrest.

An operator in the other chair is controlling an iRobot Packbot, used in war zones and by first responders to clear explosive devices and detect biological, chemical and radioactive threats. 
But these robots aren't the standard-issue versions. Instead of its usual bucket claw, this Brokk 400D has a sensor to look for gamma ray hotspots. The Packbot comes with a camera to give the operator extra viewing angles. Both robots have been kitted with a lead-lined communication box. Fiber-optic lines connect that box to a special room next to the reactor room where workers use Wi-Fi to relay info to the control room. 
For those of us from Fukushima who live here, we try to live as we did before. 
This is only the second such mission, and it's strictly for reconnaissance. The two robots are on top of the Unit 2 reactor  not inside the PCV looking for radiation hotspots. Tepco hopes the information beamed back from the robots will eventually help it remove large chunks of fuel and wreckage from the top section of the reactor, making it possible for Unit 2 to get its own dome cover.

A suppression chamber stores much of the contaminated water from the PCV, and researchers are testing if remotely controlled robots can patch leaks from inside a chamber. 
Other areas include a large pool for testing robots underwater, and stairs that can be moved and adjusted to re-create a range of challenges that robots which tend to struggle with the basic tasks of going up and down steps will likely encounter. There's also an obstacle course for humans training to operate robots through tight pathways.

That's also true for the Robot Test Field, an hour's drive north of Naraha in Minamisoma, which sometime this year will include mock bridges, tunnels and other obstacles that drones can maneuver around. And in 2020, the area will host the World Robot Summit, with many of the exhibitions focused on disaster response and infrastructure support. The government of Fukushima Prefecture hopes companies from around the world will eventually come here to test their drones. 
 Ghost towns 
As you drive up the Rikuzenhama Highway from Naraha to Fukushima Daiichi, you can see the Fukushima region slowly coming back to life, including a local supermarket and police station in Tamioka bustling with activity. 
Get closer to the facility, however, and you find businesses and homes blocked by metal gates. They're in Futaba, Tamioka and Okuma, once-thriving communities near the power plant that were forced to evacuate.

That could change. The Japanese government now permits people to return for visits in the daytime. During our stay, the local newspaper ran a story saying former residents would be allowed to move back to some of the evacuation zones in May. 
""For those of us from Fukushima who live here, we try to live as we did before,"" says Shunsuke Ono, who runs the J Village hotel and sports complex in Naraha. ""For people outside of Fukushima, there's a feeling that Fukushima is not normal."" Ono says he doesn't feel in danger living in the area.

 Nature's power 
When the explosions blew the tops off Units 1 and 3, radioactive material contaminated the soil around Daiichi. The plant's once parklike surroundings have since been almost completely paved over to prevent rainwater from leaching into the contaminated soil and spilling out to the ocean. 
Tepco boasts that you can walk around 96 percent of the 37.7-million-square-foot facility with just the standard jumpsuit and disposable face mask.

Roger Cheng,"My nose itches. I instinctively reach up, but my fingers, wrapped in three gloves one made of cloth, two of latex hit the clear plastic shield of my full-face respirator mask. 
My hand clumsily holds a reporter's notebook and pen. I'm wearing white Tyvek coveralls over my trousers, shirt and head, which is capped off by a bright yellow hard hat.  I'm also wearing two layers of socks and heavy rubber boots. Walking around isn't easy, and the gear feels like an awkward second and third, and fourth skin. The claustrophobic gear seems straight out of a thriller about a zombie apocalypse. 
Fixing Fukushima is a CNET multi-part series that explores the role technology plays in cleaning up the worst nuclear disaster in history.
And then there's that itch I just can't scratch. 
There's a good reason for all that protection I'm inside the cavernous top of the Unit 3 reactor in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Yes, that Fukushima Daiichi, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. 
Unit 3 was one of three reactors crippled on March 11, 2011, after a 9.0 earthquake struck 80 miles off the coast of Japan. (Units 4, 5 and 6 at Daiichi weren't operating at the time.) The temblor shook so violently it shifted the Earth's axis by nearly 4 inches and moved the coast of Japan by 8 feet. Eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants throughout the region were operating at the time. All shut down automatically. All reported no significant damage.  
An hour later, the tsunami reached shore. 
Two 50-foot-high waves barreled straight at Fukushima Daiichi, washing over coastal seawalls and disabling the diesel generators powering the plant's seawater cooling systems. Temperatures inside the reactors skyrocketed to as high as 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Fuel rods became molten puddles of uranium that chewed through the floors below, leaving a radioactive cocktail of fuel rods, concrete, steel and melted debris. Molten fuel ultimately sank into the three reactors' primary containment vessels, designed to catch and secure contaminated material. 
Next Monday marks the eighth anniversary of the earthquake. After all this time, Japanese energy giant Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, has barely scratched the surface of the problem. It's cleared enough of the rubble on the top floor of the Unit 3 building to allow for my 10-minute visit. 
I gaze up at the massive barrel vault ceiling, trying to get a handle on the sheer scale of everything. Radiation levels are too high for me to linger. My quickening pace and breath are betrayed by rapid flapping noises coming from the purple filters on both sides of my respirator mask. 
At the far end of the room, there's an enormous orange platform known as a fuel-handling machine. It has four giant metal legs that taper down, giving the structure a sort of animalistic look. Thin steel cables suspend a chrome robot in the center of the frame. The robot, largely obscured by a pink plastic wrapper, is equipped with so-called manipulators that can cut rubble and grab fuel rods. The robot will eventually pull radioactive wreckage out of a 39-foot-deep pool in the center of the room. 
It's just one of the many robots Tepco is using to clean up the power plant. It's why I came to Japan this past November to see how robots are working in one of the most extreme situations imaginable. 
The Japanese government estimates it will cost $75.7 billion and take 40 years to fully decommission and tear down the facility. The Japan Atomic Energy Agency even built a research center nearby to mock up conditions inside the power plant, allowing experts from around the country to try out new robot designs for clearing away the wreckage. 
The hope is that the research facility along with a drone-testing field an hour away can clean up Daiichi and revitalize Fukushima Prefecture, once known for everything from seafood to sake. The effort will take so long that Tepco and government organizations are grooming the next generation of robotics experts to finish the job. 
Fukushima was a humbling moment. It showed the limits of robot technologies.
 Rian Whitton, ABI Research
""It's of the magnitude of putting a man on the moon,"" says Lake Barrett, a senior adviser to Tepco who previously served as acting director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management at the US Department of Energy. ""Unless there's an acceleration, I would not be surprised if it takes 60 years or so."" 
Everything's relative
There's something quintessentially Japanese about hearing the jingle to the 1970s anime classic Space Battleship Yamato while taking an elevator to the top of a nuclear reactor.   
CNET photographer James Martin and I lock eyes when the tune plays, stirring memories from our childhoods. It's a brief moment of whimsy in such deadly surroundings. 
Two years ago, Tepco erected a dome over the Unit 3 reactor and fuel pool so that engineers could bring in heavy equipment and now, us. 
Roughly 60 feet below me, radiation is being emitted at 1 sievert per hour. A single dose at that level is enough to cause radiation sickness such as nausea, vomiting and hemorrhaging. One dose of 5 sieverts an hour would kill about half of those exposed to it within a month, while exposure to 10 sieverts in an hour would be fatal within weeks. 
Unit 3 is the least contaminated of the three destroyed reactors.   
Radiation in Unit 1 has been measured at 4.1 to 9.7 sieverts per hour. And two years ago, a reading taken at the deepest level of Unit 2 was an ""unimaginable"" 530 sieverts, according to The Guardian. Readings elsewhere in Unit 2 are typically closer to 70 sieverts an hour, still making it the hottest of Daiichi's hotspots.   
Bundled up for a 10-minute visit to Unit 3.

The reactors' hostile environments brought most of the early robots to their figurative knees: High gamma radiation levels scrambled the electrons within the semiconductors serving as the robots' brains ruling out machines that are too sophisticated. Autonomous robots would either shut down or get snared by misshapen obstacles in unexpected places. 
The robots also had to be nimble enough to avoid disturbing the volatile melted fuel rods, essentially playing the world's deadliest game of ""Operation."" At least initially, they weren't.  
""Fukushima was a humbling moment,"" says Rian Whitton, an analyst at ABI Research. ""It showed the limits of robot technologies."" 
Robot love
Consider the Scorpion, a 24-inch-long robot that could curl up its camera-mounted tail for better viewing angles. In December 2016, workers cut out a hole in the PCV of Unit 2 for the Scorpion to enter. Tepco hoped the robot, with its two cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels and temperatures, would finally provide a glimpse inside the reactor.   
The Scorpion became stuck after just two hours in what was supposed to have been a 10-hour mission, blocked by lumps of melted metal. It had taken Toshiba over two and a half years, and an undisclosed sum, to develop the robot. 
Touring the Fukushima power plant requires a near-constant change of rubber boots. 
James Martin/CNET
""Even if the [Scorpion] failed in its mission, the data that we received from the robot has been beneficial,"" Hideki Yagi, general manager of Tepco's Nuclear Power Communications Unit, tells me through an interpreter, noting that engineers have since added guide pipes and other design elements to help new machines get around. 
Still, the failure underscores the inherent weakness of flashy robots with multiple parts versus simpler, purpose-built alternatives. ""They're trying to develop sophisticated technology without understanding the full solution,"" says an industry expert who isn't authorized to talk publicly about the decontamination process. 
Barrett lays part of the blame on Tepco's sole reliance on established Japanese manufacturers like Toshiba and Hitachi, saying the utility needs to embrace more of an experimental, Silicon Valley mentality. 
""Where's the long-haired kid with the body piercings?"" he says. ""You got to have one or two of them."" 
(For the record, I never saw anyone with long hair or body piercings on my trip.) 
 Success after failure 
Seven months after the Scorpion setback, in July 2017, Toshiba sent a small (12 inches long and 5 inches around) submersible robot, nicknamed Sunfish, into the flooded PCV of Unit 3. On its second day of reconnaissance, Sunfish Sunfish recorded the first signs of melted fuel inside a reactor. 
Toshiba returned to the heavily contaminated Unit 2 in January 2018 with a new machine carrying one camera that could pan and tilt and another attached to the tip of a telescopic guide pipe, offering a bird's-eye view. Once that machine reached the heart of the PCV, workers remotely lowered the pan-and-tilt camera an additional seven and a half feet to take photos. 
Some of the robots being used for reconnaissance missions inside Daiichi's reactors. 
James Martin/CNET
""This has to all be created to address specific challenges,"" says Takayuki Nakahara, a specialist for Toshiba who helped create the structure to lower the robot. 
The robot not only survived Unit 2's mega-radioactivity, it showed Tepco that the floor of the PCV held mud and pebbles thought to be melted fuel debris, adding new wrinkles to the cleanup task. 
In February, Tepco sent a modified version of the same robot back down, where it was able to touch some of the pebbles for the first time. The company said the robot was able to grip smaller pebbles with its hand-like attachment, as well as take more photos and get radiation and temperature readings without disturbing the surrounding environment.  
 Reconnaissance mission 
Hushed conversations echo from around the off-white control room in a building 350 meters (about 1,150 feet) from Unit 2. Bare ceiling pipes, office chairs and racks of computer equipment break up the otherwise sparse space. There's a quiet intensity from the nearly two dozen men. All wear jumpsuits color-coded to their company affiliations, like military officers preparing for war. 
Two special chairs have been outfitted with joysticks at the end of each armrest. A Tepco operator sits in one chair controlling a specially built Brokk 400D, a big blue bot that looks like a miniature excavator running on two large tank treads. He stares intently at four monitors giving him a real-time feed of what's happening inside the Unit 2 reactor.

STEVEN LEE MYERS and JAVIER C. HERNÁNDEZ,"“This is an oil spill of a type we haven’t seen before,” said Paul Johnston, a scientist at Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter in England. “Working out the impact is actually a huge task — probably next to impossible.” For China, the disaster has become a test of its ambitions as a global and regional steward of the seas, especially at a time when it is reinforcing its territorial claims, including disputed territories with Japan in these waters. Given its proximity, China has taken the lead in investigating the disaster and monitoring the spill, but it has faced some criticism for what some see as a slow and inadequate response thus far. Officials in Beijing announced on Feb. 1 that samples of fish taken within four to five nautical miles of the sunken ship contained traces of petroleum hydrocarbons, suggesting possible condensate contamination; they pledged to expand the range of testing to 90 miles, and closely monitor fish coming into markets. The threat of contamination has raised anxiety in the ports that cling to the rugged coastlines of Zhoushan’s islands, though such fears are usually expressed with quiet resignation lest one offend the government. “The quality will go down because of the oil in the water,” Hai Tao, a fish wholesaler at the International Aquatic Product City in Putuo, a district on Zhoushan’s biggest island, said as he watched a ship unload hundreds of crates of mantis shrimp, a delicacy headed to restaurants across China. The spill began on the evening of Jan. 6, when the Sanchi, a Panamanian-flagged, Iranian-owned tanker, collided with a cargo ship in waters roughly 160 nautical miles east of Shanghai. The Sanchi exploded and burned for more than a week before sinking. All 32 crew members are presumed dead. Katya Popova, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanography Center in England, said there had not been a sufficiently coordinated international operation, and that was exacerbating the scale of the disaster. The lack of visible devastation has almost certainly dampened public reaction that might have galvanized a more vigorous response.

JIM DWYER,"Over the years that followed, Chief Pfeifer created the department’s Center for Terrorism and Disaster Preparedness. A loss of control afflicts crime and terrorism victims alike, he said: “By making a difference, it’s gaining back one’s sense of being.” Some reforms turned out to be impossible or maddeningly slow or required black-belt-level bureaucratic judo. The police department agreed to routinely take fire chiefs along on flights over three-alarm blazes — but only, Chief Pfeifer said, after he made a deal with news organizations for chiefs to ride in their aircraft. Now commanders on the ground get video feeds from drones and the choppers. The real estate industry shut down an effort to require more exit stairs in new buildings because, as a city commissioner explained, “One inch on every staircase in every high rise is hundreds of thousands of dollars.” With the arrival of Bill Bratton as police commissioner in 2014, Chief Pfeifer said, an era of cooperation began. “The next mega-attack will come back to high-rises,” Chief Pfeifer said. Vertical terrorists will use guns and arson. Fire could hold off police officers, and guns would stop firefighters. “How do law enforcement, and fire, and medical, all operate together in very hostile environments?” he asked. His next stops are at Columbia and Harvard universities, teaching in crisis-leadership and disaster-preparedness programs.

It’s tragic that tragedy brings us closer together, but out of that we learn to depend on each other and work together,” he said. President Trump on Saturday approved a disaster declaration for California, which will make federal assistance available for Shasta County residents affected by the Carr Fire.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives ""Stranger Things"" has nothing on this. screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Ads are like phones. They come, they go and they affect the world not in the slightest. Then there's this insanely twisted, artistic oeuvre on behalf of the AGM X2. Chinese company AGM is renowned for creating rugged, durable phones. This ad, I feel sure, is one of the most durable ever made. We're in a hospital. A woman waits for news of her husband, who's clearly been undergoing surgery. A surgeon emerges to tell her that her husband is dead. She collapses with pain and grief. The surgeon has more to say: ""But I have good news for you."" Indeed, the good news is that the surgeon has digitized the consciousness of the husband's brain and inserted it into the fine, sturdy AGM X2 phone. You didn't think that was going to happen, did you? What follows is beautifully macabre and a wonderful indication of what your children's futures might look like. The (almost) widowed woman stares into her phone everywhere she goes, chatting with her husband. As you would too, if you were in these circumstances and technology allowed it. Her husband says he's doing remarkably well. Given that he lives inside the phone, he needs charging rather than food. And then, as if this woman hasn't already suffered enough, she drops her phone -- and her husband's brain -- in the river. She's bathed in grief all over again. This ad is cruel beyond measure. But then someone fishes the phone out -- did I mention these phones are said to be waterproof? -- and her husband is with her again. They go for a celebratory walk together and, naturally, take selfies. How he takes his selfie has to be witnessed in order to have truly lived. And then, as if the warped cruelty hasn't been enough, the woman is set upon by a gang of men whose leader seems to have had designs on her and is upset that she's married. Yes, this ad really is a soap opera all presented in just over three minutes. Yet again, the phone suffers punishment and ends up back in the river. (Well, you have to get those product points across, don't you?) Is this enough drama for you? A spokesman for AGM told me that, since it was released at the end of January, the ad has garnered more than 6 million online views on the mobile video platform MIAOPAI.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Additional details about the death were not immediately available. A spokeswoman for Cal Fire referred questions to Pacific Gas and Electric, which did not immediately respond to a request for more information on Sunday. The Carr Fire has claimed six other lives since it began on July 23, including those of a firefighter and a bulldozer operator. Melody Bledsoe of Redding, Calif., and her great-grandchildren, James Roberts, 5, and Emily Roberts, 4, died after the fire engulfed Ms. Bledsoe’s home. A sixth victim was found after the fire consumed the person’s home, Tom Bosenko, the Shasta County sheriff, said last week. Additional details on that death were unavailable.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright US NAtional Archives Image caption Islanders digging the graves at the Otranto Cemetery It is the whisky-making Scottish island, world famous for its peaty single malts and warm hospitality. But the isle of Islay, in the Inner Hebrides, is now being recognised for an almost forgotten example of huge courage and humanity. A hundred years ago, Islay was on the frontline in the battle at sea during World War One. The island coped with mass casualties from two major troopship disasters just eight months apart. Image caption The story featured on the front page of the American newspapers Between them, the sinkings of the SS Tuscania in February and HMS Otranto in October, claimed the lives of about 700 men in the last year of the war. Both will be officially commemorated on Islay this week. A century ago, the island was enduring considerable pain. It had already lost about 150 sons on the Western front, from a population of just 6,000. Image caption The American monument on Islay's bleak Mull of Oa Every household grieved for someone killed in a far away field. And then the carnage of war came to them. The Tuscania had almost completed its transatlantic voyage, carrying US troops, among a convoy of ships. As it turned into the north channel between Scotland and Ireland on 5 February 1918, danger lurked beneath the waves. Image caption The SS Tuscania was carrying more than 2,000 US troops when it was torpedoed off Islay A German U-boat stalked the convoy, got the Tuscania in its sights and fired two torpedoes - one of which ripped a huge gash in its side. It was a fatal blow. The former luxury liner, converted for the war effort, would soon be on the seabed. The Tuscania was carrying almost 2,500 US soldiers and British crew. Incredibly, most were rescued by the Royal Navy. But some of those who made it into lifeboats were not so lucky. They were swept towards the cliffs and rocks of Islay's Oa peninsula and shipwrecked for a second time. Image caption The troops were shipwrecked off the island's Oa peninsula Private Arthur Siplon was thrown into the sea when his lifeboat capsized. ""He thought he was going to die,"" his youngest son Bob told me. ""But at last he grabbed hold of a rock and when the sea receded he managed to hang on and climbed to the shore."" Image caption Arthur Siplon was rescued from the sea by two Islay farmers Private Siplon was rescued by one of two Islay farmers who risked their own lives pulling men to safety. Robert Morrison and Duncan Campbell gave food and shelter to dozens of survivors and were later awarded the OBE. I have reason to feel particularly proud of Duncan Campbell because, while researching this story, I discovered that he was my great, great uncle. Image caption Duncan Campbell was Glenn's great, great uncle Bob Siplon knows that he and his family would not exist if his father had not found help on Islay. ""It's like the actions of those people 100 years ago ripples through time to affect me 100 years later. ""It tells me that what we do makes a difference"" he said. This was a massive disaster for a small island to manage. In 1918, Islay had no electricity, no air service and few motor vehicles. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption The funeral on Islay of 199 American soldiers who were victims of the Otranto disaster The civil authority on this almost crime-free island was a police sergeant on a bicycle, called Malcolm MacNeill. Sgt MacNeill and his three constables had to recover, identify and bury the remains of almost 200. Image caption Sergeant Malcolm MacNeill was the police sergeant on the almost crime-free island His grandson - former Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson - considers their task on a scale comparable with recent terrorist attacks. ""This is like Lockerbie (air disaster) or 7/7 or even 9/11 occurring in a small community. ""A huge event taking place with deaths, bodies, survivors - the calamity that was involved"". Image copyright US National Archives Image caption The funeral of the American soldier victims of the Otranto disaster was attended by all the locals Despite their trauma, the islanders worked tirelessly to bury the dead with dignity. They did not have an American flag for the funerals, so a small group of locals hand-stitched one from the materials they had - working late into the night. That flag has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, which is sending it home on loan to Islay for the centenary. Image caption The US flag made by Islay locals is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC The Smithsonian's Jennifer Jones is impressed by the care the islanders showed for the American soldiers washed up on their shores. ""It was very heartfelt, that people went out of their way to respect those who had recently lost their lives"" she said. Islanders pulled together to respond to the Tuscania sinking. What they could not know is that this was only a preparation for a much bigger disaster to come. Like the Tuscania, HMS Otranto was carrying US troops across the Atlantic in a convoy when disaster struck. But it wasn't an act of war that sank the Otranto on 6 October 1918, within weeks of the armistice. It was a navigational error in a storm. Image caption The HMS Otranto was carrying US troops across the Atlantic when disaster struck As the convoy approached the west coast of Scotland in near hurricane conditions, there was confusion over their exact position. The Otranto was rammed by another ship in the convoy - HMS Kashmir - which ripped its steel hull wide open. The Kashmir and the rest of the convoy sailed on, under orders not to give assistance for fear of U-boat attack. Image caption HMS Kashmir rammed into the Otranto and ripped its hull wide open Despite the ferocious weather, the Royal Navy destroyer, HMS Mounsey came to the rescue under the command of Lieutenant Francis Craven. ""In my viewpoint, Captain Craven was a real hero. Perhaps the real hero of the event"" said Chuck Freedman, whose grandfather, Sam Levy, was on the Otranto. Lieutenant Levy was among almost 600 soldiers who successfully jumped for their lives on to the deck of the Mounsey. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption Funeral of the victims of the Otranto at Kilchoman on Islay Many others tried and failed and were crushed to death between the two ships. By the time the Mounsey left the scene there were still hundreds of men aboard the sinking Otranto. Their best hope was to be swept towards one of the beaches on Islay's Atlantic coast. But that wasn't to be. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption Searching in the wreckage for bodies of victims of the US troopship Otranto The Otranto was lifted by a huge wave and dumped down onto a reef that broke its back and tore the ship to pieces. Only 21 men made it ashore alive. Some were pulled from the sea by members of Donald-James McPhee's family. They were shepherds and used their crooks to reach survivors - the length of their staffs, the distance between life and death. But this was largely a recovery operation with bodies piling up along the coast. Image copyright US National Archives Image caption American soldiers laid out for burial in the churchyard at Kilchoman ""It must have been so sad for them to see that"" said Mr McPhee. ""Waking up in the morning to a normal day's work and hundreds of dead bodies by the evening. It must have been horrendous."" Sergeant MacNeill painstakingly recorded the details of every body washed ashore, in a notebook which now has pride of place in the Museum of Islay life. Many of the victims were from the US state of Georgia, which is planning its own commemorations later this year. Image caption Sergeant MacNeill painstakingly recorded the details of every body washed ashore Some of the 700 victims of the Otranto and Tuscania disasters were never found. The majority were buried on Islay. After the war, the remains of the American soldiers were exhumed and returned home. Image caption Only one US serviceman is buried on Islay Image caption A monument was erected the year after the disaster Only one American - private Roy Muncaster - is still on the island. At the request of his family, he was left to rest where the people of Islay buried him. In 1918, the Tuscania disaster represented the biggest single loss of US military lives since the American civil war. Image caption Islay's rugged coastline was a difficult place to be shipwrecked The sinking of the Otranto accounted for some of America's heaviest losses at sea during the 1914-18 war. Yet the stories of these ships are not well known - lost perhaps in a century of Islay mist. There is a large lighthouse-shaped memorial on Islay's bleak Mull of Oa. But when I was growing up on the island, the troopships were rarely talked about. That's changing. Today, every child at my old school - Bowmore primary - is learning about them. On Friday 4 May, Princess Anne will lead commemorations on Islay to mark the centenary of these twin tragedies. These events will honour those who lost their lives and honour what the people of Islay did for those in peril on their shores a hundred years ago.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Included in the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal is a “bold new approach” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides low-wage working families, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities assistance with buying food. Under the plan, those who receive at least $90 a month from SNAP (the vast majority of recipients) would get about half of their benefits in the form of a “USDA Foods package,” which would include “items such as shelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit, vegetables, and meat, poultry or fish” (in other words, no fresh food). Overall, the budget proposes cuts of $213 billion over ten years to the program. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP aids 40 million people, around 70 percent of which are in families with children. More than 25 percent of participants are in households with seniors or people with disabilities. Currently, SNAP recipients receive a loaded EBT debit card, which they can spend at grocery stores and other authorized retailers. Recipients cannot buy alcohol, cigarettes, vitamin supplements, hot foods or non-grocery household items (like toilet paper or diapers) with the money. The administration writes that this is a “cost-effective approach,” but it’s easy to see how this could be a disaster for people with any type of food allergy, as well as for people who do not have homes or addresses at which they can receive the boxes—and how it could ratchet up costs, considering all of the packaging and shipping costs involved. On Twitter, Annie Lowrey, an economic policy writer for The Atlantic, lays out some very good questions it appears the administration hasn’t fully considered. For example, what happens if there’s a snowstorm or hurricane? More fundamentally, “do poor folks deserve to get to choose their own food?” It’s a good thread worth considering in full.","Included in the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal is a “bold new approach” to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides low-wage working families, low-income seniors, and people with disabilities assistance with buyin…",2018-02-13T21:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",Some Questions About Trump's New SNAP Proposal,https://twocents.lifehacker.com/some-questions-about-trumps-new-snap-proposal-1822964950,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--o8-u4HxK--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jvobwmaqvmp1as14aque.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,1
BeauHD,"If you talk to experts on election security (I studied with several of them in graduate school) they'll tell you that we're nowhere close to being ready for online voting. ""Mobile voting is a horrific idea,"" said election security expert Joe Hall when I asked him about a West Virginia experiment with blockchain-based mobile voting back in August. But on Tuesday, The New York Times published an opinion piece claiming the opposite. ""Building a workable, scalable, and inclusive online voting system is now possible, thanks to blockchain technologies,"" writes Alex Tapscott, whom the Times describes as co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute. Tapscott is wrong -- and dangerously so. Online voting would be a huge threat to the integrity of our elections -- and to public faith in election outcomes. Tapscott focuses on the idea that blockchain technology would allow people to vote anonymously while still being able to verify that their vote was included in the final total. Even assuming this is mathematically possible -- and I think it probably is -- this idea ignores the many, many ways that foreign governments could compromise an online vote without breaking the core cryptographic algorithms. For example, foreign governments could hack into the computer systems that governments use to generate and distribute cryptographic credentials to voters. They could bribe election officials to supply them with copies of voters' credentials. They could hack into the PCs or smartphones voters use to cast their votes. They could send voters phishing emails to trick them into revealing their voting credentials -- or simply trick them into thinking they've cast a vote when they haven't.","An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: If you talk to experts on election security (I studied with several of them in graduate school) they'll tell you that we're nowhere close to being ready for online voting.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Before jumping to how we handle crises and potential catastrophes, let's first consider more routine situations. Think about when you were last in a meeting, hammering out a new plan or strategy for your organization. Did team members keep pressing to get ""the right answer,"" and, when finished, did they bask in all that was good about it? Or rather did they unleash their most aggressive, destructive, diabolical thinking in order to stress test their ideas and identify weaknesses?
Related: Why Every Entrepreneur Must Be Prepared for Tough Times
More likely than not, they pushed for the pristine ""right."" Even if they (inadvertently) discovered problems and potential stumbling blocks along the way, team members probably didn't dig to figure out causes and corrective actions. Instead, they brushed off the possibility of an obstacle materializing with a, ""Oh, that'll never happen,"" or they dismissed it with, ""We'll figure it out on the fly.""
The fact is, problems happen all the time. But, when we have the greatest ability to address them with ample lead-time and lower costs -- when our ideas are still conceptual and haven't yet been acted on -- we don't.
It's a missed opportunity. Our brains have wondrous capacity for creative thinking and problem solving. Trouble is, they're incredibly slow at those functions, and most crises develop far faster than we can figure out what to do, so we get overwhelmed. Without the skills to manage the situation, we flee, fight or cower.
But, that's not inevitable. So, how might leaders and organizations ensure their teams are capable of responding in the event of a disaster?
Related: 3 Steps Effective Leaders Take When Dealing With Crisis
For starters, they can and should commit time in development processes to stress test plans to identify breaking points. Macabre imaginations are needed -- what if the emergency room loses power? What if a flock of geese cripple both airplane engines? What if market conditions shift against the team's investment strategy? Once they have their scenarios, they need to generate appropriate alternatives and then aggressively ""war game"" those to find flaws. The goal is to help make the team be ready for abnormal situations.
It's this approach that saved the day for Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and writer for The New Yorker. In an interview, he describes removing a patient's adrenal gland laparoscopically, a procedure he'd performed dozens of times; but this operation was more complex. The patient's tumor was behind his liver and burrowed firmly against his vena cava, the vessel that pumps blood to the heart.
Before the surgery, the team developed a list of what could go wrong and prepared how they'd react. For instance, the anesthesiologist arranged to have blood made available for transfusion just in case. And good thing. As Dr. Gawande detached the tumor, he nicked the patient's blood vessel, and the patient began bleeding seriously. Disaster was averted because the team's preparations meant the patient could be sustained while the hole was repaired. The patient survived, not because of impromptu heroism but because the team searched for and planned for the worst.
Deliberative thinking and fine-tuning emergency reactions in advance is critical; so, too, is practicing those responses. Take, for instance, what happened in July 1989 when United Airlines flight 232 had a mechanical failure in its tail engine that cost the plane its hydraulic controls. Such a failure had been completely catastrophic on other flights. Fortunately for UA 232, flight instructor Dennis Fitch was onboard, and he had rehearsed how to fly only with the engine throttles. He guided the crew to a controlled crash landing. More than half the passengers survived -- the death toll would have been much worse otherwise.
Related: Culture Makes or Breaks a Company When Crisis Hits
Leaders play a critical role in ingraining these behaviors. Because we humans are consumed with status, hierarchy and a need for self-esteem, it's not natural to seek flaws in our thinking -- particularly not with our colleagues' help. Instead, we want validation that our thinking is sound, and we get defensive if we're challenged. Put simply, once we've invested time and energy in an idea, we lose sight that what's important is not the plan itself, but how it'll work when put to use.
A friend, who works for an investment firm, bemoans that his analysts develop investment strategies and then ""pitch"" them to colleagues, emphasizing all that's good, while evading all concerns. They could take a different approach: Presenting the proposal as the product of their best thinking but then soliciting criticism. Better to be wrong in the conference room than in the market, after all.
To combat this tendency, leaders -- including my friend -- must demonstrate and coach team members how to articulate (and accept) misgivings, so that everyone can feel comfortable raising a hand and saying, ""This isn't going to work,"" or, ""What if we tried something different,"" or ""I'm having trouble tracking this.""
Things will go wrong -- sometimes at crisis level. However, catastrophe need not be the inevitable outcome if we aggressively seek faults in our thinking and correct them before they become faults in our doing.",How might leaders and organizations ensure their teams are capable of responding in the event of a disaster?,2018-12-20T15:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",Preempt Crises by Aggressively Seeking Solutions Before Problems Occur,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324662,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181214225051-GettyImages-680316391.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,1
Catie Keck,"It has not been an especially great week for Netflix or its polarizing monster flick Bird Box, which has spawned one of the most idiotic so-called challenges to surface in this cursed timeline were trapped in. In yet another public relations headache for the company, Netflix is now looking into whether actual footage of a deadly 2013 event in Canada appeared in Bird Box after it was discovered in at least one other production.
According to the Canadian Press, an early Bird Box scene involving a newscast about a mysterious phenomenon resulting in mass suicides appears to depict real footage of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster, one of the worst rail incidents in Canadas history. The incident occurred in the Québec town after a train transporting crude oil derailed and exploded, leaving 47 people dead.
Footage of the incident was recently discovered in an episode of the latest season of the science fiction series Travelers, which was produced by Toronto-based Peacock Alley Entertainment. The production companys president Carrie Mudd told the Canadian Press it got the imagery from stock footage supplier Pond5, whose spokesperson Tina Witoshkin told BuzzFeed News the footage was taken out of context and used in entertainment programming.
Pond5 apologized for the obvious oversight, telling BuzzFeed News that it deeply regret[s] that this happened and sincerely apologize[s] to anyone who was offended, especially the victims and their families. Mudd said in a separate statement that Peacock Alley Entertainment had no intention to dishonour the tragic events of 2013.
Both Mudd and a Netflix spokesperson reportedly told the Canadian Press that the images would be removed from the episode of Travelers in which they appear; as for Bird Box, Netflix told the outlet that it was investigating whether the footage shown in the film does indeed depict the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster.
Its not clear if the footage of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster has been used in other productions on the platform. However, as BuzzFeed News noted, Netflix was accused earlier this month of using footage from another fatal train crash that occurred in Belgium in 2010 in its film Death Note.
Bird Box has created some unique hassles for Netflix in recent weeks, not the least of which include the extremely moronic Bird Box challenge, which involves wearing blindfolds while wandering around and (in particularly unfortunate cases) operating a vehicle. The challenge recently prompted YouTuber Jake Paul to idiotically dash through traffic with his own eyes covered, a stunt he (of course) later uploaded to the platform. (At least YouTube seems to have pulled the cord on that mess.) Netflix has since asked that people please not do this.

Nearly 1,600 people died when Mount Agung last erupted in 1963. So far, there have been no changes to flights in the region despite the eruption.

Media caption Survivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted Villagers near the mount were first told to leave in August when it started rumbling but were later allowed to return home. Since then the mount has been rumbling intermittently. Many of those who returned home have now been ordered to leave and stay overnight in village halls and temples a safe distance from the volcano. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent seismic and volcanic activity. According to official estimates, the holiday island of Bali lost at least $110m (£83m) in tourism and productivity while locals were moved to shelters. However, the island's airport remains open with no changes to flights, and tourist areas are safe according to Indonesia's disaster agency.

Leigh Anderson,"Last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report a klaxon, reallywarning of the catastrophic consequences of climate change if global political leaders dont take action right now. For people whove been sounding the alarm for decades now, this report is depressing but not surprising; for those of us whove not paid as much attention to the science as we should have, the report is a blaring wake-up call. No matter which group youre in, though, the path forward is clear: We need to pressure our elected leaders, corporations, and even our friends and neighbors to change our ways or we will be witnessing rising sea levels, natural disasters, war, famine and a refugee crisis the likes of which the world has never seen. As the New York Times writes, the world must utterly transform its energy systems in the next decade or risk ecological and social disaster. The first thing that someone can do, says Michael Brune, the executive director for the Sierra Club, is to remember that you have power. In the face of enormous, apparently intractable social problems, individual action can seem puny and inconsequential. (And indeed, just 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which can make your rinsing out your tuna cans seem like an absurd bit of private theater.) But collectively we actually can slow climate change: The first thing that someone can do, says Michael Brune, the executive director for the Sierra Club, is to remember that you have power. As a citizen, a consumer, an investor, as a human being, you have the power to effect really great change. Heres how to get started. By 2030, we as a collective 7 billion humans will know our fate, or at the very least, the fate of Read more Read Know Where Your Elected Officials Stand If you think that everyones pretty much on board with the fact of climate change, youre in for a rude awakening: More than half of Congress are climate-change deniers (and are largely, but not exclusively, Republicans). Want to see how enlightened your rep is on the issue? Check out this handy list of all the climate-change deniers in Congress. You know the drill: Call, write, email, protest, and above all, vote. Communicating with the people that are supposed to represent you in government can sound like a Read more Read Focus on State and Local Government Municipalities, collectively, might be able to do more than Washington. After President Trump decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, a coalition of mayors pledged to meet the targets anyway. As Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City who coordinated the effort, writes in the Times, More than 130 American cities have joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, and all are determined to see that we meet our Paris goal. Start going to your city council meetings, or at least follow the reporters or environmental advocates who are covering those meetings. Does your city have a sustainability office or a committee on the environment? Does your local university have a sustainability office you can communicate with about local efforts? If you truly turn up nothing, check out the Climate Resilience Toolkit for step-by-step instructions on addressing climate change in your community. Who you vote for for mayor, or whos on your city council, is really important, says Brune. If you want your community to be powered by clean energy, you need to vote and agitate at the local level. The world is warming. Theres no longer any doubt of that. With a new report breaking down exactly Read more Read Brune also points out that governors who believe in and are addressing climate change have made more economic opportunity for their constituents: see New Jersey, Illinois, California, Massachusetts. So hold your governors feet to the fire and volunteer for the candidates you think have the best handle on the climate change/economic-opportunity intersection. For a quick way to check out how a federal candidate leans, go to the Sierra Clubs endorsement page. For state and local races, contact your local chapter of the Sierra Club some states offer legislative scorecards. Take Action Yourself The very first thing you have to do is take action yourself, says David Miller, the North American regional director for the C40 cities climate leadership group. When you talk to your elected officials and they ask, well, what are you doing? you want to have a ready answer. Do you take transit? Can you make choices in your own personal transportation? If you drive, can you take transit even one day a week? If you take transit, can you walk more, can you bike more?...Can you choose an electric vehicle over a gas-powered vehicle? Miller acknowledges that your personal action will depend on your personal circumstances, but that collectively these decisions can have a huge impact. A new report from the United Nations offers a terrifying and stark forecast of the immediate Read more Read You can ask yourself the same questions about dozens of relatively small lifestyle choices: Can you eat a more climate-friendly diet? Can you cut down on meat and animal products? (This doesnt have to mean going fully vegetarian or veganyou can just go reducetarian. Really, if you can just limit or eliminate beef and pork youd be doing a lot. ) Can you waste less food and compost the scraps? Food waste is a huge contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Is there a compost program [in your community? says Miller. Can you organize with others to push your municipal representatives to do something? Can you stop with all the disposables? I love a ziplock bag and a big cup of coffee as much as the next parent, but I try really hard to use reusable containers for lunches and to bring a to-go cup for coffee. If you want to get fanatical about never buying something, make it bottled water, a scourge upon the planet. Can you, in general, just buy less stuff? Especially plastic toys, for kids, which arent usually recyclable and arent in play for very long, anyway. The holidays are comingwhat if you gave and asked for experiences instead of things? Youd probably be happier. Can you make your home more energy-efficient ? Can you find out if your workplace is energy-efficient? If youre thinking about buying a new car, can you test drive a Bolt or a Prius ? Do you really need a car at all? Can you lobby for better transit and cycling lanes in your town or arrange a car pool with fellow commuters or parents? Who are you doing business with? Dont support banks that arent investing in solutions, says Brune, specifically calling out Bank of Americas support for fracking. Switch to a socially responsible bank. If you have investments, consider impact investing. Want more ideas, from the very easy dont put stuff on your car roof? to the even easier replace your lightbulbs? Check out these suggestions from the Natural Resources Defense Council. These efforts might seem inconsequential, like rinsing out the tuna cans, above, but if youre also leaning on your friends and neighbors, and your employer, and your local government, small actions will start to snowball. And regarding those 100 companies that are the big villains in climate change, Miller points out that changing your behavior to not support environmentally-damaging sectors of the economyby, for example, choosing public transit over carsyou are effecting change. Youre making choices with your pocketbook. A million small choices add up. For the one thousandth time, an authoritative new report tells us with great certainty thatif we Read more Read Influence Your Friends and Neighbors Speaking up actually matters, says Miller. Building a political movement requires knowledgeable, engaged people who work together on an issue. If fighting climate change is your new passion, or even your old passion, dont keep it to yourself. And you dont have to take a finger-wagging tackstart with the positive: So many things are happening that are inspiring, says Miller. This is a movement that is based on making lives better. You can talk about how great electric cars are now, or how much youre enjoying the health benefits of cycling and dont want to be hit by a car (this is my personal strategy) or how cities around the world are buying fleets of electric buses. There are about a million reasons why we should eat less meat, considering its effects on our own Read more Read Its important to influence our elected officials, of course, but as the saying goes, there go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader. Changing representatives minds means changing their constituents minds. The most important thing to influence elected officials is a general understanding amongst people that something is the right thing to do, says Miller. This is also where Facebook activism comes ineven if youre just posting about what changes individuals can make, you might influence someone to re-think what kind of car they need, or even if they need a car at all. This doesnt have to mean scare-mongering or guilt-trippingkeeping a positive and helpful tone is critical. The posts from friends that make me listen usually involve events, like fundraising bike rides or postcard-writing partiesfun things that make activism social. Were doomed is not going to inspire anyone to do anything. The earth is getting warmer. Thats a fact. And as the earth gets warmer, we expect to see larger Read more Read Start With Your Personal Interests and Your Own Community I confess that while I have always been aware of climate change and vaguely hoping that politicians would do something, it hasnt been my number-one issue. But lately Ive gotten into cycling, and so follow a lot of transportation-alternatives types on social mediawhich has changed how I think about cars, transit, and cities...which in turn has changed what I talk about with friends. A lot of people come to this topic through their own personal perspective, says Brune: grandparents who want their children to have a future that isnt impoverished because of climate change, parents and teachers who organize to have a strong science-based curriculum in schools. Brune says, A lot of people may be more conservative politically, but they run a company or theyre active in the private sector, and want to make an economic argument in favor of taking action on climate change....We have seen people who organize through their church, to make a moral argument for why we should take stronger action in favor of clean energy. Weve seen all these things be effective in their own right, but when they are coordinated together, you have a cacophony of voices all calling for stronger leadership. So are you into education? Check out Climate Parents, follow the National Science Teachers Association, and attend your local school board meetings to find out what the science curriculum is in your kids school. Are you into gardening? Research how to get started with composting. Catholic? Read what the Pope has to say on climate change. (Jewish? Covered. Episcopalian? Covered.) Are you an engineer or architect ? Are you an African-American person who wants to get into camping, or a Latino person who wants to connect with nature ? Are you queer and interested in backpacking ? I am going to guess that no matter your identity, hobbies, interests, or passions, you can hook up with some group that is enjoying nature and fighting climate change. My personal next steps? Start going to my local meetings about transportation alternatives, and re-considering my banking. If youre stumped, look for your local chapter of the Sierra Club, or just find your greenest friend on Facebook and ask what to do. Weve got a decade to turn things around, so pour yourself a coffee in a reusable mug, make yourself a vegetarian snack, and start planning. The future depends on it.","Last week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report—a klaxon, really—warning of the catastrophic consequences of climate change if global political leaders don’t take action right now.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A tsunami that slammed into the beaches of Indonesias Sunda Strait over the weekend has reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least 429 people.
While the cause is still unclear, scientists believe the event may have been caused by underwater landslides resulting from volcanic activity on the island of Anak Krakatoa. Saturdays tsunami struck the neighboring islands of Java and Sumatra without warning, sending people running for their lives. Horrifying video captured the wave slamming into a beachside concert, collapsing the stage as it plowed through to the audience.
Speaking with the Guardian, Dougal Jerram of the department of geosciences at the University of Oslo said tsunamis resulting from volcanic activity may not trigger warning systems that are designed to alarm after large quakes, and thus may provide little warning, unless observed directly or detected by other devices such as wave buoy warning systems.
Hundreds of homes and dozens of hotels were damaged in the disaster, and thousands of people have been displaced. More than 1,400 people were injured, CNN reported Tuesday, and dozens are still missing. The U.S. State Department said it is continuing to monitor the situation and that it is not aware of any U.S. citizens directly affected, but stand ready to assist as needed.
The U.S. Geological Survey, an agency that would normally provide data on the disaster, saw a massive staff reduction resulting from the government shutdown that could last through the new year and has stalled some operations. The Huffington Post reported the agency is operating with only 75 of its roughly 8,032 employees.
Authorities previously cautioned people in the area to avoid beaches around the Sunda Strait, per Reuters, noting a high-tide warning in place through Christmas Day. Residents were again warned on Monday to stay away from beaches over the possibility that another tsunami could strike.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of Indonesias National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said that it is warning people to remain cautious, according to CNN. Nugroho added: Agencies are still continuing to analyze the root cause ... the Krakatau volcano continues to erupt, which could potentially trigger another tsunami.

MALCOLM ROBERTS,"So, are you worried now? Probably not. Thus, humans continue to take chances. And when they get away with them, they take more chances. Conversely, when they lose, they learn. Unfortunately, they usually learn only when they lose. Given this conundrum, I propose that we in the insurance/disaster management world try something new. We need to find ways for people to encounter disasters without actually living through them. We call it pre-experiencing disaster. Were trying this at my workplace for clients and would-be clients. We create six-story controlled warehouse fires and trigger actual explosions. We simulate hurricanes, floods and cyberattacks. We have a platform that mimics the motion of an earthquake and shows how violently and unpredictably a building will move, and even rotate, when the ground shakes. Our visitors feel the heat from the fire. They cringe as a two-by-four hurtles across a room in a simulated hurricane. Their bodies absorb the concussion of an explosion. When they leave, they seem converted. We need to do this kind of education in a broader way that reaches people and businesses in vulnerable communities, places that face threats from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, flooding and wildfires. In schools, we need to weave disaster and denial stories into classes on physics, earth science psychology, engineering, finance, statistics and the building trades. We need to find ways to tell the stories of people who suffered because of their denial, and who survived because they took the right precautions and built in the proper safeguards. Communities at potential risk should bring in engineers and emergency workers to point out what could fail, wash away, freeze, rot, short-circuit, explode, shatter, cave in or burn up.","United Cajun Navy volunteers make their way to a house to rescue a family stranded by rising floodwaters in Wilmington, N.C., on Sept. 15, 2018.",2018-10-11T16:14:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why We Ride Out Life-Threatening Storms and Do Other Crazy Things,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/opinion/hurricanes-disasters-denial-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/11/opinion/11roberts/11roberts-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Nick Stockton,"Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, Donald Trump flew to Puerto Rico, toured a relatively affluent neighborhood there, and expressed his relief that the storm had not been “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina. He jokingly chided Puerto Ricans for throwing the federal budget a “little out of whack.” In reality, Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, and the federal disaster response on the island was, at that point, a fraction of what residents of Florida and Texas had received during the same hurricane season. The government of Puerto Rico recently published a report estimating the storm's death toll at 1,427 people, more than 20 times the previous estimate. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the storm and its aftermath ultimately killed more than 4,000. If the federal government’s response to Maria was a scandal, the tech industry’s initial reaction seemed, comparatively, like a source of hope. In the days after the disaster, a small groundswell of private tech enthusiasm furthered the notion that Puerto Rico ought to become a test bed for renewable, distributed, climate-­resilient infrastructure. Companies like Alphabet and Tesla, which were already working on the island, looked like they might be poised to make this idea a reality. Later, a different set of tech entrepreneurs descended on Puerto Rico as well, enticed by tax breaks to advance other, more esoteric techno-​utopian visions. Here’s a progress report on how tech has, and hasn’t, managed to come to Puerto Rico’s rescue. Alphabet For years, Alphabet’s X (formerly known as Google X) has been working on a project called Loon, which provides cell service to remote areas via giant balloons. And it just so happened that one of the company’s two launch facilities for those signal-­slinging balloons was located in Ceiba, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast. So the company deployed a handful of the floating antennas, blanketing the island with text and data service for more than 250,000 customers of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T for four months while parts of the electrical grid were down. Tesla Two weeks after the storm, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla had a track record of building decentralized electrical infrastructure—independent solar and battery systems—on small islands. “There is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” he said. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” Since then, updates have come mostly in the form of more tweets. In April, Musk reported that “Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at 662 locations in Puerto Rico.” Then in June he tweeted, “We have about 11,000 projects underway” on the island. Tesla has declined to clarify what that means or how many Puerto Ricans are served by those projects. The Blockchain Crowd Over the past year, about 150 cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have settled on the island, according to Giovanni Mendez, a tax lawyer who has helped many of them. They’ve been drawn in part by incentives, passed in 2012, that give tax exemptions for capital gains and passive income to individuals who spend at least half their year on the island, and by an amendment, passed just months before Hurricane Maria, that eased requirements on US companies to hire Puerto Rican residents. One of the new arrivals was the cryptocurrency guru and former child actor Brock Pierce, who promptly said he was setting out to build a utopian community—perhaps even a whole new city—on the island, to the ire of many Puerto Ricans.

Jason Schreier,"The Disaster Artist, the incredible true-ish story behind the making of one of the worst movies of all time, came out in theaters earlier this month. Allow me and Gita to tell you why it’s fantastic. Jason Schreier: Gita, today we are going to talk about The Disaster Artist, which might be my favorite movie of the year. Before we even start, though, I want to do some table-setting. In 2003, a man named Tommy Wiseau released a movie called The Room that ostensibly told a dramatic story of a rich banker who was betrayed by his girlfriend, but was so terrible, people couldn’t help but laugh the whole time. In the following years, The Room turned into a viral sensation, attracting Rocky Horror Picture Show -esque crowds that would go and dress up as their favorite characters and shout along with lines on screen. People were fascinated by Wiseau, who wrote, directed, financed, and starred in the film. His long, black hair, strange accent, and wooden acting captivated people in inexplicable ways. Who was this dude? In 2013, The Room actor Greg Sestero co-wrote a book with journalist Tom Bissell (who, I should disclose, is a good friend of mine) about the film’s tortured development. Turns out that Tommy Wiseau might be a sociopath! That book, The Disaster Artist, is full of insane details and anecdotes not just about the horrors and abuses that went into the making of The Room, but about Sestero’s complicated friendship with Wiseau. The book captivated James Franco, who made a movie about it (also called The Disaster Artist ) that’s now in theaters. Franco plays Wiseau, and his brother Dave Franco plays Sestero, and just like the book, the movie tells their entire story, from when they first met at an acting class to the conception and production of The Room. I arrived late to this whole party (and still haven’t even seen The Room, although I’ve watched enough clips to have a feel for it), and before we talk about The Disaster Artist, I want to hear your origin story - when did you first see The Room ? Gita Jackson: I remember reading some piece of longform journalism about The Room when I was in college. I was a cinema studies major, and at the time really into the improv-based comedy from the Judd Apatow crew of writers and performers. I think even then, Franco was a part of that group of collaborators, and the article was about how these comedians found this absurd movie and grew to love it. I wish I could remember who wrote this! It really left an impression. [Note: It’s this one !] Anyway, The Room had already become a bit of phenomenon among cinema nerds online for the depth of its ineptitude, so I found a copy and more or less forced some friends to watch it with me on a tiny laptop screen in my dorm room. I think this was maybe 2011? After we watched the movie for the first time it set off this chain reaction. Every weekend I would host a new group of friends to watch The Room in my dorm room. We watched it every weekend for a month or two. Jason: EVERY weekend? How many times did you watch it? Gita: I have seen this movie a lot of times. Maybe ten or fifteen times? I’ve been to a few midnight screenings as well. There is just such a depth to its ineptitude. That said I haven’t watched it for a few years now. Jason: Amazing. The Room superfan Gita Jackson over here. OK, so did you read The Disaster Artist as soon as it came out? Gita: I didn’t! My then boyfriend bought it and told me he’d let me borrow it after he was done. Then we broke up, and it got added to the long list of books I wanted to read but didn’t have time to. I finally read it this year—actually, listened to the audio book, which I knew was the only way I’d finally get to experience it. I’m a busy lady Jason. Jason: Busy watching The Room fifteen times, yes. Gita: Ha! Jason: To get a sense of just how magnetically awful this movie is, I’ll direct people to this video roundup of the highlights: Jason: When you were watching it, did you ever wonder just how it got made? Gita: Oh absolutely. I mean, there’s a real love for movies in The Room, but absolutely no skill whatsoever. It’s also simultaneously too expensive looking for what it is, and too cheap looking to be believed as a movie. So many of the conversations me and my friends had about this movie were just, “Who the hell is Tommy Wiseau?” Jason: And now we have the answer — well, some of the answers to that question with The Disaster Artist. James Franco does an incredible, Oscar-worthy job of playing this man, who wants so badly to be an actor but doesn’t have the talent to pull it off. As we see in the film, Tommy Wiseau might be the most insecure person on this planet. Part of him thinks he’s James Dean, and another part of him thinks that the entire world is out to get him. The Room, which tells an incoherent story about a man who is betrayed by his lover and his friends, seems more than anything to be an autobiography. Gita: There’s a scene in The Disaster Artist where two characters are talking about what each character in The Room is a representation of in Tommy’s actual life. They decide that Lisa, the girlfriend who betrays the main character, is a representation of what the whole world is to Tommy. If there’s anything that encapsulates the whole story of The Room and Tommy Wiseau in general, it’s that. The more I think about Lisa as a character the sadder The Room gets as a movie. As a representation of “the world,” she fickle and cruel. It just makes sense to me that this is how a person like Tommy Wiseau, who believes he has never done anything wrong, would see literally all of humanity. Jason: Yeah, and it makes you sympathize with him, because clearly he’s dealt with some serious tragedy in the past. Like, was he betrayed by a woman like Lisa? Did something even worse happen to him? But then you watch the way he deals with other people — he berates them on set, screaming and criticizing (especially the women) and refusing to have the basic decency to even get them water — and it’s hard to feel too bad for the man. Another thing that’s interesting about The Disaster Artist (the film) is that it’s a character study of Tommy Wiseau that doesn’t actually tell us very much about Tommy Wiseau. We don’t know where he came from, we don’t know how old he is, and we don’t know how he got the $6million+ it cost to make The Room. These questions are all posed at multiple points in the movie, but never answered, much to the characters’ frustration and amusement. Gita: I thought it was so smart to leave that hanging for the audience. By the end of the movie, I felt like they were unimportant questions even if they were the things that the movie had hooked us with. Through his relationship with Greg you see that he’s just a sad, lonely person. His weird idiosyncrasies are a symptom of his desire to relate to other people. Wiseau is definitely a nightmare boss—a woman fainted on set because he wouldn’t get AC!—but by the end you just want him to get a win. Even if that means not forcing him to confront the ways in which he is frustrating or vague or impenetrable. The book ends just as the lights go down on the first screening of The Room, whereas the movie goes beyond that, and shows both the audiences’s reaction and Tommy having to deal with the weird, amazing, horrible thing he’s made. I don’t know if you felt this way, but there’s a part of me that liked how the book hung on the inevitability of what The Room would become. At the same time, I did like actually seeing Wiseau make some kind of attempt at humility. Jason: Yeah the movie couldn’t just end without asking Wiseau to reconcile his own delusions with how people actually reacted to the film, and it needed to put a bow on his friendship with Sestero. Meanwhile, in real life, Wiseau apparently paid to keep The Room in theaters for two weeks so it would qualify for the Oscars. And now, thanks to The Disaster Artist, we might see James Franco as Tommy Wiseau win an Oscar? I hope he brings the real Wiseau. You said on Twitter that you think Wiseau will murder Franco as a result of this movie, but I actually had the opposite feeling — I think Wiseau loves this. Suddenly, everyone knows who he is! Gita: I don’t know. I want to agree with you, and I hope that he does see it that way. Maybe he did actually learn something from the experience of making The Room and has grown up a bit. But the stories that Greg Sestero tells about Wiseau in The Disaster Artist are terrifying. Most of them were cut from the movie, which makes sense. Sestero’s personal history as an up and coming actor isn’t strictly necessary for the story the movie is telling. The one story of how Wiseau kicked Sestero out of his apartment really fucked me up though. He takes Greg on a drive, speeds down busy Los Angeles streets, screaming at him, all for the crime of… telling a friend that he was staying at Wiseau’s apartment. I want to believe that he’s not that bitter and paranoid right now. But as much as I think Tommy Wiseau likes the attention, there must be a little part of him that’s angry that Hollywood only accepted him when he was played by James Franco. That said, I want him to come to the Oscars. I need that. I watch every year and for once I want it to be interesting. Jason: Oh man, that’d be a GOAT Oscar moment. Franco in Wiseau makeup accompanied by the real Wiseau. I need that to happen. So let’s talk about The Disaster Artist a bit more, maybe offer some spoiler-free thoughts for people who might be on the fence about seeing it. I thought it was both hilarious and poignant, the rare comedy that really leaves you thinking about the people you just watched on screen (which I think is a byproduct of it being (basically) non-fiction — how many non-fiction comedies are there??). I would recommend it even to people who haven’t watched The Room (since I haven’t watched The Room !) because it gives you the gist of that film as you watch. The Disaster Artist is precise, well-crafted, and incredibly fun. Gita: Wow, you haven’t watched The Room ? Huh. I guess it is kind of past its cultural moment. I don’t even really know if you “need” to see The Room to know its impact on American comedy television and film anymore. Anyway yeah, I agree. I think this is the best movie about Hollywood that Hollywood has produced in the last few decades. It’s just a sincere love letter to acting and movies and being a movie star—all the things Wiseau wanted and kind of got in the end. What struck me is that it’s not just so, so funny, but also a really genuine movie. There’s nothing ironic about Tommy Wiseau, even though the culture of liking The Room is often soaked in irony. Tommy Wiseau just loves movies, but making movies is hard, and is often as unfair as he makes it out to be. Despite being a movie about failure, I found it pretty heartwarming. Tommy Wiseau didn’t get the happy ending he wanted, but he did get one. Even if he can be a real piece of shit, it felt nice to see him just get one good thing in life. Jason: Good points all around, and man, this has all left me so conflicted about Wiseau. He’s one of the most interesting people on the planet, and I appreciate that The Disaster Artist (the film) tells his story with a TON of empathy. But also, he’s a psychopathic asshole and he hurt a lot of people. Is this really a person we should be celebrating? Is this really someone we should be feeling bad for? It’s sort of like when the New York Times ran that puff piece about the white supremacist a few weeks ago - Tommy Wiseau obviously isn’t that hateful or extreme, but he’s not a good guy! Should we really be feeling happy that at the end of the day, he’s getting the fame and (semi-)success he wanted? Gita: I wish that the movie had been more frank about how Tommy Wiseau really tortured and berated Juliette Danielle, who played Lisa. He often reduced her to tears on set, and a lot of his criticism was about her body. That is absolutely indicative of the how women are treated in Hollywood in general, but that doesn’t absolve Wiseau of being horrible to a woman every day basically because he felt like it. I am really glad The Room exists, and I’m happy to know the story of how it was made. I think The Disaster Artist as a book leaves a little more ambiguity about how you should feel about Tommy, where the movie is definitely on “his side.” I understand that, because it’s also clear that he’s an incredibly damaged person, who has also been hurt and abused. I guess if I have one criticism of the movie it’s that they smooth away some of Wiseau’s very jagged edges. Jason: The book, by the way, is equally excellent. The writing is sharp and fun, and it includes a ton of anecdotes that didn’t make it into the film, including a very detailed recreation of Wiseau’s pre-United States history that may or may not be true. In general, I think we both agree that everyone should go watch and read The Disaster Artist, because it’s a compelling look at one of the most fascinating people on this planet. Yes? Gita: Yes! Definitely, definitely see it. And honestly if you don’t have time to read it, the audiobook is narrated by Greg Sestero and his Tommy Wiseau impression is unreal. Jason: Better than James Franco’s? Gita: Honestly? yes. Jason: Daaamn. OK sold.","The Disaster Artist, the incredible true-ish story behind the making of one of the worst movies of all time, came out in theaters earlier this month.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

Scott Jones,"Once again, the California Legislature has passed a public safety disaster under the misguided guise of criminal justice reform. Senate Bill 10 would eliminate cash bail in California, but that’s not all. Remember when Proposition 47 reduced many felonies to misdemeanors, including commercial burglary and theft of a firearm? This bill — currently on Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk — mandates that nearly all those arrested for misdemeanors who make their way to jail be released within 12 hours, even those arrested for failing to appear in court. The bail system in California admittedly needs attention. Bail — a constitutional right that is only intended to secure appearance in court rather than as punishment — is too high in most cases and applied with little regard to a defendant’s financial situation. Those issues need to be addressed, and risk assessment definitely has a place, but the outright elimination of cash bail is foolish. In fact, in rare agreement, law enforcement groups, the ACLU and the NAACP are all opposed to this bill. But the Legislature is undeterred. Currently in Sacramento County there are more than 59,000 outstanding warrants for defendants who have failed to fulfill their legal obligations. Law enforcement agencies seldom have the opportunity to look for them and drag them to court. On the contrary, the bail industry has a very high success rate in getting their clients to court because they or their families have a personal stake. If they fail to appear, the bondsman will find them and return them to court. Notably, this occurs without any cost to taxpayers or any burden on law enforcement or the court. If the governor signs SB 10, warrants for failing to appear for court will skyrocket, and California will continue its descent from accountability for criminality. This bill is just another in a long series of stay-out-of-jail and early release programs, and will not accomplish its purported goals. We can expect more defendants who are immediately released to choose not to show up for court, which means that those with a propensity for criminal behavior will be able to practice their trade unimpeded. This means yet more crime and more victims. As usual, when the Legislature substitutes its judgment for those of the experts on public safety, it is the rest of us who are forced to pay the price. Further, like most criminal justice reforms during recent legislative sessions, SB 10 will require significant new spending to develop oversight, metrics and supervised release programs. This money does not exist in a vacuum; it will have to be taken from other programs and services. I strongly urge Gov. Brown to veto this bill, and instead develop a program that doesn’t push public safety aside, but rather balances it with the rights of the accused in a fair, safe way.","Sacramento Bee Gov.

 Streaming service Netflix has apologised for the incident
Streaming service Netflix has said it will remove footage of a real-life rail disaster from the film Bird Box.
The company confirmed in January that the popular thriller contained a brief clip from Canada's deadly Lac-Mégantic tragedy. 
The excerpt was used early in the film to depict a fictional news story about an apocalyptic scenario. 
Netflix had initially said it would not substitute the footage in question. 
In a brief emailed statement to the BBC on Thursday, the company confirmed that, along with the filmmakers of Bird Box, it has decided to replace the clip. 
""We're sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Mégantic community,"" the statement said, without giving a reason for changing its decision. 
Over 45 people were killed in 2013 when a train carrying crude oil derailed in the Quebec town of Lac-Mégantic. Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed.
The process to replace the clip worldwide with an outtake from a TV series will take several weeks, the company said. 
In January, Quebec's culture minister wrote to the CEO of Netflix urging the company to have the clips removed. 
On Twitter on Thursday she wrote that the streaming service's change of heart ""demonstrates that by staying united and working together, anything is possible"". 
Bird Box was not the only Netflix production containing images of the deadly runaway train disaster. 
Similar footage was found to have been used in the Canadian-American science-fiction drama Travelers.
In the show's third season, images of Lac-Mégantic's blazing downtown core could be briefly seen illustrating fictional news coverage of a nuclear attack in London. Those clips were later removed. 
At the time, the stock footage vendor that provided the production company behind the show Travelers said it deeply regretted the footage being ""taken out of context and used in entertainment programming"".
It said would contact customers who had purchased any related clips to make them aware ""of the sensitive nature of this footage"".",Netflix to remove real disaster footage from Bird Box film BBC News Streaming service Netflix has said it will remove footage of a real-life rail disaster from the film Bird Box.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said. 
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years: 
- 2004: A massive 9.1 magnitude quake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh. 
- 2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April. Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra. 
- 2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people. 
- 2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province. More than 1,100 people were killed. 
- 2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people. 
- 2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami. No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings. 
- 2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island. 
- 2018: More than 2,000 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi island.","A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said.",2018-12-25T04:45:59Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Factbox: Indonesia regularly hit by quakes and tsunamis,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-tsunami-factbox-idUSKCN1OO06D,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181225&t=2&i=1338773568&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEEBO04J,reuters,Reuters,1
Derek Johnson,"Derek Johnson is the executive director of Global Zero, the international movement for a world without nuclear weapons. He is a nuclear security expert and lawyer with a background in international law. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN) President Donald Trump announced during a campaign stop in Nevada that he would terminate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was used to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons. This was probably the first time most folks had ever heard of this Reagan-era arms control agreement that helped end the Cold War and kept Europe stable for a generation. Which may explain why the American public is not yet reacting to this disaster with the level of panic it deserves. It's tempting to think of treaties as little scraps of paper collecting dust on a historian's bookshelf. Interesting, if you're into that sort of thing, but largely irrelevant. The INF Treaty is something else entirely: This scrap of paper is a powerful leash, one of the few things restraining Russia and the United States (which together hold around 92% of the world's nuclear weapons) from arms-racing us all into oblivion. Hammered out by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, this agreement you've never heard of sent thousands of midrange nuclear missiles to the scrap heap. The INF Treaty was central not only to stopping but reversing the most dangerous military buildup in history: It cleared the way for a series of deals that brought global nuclear stockpiles down from their estimated peak of 70,300 weapons in 1986 to the 14,485 that remain today. For 30 years, Reagan's historic achievement largely held fast -- until Trump. Yes, over the past few years, American and Russian officials have accused each other of developing weapon systems that violate the INF Treaty. It's a legitimate and troubling dispute. But that's what diplomacy is: the ongoing management of legitimate and troubling disputes. Where the Obama administration tried (and failed) to resolve these concerns, it's not clear Trump or his senior team have actively tried to engage their Russian counterparts about it. Trump's decision to flip the table and storm away is predictable but in no way sensible. It may even morph this dispute into a full-blown nuclear crisis. Why? Because shredding the INF Treaty won't make the Russians behave -- it just absolves them of responsibility and shifts blame for the breakdown to the Americans. It also kicks open the door for the United States and Russia to deploy a greater number of the weapons systems at issue, which puts even more cities at risk. This issue may well surface at Trump's potential meeting next month with Vladimir Putin in Paris, but it would take a dizzying U-turn by the United States -- and a willingness on Russia's part to appear outfoxed -- to keep the treaty intact. I wouldn't hold my breath. This is hardly the first international accord the Trump administration has upended. From the Universal Postal Union to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement, this President has acted as a wrecking ball to the liberal international order. In its place churns an illiberal chaos. Nowhere is that chaos more dangerous than in the realm of civilization-ending nuclear weaponry. Instability gives rise to unpredictability, which can rapidly metastasize into miscalculation and catastrophe. It's difficult to overstate the stakes. From the early days of the campaign, Trump has worn his nuclear ambitions on his sleeve. He openly questioned why these weapons should not be used, called for a "" massive expansion "" of the nuclear arsenal, pressed the Pentagon on a tenfold increase in warheads, rejected a golden opportunity t o maintain limits and inspections of US-Russian strategic arsenals, and developed an extreme plan that calls for building new, more ""usable"" nuclear weapons. The United States, he has often said, must have the biggest, baddest arsenal on the planet. Nuclear stability and reductions are to be replaced with nuclear dominance, no matter the cost or the consequence. If this landmark INF Treaty is allowed to collapse, the only other restraint on Trump's and Putin's nuclear ambitions will be New START, a 2010 agreement that further limits Russian and American nuclear arsenals equally and puts inspectors on the ground in both countries to verify these limits. That agreement is set to expire in 2021 and, like most things negotiated or completed by Obama, is already under assault by hardliners in the administration -- and Trump himself. Look, I get it. There's a lot going on in the country right now, a lot of fires that need to be put out. It's hard to know where to focus when all of it's so urgent. But listen to me when I tell you that the most important guardrails on the planet are falling off. The international system put in place to protect us from the buildup of nuclear weapons -- weapons designed to kill millions of people in seconds, and poison whole nations for generations -- is crumbling. If we don't get this right, we're not going to get a chance to fix anything else.","President Donald Trump announced during a campaign stop in Nevada that he would terminate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which was used to eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons.

Angela Johnson,"McFarland hired media company Jerry Media to promote the festival. According to Oken Aks, a former Jerry Media employee who worked on the Fyre Festival campaign and was interviewed in the Hulu documentary, Jerry Media was behind the endorsers, Instagram posts, and hype, and if it weren't for their marketing campaign, Aks doesn't think the festival would have become as big as it did.
 The company's founder Elliot Tebele tweeted after the documentary that he was still owed over $150,000 from McFarland. Tebele also tweeted that he ""gave every dollar [his] agency earned from the festival"" to a now nonexistent GoFundMe for a local Bahamian caterer featured in the Netflix documentary who said she was not paid for her work on the Fyre Festival and so she paid her employees with her own money. 
 But F--- Jerry's role in the festival has been talked down by Mike Purzycki, the CEO of Jerry Media.

Jon Fingas,"In order to get Dawning Engrams, you have to complete event-specific quests. No big deal, right? There's just one problem: you can only earn three of those engrams per week, one up front and two through challenges. And that's per account, not per character. Even if you play every day and get perfect, non-duplicate drops (which you won't), you'll only get a fraction of the 59 items available during The Dawning's 3-week run. You can buy gear with the game's free Bright Dust currency, but it's hard to earn in any significant amount. In short: if you don't pay real cash, most of this content will disappear forever (or at least, until the next holiday). Players have griped about cosmetic engrams and the Eververse marketplace ever since Destiny 2 launched (and really, since Eververse first appeared in the original game ). However, the holiday event has amplified those complaints, with many arguing that Bungie should either drop Dawning engrams during ordinary activities (and thus increase your chances of getting it for free) or ditch Eververse outright. Bungie is aware of the outcry, but just what it'll do remains to be seen. Game Director Christopher Barrett said that developers ""hear your feedback on Eververse,"" and agrees that players should ""feel respected."" The team is unsurprisingly on a holiday break, though, and an update on what's next will come ""after the new year."" That is, you might not see a change in strategy until after The Dawning ends on January 9th. While that wouldn't be a disaster (The Dawning itself has plenty of activities), the underlying problems might only be fixed when it's too late to earn the gear you really want.","Bungie has already learned some hard lessons about making content accessible in Destiny 2, but it's clear the studio still has some brushing up to do.

"Andrew Dana Hudson, Milan Shrestha, Andrew Dana Hudson, Milan Shrestha","Imja Tsho is identified by the government of Nepal as one of three potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the country. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. In the Himalayas, as in a lot of places, the impacts of climate change have a “gradual until they aren’t” quality. Rising temperatures melt more of the snowpack that collects on peaks like Mount Everest. This water trickles down, filling into dips in the mountain landscape to form high-altitude glacial lakes. Slowly, as the planet warms, these lakes grow. Sometimes they grow too big. Glacial lakes are often penned in with moraines—loose accumulations of rock and regolith shoved into piles by the slow movements of glacial ice. Bigger lakes put more hydrostatic pressure on their moraines. Occasionally this pressure is enough to push through the unsteady sediment, or an avalanche or earthquake may perturb the moraine. There’s no way to know for sure when this will happen, but there’s no mistaking the results. The icy, dirty water will widen the gap until the lake can drain out of the moraine with startling speed. The lake water flows downhill, often with enough force to wipe out roads, fields, even whole human settlements unlucky enough to be built in the path of the flood. This phenomenon is called a glacial lake outburst flood, or the unceremonious GLOF for short. It’s a rare event, but one of increasing concern in our age of weather chaos and shifting landscapes. GLOF events can be deadly and can wash away the livelihoods of fragile rural communities. The stakes are high, but the risks are complicated and hard to assess. And so, as with climate-impacted areas all over the world, talk turns to mitigation and relocation—discussions that inevitably surface deep social and emotional contradictions. Society everywhere has struggled to respond to climate impacts, even as the science becomes more clear. Nepal’s Khumbu Valley, in the Mount Everest region, sits in the shadow of a glacial lake called Imja Tsho. Imja Tsho contains 2.6 billion cubic feet of water—a number that grows by the year. For the people of Khumbu, the fear of what might happen if this water were unleashed is not wholly abstract. In 1985 another glacial lake above the valley, Dig Tsho, burst on a sunny August afternoon. The flood wrecked several villages and killed three people. More glacial flooding in Khumbu accompanied the devastating 2015 earthquake. Following these events, experts began an assessment of GLOF risks in the country and the likely costs of various GLOF disasters. This study placed Imja Tsho at the top of the list, with an astonishing $11 billion potential price tag. So what do people do about a water bomb dangling over their heads? Answering that turns out to not be simple. Recently, social scientists (including one of us, Milan Shresthra) have joined the engineers and physical scientists studying the Imja Tsho problem and are in the process of completing a survey of how residents of Khumbu Valley perceive the GLOF threat. The researchers were surprised to find that while 45 percent of the respondents considered GLOF a major threat to their life, no one was planning to relocate to get out of the flood zone. This is a contradiction that bears some consideration. Much of our narrative about climate change unfolds on two different time scales: Ever-unprecedented hurricanes appear suddenly to flood Houston and batter Puerto Rico, while rising seas gradually swallow island nations like the Maldives. How do we deal with slow-moving but hard-hitting dangers like GLOFs, which defy this easy dichotomy? Often the answer lies in a tangle of a social and psychological frictions we are only beginning to unravel. Religion and cultural belief systems have great influence on how many people perceive threats—often intermingling perceptions of natural and supernatural forces. When we experience disasters over which we have little control, we often turn to spiritual connections for explanation, consolation, or relief. For instance, Sherpas’ religious and spiritual culture does not conflict with scientific claims about the climate, but their worldview does influence how they engage with the local landscape. Spirits are said to inhabit the lakes and the mountain terrain, and this tradition comes into play when experts propose large-scale engineering projects to mitigate threats, such as the 2016 emergency draining at Imja Tsho by the Nepalese army, which lowered the lake by about 11.5 feet to reduce GLOF dangers. Khumbu Valley is also considered a sacred sanctuary, and this attachment complicates suggestions that Sherpas should relocate out of danger. Other conundrums lie in the way individual calamities compete with one another—and with the daily requirements of economic survival—for our headspace. Many of the locals surveyed listed another major earthquake, like the one that hit Nepal in 2015, as their biggest disaster concern—despite the presence of a potential GLOF right above their homes. Does this mean that experience trumps proximity? As the threats brought by climate change pile up—erratic rain and snowfall, or prolonged droughts that threaten Himalayan subsistence agriculture—how will people rank and prioritize their responses? What’s the point of moving to escape one threat if it puts us in greater danger from another? This potential for paralysis makes planning long-term adaptation and mitigation projects difficult to muster community support for. Chheplung Village in the Mount Everest region. And of course some are unwilling to relocate simply because they don’t feel that they have alternatives. They have homes, jobs, crops. Many are invested in making the most of opportunities that come with the booming Everest tourism industry. And so a calculation must be made: risk dying in a flood or give up assets that may take years or even generations to recoup. We’re already in the disaster. We live in a world where the stakes of economic survival feel equal to any physical struggle for life and death. These stakes become more real through the erosion of social safety nets, the private capture of public goods, the visions of inequality in global media that let us know where we really stand. Call it precarity. Call it the Anxiety. Call it what novelist Amitav Ghosh names The Great Derangement —the difficulty modern humans have acting on slow-moving dangers. Society everywhere has struggled to respond to climate impacts, even as the science becomes more clear. Action on climate change will require deeper and more nuanced engagement with individuals and communities that aren’t attuned to the unique threat that phenomena like GLOFs represent. And we will need a deeper understanding of fear: as more than just the instinct to flee, but as a dread that can be lived with because the disaster is everywhere.","In the Himalayas, as in a lot of places, the impacts of climate change have a “gradual until they aren’t” quality.

Patrick Rucker,"FAIR BLUFF, N.C. (Reuters) - When Hurricane Matthew submerged the small town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, two years ago, Eve Waddell thought she had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime disaster. “You’ll never see that again,” she reassured her daughter Ella, then 4, after floodwaters surged over the banks of the Lumber River, inundating Fair Bluff with several feet of water and damaging her house. As Hurricane Florence barreled toward the state on Wednesday, Waddell packed up her family to seek shelter with relatives and said she was ready to leave town for good - just as many businesses and hundreds of residents did after Matthew in 2016. “This old town’s had it,” said her husband, Anthony Spivey, the police chief in a nearby municipality. Meteorologists warn the menacing storm could stall out over the Carolinas, dumping enormous amounts of rainfall and creating massive flooding. That was the case with Matthew, a less powerful hurricane that did most of its damage inland, producing catastrophic levels of flooding throughout low-lying eastern North Carolina and causing billions of dollars in damages. Rural, low-income communities like Fair Bluff - already beset by economic difficulties - were hardest hit and remain most at risk this week. Approximately 125 miles (200 km) south of Raleigh, Fair Bluff is 38 percent white and 60 percent African-American, with a median household income of $17,000, according to state figures. Its downtown district has been a virtual ghost town since Matthew, with a dozen empty storefronts still bearing the marks of the storm’s fury. A grimy scar cuts across retail windows, marking the height of the flooding. In a furniture shop, neatly arranged bedroom sets moldered; an abandoned hardware store was still stocked with ovens, washing machines and refrigerators. Before the storm, Fair Bluff had nearly 1,000 residents, said Al Leonard, the town’s part-time administrator. He estimated more than a quarter left and have not returned since Matthew. “We base our calendar on B.C. or A.D.,” Leonard said. “In Fair Bluff, they base their calendar on Before Matthew and After Matthew. Matthew changed everything.” Eve Waddell, daughter Ella, 6, and her husband, acting police chief of Chadbourn, North Carolina, Anthony Spivey, take stock out in the backyard of their home ahead of Hurricane Florence in Fair Bluff, North Carolina, U.S., September 12, 2018. REUTERS/Patrick Rucker RURAL DEVASTATION Other rural communities around the state’s eastern half tell a similar story. Lumberton, a larger nearby town of approximately 21,000 people along the Lumber River, saw nearly 900 homes severely damaged by Matthew, including hundreds of low-income renters who lost their residences, according to a state report. In Princeville, known as the oldest community settled by freed slaves in the United States, hundreds of homes were severely damaged by flooding from the Tar River. The agricultural community of Goldsboro, along the Neuse River, saw hundreds of homes and substantial livestock destroyed. Many low-income communities were already buffeted by a decline in manufacturing and agriculture, as well as the aftermath of the 2007-09 recession, according to Barry Ryan, vice president of the nonprofit NC Rural Center, which helps support rural counties. “These communities are aging rapidly,” he said. “There’s been a general market downturn - somewhat driven by population loss, somewhat driven by economic restructuring.” Jeff Axelberg, a member of Fair Bluff’s Chamber of Commerce who markets sweet potatoes, said the farmers he works with are worried because Florence is arriving so early in the season, with only about 10 percent of the crop in. “They’re working day and night to get what they can out of the ground,” he said. Long-term solutions are elusive. Some in town have suggested recruiting a canoe operator or other tourist draw to Fair Bluff, turning the river from a liability into an opportunity, Axelberg said. Residents and business owners have often found it challenging to navigate state and federal bureaucracies in search of recovery and repair funds. In many communities, homeowners are only now starting to receive money through the state’s hazard mitigation grant program to sell, elevate or rebuild their homes. The smallest towns are also hamstrung by a lack of administrative capacity. Leonard, Fair Bluff’s administrator, also serves as the town’s water system supervisor, town planner and budget director. He spends one day per week in Fair Bluff because he also holds the position of town administrator for four other nearby municipalities. On Wednesday, he watched as laborers laid brick for a police office extension off the back of Fair Bluff’s town hall, which officials moved to just outside the flood zone after Matthew. “Last time, this was high ground,” Leonard said. “We’ll just have to wait and see.” Reporting by Patrick Rucker in Fair Bluff, North Carolina; Additional reporting and writing by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Lisa Shumaker","When Hurricane Matthew submerged the small town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, two years ago, Eve Waddell thought she had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime disaster.",2018-09-12T23:55:42Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Looming Florence heaps despair on rural U.S. towns ravaged by 2016 storm,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence-rural/looming-florence-heaps-despair-on-rural-u-s-towns-ravaged-by-2016-storm-idUSKCN1LS398,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180912&t=2&i=1303730513&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE8B2B9,reuters,Reuters,1

Typhoon Jongdari (or ""skylark"" in Korean), is expected to make landfall on the country's main island, Honshu, late on Saturday or early on Sunday. The storm comes less than a month after floods killed more than 200 people, and then a heatwave left dozens dead. Japan's Meteorological Agency has told locals to be ready for evacuation. At 18:05 local time (09:05 GMT) Jongdari was situated about 200km south of Tokyo and forecast to make landfall close to the city of Nagoya. More than eight million people were ordered to leave their homes earlier in July when torrential rain saw rivers burst their banks, but some became trapped after failing to heed the order. Critics said the official warning came too late, and officials are urging those in disaster-struck areas to stay vigilant. ""We are afraid that people may not be able to evacuate due to strong wind or floods blocking evacuation routes,"" said Hiroshima's governor, Hidehiko Yuzaki. ""I would like people to evacuate in advance so that they can save their lives.""

Andy Isaacson,"March 29, 2018 23 min read This story appears in the April 2018 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe » When Hurricane Maria raked across Puerto Rico last September with wind speeds of up to 155 miles per hour, it left a path of unprecedented destruction. The storm flattened houses and forests, flooded towns and made hundreds of thousands of people homeless. It knocked out most of the island’s power grid, leaving nearly all 3.7 million residents in the dark, and severed 95 percent of cell networks as well as 85 percent of aboveground phone and internet cables. Eighty percent of the island’s crops were decimated. Related: Is Your Business Ready for the Next Devastating Natural Disaster? Once the hurricane moved on, an all-too-common aftermath unfolded. Local emergency responders became overwhelmed. There was, memorably, public fighting among political officials -- San Juan’s mayor versus President Trump. Relief agencies and volunteers flooded in. People who wanted to help could find long lists of organizations to donate to, though, as is typical after a disaster, it wasn’t clear where the money was best spent. Dollars often flowed indiscriminately. Ten days after the hurricane, a different kind of responder arrived on the island. His name was Jesse Levin, a 32-year-old serial entrepreneur with close-cropped hair and aviators, and the co-founder of a series of rock-climbing gyms called Brooklyn Boulders. He had no military background, though he had volunteered in past disaster zones and spoke the language of relief -- casually discussing “air assets” and “force multipliers.” Before he arrived he’d made plans to help, help that didn’t necessarily involve the cluster of government agencies and NGOs that were scrambling to advance their operations. “It was mind-boggling,” he recalls now. “There was just completely ineffective communication going on.” A rented jeep was waiting for him. Once in Puerto Rico, Levin spent several days crisscrossing the island’s debris-strewn roads, talking to residents, business owners, mayors and policemen. He rarely came across an aid worker or a utility truck. In the media, he’d kept hearing that people were desperate for food and water. But in village after village, Levin encountered grocery stores open and stocked with enough provisions to sustain the local communities. Enterprising merchants had even rustled up generators to keep on the lights. But many customers couldn’t buy anything: Around 40 percent of Puerto Rico’s population depends on food stamps, which require Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards to make purchases. With the island’s telecommunications network down, the cards couldn’t be processed. This particular problem didn’t require an intensive governmental effort to distribute food and water. It was just a connectivity issue that nobody else was solving. So Levin coordinated with Steve Birnbaum, a satellite communications expert he works with, who had arrived on the island a week before the hurricane to prep for the storm’s aftermath. Their plan: to personally buy a bunch of small satellite terminals from Focused Mission, an emergency response business on the island. Levin then worked some local government contacts until he wrangled a helicopter. Among them was Puerto Rico’s chief information officer, Luis Arocho, who came along for a beta test to see if their plan would succeed. Soon this small team was airborne and installing terminals on two grocery store rooftops. They flipped the switches and boom -- EBT purchases now worked. Levin would go on to install 12 more. The experience was validating. “If the economy is broken in a place, the location can’t heal,” Levin says. But now, functioning EBT machines can lead to more products sold, more employees paid and more shelves restocked -- an economic system revived, and saved from further dependence on FEMA aid. He says the hard costs totaled $33,000, which was ultimately reimbursed by the Foundation for Puerto Rico, and that around $3 million in transactions have since passed through the satellite terminals. But it was legitimizing on a far larger level as well. Levin isn’t here in Puerto Rico simply to do one-off projects like this. He’s here to advance a concept -- an audacious idea that he calls “expeditionary entrepreneurship.” In essence, it’s disaster relief in the form of entrepreneurship. Governments and NGOs are important, he says, with their standard operating procedures and approaches to administering aid. But entrepreneurship -- not profiteering, but the principles of entrepreneurship -- can accomplish what those bodies cannot: quick and nimble responses to ground-level problems, and connective tissue between foreign aid resources and capable local actors like grocery store merchants who are often not engaged. The same instincts that help an entrepreneur build a business, in other words, can help them rebuild a region from catastrophe. Levin explains this to me as we drive past toppled power lines and landslide debris in Puerto Rico’s lush interior mountains. It is mid-January, four months after the storm has passed. “An entrepreneur looks at systems and comes up with creative fixes,” he says. “We start from the bottom up.” Image Credit: Andy Isaacson Levin didn’t just dream up “expeditionary entrepreneurship” one day. Instead, he came to it after pursuing two parallel paths: He was an adventurer, and an entrepreneur. Related: 5 Ways to Prepare Your Business for Natural Disasters, Catastrophes and Income Loss He’s always had an entrepreneur’s sensibility -- that ability to sniff out an opportunity and boldly claim it. As a middle schooler in Connecticut, he launched a guerrilla marketing company called Jesse Levin’s Adrenaline Marketing. (Slogan: “With all due respect, you need a kid.”) He talked the beverage company SoBe into paying him $15,000 and helped promote them at extreme sports events by dyeing his, his friends’ and even his dog’s hair the brand’s hue of green. During summers, meanwhile, he also attended wilderness survival classes, learning how to build shelters and track animals through the woods. He became captivated by the power of resourcefulness -- how solutions exist all around us. “Survival school informed every facet of my life,” Levin says. “My relationships, how I see things, how I conduct my business.” After graduating from Babson College in 2007, those two passions continued apace. He moved to Panama, got into real estate, eventually bought a farm, and then launched a consulting firm. A Dutch company hired him to do project management and cultural mediation work in a remote coastal area where it had acquired land. The area -- a haven for narcotraffickers and local mafia -- was prone to flooding, and Levin inadvertently became the go-between for the special maritime police and the Red Cross to deliver medical care and supplies to his local community. The experience got him interested in disaster relief, so he followed the typical path: He volunteered. Following the historic earthquake in Haiti in 2010, he joined the NGO Hope for Haiti and spent six months crawling around the rubble. After the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, he split his time between Manila and a town named Tacloban, where he worked alongside Team Rubicon, a relief organization made up of veterans. Amid these overseas excursions, he was also pursuing traditional entrepreneurship. He became co-founder of Brooklyn Boulders, a New York climbing gym that was expanding into new cities. The first location was just outside Boston, and Levin’s goal was to draw people to the space. He realized that the same principles he’d learned in Haiti and the Philippines -- drop in with no agenda, assemble a capable operational team and work closely with locals to find culturally relevant solutions -- could work here as well. “We found the bike builders, the finger painters, the VCs and the nonprofits, and as we built, we said, ‘Here’s our philosophy: How can you leverage this space to amplify what’s going on here locally?’ ” Soon the place became a hybrid gym/community center/co-working space, hosting drone races, TEDx events and nude drawing classes, with MIT engineering students mingling with graffiti artists. Levin would replicate the concept in Chicago, and sell most of his stake in 2016. Throughout this period, starting in 2010, he also launched and ran a company called Tactivate, which pitches itself as a project manager inspired by the strategies and tenets of Special Operations. Through his disaster work, Levin had befriended many Air Force pararescuemen and Army Ranger types. He found them to be inherently entrepreneurial, but their resourcefulness, wide-ranging capabilities and “operational mentality” often went unappreciated in the civilian world. Tactivate could bridge that divide, he reasoned, by combining military veterans with what its website describes as “installation artists, hospitality gurus, bootstrap entrepreneurs, branders” and more, for whatever project needs doing. That’s turned out to include running events, art installations and a “pop-up outdoor survival training bar” in Miami. His parallel life pursuits had begun to bleed together, each informing the other. In entrepreneurship, he was channeling disaster relief -- the idea of moving quickly, identifying needs and bringing people together. In disaster relief, he’d been applying entrepreneurship -- dropping into post-disaster environments and creatively supporting local capacity. Along the way, Levin had assembled a vast Rolodex of relief operatives, from medics, communications specialists and private pilots to people involved in emergency logistics and air freight transport. “We all just kind of team up and see how we can fix things,” he says. “We’re fixers.” By last year, he’d come up with the phrase “expeditionary entrepreneurship” as a way to formalize his approach to disaster relief. Now he wouldn’t just be freelancing his way through regions; he’d be enacting a named strategy, which he could communicate to others. On September 20, this new phrase had its first test case: Hurricane Maria hit. Image Credit: Andy Isaacson “Cómo estás, señor!” Levin says, as he bro-hugs the guard at the security desk. “ Todo bien, caballero,” replies the guard chummily. We’re breezing into La Fortaleza, the bright-blue governor’s palace in San Juan’s colonial quarter, as if Levin didn’t just land in Puerto Rico for the first time three months earlier. We head across the lobby’s marble floor and up the stairs to the corner office of PRITS, or the Puerto Rican Innovation and Technology Services. It’s a newly formed unit headed by two former executives -- Luis Arocho, the island’s chief information officer, and Glorimar Ripoll, its chief innovation officer -- and tasked with introducing data science and technology into Puerto Rico’s bloated bureaucracy. It’s also become something of a home base for Levin, a place receptive to his particular brand of entrepreneurship. As we approach, we find the office in a flurry of redecoration. A black love seat, armchairs and gold side tables form a new reception area by the door. We stand and watch long slab tables crafted from trees felled by Maria -- and a large wooden PRITS sign emblazoned with the Puerto Rican flag -- being hoisted into an open window by a cherry picker. A giant, flashy canvas donated by a famed local artist, painted with the words La Gran Fiesta, is carried in and then promptly taken away: too much. Levin smiles. In his vision, everything is scalable -- every relationship, every idea. You start with one thing and build off it. It’s not always easy to draw a straight line from one to the next, but what’s happening in this office, at least, offers a useful pathway of how Levin’s philosophy unfolds. Related: 5 Steps for Managing Disaster Recovery for Your Business It started with that project to install satellite terminals. Originally, Levin had asked Arocho, the chief information officer, for help. “I thought, This is great, but knowing government, it probably won’t happen as fast as we need it, ” Arocho recalls. It had taken six weeks to request and launch Google’s balloon-powered Project Loon internet service on the island. But when Levin and his team produced the technology in less than a week, Arocho was impressed. “At that moment, I knew these guys were for real,” he says. “They’re forward thinkers. They offer a different approach -- that entrepreneurial mindset -- to dealing with government problems.” Now Levin had a useful new relationship. Arocho became willing to provide, as he calls it, “top cover” for his efforts -- signing forms when necessary, opening doors. And meanwhile, Levin was repeating this process with other key players around Puerto Rico. He’d befriended the heads of the Foundation for Puerto Rico, as well as key officials from FEMA, the military and the Department of Homeland Security. Leveraging his network, Levin often just connected dots. A cutting-edge, solar-powered water-purification system was installed at a Boys &amp; Girls Club in the town of Loíza because of an introduction Levin made between MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory and the Roddenberry Foundation. He introduced Global DIRT, a disaster response team, to a local organization in St. John requiring assistance, leading to a major response and connectivity operation benefiting the U.S. Virgin Islands. “This connection was immensely valuable,” Devin Welch, a solar-power-business owner, told me. Direct relationships and one-off operations can only scale so much, Levin knew. What he needed was to re-create what he had with Brooklyn Boulders -- that gathering point where infinite other relationships could thrive and people could find new ways of helping the island. “Whether in business or disaster response, informal relationships are how everything gets done,” he says. So, not long after arriving in Puerto Rico, Levin took over a six-bedroom house near the beach in San Juan that he found on Airbnb. At $275 per night, it came with a bar and an outdoor pool yet cost the same as a room at the nearby Hyatt. Then he invited everyone he’d met for regular Thursday happy hours (but also almost any time), offering a retreat where exhausted relief workers could decompress over cheese, crackers and bottles of Medalla Light, and even crash in a bedroom if necessary. Here, he believed, the silos of NGOs and government and military could break down. Arocho became a regular. So did senior officials from the U.S. military and FEMA, Puerto Rican bureaucrats and businesspeople and private-­sector technology specialists. Smart, young Puerto Rican doers arrived and began working out collaborations with PRITS. A filmmaker hired by AARP showed up and found people to help her document Maria’s impact on the elderly. Members of relief organizations swapped insights, and found partners for their work ahead. “We were better prepared for what was to come during our time there by hearing real stories of what was occurring and needed,” says Tamara Robertson of Engineers Without Borders. The house created new relationships, but it also continued to strengthen Levin’s existing ones. And that’s how, last January, Levin came to suggest that Arocho redesign the government office. If PRITS is to be an emblem of collaboration and make Puerto Rico attractive to innovators, he argued, the space ought to look the part. Arocho agreed; the office was originally nothing more than a drab, government-issue space. So Levin found a sponsor to put up $15,000, linked in a California-based furniture designer named Marcus Kirkwood and enlisted Levin’s twin sister, Sefra Alexandra, who had also come to Puerto Rico after the hurricane and built seed banks in 26 schools across the island. Now, on this day in January, we’re watching the fruits of collaboration and relationships. The new tables are being arranged. Sefra is decorating the room with tropical plants. Arocho stands by Levin and looks on happily, snapping pictures. Image Credit: Andy Isaacson Much of the attention on Puerto Rico’s hurricane response has focused on government’s colossal failures: FEMA’s sluggish response. The island’s struggle to get a handle on the situation. Corrupt utilities and local mayors. Mismanagement and dysfunction. Wastewater systems and an electrical grid left vulnerable after years of neglect. But there’s another story: how Puerto Rico’s citizens took care of themselves. Neighbors banded together. They shared food, fuel and shelters, driving their own hyperlocal response efforts. Levin talks about Alberto Delacruz, a Coca-Cola distributor he met who mustered 2,000 generators, loaded them on his fleet of trucks and delivered them to stores, clinics, salons and restaurants across the island. “Yes, he wanted his clients back in business,” Levin says. “But he solved a problem.” Necessity also inspired D.I.Y. solutions. I heard about residents powering homespun washing machines with battery-operated drills that they charged with solar panels; about electrifying their homes with car batteries. Local businesspeople began talking of themselves not just as merchants or salespeople but as sources of solutions -- as linchpins of their communities. This is, it turns out, a regular though less reported part of the disaster-recovery cycle. “History has shown that the disruption of existing traditions, policies and structures can create a climate of innovation and entrepreneurship,” reports a 2017 study in the International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior &amp; Research. The research was put together by two DePaul University professors who surveyed decades of reports on how entrepreneurship rises in areas that fall victim to disaster. Their conclusions: Perceptions of entrepreneurship always improve as local people, with their deep knowledge of their community’s needs, become effective in ways that large institutions like government can’t. And local entrepreneurs themselves go through a transformation, shedding anxieties that might have held them back before. “Necessities of the individual and his community override increases in fear of failure,” the DePaul writers report. From this, new solutions are created and new businesses are born. (This phenomenon extends to Levin himself: The co-directors of the University of Delaware’s Disaster Research Center tell me that, after disasters, independent people often step in to do what he does -- help forge connections. They just don’t typically think of themselves as entrepreneurs.) Related: Volunteer to Help Those in Need – and Become a Better Entrepreneur However, something is happening in Puerto Rico that the DePaul writers hadn’t chronicled elsewhere. Entrepreneurs from outside Puerto Rico are arriving with vigor. Within days of the storm, scores of technology companies in particular have made landfall, ranging from large entities like NetHope and Tesla, which is launching new battery projects on the island, to smaller makers of passive water collection and purification systems and “mobile ad hoc” wi-fi networks. Many see the island as a test bed for their new technologies. Wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have arrived en masse, eyeing Puerto Rico’s generous tax incentives, broken systems and humbled government as an exciting set of challenges. “It’s turned out to be this really amazing opportunity to put to work block-chain technology,” Reeve Collins, cofounder of the company BlockV, told me. Levin watched this happen on the island, and two months after the hurricane, he felt it was time to move on to a new phase of his expeditionary entrepreneurship project -- away from disaster relief, and toward disaster preparedness. (Hurricane season begins in June.) He’d now play superconnector for this new community on the island, locals and newcomers alike, whose products and services could help Puerto Rico in the long run. By this point, Levin had stopped renting his communal Airbnb; the aid workers who frequented the house had largely left. Now he makes connections on the fly. “I go into an area and try to identify who’s who. And I try to empower them and connect them around a goal,” he says. Over the course of my three days with him in January, this is almost entirely what I witness Levin doing. He meets with property developers and investors and lawyers and local foundations and youth activists and surfers and (of course) cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. We stopped in at a tech accelerator one morning to meet re:3D, a startup experimenting with an industrial 3-D printer to fabricate storm-­ravaged stuff like furniture and coral. We had lunch with Milton Soto, an influential bartender who is rehabilitating an elementary school after the hurricane, before stopping by Aqui Se Puede, a watering hole whose owner and resident carpenter once worked for Andy Warhol. For Levin, these encounters are mostly soft touches -- rapport building, part of his overarching effort to piece together a network of “local capacity” in the event of another disaster. One morning, I join Levin for a 7:45 a.m. workout on the beach with Carlos Guardiola, a well-connected Puerto Rican entrepreneur who owns one of the island’s largest warehousing businesses as well as medical cannabis licenses; Rafael Ortiz, who is in private equity; and Ben Manning, a former Navy SEAL fresh out of eight years in the service, whom Levin had taken on as something of an apprentice. (Each night before bed, Levin and Manning “debriefed” about the day’s meetings and exchanged the lessons learned.) After burpees and sprints, we sit down for breakfast at a beachfront inn. Guardiola describes his role as an unofficial connector. “I have a very simple rule: I don’t do business with anybody unless I eat with them seven times,” he tells Levin. “I like to see how you treat the waiter. I like to see who you know around. I like to see how you react. Because everybody’s a great first date.” Since 1996, he’s frequently hosted invite-only salons that bring together venture capitalists, housewives, street artists -- an intentionally diverse mix -- and after the hurricane, that made him a natural contact point for many people on the island. Not unlike Levin, Guardiola began making connections that helped the disaster recovery along. In one case, he connected GivePower, a major clean-energy nonprofit, to local partners to install water desalination and purification systems. “And that’s how real recovery happens,” Levin says. “It’s understanding the landscape, and making very unconventional, strategic relationships of human capital, and understanding the capacity of respective operating groups, and putting them together.” “It basically comes down to what we’re doing here -- it’s breaking bread,” Guardiola replies. “I’m not in the business of employing people, because I think that’s what kills Puerto Rico. That whole mindset of I want to get my sure thing. There is no such thing as a sure thing! And that’s why this is really the perfect storm. You know everybody was thinking, Oh, the United States, they got our back. Bullshit! Oh, we’re going to get money from FEMA. Bullshit!” If Puerto Rico has a savior, they agree, it will be the entrepreneurs on the island -- both the ones born here and the ones flocking in. This is the lesson they took from Hurricane Maria. “Once you realize that no one is here to save you,” Guardiola continues, “that is the most empowering thing, or the most frightening thing. And whoever is frightened should get on a plane and go to Orlando. Get the fuck out of the way.” Image Credit: Andy Isaacson One day, before a meeting with a lawyer from a prominent Puerto Rican real estate family, Levin takes me to the ruins of the former Naval Reserve Officers Beach Club. It’s perched over the sea, above a popular surf spot and in the shadow of an old Spanish fort, but it’s an absolute mess: small buildings stripped down to the concrete and covered in graffiti, hunks of wood scattered like discarded toys. The site belongs to the city of San Juan, but he’s actively courting the city government and pitching investors to turn it over to him. Related: 8 Ways to Use Emotional Intelligence and Make Lasting Connections Here, Levin says, is where he can have a truly lasting impact. “I’m proud of our ability to drop in and be operational, but really, at the end of the day I’m just another guy going out and fixing a radio, or clearing search and rescue,” he says. That’s why he wants this permanent space -- a place to once more repeat what he learned at Brooklyn Boulders. When he’d bring the climbing gym to a new city, Levin would start by inviting a diverse group of locals -- from investors to artists -- into the space as they were building it. He called the gatherings “hard hat dinners,” and the goal was to get influential constituencies in the community to meet each other and have a say in what became of the space. That way, when it opened, they’d already feel like it was theirs. This is what’s missing in Puerto Rico right now, he believes. The worst has passed. Electricity is slowly returning. But what about the next Maria? All of this entrepreneurial energy -- the resurgent locals and the innovators coming with their cutting-edge resiliency technologies -- needs a central place to organize around disaster preparedness and recovery. The way Levin envisions it, this could become an open-air market: a hybrid pop-up space where military veterans teach preparedness skills to patrons amid food trucks, live entertainment and off-grid-technology exhibits. He’d been involved in a project like that in Miami -- minus the disaster element, of course -- and thinks it can work here, too. Recently, Levin signed a one-year lease on an apartment in San Juan. He’s racked up a hefty credit card bill during his time here, but he’s determined to bring his new concept to life and recoup his costs in the process. “Puerto Rico is a phenomenal place to demonstrate this concept of community self-sufficiency,” he says. And if it’s successful, he wants to replicate the idea back in the continental U.S. -- and prepare us all for whatever is to come.","After Hurricane Maria savaged Puerto Rico, a man named Jesse Levin used what he'd learned as an entrepreneur and applied it to disaster relief.

Lena Requist,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Disasters can strike businesses at any time and take almost any shape: A flood takes out a startup’s servers. A founder is imprisoned. A tornado destroys the office building. Whether it’s a natural disaster, a PR scandal or something else altogether, not being ready can add another level of devastation to an entrepreneur’s life. I know this firsthand. My company, ONTRAPORT, endured the Santa Barbara fires and aftermath that started in late 2017 and ravaged into this year. We also had shifts on our accounting team that resulted in me trying my hand at accounting (not my forte). Needless to say, 2018 has been a year of unexpected change and destruction -- both of my team’s physical surroundings and our “usual” way of doing things. Alongside our CEO, Landon Ray, I debated: “What do we do as leaders of this company and leaders in our community?” It all boiled down to a question that wasn’t so simple to answer: What kind of emergency preparedness should you have in place so when stuff hits the fan, you’re ready to execute? Stuff hits the fan The fires and mudslide in Santa Barbara were crazy acts of nature that resulted in evacuations as people’s health was put at risk with the toxic air. Twenty-three people died in what’s been called “the worst disaster in Santa Barbara history.” It was a scary and traumatic experience as people were spread out, unsure of the status of people they cared about. Before we knew how bad things were going to get, we still knew that the only way to keep our company up and running was by being proactive. We’d created an emergency plan years ago, so when the fires started, I immediately pulled the plan out at 6 a.m. because I had already lost power at my house and knew we were going to lose power in the office. We weren’t in the evacuation area yet, but we needed a generator before they sold out. We made sure to buy the right masks for everyone after we researched how to stay safe with declining air quality. Unlike most homes in Santa Barbara, our office had air conditioning, so we ordered HEPA filters. And when we realized that wasn’t going to be enough because the air quality had become hazardous, we rented a ranch in Los Osos, two hours away. At that point, we evacuated and couldn’t return to the office. We told people to work where they could -- about half came to the ranch, while the rest went to other areas with their families and loved ones. Related: 5 Steps for Managing Disaster Recovery for Your Business When safe places no longer feel safe. We heard stories from others in the area that their employers wouldn’t pay them because they couldn’t work. I get that this was an emergency, and business owners have to make business decisions. We also had some employees who couldn’t work: Our coffee and meal program employee couldn’t take care of people’s food because they weren’t in the office. In the same vein, our childcare center wasn’t taking care of people’s kids, but we knew that, just like our meal program provider, we had to pay them so they could in turn pay rent. Those are the decisions you have to make as an employer; they go a long way toward building trust with people. Treating people well isn’t just a short-term investment but a long-term one, too. We wanted people to feel really taken care of. And that applied to the employees who could still work as well. We set the ranch up with Wi-Fi, VPN, laptops and docking stations. We tried to close every loophole that could prevent us from offering customer support, prevent our marketing team from implementing campaigns or stop our engineers from fixing bugs or working on the development of new features on schedule. How to prevent a disaster from getting bigger Not every employer can move things around the way we did -- but a lot of entrepreneurs can do better than they’re currently planned for. It’s all about remaining thoughtful in how you handle the disaster facing you, and there are some smart ways to do that. 1. Make your priorities known. The only thing more demoralizing for employees who are going through a situation of disastrous proportions is feeling as if they’re means to an end. Servers, process documents and computers can all be replaced; people can’t be. Make it clear that their safety is the most important thing. We sent daily morning and evening emails or messages through our ONTRApeeps social media community to keep everyone connected and make sure people were safe. Every day, we also sent updates on the fire situation based on the information we were receiving so our team knew we were staying informed on a situation that directly impacted their lives and livelihood. Related: First Things First: The 5 Secrets to Prioritization 2. Plan ahead to stay open. While some businesses are built to be hands-on entities -- say, massage therapy or tutoring services -- most entrepreneurs can make plans to keep working when disaster strikes. We proactively placed our servers for customer work in different locations so customers wouldn’t see disruptions, and we created redundancy with Amazon and Google Web Services. Creating tech stopgaps can save your business. 3. Look at what your state provides. Our state had disaster recovery funds, and employees who didn’t get paid could apply for unemployment during that time. Knowing what state benefits are available can be life-saving for both your business and your employees. Go the extra step to prepare the paperwork for affected employees so they can simply submit it if they’d like to access the benefits. Be informed ahead of time. 4. Always have three people who know how to do a job. Not every entrepreneur has three employees. However, every entrepreneur can ensure processes are documented so anyone can follow them. When we ran into issues on the accounting side, many employees asked if they could help, but because some processes weren’t documented, we couldn’t take them up on their offers. Enforce documentation updates -- if you don’t, you’ll be the one cleaning up the debris. 5. Do what you can to help. Our company did Valentine’s Day candy grams as a fundraiser for affected families, raising several hundred dollars through people buying handmade cards from our HR team. We went together to dig out houses and hosted a bucket brigade of 300 people at our office to show our support. We couldn’t afford to provide housing or write huge checks, but we did what we could. Related: Volunteer to Help Those in Need – and Become a Better Entrepreneur No one is immune from disaster, but everyone can prepare for disasters so their impact is limited. Entrepreneurs have a lot to lose when disaster strikes, and not being ready ensures that the devastation takes on new proportions.

Valentina Za,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s anti-establishment government, outraged at the deadly collapse of a 50-year-old bridge, has presented the disaster as a warning to Brussels to give it more leeway to upgrade the country’s aging infrastructure. But the political anger generated by Tuesday’s tragedy in Genoa, in which at least 39 people died, could instead end up piling even more financial pressure on the state - from nervous holders of its 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion) in bonds. Within hours of the viaduct giving way and sending vehicles plummeting, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the EU must allow Rome to include in its next budget all the funds needed to ensure the country’s infrastructure was safe. That investment, to be calculated after an emergency audit of bridges and tunnels nationwide, comes on top of plans outlined by the government which took office in June to spend tens of billions of euros on tax cuts, easing pension rules and a basic income for the poor. It also wants to avoid triggering a planned rise in value-added tax (VAT), agreed with Brussels by the previous government to meet budget goals. For Italy’s creditors, the fiscal gap is a growing worry. A sell-off sent Italian bond yields rising sharply on Wednesday morning after Salvini used the bridge disaster to question EU limits on Italy’s deficit. The bonds later rallied but their yields continue to offer a sizeable premium over safer German debt. NOT ALWAYS A PRIORITY Gustavo Piga, economics professor at Rome’s Tor Vergata University, said regardless of EU rules, Rome had not always demonstrated that infrastructure was at top of its agenda. “Italy sorely needs higher and better public investments but they haven’t been a priority for politicians in recent years,” Piga said, noting that the previous administration had even appeared to divert some funds away from infrastructure after winning some budgetary leeway from Brussels for investments. Total investment and maintenance spending on Italian transport infrastructure fell by 58 percent between 2008 and 2015, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But more money could have been invested, according to an Italian central bank analysis last year. As overall public investment in Italy fell 35 percent in real terms between 2007 and 2015, Rome hiked spending on everyday things like public salaries and pensions by 7 percent. The European Commission also sent reminder on Wednesday that it had for some time been encouraging the ruling coalition in Rome to prioritize infrastructure spending. The Commission, the EU’s executive, said it had approved in April an 8.5 billion euro investment plan for Italian motorways, including in the Genoa region, under EU state aid rules. Italy is also set to receive around 2.5 billion euros in European funds between 2014 and 2020 to invest in network infrastructures, such as roads or rail, the Commission added. Italy’s economy minister, a former economics professor who appears more attuned to the moods of markets than some of his colleagues, also hinted on Wednesday that infrastructure might not fit neatly into the call for easier EU funding rules. Giovanni Tria said in a statement that his priority would not be just on higher public investment, which was already factored into his upcoming budget; the government would also aim to “overcome shortfalls in the ability to spend and intervene”. A Treasury source said Tria was already discussing a big overall public investment plan with EU officials, worth a total of 150 billion euros over 10 years. Italy does not need to raise its deficit to boost infrastructure spending, the source added. KEEPING IT PRIVATE? The bridge disaster may also fail to further the government’s cause in Brussels for other reasons: the viaduct revealed problems not long after it was completed in 1967 and it is maintained by a private toll operator, not the government. Autostrade per l’Italia, part of the Milan-listed Atlantia group ( ATL.MI ), said it complied with all its maintenance requirements and made regular safety checks on the bridge. It said it spent more than 1 billion euros a year over 2012-2017 to maintain and upgrade its road network spanning 3,000 km. Autostrade has not disclosed its specific maintenance budget for the bridge, which was part of its concession on the A10 motorway linking the port city of Genoa with southern France. Antonio Brencich, an engineering professor at Genoa University, told state television the bridge had been shown to be defective just two decades after it was built — a comment supported by anecdotal evidence of those who lived below it. “In the ‘80s pieces of cement came down and ruined parked cars, and there was a procedure — you filled out a form to claim compensation for the repairs,” said Salvatore Lorefice, 58, a pensioner who worked at a warehouse directly under the bridge.

Ilaria Polleschi,"GENOA (Reuters) - Italian rescue workers used jackhammers and cranes on Friday to lift giant slabs of concrete from the Genoa highway bridge collapse, hoping to find survivors buried in the rubble of the disaster that killed at least 38 people. A fire held up part of the operation in the early morning, sending up clouds of white smoke before being extinguished. A spark from metal-cutting equipment was thought to have caused the blaze that started in a warehouse under the ruined bridge. But then the more than 300 firefighters who have been working non-stop since Tuesday resumed their task. As many as 20 people are still unaccounted for, Genoa’s chief prosecutor said. Chances of finding survivors appeared to be slim. Vehicles on the highway that links the port city to the French border plummeted 50 meters (165 feet) to the ground when a 200-metre (660-foot) stretch of the viaduct collapsed on Tuesday. Firefighters, who are using sniffer dogs as well as heavy machinery, have not yet reached all the cars. “We are trying to find points where we can penetrate these incredibly heavy slabs. Then the earth-moving equipment moves in to create a passageway where the dogs can enter,” firefighter Stefano Zanut said at the scene. Rescuers are hoping that the large chunks of debris may have created a “triangle of survival” when they fell, where someone could still be alive, he said. FUNERAL Some 600 people have had to leave their apartments below the remaining spans of the bridge for fear of further collapse. The homes will be demolished as officials have deemed it would be too dangerous to leave them there. The government has said alternative housing will be found, although it may take months to re-house everyone. A state funeral for many of the victims will be held on Saturday at Genoa’s Exhibition and Trade Centre, led by the city’s archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, and attended by President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. But some families plan to boycott the event and hold their own private services, as a sign of protest against what they say was the negligence that caused the bridge to collapse. An engineering study commissioned by toll-highway operator Autostrade per l’Italia last year warned about the state of the bridge’s concrete-encased cable stays, Italian newspapers reported. Autostrade has said it monitored the bridge on a quarterly basis, as required by law, and carried out additional checks by hiring external experts. It had no immediate comment on Friday’s news reports. The government has declared Saturday a national day of mourning. The state funeral will be televised live and broadcaster RAI will not air any advertising, as a sign of respect for the victims. Shares in the parent company of Autostrade plunged more than 30 percent in the days after the collapse, but were recovering slightly on Friday as investors said government threats to revoke its concessions might be political rhetoric rather than a likely outcome. Atlantia ( ATL.MI ) shares were up 3.7 percent on Thursday’s close by 1100 GMT, still down more than 23 percent from their level the day before the disaster. The Transport Ministry has given Autostrade 15 days to show it had met all its contractual obligations, and wants the company to rebuild the bridge at its own expense.

 Rescuers prepare a water pump at the site of the flooded coal mine
A team of Indian navy divers has been deployed in a bid to rescue 15 workers trapped inside a flooded coal mine.
The men had entered the illegal pit, known as a ""rat hole"", in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya on 13 December, and were cut off when floodwater from a nearby river poured in.
Emergency workers equipped with high-power pumps have arrived at the scene.
It is not yet clear whether the miners are still alive.
India's NDTV reports that divers have recovered nothing but three helmets so far.
Officials hope the men may have found an air pocket in the main mineshaft.
""Only God's grace and some miracle can help them to be alive,"" Kyrmen Shylla, Meghalaya's disaster management minister, told Reuters on Wednesday.
Earlier rescue efforts by India's National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) were hampered by a lack of equipment. Initially, only two low-power pumps were on hand to drain the water.

Rat-hole mining involves digging pits into the ground to create a narrow hole to find coal, and is dangerous for those involved. Workers, including children, descend into the mines using bamboo ladders and accidents are common.
The practice was banned in 2014, but mine owners have challenged the ruling in India's Supreme Court.
Most of Meghalaya's illegal miners are migrant labourers who come from neighbouring states to earn money.","High-power pumps arrive at a flooded ""rat-hole"" mine where 15 workers were trapped 16 days ago.",2018-12-29T15:48:25Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Indian miners: Navy divers deployed in rescue bid,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46710467,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/428E/production/_104983071_mine2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1
KAI SCHULTZ,"Cyclones occur in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean ; in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, such severe storms are called hurricanes. “There was no forewarning,” Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose, of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, said by telephone. “There was no scientific means of establishing that this was going to become a cyclone.” But fishermen, saying the government had been slow to notify people of the storm, organized protests on Saturday in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu, blocking roads and pooling resources and boats to try to locate the missing. Speaking to the families of missing fishermen in Tamil Nadu villages, India’s defense minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said on Sunday that the country’s navy, air force and coast guard were doing everything possible to try to find the missing fishermen. “I speak with folded hands,” she told the crowd, in which wives of the missing fishermen wept. “We have not stopped searching for them.” Several hundred fishermen have been rescued, the Kerala disaster management agency said. The state has announced compensation payments of about $15,000 each for the families of those who have died. Mr. Kuriakose said that some of the missing fishermen had already been out at sea days before the cyclone formed. Before gathering force, the storm killed at least 13 people last week in neighboring Sri Lanka, uprooting trees, forcing schools to shut and disrupting air travel. The India Meteorological Department said the cyclone was expected to weaken gradually in the next couple of days as it moved north toward the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Heavy rainfall was forecast for the area on Tuesday and officials have advised fishermen in southern Gujarat and northern Maharashtra to stay on shore.

Maggie Fick,"ADDIS ABABA/JAKARTA (Reuters) - The world’s biggest planemaker Boeing faced growing obstacles to returning its grounded 737 MAX fleet to the skies on Wednesday, while chilling details emerged of an Indonesian crash with similarities to the Ethiopian disaster. 
Experts suspect an automated system, meant to stop stalling by dipping the nose, may be involved in both cases, with pilots unable to override it as their jets plunged downwards. 
The March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash has shaken the global aviation industry and cast a shadow over the flagship Boeing model intended to be a standard for decades to come, given parallels with the Lion Air calamity off Jakarta in October. 
The twin crashes killed 346 people. 
(GRAPHIC: Ethiopian Airlines crash - tmsnrt.rs/2Hn6V4k) 
Chicago-headquartered Boeing has promised a swift update of the automatic flight software for the craft but major regulators in Europe and Canada want to be sure themselves, rather than rely on U.S. vetting. 
As Ethiopian investigators pored over black box data from their crash, sources with knowledge of the doomed Lion Air cockpit voice recorder revealed how pilots scoured a manual in a losing battle to figure out why they were hurtling down to sea. 
Investigators examining the Indonesian crash want to know how a computer ordered the plane to dive in response to data from a faulty sensor and whether pilots had enough training to respond appropriately to the emergency. 
Communications showed that in the final moments, the captain tried in vain to find the right procedure in the handbook, while the first officer was unable to control the plane. 
“It is like a test where there are 100 questions and when the time is up you have only answered 75,” said one of the sources with knowledge of the cockpit recording that has not been made public. “So you panic. It is a time-out condition.” 
At the end, the sources told Reuters, the Indian-born captain, 31, was quiet, while the Indonesian officer, 41, said “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”) - an Arabic phrase to express excitement, shock, praise or distress. The plane then hit water. 
U.S. “CREDIBILITY DAMAGED” 
Boeing has said there was a documented procedure to handle the situation. A different crew on the same plane the evening before had the same problem but solved it after running through three checklists, though they did not pass on all that information to the doomed crew, the preliminary report by investigators released in November said. 
Rowing back from previous reliance on U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) vetting, Canada and the European Union will now seek their own guarantees over the MAX planes, complicating Boeing’s hopes to get them flying worldwide again. 
Regulators want to be absolutely sure of Boeing’s new automated flight control system, known as MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), and that pilots are fully trained to handle it. 
“Our credibility as leaders in aviation is being damaged,” wrote Chesley Sullenberger, a U.S. pilot famed for landing a jet on the Hudson River saving all 155 people on board a decade ago. 
“Boeing and the FAA have been found wanting in this ugly saga that began years ago but has come home to roost with two terrible fatal crashes, with no survivors, in less than five months, on a new airplane type, the Boeing 737 Max 8, something that is unprecedented in modern aviation history,” he added in a scathing article on marketwatch.com. 
(GRAPHIC: The grounded 737 Max fleet - tmsnrt.rs/2u5sZYI) 
Facing such high-profile scrutiny, Boeing, one of the United States’ most prestigious exporters, reshuffled executives in its commercial airplanes unit to focus on the crash fallout. 
(GRAPHIC: Boeing 737 Max deliveries in question - tmsnrt.rs/2Hv2btC) 
VOICE RECORDINGS 
The FAA noted in a statement that its “robust processes” and “full collaboration with the aviation community” were key to safety worldwide. The regulator is due to have a new head soon, likely to be former Delta Air Lines executive Steve Dickson. 
U.S. President Donald Trump had apparently been considering his longtime personal pilot, John Dunkin, before leaning toward Dickson who had a 27-year career at Delta. 
In Ethiopia, which is leading the investigation, experts were poring over the in-flight recording of Captain Yared Getachew and First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed’s voices. 
As with the Indonesia flight, they radioed control problems shortly after take-off and sought to turn back, struggling to get their plane on track before it hit a field. However, there is no proven link and experts emphasize that every accident is a unique chain of human and technical factors. 
For now, though, more than 300 MAX aircraft are grounded round the world, and deliveries of nearly 5,000 more - worth well over $500 billion - are on hold. 
Development of the 737 MAX, which offers cost savings of about 15 percent on fuel, began in 2011 after the successful launch by its main rival of the Airbus A320neo. The 737 MAX entered service in 2017 after six years of preparation.

Sam Rutherford,"So there I am, six thousand miles away from home in a foreign country (whose language I don’t speak) covering a trade show by myself, and I realize the power brick on my XPS 13 is busted. This is a disaster. My laptop is my lifeblood. I need it to write stories, edit photos, and collaborate with the team back home. Without it, I’m truly screwed. And what’s even worse is that my work XPS is the last generation without support for charging over USB-C, and because Spain doesn’t give a shit about Dell, there was no replacing it (trust me I tried). But then I remember, as I nervously watch my laptop’s battery tick down from 68 to 67 percent, there is a solution. That’s because in my bag, I was carrying a review unit for Huawei’s newest laptop, the MateBook X Pro. OK, it’s time for a real trial by fire. Matebook X Pro Price 1,500 Euros (US pricing TBA) What is it? An 13.9-inch ultraportable laptop Like Brilliant screen with super thin bezels, great design Don't Like Still no availability info, no microSD card slot While best known for its smartphones, Huawei has been slowly pushing into laptops and tablets over the past few years. Its first major success came on with the original MateBook X, which took (or borrowed) the template from Apple’s 12-inch MacBook and fixed a number of issues. But for the MateBook X Pro, the company set its sights on something bigger: the 13-inch MacBook Pro. And you know what? Huawei has totally succeeded, because for every downside of Apple’s top laptop, Huawei seems to have an answer. Like Apple, Huawei starts with a solid aluminum body and then adds surprisingly powerful speakers to the sides, a big one-piece trackpad down below, and clever power button/fingerprint reader combo in the top left—and all of it is top notch. Then there’s Matebook X Pro’s backlit keyboard. While it is a bit on the shallow side, the keyboard’s relatively high actuation weight and deeper key travel feels vastly superior to the garbage you get on modern MacBooks. Huawei also smartly included two USB-C ports (one of which supports Thunderbolt 3) and a single USB 3 Type-A port, so you can live life dongle-free. I would have really liked it if Huawei had found room for a SD card slot on the X Pro, though for folks in the US, Huawei’s inclusion of of a free MateDock 2 (which tacks on an extra USB-A, USB-C, HDMI and VGA ports) might help smooth over any concerns about connectivity. Once you’re done ogling the X Pro’s design, the next thing that draws your eyes in is its brilliant screen. Not only is it super bright, topping out at 485 nits, it also has the slimmest bezels of any laptop out right now. And I’m not just talking about skinny margins on the top and sides, the X Pro’s chin is equally thin too, resulting in a screen-to-body ratio of 91 percent. That’s better than devices like the new XPS 13 (80.7 percent) and the Galaxy S9 (83.6 percent) by a fair margin. And after more than three weeks of using it every day, I simply don’t want to go back to normal laptops screens with awkward Jay Leno proportions. But that’s not all, because by cutting down on bezels, Huawei had room for a bigger screen, so you get a high-res 13.9-inch 3000 x 2000 touchscreen while most competing systems cap out at 13.3-inches. At that resolution, and with the screen’s seriously good color reproduction, pictures, movies and anything else you’re viewing really pop. Huawei even equipped the X Pro with a neat trick for how it hides its webcam. Without a big bezel above or below the screen, Huawei stashed the webcam inside one of its keys, smack dab in the middle of the function row. When the keyboard’s backlight is on, it’s pretty noticeable, because it’s the only key that doesn’t light up. But aside from that, you normally kind of just forget it’s there, which is exactly what a webcam should do when you’re not using it. Another bonus effect of the webcam’s location, is that when it’s depressed and pointed into the guts of the system, there’s no chance it can be hacked and used to spy on you unknowingly. Now for all you Mac die-hards, the fact that the X Pro doesn’t run macOS might be a deal breaker. But that’s really Apple’s fault for not letting other companies license its operating system, as I suspect Huawei may have wanted to ape that too. But I’m not really bothered, because Huawei did something just as good when it partnered with Microsoft to install Windows 10 Pro Signature Edition on the Matebook X Pro. There’s no bloat or added bullshit whatsoever. As for the specs, the X Pro has more than enough oomph thanks to a 8th-Gen Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU, up to 16GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD storage, and even a Nvidia MX 150 GPU if you want it. When compared to competing systems like the recently revamped XPS 13 and the LG Gram 15, our fully loaded X Pro review unit finished with top scores across every one of our standard benchmarks, which includes browser performance in WebXPRT 2015, a picture resizing test in Photoshop, and Geekbench 4. You can’t quite say the same for the X Pro’s graphics performance, as its MX 150 is more of a step up over standard integrated graphics, as opposed to something built to game on. Even the X Pro’s battery life is pretty stellar, with it lasting 11 hours and 7 minutes on our standard rundown test. That’s better than both the Dell’s XPS 13, and bigger systems like the 15-inch LG Gram, which lasted 9:28 and 10:39 respectively. One small quirk that I don’t quite get is that by default—the X Pro’s SSD came formatted into two partitions: a smaller 80GB section and a larger 380 GB division. It’s weird because there’s only one physical drive, so the system is just cutting up its storage in two for no real reason. That said, it is very minor issue. Really, trying to pick out flaws of the MateBook X Pro isn’t an easy task. Regardless of how shamelessly you think Huawei has copied Apple’s formula, it has absolutely improved on that template in a number of very important ways. In fact, the biggest problem with this system right now, is that it still doesn’t have an official US release date or pricing. And despite the company’s recent issues with brick-and-mortar retailers, Huawei has confirmed the X Pro will be available on Amazon and both online and in-store from Microsoft when it arrives. But if the Matebook X Pro does ends up anywhere near its 1,500 euro tag overseas (or 1900 euros for an i7 with that MX 150), and it should as Huawei has said the X Pro is going to be “aggressively priced” in the US, then other systems like the $1900 XPS 13, $ 2,000 LG Gram 15 are going to be facing some damn fine competition. And then there’s the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which for $1,800 has a worse keyboard, a last-gen CPU, a lower-res non-touch display, weaker speakers, and no option for a real GPU. After using this system daily for almost a month, I’m actually not sure there’s another daily driver I would rather use. It feels a little weird to say this: But what do you call a laptop that looks like a MacBook Pro, but is actually much better? I guess the answer would be a Matebook. README The Matebook X Pro’s 3000 x 2000 screen is gorgeous and has the smallest bezels of any laptop on the market. While the hidden webcam isn’t in the ideal position, it’s better what you get from an XPS13. It’s also cool as hell. The optional Nvidia GeForce MX150 isn’t a full gaming-grade GPU, but it’s a big boon to people who need a little extra graphics power. Two USB-C ports and one USB-A port is just enough connectivity, but a SD card reader would have been nice. In the US, the Matebook X Pro will come with a clean install of Windows 10 Pro signature edition, and a free dock. Battery life is surprisingly good, despite its thinness and potent specs.

Steve Gorman,"(Reuters) - Federal emergency managers got an unusual head start preparing for Hurricane Lane, with key personnel and supplies deployed well ahead of the storm in response to a flurry of disaster threats to Hawaii in recent months, officials said on Thursday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had already established an operational presence on Oahu and Kauai after widespread flooding across those islands in April, and on Hawaii’s Big Island during the eruption of Kilauea Volcano that began in May. FEMA started moving additional supplies to Hawaii again in advance of Hurricane Hector, which skirted past the Pacific U.S. archipelago state more than a week ago, agency spokeswoman Veronica Verde told Reuters by phone from Honolulu. “We have already shipped meals-ready-to-eat, and also water and generators to all four (Hawaii) counties and prepositioned them for Hector” in distribution centers, with more provisions set to arrive ahead of Lane, she said. FEMA is also following a revised play book in the aftermath of catastrophic damage and loss of life wreaked by Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to FEMA chief Brock Long. The strategy calls for getting generators in place before the storm hits so they can immediately restore electricity for basic needs, including power to restart local water systems, Long told reporters at a briefing in Washington. “It’s not just providing food and water. If you fix the power first, you solve 90 percent of the problems,” Long said. Verde said FEMA has also “pushed more of our commodities forward in preparation for this hurricane” than it has in the past. FEMA was harshly criticized in the wake of Maria as having been too slow to recognize the gravity of the devastation to Puerto Rico and too sluggish in providing disaster relief to the Caribbean island. For Lane, which had threatened for days to become the first major hurricane to plow directly through the Hawaiian islands since 1992, FEMA “embedded” its own liaison officers in the emergency operations centers of state and local authorities for close coordination. FEMA has also sent in urban search-and-rescue teams, along with two disaster medical teams, personnel from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other specialists for transportation, communications and hazardous waste management, she said. In one other change since the Hurricane Maria calamity in Puerto Rico, Verde said FEMA has worked more closely with private-sector suppliers - such as big-box retail outlets - to arrange for emergency distribution of food, communications equipment and other provisions that might be needed.

Ilaria Polleschi,"GENOA (Reuters) - Rescue workers searched through tons of concrete and steel from the collapsed Genoa highway bridge for a fourth day on Friday as Italians prepared to bury the 38 victims of a disaster that has angered the public and rattled industry. A fire among the rubble held up part of the operation, sending clouds of white smoke up before being extinguished. A spark from metal cutting equipment was thought to have caused the blaze that started in a warehouse under the ruined bridge. The confirmed death toll from the collapse of a 200-meter (660-foot) stretch of the bridge on Tuesday that sent vehicles plummeting 50 meters (165 feet) to the ground, remained at 38, but officials have said there still may be 10-20 people missing. More than 600 people had to leave their apartments below the remaining spans of the bridge for fear of further collapse. Officials have decided the buildings will be demolished as it would be too dangerous to leave them there. A state funeral for most of the victims is due to be held on Saturday morning at the port city’s Exhibition and Trade Centre, led by Genoa’s archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, and attended by President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. But some families have said they will boycott the event and hold their own private services, as a sign of protest against what they say was negligence that caused the bridge to collapse. The government has declared Saturday a national day of mourning. The state funeral will be televised live and state broadcaster RAI said will not air any advertising as a sign of respect for the victims. Shares in the parent company of Autostrade per l’Italia which runs the highway plunged more than 30 percent in the days after the collapse, but were recovering slightly on Friday as investors said government threats to revoke its concessions might be political rhetoric rather than a likely outcome. Atlantia shares were up 6 percent on Thursday’s close by 0900 GMT, still down almost 22 percent from their level the day before the disaster. The Transport Ministry has given Autostrade 15 days to show it had met all its contractual obligations, and wants the company to rebuild the bridge at its own expense.

Angus McDowall,"BEIRUT/ANKARA (Reuters) - Russian and Syrian jets hammered the last major rebel stronghold on Tuesday, days before leaders of Russia, Iran and Turkey meet to discuss an expected Syrian government offensive that could spark a humanitarian disaster. The warplanes bombarded countryside around Jisr al-Shughour on the western edge of the rebel enclave of Idlib after weeks of lull, killing 13 civilians but no fighters, a war monitoring group said. For President Bashar al-Assad, the defeat of rebels in the northwestern province would be a breakthrough in crushing active armed opposition, though other large areas remain beyond his control. Since Russia’s entry into the war on his side in 2015, Assad and his other close allies, Iran and a group of regional Shi’ite militias it backs, have forced the rebels from a succession of bastions including Aleppo, Eastern Ghouta and Deraa. A Syrian government minister said the siege of Idlib would probably be resolved by force. “Until now, military action is more likely than reconciliations,” Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar told Russia’s Arabic-language Sputnik news agency. Damascus uses the term “reconciliation” for the negotiated rebel surrenders that have taken place in some areas. “Idlib is different from other regions because of the large numbers of fighters,” Haidar said. “However we cannot say there is no gateway to reconciliation.” Half of Idlib’s 3 million people have already been forced there from their homes in other parts of Syria, according to the United Nations, and any offensive there threatens new displacement and human misery. It could also spark a wider confrontation with Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, whose army has set up observation posts along the Idlib front lines to deter fighting. Turkey’s Hurriyet daily reported that Turkish armed forces were reinforcing the Idlib border with M60 tanks, and Reuters television filmed a convoy heading towards the border. Tuesday’s air strikes came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Assad and his allies not to “recklessly attack” Idlib, saying that hundreds of thousands might die. “HUMAN SHIELDS” The Kremlin on Tuesday dismissed his comments, describing Idlib, where jihadist insurgent factions dominate, as a “nest of terrorism”. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov added: “We know that Syria’s armed forces are preparing to resolve this problem.” Iran echoed that theme. “Terrorist groups [in Idlib] have mixed with the people,” said Abbas Araqchi, deputy foreign minister, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. “They are using people as human shields.” Idlib’s dominant rebel faction is Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance spearheaded by al Qaeda’s former official affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front, though other insurgent groups are also present. Last week the U.N. envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said the Nusra Front and al Qaeda, both of which the international body designates as terrorists, had an estimated 10,000 fighters in Idlib. A top U.S. general estimated there were 20,000-30,000 militants in Idlib, but said if there were major military operations “we can expect humanitarian catastrophe”, and urged operations that mitigated the risks to civilians. On Tuesday de Mistura said ongoing talks between Russia and Turkey held the key to resolving the fate of Idlib without a bloodbath. He said he had heard reports that Damascus had set a Sept. 10 deadline for diplomacy to work before attacking. Turkey fears a major assault on Idlib could send a new wave of refugees towards its border, and wants to maintain a “de-escalation agreement” that it struck with Russia and Iran last year. It has staged two major incursions into Syria, creating a buffer zone along its border in an area north of Aleppo that adjoins Idlib, where it has set up a local administration alongside Syrian rebel groups. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was discussing joint action with Russia to target terrorist groups in Idlib while avoiding a full-scale offensive. Ankara last week added Tahrir al-Sham to its list of designated terrorist groups. PRETEXT FOR ATTACK? “We went to Moscow with our defense minister and intelligence chief. Now talks are ongoing between our soldiers, intelligence agencies and foreign ministries about what kind of steps could be taken,” he said in Ankara late on Monday. Ankara has said the presence of radical groups in Idlib is being used a pretext for a military operation. When he was in Russia in late August, Cavusoglu said “we have to differentiate terrorists from other people”, but added that it was also important to eliminate Russia’s concerns. Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, on a visit to Syria, told Iranian state television: “Our efforts are for... the exit of terrorists from Idlib to be carried out with the least human cost.” He and Peskov said Idlib would be a major subject of discussion at the Sept. 7 summit meeting between Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani. Tuesday’s strikes come after three weeks without Russian air raids in Idlib, though the Syrian military has kept up shelling and some aerial bombardment. Last week a source close to Damascus said the government was preparing a phased assault that would initially target the areas in the south and west of the rebel enclave. That would bring Assad close to reclaiming the major strategic prize in the region, two arterial highways running to Aleppo. Even a staggered offensive like that would involve fighting around Turkish observation posts, potentially triggering a new escalation in an already complex war.

Kylie MacLellan,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy means disaster for Britain, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said, as critics at home and officials in Brussels step up their opposition to her plans for how to leave the European Union. With under two months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union, May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country. Johnson, who some in the governing Conservative Party favour as a potential successor to May, resigned in July in protest at the prime minister’s so-called Chequers plan. “In adopting the Chequers proposals, we have gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank. If we continue on this basis we will throw away most of the advantages of Brexit,” he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper on Monday. “People can see Chequers means disaster.” May’s plan, which is designed to protect cross-border trade with the EU, will mean Britain loses control over its direction, preventing it from becoming more competitive and doing major trade deals with other countries, he said. “We will remain in the EU taxi; but this time locked in the boot, with absolutely no say on the destination.” On Sunday, May sought to allay fears she would cave in to Brussels’ demands in negotiations, saying she would not allow compromises to her Brexit strategy that went against the national interest. But the Times newspaper reported 20 of May’s Conservative lawmakers were now backing the grassroots ‘StandUp4Brexit’ campaign committing to opposing the Chequers plan. Parliament returns from its summer break on Tuesday. May, who has pledged to give lawmakers approval of the final deal with Brussels, has a working majority of 13 members in parliament. If she loses the vote Britain could leave the EU without a deal and possibly force an early election. Conservative lawmaker and former government minister Nick Boles, who has launched a campaign for a “Better Brexit”, said on Monday he didn’t think May had enough support for her proposals. Asked during an interview on BBC Radio what the chances of getting her proposals through parliament, he said: “Very, very small, as close to zero as anything in politics.” British media have reported Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmakers are preparing to unveil an alternative plan for Brexit before the party’s annual conference at the end of the month. EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told a German newspaper on Sunday that he strongly opposed Britain’s proposal. “If we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits. That would be the end of the single market and the European project,” he said.

Reuters Editorial,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese nuclear energy station is relying on emergency back up power after a powerful earthquake knocked out electricity on the northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, a stark reminder of the Fukushima disaster more than seven years ago. The three-reactor Tomari nuclear plant, operated by Hokkaido Electric Power and in shutdown since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, lost power after a magnitude 6.7 quake hit the island in the early hours, the government said. The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. More than 100 have been injured and 19 are missing following the quake, according to broadcaster NHK. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake, the most powerful recorded in Japan, struck off the northern Honshu coast. The quake set off a massive tsunami that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and left nearly 20,000 dead. The quake knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and the tsunami swamped diesel generators placed low in reactor buildings, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years. The crisis led to the shutdown of the country’s nuclear industry, once the world’s third-biggest. Seven reactors have come back online after a protracted relicensing process. The majority of Japanese people remain opposed to nuclear power after Fukushima highlighted failings in regulation and operational procedures in the industry. Hokkaido Electric has shut down all fossil fuel plants, cutting power to all its nearly 3 million customers, a spokesman told Reuters by phone. Japan’s industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, has instructed Hokkaido Electric to restart its biggest coal plant after the station was tripped by the earthquake. The blackout shut down Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport, a popular gateway to the most northern of Japan’s main islands, the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation’s third-biggest. Japan is in the midst of a record tourism boom and will host the Olympics in 2020. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6 a.m., told reporters saving lives was the priority as his government set up a command center to coordinate relief and rescue. A fire broke out at a steel plant operated by Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing in the city of Muroran, but has largely been brought under control, a spokesman told Reuters. Idemitsu Kosan, Japan’s second biggest refiner by sales, stopped all refining and product shipments at its 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery, an official told Reuters.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Rescuers are continuing to look for survivors after a motorway bridge collapsed in the Italian city of Genoa on Tuesday. Police say at least 37 people were killed when dozens of vehicles fell 45m (148ft) from the Morandi bridge during bad weather. The number of people who are reportedly missing ranges from four to 12. Images from the scene show a huge section of the bridge missing, with vehicles perched close to the edge. Here is what we know so far about the disaster. The bridge The Morandi bridge carries a major road, the A10 toll motorway, which serves the Italian Riviera and links northern Italy to France. Media caption Parts of the bridge can be seen collapsing Part of the 1.2km (0.8 mile) long bridge spans the Polcevera waterway, with other portions reaching over railway lines and buildings. It was designed by Riccardo Morandi and completed in 1967, but restructuring work was done in 2016. Some major repairs were also done to the bridge in the 1990s. The motorway operator said work to shore up the bridge's foundation was being carried out at the time of the collapse, during which time it was being constantly monitored. The collapse A section measuring about 200m fell at around 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT). Police say there was a violent cloudburst at the time. It is not yet clear what caused the disaster, but several explanations have been offered. Some experts have suggested that the ongoing maintenance work may have been a factor in the collapse. Others have suggested it may have been caused by a design flaw or heavy traffic. The bridge sees some 25 million vehicles every year, and a 2011 report by an Italian highways company said that the bridge had been suffering from degradation. Antonio Brencich, a structural engineer who lectures at Genoa University, wrote in 2016 that it may have been more economical to rebuild the bridge because of the ongoing maintenance costs. ""There are errors in this bridge. Sooner or later, it will have to be replaced. I don't know when,"" he warned. The victims Image copyright EPA Image caption Rescuers from all over northern Italy came to help Details about those killed in the collapse are continuing to emerge, but some victims have been named. A young family of three were killed after their car fell from the bridge. They have been identified in Italian media as Roberto Robbiano, Ersilia Piccinino, and their seven-year-old son Samuel. Amateur footballer Andrea Cerulli was also killed as he was driving to work. His team in Genoa confirmed his death in a tribute posted to their Facebook page. The survivors Some survivors have recounted dramatic stories of the disaster. The car of Davide Capello, 33, a former goalkeeper for Serie A side Cagliari, went down with the collapsed bridge but he survived. ""I was driving along the bridge, and at a certain point I saw the road in front of me collapse, and I went down with the car,"" he told local media. ""I was able to get out... I don't know how my car wasn't crushed. It seemed like a scene from a film, it was the apocalypse,"" he said. One man who was standing underneath the bridge said the collapse sent him flying more than 10m into a wall. ""I was in front of [my] truck and flew away, like everything else,"" he told the Associated Press. ""Yes, I think it's a miracle. I don't know what to say. I'm out of words,"" he said. The response Image copyright Reuters Image caption Interior Minister and Deputy PM Matteo Salvini said he was committed to finding those responsible Interior Minister and Deputy PM Matteo Salvini said the disaster showed that Italy needed to spend more on infrastructure regardless of European Union budget constraints. ""We should ask ourselves whether respecting these limits is more important than the safety of Italian citizens,"" he said. Obviously for me, it is not."" He added that he was committed to finding those responsible for the ""unacceptable disaster"". ""I will do everything to get the names and surnames of the managers responsible, past and present,"" he said. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli called for resignations at the Italian highways agency which operated the bridge. ""The top management of Autostrade per l'Italia must step down first of all,"" he said in a Facebook post. He added that moves to fine and dissolve the company were under way. But an official from the company insisted the collapse was ""unexpected and unpredictable"". ""The bridge was constantly monitored and supervised well beyond what the law required,"" Stefano Marigliani told Reuters news agency.",What we know so far after a motorway bridge collapsed in the north-western Italian city of Genoa.,2018-08-15T08:40:06Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",What we know about Italy's devastating bridge collapse,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45193452,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EE95/production/_102977016_gens2-nc.png,bbc-news,BBC News,1
Kerry Flynn,"Mount Agung, a volcano on Bali, erupted three times over the weekend, sending a thick ash cloud into the sky over the Indonesian island. Over the weekend, Mount Agung had its first major volcanic eruption since 1963. The latest eruption sent ash more than 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) into the air on Sunday, Bali's Regional Disaster Management Agency told CNN. The volcanic ash plume following the eruption reached an altitude of more than 4.7 miles and activity is still ongoing. SEE ALSO: Drone captures dramatic footage of erupting volcano in Japan The first eruption occurred around 4:30 a.m. ET on Saturday with more continuing over the following day. The disaster management agency advised residents to evacuate from 224 points around the island, according to CNN. The agency recommended no public activities around 3.5 to 4.5 miles from the peak of Mount Agung. At least 14 flights were cancelled, affecting more than 5,500 passengers, the Wall Street Journal reported. Indonesia issued its highest-level aviation warning for flights around Bali, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Mount Agung has been rumbling for months and has shown activity throughout the last week. An eruption began last week and was followed by a low-frequency tremor signal, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. As of last week, the eruptions were only ""phreatic,"" meaning they did not include magma. But that appears to have changed over the weekend, and it is expected to continue to erupt. Last September, the volcano awoke for the first time in five years and led to an evacuation of 140,000 people from their homes. More than half of those who evacuated were advised to return home in October as activity decreased, Indonesian authorities told The Guardian. About 30,000 people in Bali are now living in temporary shelters, according to ABC.","Mount Agung, a volcano on Bali, erupted three times over the weekend, sending a thick ash cloud into the sky over the Indonesian island.

Paul Sandle,"LONDON (Reuters) - Japan’s Shinzo Abe is likely to urge British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday to do everything she can to avoid a disorderly Brexit that some of Japan’s leading companies have warned could be a disaster. 
Japanese firms have spent more than 46 billion pounds ($59 billion) in Britain, encouraged by successive British governments since Margaret Thatcher promising them a business-friendly base from which to trade across Europe. 
The future of Brexit remains deeply uncertain - with options ranging from a disorderly exit from the EU to another membership referendum - because British lawmakers are expected on Jan. 15 to vote down the deal May struck with the EU in November. 
Abe welcomed the deal in November and investors fear that if it is defeated then the world’s fifth largest economy would be 
plunged into a chaotic no-deal Brexit that would severely disrupt supply chains. 
Abe and May will discuss the economic opportunities that exist for both nations as the UK leaves the European Union, Downing Street said ahead of the meeting. 
“The UK and Japan are natural partners,” May said. 
“As the UK prepares to leave the EU, we raise our horizons toward the rest of the world. Our relationship with Japan is stronger than ever, and this visit will enhance co-operation in a wide range of areas.” 
For Abe, however, Britain’s trading relationship with Europe after Brexit will be high on the agenda. He told reporters before his departure to Europe that he would convey Japan’s position on Brexit to May, reports said. 
When the two met at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires in December, Abe asked for May’s support to avoid a “no deal” and to ensure transparency, predictability and legal stability in the process. 
Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda build roughly half of Britain’s nearly 1.7 million cars and have warned about the loss of any free and unfettered trade with the European Union after Brexit. 
The country’s ambassador to Britain, Koji Tsuruoka, issued a blunt warning about Brexit in February when he said Japanese companies would have to leave Britain if trade barriers made them unprofitable. 
“If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - then no private company can continue operations,” he said. “So it is as simple as that.”

Maggie Fick,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia said on Sunday the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane that killed 157 people had “clear similarities” with October’s Lion Air crash, according to analysis of the black boxes recovered from the wreckage of the March 10 disaster. 
Both planes were Boeing 737 MAX 8s, and both crashed minutes after take off after pilots reported flight control problems. Concern over the plane’s safety caused aviation authorities worldwide to ground the model, wiping billions of dollars off Boeing’s market value. 
Investigators are trying to determine why the aircraft plunged into a field shortly after take off from Addis Ababa, searching for possible similarities to an October Lion Air crash that killed 189 people. 
“It was the same case with the Indonesian (Lion Air) one. There were clear similarities between the two crashes so far,” Ethiopian transport ministry spokesman Muse Yiheyis said. 
“The data was successfully recovered. Both the American team and our (Ethiopian) team validated it. The minister thanked the French government. We will let you know more after three or four days,” he told Reuters. 
In Washington, U.S. officials told Reuters that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board have not validated the data yet. 
When investigators, after reviewing black box data, return to Addis Ababa and start conducting interpretive work, the NTSB and FAA will assist in verification and validation of the data, an official said. 
In Paris, France’s BEA air accident investigation agency said data from the jet’s cockpit voice recorder had been successfully downloaded. The French agency said in a tweet it had not listened to the audio files and that the data had been transferred to Ethiopian investigators. 
In Addis Ababa, a source who has listened to the air traffic control recording of the plane’s communications said flight 302 had an unusually high speed after take-off before the plane reported problems and asked permission to climb quickly.

SAFETY ANALYSIS 
A preliminary report on the crash is to be released within 30 days, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing the transport minister. 
The Seattle Times reported that Boeing’s safety analysis of a new flight control system on 737 MAX jets had several crucial flaws. 
The analysis of the system called MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) understated the power of this system, the Seattle Times said, citing current and former engineers at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
The FAA also did not delve into any detailed inquiries and followed a standard certification process on the MAX, the Seattle Times reported citing an FAA spokesman. 
The FAA declined to comment on the Seattle Times report but referred to previous statements about the certification process. It has said the 737-MAX certification process followed the FAA’s standard certification process. 
The report also said both Boeing and the FAA were informed of the specifics of this story and were asked for responses 11 days ago, before the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX last Sunday that killed all 157 people on board. The same model flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October, killing all 189 on board. 
Last Monday Boeing said it would deploy a software upgrade to the 737 MAX 8, a few hours after the FAA said it would mandate “design changes” in the aircraft by April. 
A Boeing spokesman said 737 MAX was certified in accordance with the identical FAA requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives. The spokesman said the FAA concluded that MCAS on 737 MAX met all certification and regulatory requirements. 
In Addis Ababa, aviation staff gathered at Bole International Airport to remember the two pilots and six crew, who perished along with the 149 passengers. 
Weeping women held single stems in their shaking hands. Banks of the white flowers, the traditional color of mourning, were placed in front of a row of empty coffins at the ceremony.

Kate Stillwell,"December 6, 2018 8 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. In the Women Entrepreneur series My Worst Moment, female founders provide a firsthand account of the most difficult, gut-wrenching, almost-made-them-give-up experience they had while building their business -- and how they recovered. Jumpstart, which launched on Oct. 2, 2018, is a new type of natural disaster insurance that helps families and individuals bounce back from earthquakes through an immediate payout initiated via text message. Jumpstart connects the insured person to the insurer. Founder and CEO Kate Stillwell said she believes her company is, at its core, about resilience -- ensuring more money comes into the system after natural disasters and creating an upward spiral of recovery. But when natural disasters occur, everyone experiences losses at the same time, so insurers themselves need insurance (“reinsurance”). She tells us about her worst moment, when Jumpstart unexpectedly lost a partnership and up to $100 million was at stake. What follows is a firsthand account of this person’s experience. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. My worst moment was eight days before Jumpstart’s initial planned launch, about a year ago. We had built up a team of eight people. For 16 months we had worked shoulder-to-shoulder with our reinsurance partner, in preparation to sign the agreement that would authorize us to start selling policies on their behalf (and fund us with six months of runway). But someone got cold feet, and up to $100 million -- the entire pot of money we had in capital reserves to pay out our customers -- was at stake. I was in our office in a coworking space in Oakland, meeting with my team as part of our weekly “sprint.” My phone rang, and since I recognized the number calling was our partner’s account manager, I excused myself and walked into the common space. The account manager had been my primary point of contact for the past 16 months, and I could hear that he was close to tears. I remember him saying that he wished he wasn’t the one who had to give me the news but that it had been decided that our two companies were no longer going to be working together. They had called off the partnership. There was silence for about 10 seconds. I asked if he could tell me why, and I remember hearing that it was a combination of the high risks and the fact that we were a startup. Eventually, we hung up. Since Jumpstart pays out in earthquakes, where everyone needs money at once, we need access to a large pool of capital. But a startup doesn’t have millions of dollars in reserve, so we partner with one or more established companies who have deep pockets to make the payouts. There’s a David and a Goliath dynamic; we’re mutually dependent. The product can only be sold if we cooperate. The difference is, for “David” (us), this is the only product: cooperation is life or death. For the “Goliath” (the partner), this is one of many products -- they have other income streams. In my previous startup, we had a great partnership with this particular Goliath, so against the number-one piece of advice from almost everyone in the industry, I had agreed to be exclusive. That was my first mistake -- let’s call it an error of optimism. Another of my mistakes? I took at face value a claim that the partner would make us an investment worth several months of runway. I should have raised funds sooner from other sources. I felt blindsided, but that’s only because I was wearing rose-colored blinders. I should have seen the signs -- months of delays, creating new hurdles each time we cleared the last one, the right hand not talking to the left hand, reasons that didn’t quite add up. I returned to the team and pretended like nothing had happened because they were still in the middle of the meeting. That day it was my turn to drive the carpool of kids home from school, so I picked them up and then texted my mother about what had happened. I was very withdrawn. I remember that my mother gave me what I wanted to hear -- “You don’t deserve that!” -- while my husband had a different mindset: “Well, you knew this could happen.” Without the authority to sell, we couldn’t launch -- and we were at negative runway. The day after I got the call, I had to break the news to eight different people on the team individually. One of my teammates was leaving the next day to settle her late mother’s estate. I asked if I could drive her to the airport in the morning. She knew something was up. On the way, I remember telling her how sorry I was but that we’d have to let her go. We’d both known going into it that working for a startup is risky, but it was hard because we’d just hired her about six weeks before, and it was her first job after a career change. I went back to the office and met with our main developer, who was a contractor, and told him the bad news. I remember saying, “We have no more money. The launch is now many months, if not years, away. We don’t know what the future of the company is, and I’m going to be laying off everybody else.” He spent the next two to four hours buttoning things up and left. After that, I told another co-worker what happened -- and that I didn’t have to lay him off that day, but we were at risk, and I didn’t know exactly what would happen over the next two weeks. I told him it would be a good idea to start looking for other jobs. And that night, I had dinner with another teammate and told her the same thing. That’s how the team went from eight to six in one day. There we were: no launch, team gone, out of money, no basis of raising money. I was angry, humiliated and just plain sad. But I was still optimistic: We had fallen off the proverbial cliff, but we didn’t die. The core value proposition of our product -- what we’re fundamentally selling -- is personal resilience. It’s resources to tap into the inner strength that’s already there and adapt to the new normal after a shock. So, as a company, I thought, we’d better be able to walk that talk. Five weeks after that initial call, me and two of my remaining teammates -- people who knew their jobs would likely be gone soon -- took a huge risk. We decided to spend the company’s remaining funds on a flashy publicity stunt at an insurance conference in Las Vegas. We brought a “shake trailer” -- which simulates an earthquake -- and 400 conference attendees took a ride in it. One of them called it “brilliant marketing” and the “most fun thing” at the conference. About eight months later, his company would end up being our next partner. But that was months away. On the afternoon of the conference’s second day, I had to sit down with both team members who had accompanied me. I remember telling them, “I can’t pay you after today. I have to lay you both off.” One of them burst into tears. It took us over a year to make a comeback, but we survived by the grace of a few industry insiders who provided enough funding to tide us over. I remember them saying, “We know what happened to you, and it sucks. No one should have to go through that. We want to make sure you come out alive.” From this experience, I learned that there’s no other choice than to be optimistic. Entrepreneurs are creating the future -- not just for ourselves but for our communities and our collective children. That’s a huge responsibility and a huge opportunity. Having the courage to be optimistic -- in the face of setbacks, in spite of shock -- is the test of being a true entrepreneur. To others going through something similar, my advice is to stay optimistic and make decisions assuming the best. I relied solely on optimism and didn’t have enough of a safety net or plan B, so along with optimism, make a freaking backup plan!","Kate Stillwell, founder and CEO of Jumpstart, a natural disaster insurance startup, built her company back up after a devastating blow.",2018-12-06T22:04:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}","How This Entrepreneur Bounced Back After Losing a Partnership, Laying Off Her Team and Dealing with $100 Million at Stake",https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324254,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20181206215816-35031400111-39e8faac7e-o-crop.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,1
Jon Brodkin,"Enlarge / AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson. 24 AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson yesterday urged Congress to pass net neutrality and consumer data privacy laws that would prevent states from issuing their own stricter laws. ""There are a number of states that are now passing their own legislation around privacy and, by the way, net neutrality,"" Stephenson said in an interview at a Wall Street Journal tech conference ( see video ). ""What would be a total disaster for the technology and innovation you see happening in Silicon Valley and elsewhere is to pick our head up and have 50 different sets of rules for companies trying to operate in the United States."" There was a single US standard for net neutrality passed by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015. But AT&amp;T and other ISPs opposed it and sued the FCC in a failed effort to get the regulation thrown out by a court. The FCC repealed those rules after President Trump appointed Republican Ajit Pai to lead the FCC. Now that states such as California are trying to impose their own net neutrality rules, AT&amp;T wants another federal standard that won't be as strict as the state laws or the repealed federal regulations. The Journal didn't post full video of Stephenson's interview but described his other remarks on net neutrality in an article. ""There should be no blocking,"" ISPs ""should not be allowed to throttle somebody else's content,"" and any device should be allowed to connect to the Internet without interference, he said, according to the Journal. Stephenson apparently made no mention of banning paid prioritization, which was banned under the now-repealed FCC rules and by the California law that AT&amp;T and other ISPs are fighting in court. The omission makes sense, given that AT&amp;T has previously argued that some forms of paid prioritization should be allowed. Stephenson also apparently did not call for any limitations on zero-rating, the practice of exempting some Internet content from data caps, often in exchange for payment from content providers. The California law would ban paid zero-rating, which would force AT&amp;T to stop charging companies for data cap exemptions. (The California law is being challenged in court by the broadband industry and Trump administration, which says state laws are preempted by the federal net neutrality repeal. California agreed to suspend its law until litigation over the federal preemption is over.)

Reuters Editorial,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A storm ravaging southern Africa is possibly the worst weather-related disaster ever to hit the southern hemisphere, with 1.7 million people in the path of the cyclone in Mozambique and 920,000 affected in Malawi, U.N. officials said on Tuesday. 
Storm surge floods up to 6 meters deep had caused “incredible devastation” over a huge area, World Food Programme regional chief Lola Castro said. The Buzi river had burst its banks, killing hundreds, and there was risk of more flooding in the Buzi, Pungoe and Save river basins in the next 72 hours.

Cindy Silviana,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Garuda Indonesia has asked to cancel an order for 49 Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 jets, citing a loss of passenger trust following two crashes, although it had been reconsidering the order before the latest disaster in Ethiopia last week. 
Garuda is the first airline to publicly confirm plans to scrap an order for the jets after the Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people. That accident came five months after a Lion Air 737 MAX crashed off Indonesia killing 189, and led to the grounding of the world’s entire fleet of the aircraft. 
“Many passengers told us they were afraid to get on a MAX 8,” Garuda CEO Ari Askhara told Reuters on Friday. 
An analyst, however, noted that Garuda had been looking at its fleet planning before the Ethiopian crash. 
“This is an opportunity to make some changes that otherwise may be difficult to do,” CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. 
Analysts last week said the grounding of the 737 MAX fleet could give some airlines a good excuse to delay or cancel purchases, saving cash on their balance sheets. 
Garuda could switch its order, valued at $6 billion at list prices, to other Boeing models, Chief Financial Officer Fuad Rizal said. 
He said negotiations with Boeing were ongoing and Airbus SE jets were not under consideration. 
The airline has only one 737 MAX in its fleet and its prior generation 737s remain relatively young. In 2017, the airline pushed back the rest of the deliveries to 2020 and beyond due to financial difficulties. 
Askhara said last week it was possible it would cancel the order for 20 of the jets, with a final decision depending on what the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration does after the Ethiopian crash. 
He told Reuters before the crash that the airline had decided to reduce the Boeing 737 MAX order from 49 by swapping some to widebody Boeing models. That could help it salvage deposits made on the 737 MAX planes. 
Boeing declined to comment on customer discussions. 
Indonesian rival Lion Air has been reconsidering its orders since its October crash.

Aaron Maasho,"ADDIS ABABA/BEIJING (Reuters) - China and Ethiopia grounded their Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 fleets on Monday while investigators found the black box from a crash that killed 157 people in the second disaster involving that airplane model in the last six months. 
The Ethiopian Airlines jet bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa on Sunday, killing all on board. 
The victims came from 33 nations and included 22 United Nations’ staff. 
The discovery of the black box, reported by Ethiopian state TV, may shed light on the cause, though there was no immediate indication if it was the flight data or cockpit voice recorder. 
At the scene, men in Red Cross jackets picked through the dirt, putting items in black paper bags, while investigators hunted for the black box voice recorders. 
“Although we don’t yet know the cause of the crash, we had to decide to ground the particular fleet as extra safety precaution,” Ethiopian Airlines said. It has four other 737 MAX 8 jets, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. 
China on Monday also ordered its airlines to suspend operations of their 737 MAX 8 jets by 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) following the crash, the second of a Boeing 737 MAX jet since one run by Indonesia’s Lion Air crashed in October. 
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said it would notify airlines when they could resume flying the jets, after contacting Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
“Given that two accidents both involved newly delivered Boeing 737-8 planes and happened during take-off phase, they have some degree of similarity,” the CAAC said, adding the step was in line with its principle of zero tolerance of safety hazards. The 737 MAX 8 is sometimes referred to as the 737-8. 
DAY OF MOURNING 
A senior U.S. government official said it was too early to tell if there was any direct connection between the two accidents, but that reviewing the issue would be among the top priorities for investigators. 
Ethiopia’s parliament declared Monday a day of mourning, while a global summit in Nairobi opened with a moment of silence as some wept for the U.N. members killed in one of the deadliest aviation accidents in the organization’s history. 
The dead include a 28-year-old Norwegian Red Cross worker, three Austrian aid workers on their way to Zanzibar, a Nigerian-Canadian professor known for mentoring young colleagues, and an Italian archaeologist, employers and foreign ministries said. 
The pilot Yared Getachew, who was a joint Ethiopian-Kenyan national, had a “commendable record” and more than 8,000 hours of flying experience, the airline said. 
Kenyan authorities had managed to contact the families of 25 of the 32 Kenyan passengers, cabinet secretary for transport James Macharia told journalists at the airport on Monday. 
The 737 is the world’s best selling modern passenger aircraft and is seen as one of the industry’s most reliable.

LEAH C. STOKES,"We say the extreme rain caused this disaster. We say it was the fire. And we say that multiple years of drought didn’t help. But what caused the rain, the fire and the drought? There is a clear climate signature in the disaster in Santa Barbara. We know that climate change is making California’s extreme rainfall events more frequent. We know it’s worsening our fires. We know that it contributed substantially to the latest drought. There are simpler stories we could tell. Stories with more proximate causes: Those people bought in dangerous places. Those people should have left their homes. Those people are somehow to blame. These events are normal. These things just happen there. But these simple stories mask a larger truth. How many times do we need to hear adjectives in their superlative form before we spot a pattern: largest, rainiest, driest, deadliest? Records, by their nature, are not meant to be set annually. And yet that’s what is happening. The costliest year for natural disasters in the United States was 2017. One of the longest and most severe droughts in California history concluded for most parts of the state in 2017. The five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2006, with 2017 expected to be one of the warmest yet again. I have researched climate change policy for over a decade now. For a long time, we assumed that climate policy was stalled because it was a problem for the future. Or it would affect other people. Poorer people. Animals. Ecosystems. We assumed those parts of the world were separate from us. That we were somehow insulated. I didn’t expect to see it in my own backyard so soon. Climate change devastated ecosystems, species and neighborhoods in Houston and much of struggling Puerto Rico last year. Now climate change has ravaged one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the country. We know now that even the richest among us is not insulated. These extreme events are getting worse. But when I read the news after each fresh disaster, I rarely see a mention of climate change. Whether it’s coverage of a fire in my backyard or a powerful hurricane in the Caribbean, this bigger story is usually missing. To say that it is too soon to talk about the causes of a crisis is wrongheaded. We must connect the dots. Climate change helped cost my friends’ businesses’ revenue. Climate change helped put my community in chaos for weeks. Climate change paved the way for lost lives next door. If climate victims here and across the globe understood that carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels played a role in their losses, perhaps they would rise up to demand policy changes. We know this could happen because research from the political scientist Regina Bateson, now a congressional candidate in California, shows that being a crime victim can spur people into activism. Perhaps some of the people affected by the fires in California, the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas, and the drought in the Dakotas will be similarly motivated. Maybe some of these climate change victims will become the climate policy champions we sorely need. It is never too soon after one of these disasters to speak truth about climate change’s role. If anything, it is too late. If we do not name the problem, we cannot hope to solve it. For my community, as much as yours, I hope we will.

GAIL COLLINS,"In 2003, when Trump wanted to borrow another wad of cash, Deutsche Bank invited potential bond investors to come in and hear his pitch. Tons of people responded. The problem, as Enrich reports, was that the vast majority just wanted to get a glimpse of a celebrity and had no plans on entrusting him with their money.
See? Sometimes the system works. However, eventually, the bankers did manage to find some buyers. After which Trump defaulted.
And back again! Deutsche Bank gave him a $640 million loan for a skyscraper he wanted to build in Chicago. The bankers must have been nervous, but Trump made a great sales pitch he even promised to put Ivanka in charge of the project.
Think about this. What was Ivankas best-known project to date? Jared.
At this point the bank did a review of Trumps claim that he was worth about $3 billion and discovered it was more like $788 million.
But hey. Hes friends with Mike Tyson.
The skyscraper got built, but nobody seemed to want to live there. Trump, who had personally guaranteed $40 million of the loan, then went to court, pointing to a clause in the contract that said he wouldnt have to cough up the money in the event of a natural disaster. And what about the recession? Was that a natural disaster or what?
Onward. More loans from Deutsche Bank. Some of which he used to pay back Deutsche Bank. Nobody seemed to think that was crazy.
So, whats the problem here?

Laignee Barron,"The Nigerian government has confirmed that 110 girls are missing after suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a school in the northeast of the country last week. The kidnapping is believed to be the largest abduction since Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school in Chibok almost four years ago. On Feb. 19, armed insurgents attacked the Government Science and Technical College in the town of Dapchi in Yobe state, Reuters reports. Initially, it was unclear how many girls had been abducted, with some reports saying 50 were missing. The state government then said on Wednesday that some of the girls had been rescued, prompting confusion and then despair when it turned out not to be the case. Frantic parents put together their own list of the missing, estimating that some 105 girls were unaccounted for in the wake of the attack, according to Reuters. In a statement issued Sunday, the Information Ministry confirmed the parents’ fears: 110 girls have disappeared. On Monday, Nigeria said it had deployed extra troops and planes to search for the missing girls, according to the BBC. President Muhammadu Buhari called the kidnappings a “national disaster.” Read More: Boko Haram’s Other Victims The attack in Dapchi brings back painful memories of the 2014 Chibok abduction that garnered international attention with the worldwide #BringBackOurGirls campaign to pressure the Nigerian government into action. More than 100 girls are still missing from that attack. Boko Haram, an extremist group trying to institute an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria, has been waging a violent insurgency since 2009.

ADAM LIPTAK and MAGGIE HABERMAN,"“Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster, he turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare,” Mr. Trump said in 2016, presumably referring to Chief Justice Roberts’s votes to sustain President Barack Obama’s health care law. There is reason to think, then, that Mr. Trump’s praise of Justice Kennedy was strategic. Then, after Justice Gorsuch’s nomination was announced, a White House official singled out two candidates for the next Supreme Court vacancy: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge Raymond M. Kethledge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. The two judges had something in common: They had both clerked for Justice Kennedy. In the meantime, as the White House turned to stocking the lower courts, it did not overlook Justice Kennedy’s clerks. Mr. Trump nominated three of them to federal appeals courts: Judges Stephanos Bibas and Michael Scudder, both of whom have been confirmed, and Eric Murphy, the Ohio solicitor general, whom Mr. Trump nominated to the Sixth Circuit this month. One person who knows both men remarked on the affinity between Mr. Trump and Justice Kennedy, which is not obvious at first glance. Justice Kennedy is bookish and abstract, while Mr. Trump is earthy and direct. But they had a connection, one Mr. Trump was quick to note in the moments after his first address to Congress in February 2017. As he made his way out of the chamber, Mr. Trump paused to chat with the justice. “Say hello to your boy,” Mr. Trump said. “Special guy.” Mr. Trump was apparently referring to Justice Kennedy’s son, Justin. The younger Mr. Kennedy spent more than a decade at Deutsche Bank, eventually rising to become the bank’s global head of real estate capital markets, and he worked closely with Mr. Trump when he was a real estate developer, according to two people with knowledge of his role. During Mr. Kennedy’s tenure, Deutsche Bank became Mr. Trump’s most important lender, dispensing well over $1 billion in loans to him for the renovation and construction of skyscrapers in New York and Chicago at a time other mainstream banks were wary of doing business with him because of his troubled business history.","Justice Anthony M.

David Lumb,"Another unnamed HI-EMA official has quit before facing disciplinary action and a fourth employee was suspended without pay, but it isn't clear yet what either of their roles were in the fiasco. As state and FCC investigations into the vents of January 13th have revealed, the fired officer wasn't required to check with a colleague or get managerial approval before sending the emergency blast to mobile phones, TV and radio stations across the state. There weren't safeguards in place to prevent one employee from erroneously warning the whole state on their own, an FCC staffer told Time. The test and real alerts used the exact same prompts and language, which ended up confusing the fired officer. Further, the state didn't have procedures to correct mistaken alerts at all. The messaging disaster served as a grim dry run that revealed a widespread unpreparedness to handle if, and when, this emergency warning system went awry. This was the sobering lesson the exiting HI-EMA administrator Miyagi left in a statement sent out by the agency on his behalf, which read in part: ""To the people of Hawaii, recent events have cast a bright light on our emergency preparedness, and caused many of you to consider whether you are ready for the emergencies we will surely face.

Lauren Migaki,"Clark Howe, age 12, poses for a portrait. Lauren Migaki/NPR With wildfires still raging across parts of Southern California, dozens of schools have been closed. Many will stay that way till the new year. That gives educators valuable time to think about what they can do, when school resumes, to help students who have been traumatized by these fires. One answer can be found a few hundred miles north, in Santa Rosa, California. In late October, students there returned to class after three weeks away. A massive wildfire had swept through the city of 175,000 and the surrounding county, killing at least 22 people and destroying or damaging at least 5,500 structures. The Tubbs fire took the homes of many students at Northwest Prep Charter School, a small secondary school in northwestern Santa Rosa. Given the trauma their community had just experienced, teachers knew they couldn't dive right back into algebra. On the first day back, all 75 students at Northwest Prep gathered in a community circle and spoke about the fire's impact on their lives. ""I think every one of the students who lost a home spoke during that discussion, which we didn't expect,"" says Jessica Hadid, the language and communication teacher there. One of those kids was Clark Howe. The seventh-grader remembers Oct. 9 clearly: He woke up to a chaotic scene around 1:30 a.m. His dad told him they needed to leave right away. Clark grabbed some of his things and rounded up the family dogs. After picking up a neighbor who couldn't drive, his family headed out onto the packed roads, full of other people evacuating their homes. ""We were all really nervous, there were just cars everywhere, people driving on the wrong side of the road, fires starting on lawns,"" Clark says. ""We were all just really scared for what could happen."" His family made it to safety, but their home, located in Santa Rosa's Coffey Park neighborhood, was completely destroyed. They lost some of their most prized possessions: a classic Mustang in the garage, some favorite stuffed animals left behind in Clark's bedroom. ""Nothing was left,"" Clark says. ""Everybody lost something."" Before returning to school, Northwest Prep's teaching staff received trauma-based training to help students cope with the aftermath of the fires. But the teachers also wanted to do something in the classroom. ""We realized we needed to do something, as a school, to help our students and really our whole community process what we'd all been through,"" says Alyssa Dossat, a math teacher at Northwest Prep. When she was evacuated from her own home, Dossat took her kids to a museum. Her 7-year-old was looking at an exhibit about earthquakes that struck California in 1906 and 1989. ""She was reading it going, 'Mom, who, who wrote this? Who are these quotes from?'"" Dossat says. ""I said, 'They're just from people, sweetie, that's how it works. That's how we record history that way.'"" In that moment, Dossat had an idea. This could be done in her school. At that, an oral history assignment was born. As part of the project, Northwest Prep students will use their smartphones and tablets to record stories from the Tubbs fire and its impact on the Santa Rosa community. From there, students will curate and archive the firsthand accounts. The fire has brought the community together, says Adam Napoleon, a social systems teacher. He hopes the project will go beyond storytelling and provide a ""sense of healing"" to both the students and their interviewees. ""They can provide not only this historical record, but this emotional healing aspect that a lot of people in our community need right now,"" he says. After the fire, Clark Howe was eager to get back to school and be with his friends — many of whom also lost their homes. As he returned, he sometimes found it hard to talk about the fire and remember all that was lost. But, Clark says, it's also been really helpful to talk about it — and he can't believe the support he has received from his community. His family received many donations and has since been able to relocate to an apartment building. They plan to rebuild their home. Last weekend, Clark's family and neighbors returned to their old neighborhood to put Christmas decorations on one of the only trees left standing after the fire. ""We're not struggling very much anymore. We're looking for some good holidays,"" he says.","Experiencing a natural disaster can traumatize children.

Alana Abramson,"Given their impending battle to regain control of Congress, Democrats didn’t need a reason to worry about their fundraising efforts lagging behind that of Republicans. But on Wednesday, the Supreme Court handed them one. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled in the case of Janus v. AFSCME that public sector employees do not have to pay agency fees — funds that support collective bargaining — if they are not union members. The decision reversed 1977’s Abood v. Detroit Board of Education and voided laws in 22 states mandating that employees pay such fees. Unions quickly framed the widely-expected decision as an example of corporations’ ability to exert power over the working class. “A bare majority of the court, over the vigorous dissent of four justices, has conceded to the dark web of corporations and wealthy donors who wish to take away the freedoms of working people,” read an AFL-CIO statement. The case has significant political ramifications, particularly for Democratic fundraising efforts. Unions are not allowed to use agency fees for political activity; those funds must go towards collective bargaining. But experts say the loss of such funds could force unions to spend money on bargaining they might otherwise have used for different purposes, like political activity. (While unions are prohibited from using their treasury to donate directly to candidates’ coffers, they can use it for independent expenditures and contributions to outside groups). Given unions’ typically leftward political leanings, that could be particularly painful for Democrats. “To the degree that money is fungible, this could have a negative effect on [unions’] ability to recruit as well as on political activities,” said Sheila Krumholz, the Executive Director of the Center for Responsive Politics. “If they have less to spend from agency fees on collective bargaining, where will that money come from? They won’t stop collective bargaining, perhaps it will come from the membership dues that could be spent on political activity.” Union leaders aren’t copping to any changes in their spending strategy just yet. “We just don’t know what the impact is going be on contributions, [and] what decisions any particular union will make given the situation they are faced with,” said AFL-CIO General Counsel Lynn Rhinehart. But James Feigenbaum, a Boston University economics professor who studies the labor movement, said that after laws voiding agency fees were passed in Michigan and Wisconsin, donation money was indeed shifted away. “It’s really a reduction in the amount of money coming from unions, but also the reduction in the amount of money taken in by Democrats,” he said. It’s likely the same phenomenon will replicate itself on the national level. Democratic candidates are so far repeatedly out-raising their Republican counterparts ahead of November’s midterm elections. But when it comes to party organizations like the Republican and Democratic National Committees, and outside groups like Super PACs, Republicans still have the advantage. Unions don’t necessarily close this gap, but they help level the playing field somewhat. AFSCME, the defendant in the Supreme Court case decided this week, donated $15 million during the 2016 election, according to an analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics. Much of that money went towards liberal Super PACs like House Majority PAC, Priorities USA, and For our Future, which labor unions launched that cycle in conjunction with Tom Steyer. Labor unions as a whole spent over $217 million in 2016; 88 percent of the $67 million they contributed directly to candidates went to Democrats. This cycle, labor unions have already spent $74 million; nearly half of those funds went to Democratic candidates. “This is a political disaster for the Democratic Party,” Taylor Dark, an associate professor at California State University Los Angeles and the author of The Unions and the Democrats: An Enduring Alliance, wrote in an e-mail to TIME. “The reason is simple: public employees unions are large, with vast sums of money, and they have been able to use their money and staff to promote Democratic ideas, candidates, and legislation. The Janus ruling makes that all much more difficult.” President Trump was even more blunt in his assessment. “Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!” Trump tweeted Wednesday after the ruling. One Democratic aide, who requested anonymity to discuss internal fundraising dynamics, offered a similar sentiment: “It’s probably safe to say it’s not helpful for democratic campaigns or progressive groups.” It’s likely that this outcome is exactly what those bankrolling Janus wanted. Plaintiff Mark Janus was represented by the Liberty Justice Center; The New York Times reported in February that the organization’s key financial supporter was Republican mega-donor Richard Uihlein. Meanwhile, the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute published a paper in February linking a string of court cases challenging unions to a hub of wealthy conservative donors, including Uihlein and the Koch brothers. Still, some Democrats remain optimistic that the decision will serve to rally progressives spiritually and financially, potentially dulling the impact. “Anything that exposes how hard Republicans worked to protect corporate interests will energize small dollar democratic donors; we’ve seen that from Citizens United to the fight around the tax plan and we will see it around Janus,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who ran the Democratic Congressional Campaign’s independent expenditures in 2014. “For every dollar they think they have taken from unions, I think they are going to be met by a dollar infused from the grassroots.”",'This is a political disaster for the Democratic Party',2018-06-29T20:19:01Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The Supreme Court’s Union Fees Decision Could Be a Huge Blow for Democrats,http://time.com/5323537/supreme-court-janus-unions-fundraising/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/janus.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Hungry survivors of an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia said on Wednesday they were scavenging for food in farms as President Joko Widodo made a second visit to the area to ramp up aid efforts five days after disaster struck. The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered. (GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo ) But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has yet to be restored. But rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people. Johnny Lim, a restaurant owner reached by telephone in Donggala town, said he was surviving on coconuts. “It’s a zombie town. Everything’s destroyed. Nothing’s left,” Lim said over a crackling line. “We’re on our last legs. There’s no food, no water.” In another part of Donggala district, which has a population of 300,000 people, Ahmad Derajat, said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards. “What we’re relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,” said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams. “Why aren’t they dropping aid by helicopter?” he asked. Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter. “Everyone is desperate for food and water. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike. Underlining a growing sense of urgency, President Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu. “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters. ‘PRESIDENT NOT HEARING’ Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins. Yahdi Basma, a leader from a village south of Palu hoping to get his family on a cargo plane out, said Widodo had no idea of the extent of the suffering. “The president is not hearing about the remote areas, only about the tsunami and about Palu,” he said. “There are hundreds of people still buried under the mud in my village... There is no aid whatsoever which is why we’re leaving.” At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”. The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Indonesian Red Cross disaster responders said the village of Petobo, just south of Palu, which was home to almost 500 people, had been “wiped off the map”. “They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,” Iris van Deinse, of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement. Nearby, rescue workers, some using an excavator, were searching for 52 children missing since liquefaction destroyed their bible study camp. Bodies of 35 of the children have been found. Aircraft, tents, water treatment facilities and generators were the main needs for survivors including more than 70,000 displaced people, according to the national disaster mitigation agency spokesman. Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted on Wednesday but there were no reports of casualties or damage.

KHMER TIMES,"JAKARTA: Dozens of tourists were evacuated on Sunday from a waterfall site hit by landslides in the Indonesian holiday island of Lombok, where two people died, authorities said.
Two moderate earthquakes struck Lombok on Sunday afternoon, triggering the landslides when tourists were visiting the Tiu Kelep waterfall, north of the island, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster agency, said in a statement.
The disaster agency said the two people who died were both Malaysians, but state news agency Antara reported only one was a Malaysian.
Fourteen Indonesians and 22 other Malaysians were rescued from the waterfall site, Nugroho said.
In Indonesias easternmost province of Papua, flash floods and landslides triggered by torrential rain had killed at least 58 people, injured dozens and displaced more than 4,000, authorities said on Sunday.
A search for more possible victims was under way in the town of Sentani, which was hit by flash floods late on Saturday. 51 people were killed and 74 injured there, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the national disaster agency, told a news briefing.
Heavy rain caused landslides in the nearby provincial capital of Jayapura, killing seven there, Nugroho said.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Elon Musk’s interview with the New York Times last August gave the public a rare glimpse of the psychological challenges the iconic founder has faced as he attempts to lead two companies -- each valued at well over $1 billion -- into the next decade.
Over the course of the hour-long conversation, the Tesla and SpaceX boss admitted that 2018 had been both physically and emotionally exhausting; he claimed that he’d worked up to 120 hours per week. This concession heightened rumors that Tesla was working furiously to find a capable assistant who could shoulder some of its CEO's current responsibilities.
While Musk is certainly unique, the primary challenge he faces -- namely, how to make the best use of each precious minute he has -- is the same dilemma confronting every business leader. He’s an entrepreneur at heart, and like most entrepreneurs, he tends to want to be involved in every aspect of the company he has dedicated his life to building.
Related: The Art and Science of Delegation
In reality, of course, even for a midsize business, such a ""hands-on"" approach is simply not possible. Though multiple media outlets have asserted that Musk tries to do too much, micromanaging projects and employees rather than truly ""leading"" his company, people seem to forget that this same approach is what allowed him to get as far as he has.
Knowing when to let go
Delegating responsibility to capable employees can be the best course of action for most entrepreneurs. Sometimes, though, it can be a disaster. Only by immersing yourself in your product and your team will you gain the understanding needed to lead and motivate the people working for you. That way, when it is time to delegate responsibility, you won't risk delegating tasks to the wrong person. Reason: You'll have already worked alongside that person and learned his or her strengths and weaknesses.
Here are three more factors to think about it when you're deciding whether to delegate a task:
1. Be involved early.
In the gestational stages of a startup, before a seed round has been raised or a product has launched, it’s important that founders be involved in every task. Even after the company has gained some initial traction, founders should again be present during regular performance reviews and clearly understand the company’s financial health.
At any true tech startup, at least one founder should be regularly involved in product development and testing. In short, leaders should know enough about their companies to be able to temporarily take over any position should the need arise.
In 2016, Render Media was one of the fastest-growing companies in America. Ultimately, a change to Facebook's algorithms forced the startup to shut down, but its initial success was widely attributed to the hands-on management style of its founders.
CEO Vic Belonogoff demonstrated this by doing everything from writing and publishing content, to learning how to use Drupal, to trafficking ads, all of which allowed him to gain his employees' respect and keep costs under control as the company grew.
Related: Learn When to Delegate and When to Micromanage
2. Listen to your employees.
If your employees tell you you probably shouldn’t be working on a particular task, that’s a sign. Your team will often drop hints if they think you’re trying to do too much; they may even be straightforward about it. Either way, don’t ignore them. Instead, look for ways to help them do the task themselves.
Majid Al Futtaim owns and operates more than 20 malls throughout the Middle East, including one of the largest in the world, the Mall of the Emirates. He walks each of those malls every week, paying attention to the numbers of bags shoppers are carrying and the merchandise in those bags.
This “shopping bag test” allows him to notice things that his employees might not -- and redirect their focus, if necessary.
Whether you’re a middle manager or the CEO, know that ""delegating"" doesn't mean giving yourself less responsibility. Instead the goal is to make ensure that the responsibilities you do have are properly aligned with those where your time is best spent.
Related: Should You Delegate That? A Comprehensive Guide
3. Know your worth.
When deciding whether you should devote hours to a particular task, it can be helpful to know the monetary value of your time. Determine your hourly rate -- $150 an hour, for example -- and then decide whether someone else could do the same task and achieve the same results for less. If so, delegate that work.
Naturally, you’ll always want to be doing things that you love to do. Oftentimes, the joy you get from those activities is worth occasional lost productivity. Putting a real price on your time can help you understand what those hours cost and can be critical to your success as a founder.
There's an interesting calculator powered by an organization called Clearer Thinking that helps you weigh all the variables and determine what your time is actually worth beyond simple salary. Ultimately, the old adage is true: Time is money. You should waste neither.
Let's be clear about one thing: You are not an entrepreneur if you delegate most or all of your important duties. An entrepreneur is, by definition, someone who constantly gets his or her hands dirty solving problems.
Delegation is only a means to offload duties less centric to your core capabilities as a founder so that you can focus on where you deliver the most value. Far too much bad advice comes from teachers and online articles and claims that if you don't delegate excessively, you are not a real leader. This thinking is myopic and ego-centric.
Delegating too early and delegating the wrong duties is actually more damaging for your business than not delegating at all. The most successful entrepreneurs, Musk included, know this all too well.","Offloading tasks and responsibilities is sometimes just the right move -- but done prematurely or unwisely, it can be an unmitigated disaster.",2019-02-08T17:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",The Hard Truths to Tell Yourself About Delegating Responsibility,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/327675,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20190207192250-GettyImages-1095046960.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,1
LISA FRIEDMAN and HIROKO TABUCHI,"The agency will officially publish its proposed rule in the Federal Register on Friday and give the public 30 days to comment on the plan. “By reducing the regulatory burden on industry, we are encouraging increased domestic oil and gas production while maintaining a high bar for safety and environmental sustainability,” Scott A. Angelle, director of the safety bureau, said in a statement. Industry groups like the American Petroleum Institute have long opposed the safety rules, calling them “flawed and costly.” The fossil fuel interest group warned in 2015 that the regulations would reduce capital investment in the Gulf by $4 billion a year and threaten 50,000 industry jobs. The National Ocean Industries Association, which also represents domestic offshore energy firms, welcomed the move. “The proposed revisions to the Production Safety Systems Rule mark an integral step in the regulatory reform promised by President Trump,” Randall Luthi, the group’s president, said in comments released on Thursday. “This ‘second bite at the apple’ provides an opportunity for further dialogue, discussion and debate to assure the nation’s offshore energy resources are developed safely and expeditiously,” Mr. Luthi said. The Obama-era rules, written in 2016, tightened controls on blowout preventers, devices that are intended to stop explosions in undersea oil and gas wells, and called for rig operators to have third parties certify that the safety devices worked under extreme conditions. In the Deepwater Horizon spill, a supposedly fail-safe blowout preventer failed after a section of drill pipe buckled. Nearly one million coastal and offshore seabirds are estimated to have died in the spill, which spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the sea. The accident led to the largest environmental settlement in the nation’s history, with the oil giant BP agreeing to pay $18.7 billion in civil penalties and damages to the federal government and affected states. Environmental groups warned that reversing the safety measures would make the United States vulnerable to another such disaster. “Rolling back drilling safety standards while expanding offshore leasing is a recipe for disaster,” Miyoko Sakashita, director of the oceans program at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “By tossing aside the lessons from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Trump is putting our coasts and wildlife at risk of more deadly oil spills. Reversing offshore safety rules isn’t just deregulation, it’s willful ignorance.” Continue reading the main story",The Interior Department said reversing the Obama-era regulations would reduce “unnecessary burdens” on the energy industry.,2017-12-29T04:41:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",U.S. to Roll Back Safety Rules Created After Deepwater Horizon Spill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/trump-offshore-drilling.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/15/us/15drilling-web/15drilling-web-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Immigrants rallied outside Congress in December The Trump administration has announced the US will cancel permits allowing nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the country. The humanitarian programme, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), was granted after a series of earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001. Salvadoreans now have until 2019 before they face arrest and deportation. The Trump administration has already removed TPS protections from tens of thousands of Haitians and Nicaraguans. Protections for Salvadoreans were set to expire on Monday, after nearly two decades of holding the protected status due to the impacts of natural disaster in their home country. The Department of Homeland Security plans to allow Salvadoreans until 9 September, 2019 to leave the US or find a legal way to remain in the country. The programme, which was created in 1990, authorises immigrants from several countries to lawfully live and work in the US regardless of whether they entered the country legally or not. It is only granted to countries affected by armed conflict, environmental disaster, or epidemics. With nearly 200,000 immigrants in the US, El Salvador represents the largest group of TPS recipients. Ten countries, making up over 300,000 US immigrants, have been granted TPS protections since it was first signed into law by President George Bush.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery. At least 30 people were killed, according to local authorities, when Michael plowed ashore as one of the fiercest hurricanes on record to strike the U.S. mainland, pulverizing a cluster of seaside towns along Florida’s northwestern Panhandle region. Seven days later search crews continued combing through the wreckage of demolished neighborhoods looking for any sign of additional victims in Panama City Beach, Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe, the communities closest to the storm’s landfall. Distribution of food and water to storm-stricken residents farther inland has been slowed by communication outages and storm-shattered roads blocked by toppled trees, power lines and other debris. Florida officials have not said how many people may be missing. Teams of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach more than 700 Florida residents reported unaccounted for by worried relatives and friends, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder. Most of that number, down from 2,100 people the group was trying to locate in the immediate aftermath of the storm, are from Panama City and many of them are elderly, disabled, impoverished or living alone, Marchetti said. He said the search had been hampered by spotty cell phone service in the devastated area, though authorities were making progress in restoring communications. High volumes of missing persons reports are not uncommon in the days following a natural disaster because so many survivors fail to check in with loved ones right away or lack the means to do so because of phone and power outages, authorities said. Nevertheless, at least 48,000 Florida residents in the 12 counties hardest hit by Hurricane Michael had registered for disaster assistance as of Wednesday with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA spokesman Ruben Brown told Reuters. That number represents about 7 percent of the population of the 12 counties designated by President Donald Trump’s federal disaster declaration as eligible for FEMA aid to individuals and households. Nearly a third, or more than 15,000 people, reported storm damage to their homes when they signed up with FEMA, though the full scope of property losses remained to be seen, Brown said. As of Wednesday, 286 families left homeless by the storm in Bay County, at the epicenter of the disaster, were approved for FEMA-furnished hotel vouchers, he said. Florida accounted for 20 of the known fatalities attributed to Hurricane Michael, with six more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of reports from county officials along the path of the storm. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were storm-related. As of Tuesday, FEMA had distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, Brown said. The state government was distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. Countless numbers of people in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Relatives of hundreds of people missing after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reacted with anger, sadness and resignation on Sunday to a decision by the state disaster agency to end searches for bodies later this week. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down shopping malls, hotels and other buildings in the city of Palu, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But perhaps more deadly was soil liquefaction which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. No one knows how many people are missing but it is at least in the hundreds, rescuers say. The official death toll has risen to 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered, at least 34 in one place alone on Saturday and more on Sunday. “Many of us are angry that we haven’t found our families and friends and they want to give up?” said Hajah Ikaya, 60, who says she lost her sister, brother-in-law and niece in the Balaroa neighborhood in the south of the city. They are all missing. Balaroa was one of areas particularly hard hit by liquefaction, which turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, destroying houses and dragging people under the mud and debris. The disaster agency said earlier liquefaction destroyed 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone with hundreds of people buried in the mud. “We’re Muslim. We need a proper burial, in the Islamic way,” said Ikaya. “We don’t want this.” Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta some limited searching might continue but large-scale searches with many personnel and heavy equipment would cease on Oct. 11. Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues. Surveys would be carried out and people living in vulnerable places would be moved. “We don’t want the community to be relocated to such dangerous places,” Nugroho said. Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city. Dede Diman, 25, a resident of Petobo, another neighborhood in Palu that was laid waste by liquefaction, said rescuers hadn’t even started searching where his sister was lost. “We’re already angry,” said Diman, who is living in a shelter with his brother and another sister. Their mother was killed and her body found. “We don’t agree with giving up. Even if they give up, we won’t. We want to find our sister.” Graphic: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo PRAYERS Mohammad Irfan, 25, got home to Palu on Sunday, as air services picked up, from his job on Bali island, to help search for his missing grandfather. “I’d feel very sad if the search mission ends because there are so many still missing and buried,” he said. A grieving father was resigned to the search ending without his two-year-old daughter being found. “What’s the point anyway? At this stage, they’re not even recognizable,” said Ondre, 38, who makes toys for a living. His wife and two daughters were swept away in the tsunami that hit Palu’s seafront after the earthquake. He found the bodies of his wife and older daughter but is still looking for his younger daughter. “I don’t want her to feel like her father never tried to find her. My soul wouldn’t rest,” he said by a mass grave atop a hill overlooking Palu’s bay as the sun set, where he had come to offer prayers. Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Earlier on Sunday, dozens of Christians gathered outside ruined churches for services to give thanks for their survival and to mourn members of their congregation killed in the disaster. Indonesia has the world’s biggest Muslim population but there are Christian communities throughout the archipelago, including in Palu. “We are so relieved to be alive but sad because so many of our congregation died,” said Dewi Febriani, 26, after a service in a tent outside the Toraja Church in Jono Oge village, south of Palu. Jono Oge was hit hard by liquefaction with dozens of teenagers at a nearby church and Bible camp killed. Many of lie buried in the mud.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Electricity was restored and some shops reopened in Indonesia’s quake and tsunami stricken city of Palu on Thursday, but the fate of many thousands of people in outlying districts was unknown nearly a week after the disaster struck. The small city of 370,000 people has been the focus of the aid effort launched after last Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on the west coast of Sulawesi island. (GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo ) International help in searching for survivors has gathered pace, but communities in more remote areas have been cut off by broken roads, landslides and crippled communications, leaving people increasingly desperate for basic needs as aid has only just begun to trickle through. By Thursday, the official death toll stood at 1,424, but it will certainly rise as bodies were still being recovered in Palu, where most of the dead have been counted. Figures for more remote areas were only trickling in, if at all. “There are so many challenges with this disaster, it’s never been so bad,” said Frida Sinta, an aid volunteer trying to get basic food and other supplies out to fellow residents of Palu. The city, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, has teetered close to chaos this week, with outbreaks of looting, but a recovery was evident as some shops and banks reopened and a major mobile phone network was back up. Orderly queues formed at petrol stations after the arrival of fuel shipments and late in the day, traffic lights and televisions flickered back to life as the power came back on. The improvements are helping with the aid effort. “We carry whatever we can by car or motorbike within the city wherever we can. But not yet to the most inaccessible places,” Sinta said. Altogether, the badly affected areas in the disaster zone include some 1.4 million people. Rescue workers are pushing into outlying districts, where residents say they have been scavenging for coconuts, bananas and cassava. Villagers rushed a Red Cross helicopter that landed near the town of Donggala, northwest of Palu, to distribute bread and other food, a Reuters photographer said. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing the main roads to the south, west and east of Palu had been opened. But there has been scant information about conditions on the road to the north, along the coast toward the epicenter of the quake, 78 km (50 miles) from Palu. “There’s no data,” said Abdul Haris of the national search and rescue agency, when asked about the string of small settlements that line the road, which passes some sandy beaches that attract a trickle of tourists. “GOD DOES NOT STRIKE TWICE” While the power is back in Palu, it will take much longer for people to pick up the pieces of their lives. “We will start again here ourselves because God does not strike twice,” said Eko Joko who was building a new house, a wooden A-frame home, in the midst of a wasteland of concrete, mangled sheets of iron and uprooted trees near Palu’s beach.. In Palu’s Balaroa district, badly hit by deadly soil liquefaction, Asril Abdul Hamid, 35, was poking through the wreckage of his home. He salvaged a few mementoes including a family portrait. “My immediate family is safe, thank God, but my cousin was killed,” he told Reuters, adding that his family had got food and water in the past few days. Not far away, rescuers were using small flags to mark the location of bodies found in the debris. “We discovered eight bodies with the rescue team but we haven’t been able to bring them out because we don’t have the right equipment,” said district police chief Andi Samsudin Effendy. The body of a South Korean man, who had been in Palu for a sports event, was also found in the ruins of a hotel where dozens of people were killed. Just to the east of Palu, the 500-tonne KM Sabuk Nusantara 39, lies, high and dry in a dock-side settlement, where the tsunami picked it up and dumped it. No one on board was hurt. Engineer Charles Marlan, waiting with fellow crewmen on board the marooned ship for its owners to decide what to do, said he was thankful his ship had not killed anyone on land, as far as they knew. “What is important is we are alive and for that we should be grateful,” he said. Straddling the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia has long been vulnerable to quakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

John Timmer,"Enlarge / US EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. reader comments 1 Scott Pruitt's tenure as head of the US' Environmental Protection Agency has often been bogged down in scandals involving questionable spending and the unjustifiable rollback of regulations. But the latest controversy is one the agency's own making. This morning, Pruitt was speaking at a workshop convened to discuss the handling of specific chemical contaminants that have been found in water supplies. The EPA was already under fire for what appeared to be an attempt to stall a report that suggests these chemicals were more toxic than previously thought, so the workshop provided an opportunity to show that the agency took the risks seriously. Instead, the EPA started a brand-new controversy by specifically excluding CNN and the AP from Pruitt's speech and by having security physically escort a reporter out of the building. Contamination The controversy focuses on a large class of chemicals that are variations of perfluorooctanoic acid. This is a chain of eight carbon atoms, seven of which have fluorine atoms attached to them; the eighth is linked to two oxygen atoms, typical of an organic acid. There are many variations of perfluorooctanoic acid that can be made by substituting for various fluorines, and many of these variants have found uses in the production of everything from non-stick cooking to fire-fighting foams. Unfortunately, these variations also appear to cause significant health risks, with epidemiological studies suggesting connections to cancers, thyroid disease, and changes in cholesterol metabolism. As a result, the EPA had already instituted standards that were intended to limit environmental contamination and human exposure. Those issues were already impacting the Department of Defense, which identified over 100 sites where contamination exceeded the EPA's limits. That's where things stood when the Department of Health and Human Services stepped in. Its Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry conducted a survey of the latest research on these chemicals and prepared a report that indicated that human health issues could occur at levels far below those allowed under the EPA rules. The report was shared with other federal agencies in advance of publication in the Federal Registry. And that's when the White House and EPA got involved. An unidentified staffer started an email chain in which he noted the Health and Human Services report would suggest limiting exposures to levels substantially lower than current standards demand. ""The public, media, and Congressional reaction to these numbers,"" the email suggests, ""is going to be huge. The impact to EPA and DoD [Department of Defense] is going to be extremely painful. We (DoD and EPA) cannot seem to get [Health and Human Services] to realize the potential public-relations nightmare this is going to be."" Part of the ensuing discussion involves scientific questions about the tests used to establish exposure levels, and another EPA official suggested that an interagency review could help the different departments to develop a single standard. But the press reports that ensued ( here are two examples ) focused on the ""public-relations nightmare,"" which suggested the a review was suggested only because of the bad publicity the report would create for the Defense Department. There was also the inconvenient matter that the report, which was referred to as ""pending,"" hadn't yet seen the light of day. Since the initial reports, however, it came out that the day following these emails, EPA staff had immediately consulted representatives of the chemical industry regarding what to do about these chemicals. Meet, but don’t greet This might be a case where greater transparency would provide a clear indication of what the Trump administration was doing about the report and how the EPA's actions would lead to more coherent government response. And a two-day workshop regarding the chemicals, hosted by the EPA and featuring agency head Scott Pruitt would provide a perfect opportunity. Instead, the EPA prevented several media outlets from attending : the Associated Press, CNN, and E&amp;E News. According to the AP, its reporter was held by her shoulders as security guards pushed her ""forcibly"" outside the EPA headquarters. When asked about this, an EPA spokesperson stated that there were space constraints in the room where Pruitt was speaking. However, reporters from outlets that were allowed to attend noted several vacant seats in the room. Later that day, well after Pruitt spoke, the EPA reversed course and announced that all media would be welcome for the remainder of the meeting. We still have no indication of when the report will be published in the Federal Register, and we don't know what changed in our understanding of these chemicals that prompted Health and Human Services to suggest lower exposure tolerances. But the EPA's actions today made it more likely that the agency will be facing these questions more insistently in the future.",The EPA was already under scrutiny about its actions regarding these contaminants.,2018-05-22T22:30:29Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",EPA boots reporters from meeting on chemicals called a PR disaster,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/epa-boots-reporters-from-meeting-on-chemicals-called-a-pr-disaster/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pruitt_gage_skidmore-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,1
Amanda Luz Henning Santiago,"Nearly two weeks after Typhoon Mangkhut, the world's strongest storm this year ravaged the South China Sea, killing over 64 people in the Philippines, a tsunami has hit the coastal Indonesian city of Palu. The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake off the coast, according to the BBC, producing waves up to 6 feet that crashed through Sulawesi island, where Palu is located. SEE ALSO: Remarkably warm oceans spawned 2017's massive hurricanes A video shared by @ksjnoona on Twitter, reveals the stark impact of the tsunami's wrath. In the footage, high waves are seen completely submerging houses in water and destroying buildings. People can also be seen screaming and running from the rushing waters. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, head of BMKG, Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told the BBC. Indonesia is especially prone to earthquakes due to its location in the Ring of Fire an area in the Pacific Rim known for its frequency of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The country has already experienced several forceful earthquakes this year, resulting in over 500 deaths, according to AccuWeather. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a disaster agency spokesperson told the Associated Press, that the military will deploy troops to aid in the rehabilitation of the Indonesian areas hit by the tsunami, along with national police and disaster agencies. Hopefully Palu and Sulawesi island can start to rebuild soon, now that the water is receding.","Nearly two weeks after Typhoon Mangkhut, the world's strongest storm this year ravaged the South China Sea, killing over 64 people in the Philippines, a tsunami has hit the coastal Indonesian city of Palu.

Marina Galperina,"What a year, huh? While Facebook snooped on your family secrets, Trump tweeted us deeper into disaster, and various foreign objects were being pulled out of unsuspecting people’s heads, there was some joyous things to behold too. Like a hand-squeezed Juicero bag, or a flat Earther trying to go to space to prove a point. The new iPhone also happened! Take a journey into a time you’re going to miss next year. These are the 100 most popular Gizmodo posts from 2017 according to Google Analytics. The Senate is currently debating the repeal of Obamacare. And since Senators love their visual aids, it makes sense that Bernie Sanders brought one along with him to work today. But Bernie’s sign marks the dawn of a new era in a lot of ways. He literally just printed out a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump. A software engineer’s 10-page screed against Google’s diversity initiatives is going viral inside the company, being shared on an internal meme network and Google+. The document’s existence was first reported by Motherboard, and Gizmodo has obtained it in full. Digital security and its discontents—from Hillary Clinton’s emails to ransomware to Tor hacks—is in many ways one of the chief concerns of the contemporary FBI. So it makes sense that the bureau’s director, James Comey, would dip his toe into the digital torrent with a Twitter account. It also makes sense, given Comey’s high profile, that he would want that Twitter account to be a secret from the world, lest his follows and favs be scrubbed for clues about what the feds are up to. What is somewhat surprising, however, is that it only took me about four hours of sleuthing to find Comey’s account, which is not protected. Congratulations to those of you who used proper solar eclipse glasses and witnessed the phenomenon without permanently damaging your vision. Good job! But now you’re probably wondering what to do with those flimsy pieces of cardboard and black polymer that were basically priceless just hours ago. To reduce energy consumption, many jurisdictions around the world are transitioning to outdoor LED lighting. But as new research shows, this solid-state solution hasn’t yielded the expected energy savings, and potentially worse, it’s resulted in more light pollution than ever before. United’s market capitalization, essentially the current value of the company, has fallen by more than $750 million from $22.5 billion after a video showing a bloodied United passenger who was dragged off a flight made headlines on Monday. Martha Lillard spends half of every day with her body encapsulated in a half-century old machine that forces her to breathe. Only her head sticks out of the end of the antique iron lung. On the other side, a motorized lever pulls the leather bellows, creating negative pressure that induces her lungs to suck in air. The National Park service retweeted some sick Donald Trump burns, noting how, uh, lightly attended his inauguration was compared to Barack Obama’s in 2009. But now, the NPS has been ordered by its Washington support office to “immediately cease use of government Twitter accounts until further notice,” according to an internal email obtained by Gizmodo. President Trump isn’t going to like this. Journalist Patrick Züst noticed something funny when he googled “donald trump office.” Can you spot it? It’s not exactly subtle. A disturbing new video has emerged showing the bloody outcome after a United passenger was savagely dragged off his overbooked flight after refusing to give up his seat to a United employee on stand-by. Oh my god, he really did it. President Trump really did the one thing you’re not supposed to do during a solar eclipse. Wildlife photographer Tibor Kércz would spend a few nights each year camped out in a tent near a tree, hoping to capture photos of little owls and their nestlings. But just before nightfall on one fateful evening, three of the birds flew out onto a short branch. They landed and tried stabilizing themselves... but the owlet on the end began to fall. Between the Trump transition team’s infighting, incompetence, and high-profile resignations, any decisions that signaled even a modicum of stability for the country would come as a relief at this point. Unfortunately, the nascent Trump Administration isn’t inclined to calm anyone’s nerves. According to an official within the Department of Energy, the Trump transition team has declined to ask the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration and his deputy to temporarily stay in their roles after Trump takes office on January 20th. Andy Serkis, the actor who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings series, was on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night. And Colbert, a huge LOTR nerd, had Serkis read President Trump’s tweets on air. It’s honestly just too perfect. Remember yesterday when First Lady Melania Trump swatted away Donald’s extended hand ? Well, the President just landed in Rome, and it looks like things are still a bit shaky in the Trump household. NPR tweeted the entire Declaration of Independence in 140-character chunks yesterday to celebrate Independence Day. But more than a few people thought that the tweets were a political stance against Donald Trump. Seriously. This February Google finally brought the Google Assistant from the Pixel and Google Home to other Android devices, but they were newer products like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and HTC 10. Older phone owners were stuck with upgrading or going Assistant-less. That changes now, the company announced on Wednesday that Google Assistant is now coming to some older devices. There’s a good reason it’s so difficult for photographers and film crews to capture the elusive snow leopard in the wild. The animal’s not only a master of stealth, it also sports a patterned fur coat that turns it nearly invisible in its natural habitat. Can you find the big cat sneaking up on its prey in this amazing photo by wildlife photographer Inger Vandyke ? On Sunday, a man was forcibly dragged off a United flight headed from Chicago to Louisville after he refused to give up his seat to a United employee who “needed to be in Louisville” for a flight the following day, The Courier-Journal reports. It’s been well documented that Donald Trump is a total dick to his wife. So it’s no surprise that when he extended his hand on the tarmac in Israel this morning Melania literally swatted it away.

Many Californians’ regularly scheduled broadcasts were interrupted Thursday morning with strange emergency messages warning of extraterrestrial invasions and the beginning of Armageddon. The bizarre warnings aired on TVs in the Orange County area, affecting Cox and Spectrum cable users, according to the Orange County Register. US Customs and Border Protection recently released video of President Trump’s border wall prototypes in San Diego. And we couldn’t help but notice something strange from the video. It shows a bird’s-eye view of the wall from the perspective of a drone. And the drone is much, much higher than the wall. We’re officially through the looking glass, and it’s time to find out what powers our country’s legal system has over the president. One day after his inauguration, Donald Trump has already fucked up a tweet and deleted it. The problem is that he very likely isn’t allowed to do that anymore. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is expanding the kinds of information that it collects on immigrants to include social media information and search results. The new policy, which covers immigrants who have obtained a green card and even naturalized citizens, will take effect on October 18th. On Tuesday, a 42-year-old Indian woman went to the hospital, complaining of an extremely painful “tingling, crawling sensation.” After being transferred three times, doctors determined that there was a “foreign body that seemed to be mobile” in her head. Vice President Mike Pence made a big mistake during his tour of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center yesterday. He touched a piece of critical space flight hardware in the Orion clean room, despite the fact that there was a sign that clearly read, “DO NOT TOUCH.” So, of course, the photo is now a meme. Taking selfies with art is an entire photographic subgenre unto itself. So, when an exhibition is touted as a “series of wondrous, over-the-top sets for the perfect selfie,” why wouldn’t you pull out your camera and a snap a pic for the ‘gram? This is why. Carpenter ants of the Brazilian rain forest have it rough. When one of these insects gets infected by a certain fungus, it turns into a so-called “zombie ant” and is no longer in control of its actions. Manipulated by the parasite, an infected ant will leave the cozy confines of its arboreal home and head to the forest floor—an area more suitable for fungal growth. After parking itself on the underside of a leaf, the zombified ant anchors itself into place by chomping down onto the foliage. This marks the victim’s final act. From here, the fungus continues to grow and fester inside the ant’s body, eventually piercing through the ant’s head and releasing its fungal spores. This entire process, from start to finish, can take upwards of ten agonizing days. The story in the New York Times this week was unsettling: The New America Foundation, a major think tank, was getting rid of one of its teams of scholars, the Open Markets group. New America had warned its leader Barry Lynn that he was “imperiling the institution,” the Times reported, after he and his group had repeatedly criticized Google, a major funder of the think tank, for its market dominance.

Once a prolific tweeter, the first lady has since transferred her activity to the @FLOTUS account—she doesn’t use it very much. But the Twittersphere lit up this evening with screenshots of a tweet that was liked from her personal account, which suggests that the rumors of her dislike for her husband could be very true. Political data gathered on more than 198 million US citizens was exposed this month after a marketing firm contracted by the Republican National Committee stored internal documents on a publicly accessible Amazon server. On September 26, 1983, Soviet military officer Stanislav Petrov received a message that five nuclear missiles had been launched by the United States and were heading to Moscow. He didn’t launch a retaliatory strike, believing correctly that it was a false alarm. And with that, he saved the world from nuclear war. But now reports have surfaced that Petrov died this past May. He was 77 years old. Did you know that you can buy everything on Amazon? Medical devices, snack foods, designer clothing, books, pet supplies, art, and—you’re never gonna guess this one—buildings! Well, this isn’t terribly surprising. According to the latest dispatch from Variety, the hackers who broke into HBO’s servers and stole 1.5 terabytes of data, including at least one Game of Thrones script, also stole employee data. More specifically, the hackers made off with “thousands of Home Box Office (HBO) internal company documents.” That’s bad.

Oh God, a hacker’s on the loose with a new ( but familiar ) Google Docs phishing scam, and journalists (among many others) are in the crosshairs. Actually trying to live out of a cheap storage locker goes against every single legal document you have to sign in order to rent it out, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible, as YouTuber 007craft demonstrates. White House Press Secretary and shouting ball of wax Sean Spicer has tweeted plenty of dumb things. (And who among us hasn’t ?) This morning, though, he may have accidentally compromised the security of his Twitter account. 61-year-old DIY enthusiast and stuntman “Mad” Mike Hughes is planning his first manned launch of a homemade, $20,000 steam-powered rocket with “RESEARCH FLAT EARTH” written on the side on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. On Tuesday, a scary case reached a surprisingly positive outcome in the Supreme Court of the United States. Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. was seven-year-long standoff between a small business and an international corporation that stood to upend the world of consumer rights, especially for tech and pharmaceutical companies. Guess what: the little guy won. In recent weeks, a story about experimental Facebook machine learning research has been circulating with increasingly panicky, Skynet-esque headlines. On Friday, Donald Trump was sworn in as President of the United States, an occasion that most people would celebrate as one of the greatest moments in their lives. Donald Trump, however, reportedly spent the day getting “increasingly angry”—all because of some not-so-nice messages on Twitter. Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch’entrate, reads the gates to the Inferno. “Abandon all hope, you who enter,” which is a pretty nice way of saying “welcome to Hell.” But there’s a real underworld, albeit one with fewer dogs and less being blown around by the wind or wading through shit. Scientists are working on a comprehensive map of it. A map of hell. Kind of. We’re gradually learning that smart home devices can be quite valuable for police. Following a recent case in which Amazon handed over data from its Echo device to police investigating a murder, a smart device called the police when a couple was allegedly involved in a violent domestic dispute. In real life, in the natural course of conversation, it is not uncommon to talk about a person you may know. You meet someone and say, “I’m from Sarasota,” and they say, “Oh, I have a grandparent in Sarasota,” and they tell you where they live and their name, and you may or may not recognize them. Yesterday, Pope Francis met with President Trump. And needless to say, the pope didn’t look too happy about it. Maybe it had to do with the fact that Trump previously called the pope “disgraceful” and said ISIS will attack the Vatican, but who knows? The photo was surreal, and sure enough, people have been photoshopping the hell out of it. This morning, after about five clicks over the course of 10 seconds, I cancelled my Netflix membership. The company had started notifying people of its latest price increase —a two buck bump from $12 to $14 in my case—and I just couldn’t do it any more. In fact, you should ask yourself if you need to keep paying for Netflix. It’s not as special as it used to be. On Thursday, Google made a confusing announcement that could easily scare the crap out of 800 million people: Google Drive’s going away—but actually, no, it’s not. However, there are a few things you should know about the changes that are coming. This may look like a photograph, but the highly realistic face staring back at you belongs to a man who died over 700 years ago. The researchers who performed this unbelievable facial reconstruction say their work is providing new details about the way ordinary people lived in medieval England. Did Carl Sagan really warn about a time in the future when manufacturing jobs would slip away, when the average person would have virtually no control over their political lives, and when we would all cling to superstitions? Yes, Sagan did predict just that. The screenshot you may have seen floating around social media is real. And plenty of people are worried that Carl was talking about our era. In an apparent attempt to discredit The Washington Post the day after it published a report on fake Donald Trump Time magazine covers hanging up at his golf courses, the president posted one of his most confusing tweets since taking office. Those towering wind turbines that are slowly starting to cover countrysides around the world don’t just show up overnight—and they’re definitely not dropped in place by a helicopter. They arrive on trucks in pieces—staggeringly massive pieces—that test the skills of drivers navigating roads not designed to accommodate 200-foot long trailers. NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center has issued its forecast for the 2017-18 winter season and, for the second year in a row, La Niña is poised to be a major factor in how the season shapes up. In general, the forecasters are predicting a cooler, wetter north, and a warmer, drier south. Jon Jafari is a popular YouTube gamer and comedian better known as JonTron. He’s the founder of Normalboots—a network of channels including Did You Know Gaming and Peanutbuttergamer —and was the original cohost of the “Let’s Play” channel Game Grumps. Between those projects, Jafari wields influence over an estimated 12 million subscribers, not counting minor cameos and crossovers elsewhere within the YouTube community. Apple is very protective of its trade secrets, particularly unauthorized leaks of information about upcoming products. Case in point: The tech giant reportedly fired an engineer after his daughter recorded a video showing off features on a pre-release iPhone X at Caffè Macs, the company’s high-end employee cafeteria at its Cupertino, California headquarters, last week. Did you see those packs of water being sold at a Best Buy store in Houston for as much as $42 per pack? The photos went viral as an example of predatory price-gouging in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. But the company is now apologizing and saying it was all a big misunderstanding. Meanwhile, CNBC doesn’t think that disaster capitalism is such a big deal. Scientists in Florida have found traces of rat lungworm in five counties, bolstering the idea that this potentially fatal parasite may be expanding its geographical range on account of—you guessed it—climate change. It’s official. President Trump is, objectively speaking, a threat to the safety and security of the United States. And perhaps nothing demonstrated that better than when Trump started a tweetstorm that sent the Pentagon into a panic yesterday. The US military spent nine full minutes wondering if the president was about to start a war with North Korea. Congress has moved to dismantle some Obama-era rules that would have protected the online privacy of everyday Americans. This sucks. The deregulation means it will be easier for huge telecom companies to track and sell their customers’ browsing history. This sucks! But not all is lost. For years, scientists have wondered if dark, crater-like features on the lunar surface might be entrances to giant caverns carved long ago by flowing lava. Researchers from Japan and the United States have uncovered new evidence to prove that these features actually exist—which is good news for future lunar colonists looking for a convenient and safe place to live. So you’re still using Microsoft Word. Seems like an odd decision in the year 2017, but I didn’t come here to judge. I’m legitimately curious why some people continue to pump their money into the MS Office Suite, despite mounting evidence that the software offers shitty security and a historically terrible user experience. So why bother? When a celebrity dies unexpectedly, there’s a strange new ritual that fans partake in as we remember the person’s contributions to our lives. We scour the internet for social media posts for a glimpse of their last moments. In the case of Chris Cornell, the lead singer for Soundgarden who died last night at the age of 52, we have his last tweet. 61-year-old stuntman and amateur Flat Earth theory researcher “Mad” Mike Hughes, who planned to launch himself some 1,800 feet up at 500 miles per hour in an untested homemade steam-powered rocket over the Mojave Desert ghost town of Amboy, California on Saturday in some sort of gambit to prove the Earth is flat (spoilers: it’s not), will not be doing any of that that this weekend. It’s an obscure case that hasn’t received a ton of attention as it has made its way to the Supreme Court but the final verdict could set off a cascade of consequences in the world of consumer products. Storm chasers combined forces this afternoon to pay tribute to a man who put them on the map by literally putting his initials on their maps. Hundreds of professionals and enthusiasts are checking in to form the letters “BP” with their GPS coordinates. I’m a total gadget nerd, and it’s been five years since a new smartphone made me nod to myself with the understanding that, “Yes, I need that thing more than I need air.” But the buzz around the iPhone X has had me a little more hyped than usual. Not just because the iPhone finally ditched the bezels and got an OLED display—Samsung’s Galaxy S8 lost its bezels in March—but because the iPhone X is the line’s first significant overhaul since god knows when. I should know better than to fall for the hype, but after spending nearly a week with the device, I’ve actually convinced myself that spending $1,000 on a phone seems like a good idea. If you hate me for saying that, that’s okay, I hate me too. What happens when your power lines get all kinds of trash hanging from them and it’s not safe to send up a human? In Xiangyang, China, you send in the drones. Specifically, the drones that shoot fire. While many of us envisioned the world going out in a wicked blaze of glory, sadly, that doesn’t seem to be the way things will go. Instead, we have to settle for Ted Cruz, the other horsemen of the apocalypse, and this massive beast that just washed up on the shore of Indonesia’s Maluku province. A hustler knows a hustle. So if you have ever considered sinking money into an initial coin offering—a complicated, barely regulated, and booming new form of financial vehicle where startups offer investors stakes in “new” cryptocurrencies rather than traditional stock—it might be a good idea to listen to what one of finance’s most notorious criminals-turned-authors has to say. I tingle just thinking about the full-body sensation accompanying a Q-tip exploring the inside of my ear canal. But the guilt-ridden pleasure is always followed by a nagging mother whisper: “don’t put anything smaller than your elbow into your ear!” Well, scientists have decided to amplify that whisper. So far, the FCC has refused to cooperate with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s investigation into identity theft during the commenting period on net neutrality repeal. So Schneiderman is using the internet to find the evidence and he needs help. What you’re seeing is a valuable painting being partially dissolved on purpose. Though they were constructed nearly 5,000 years ago, the Great Pyramids of Egypt are still packed with secrets. Using a technique that leverages the power of cosmic rays, scientists have confirmed the presence of a large empty space within Khufu’s pyramid—a void that’s signaling the presence of a possible hidden chamber. In 1944, Marcel Nadjari—a Greek Jew who was forced to remove bodies from the Auschwitz gas chambers—buried a letter in a forest near the camp. The text was rediscovered in 1980, but it was virtually unreadable. Using a new imaging technique, scientists have finally reconstructed the letter, and it’s providing harrowing new details of the Holocaust—and what it was like to work as a forced laborer in a Nazi extermination camp. Verizon has decided to abruptly cut off wireless internet to some 8,500 rural customers in 13 states, saying their heavy data use had made it impossible to profit off of the accounts—even though many of the users had purchased unlimited plans. Less than two weeks after Ajit Pai assumed leadership of the FCC, the agency quietly announced several troubling actions Friday afternoon, including major blows to net neutrality and a program designed to give poor people internet access. While prepping a 67-year-old female patient for routine cataract surgery at England’s Solihull Hospital, physicians noticed a strange bluish blob in one of her eyes. On closer look, the blob turned out to be 17 contact lenses stuck together. Another 10 lenses were subsequently discovered in the same eye. The surgeons have never seen anything quite like it. Google has surveyed the advertising landscape that it dominates and determined that it’s time for a change. Beginning in January, its Chrome web browser will mute autoplay video ads with sound by default. The effort is being framed as a drive to clean up the web, but it could just as easily be interpreted as a disguised move to further solidify Google’s monopoly. A little after 1pm on Tuesday, countless websites and web services ground to a halt following a reported widespread outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS). One of the dirty secrets about streaming live TV services like PS Vue and Hulu TV is that in many cases you’re paying the same amount of money as you would for basic cable. The main difference, besides the benefit of not dealing with a godforsaken cable company, is the crazy monthly fees local operators like to charge for their hardware—often $8 to $12 a month. But Plex, a popular video app that lets you easily share your entire video library to practically any device you want, just added support for streaming live TV. Which means that with a little investment, you can escape most of those rental fees for good. I tried it, and I’m just about ready to get rid of that cable box forever. A man in east London was expecting a package from Amazon but the special delivery on his driveway was not what he’d ordered.

MANNY FERNANDEZ and ILANA PANICH-LINSMAN,"Local, state and federal officials expressed concern for low-income Harvey victims, but they were unable to explain why so many of them continue to struggle. City officials say there has been no shortage of resources and services for poor residents affected by the storm, including the 14 neighborhood restoration centers the city opened, mostly in low-income areas. FEMA said it has put $4.3 billion into the hands of affected Houstonians. “There are thousands of families who live in low-income communities, who already were operating at the margins before Harvey, and the storm pushed them down even further,” the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, said in an interview. “We want to reassure them that they have not been forgotten.” Mr. Turner, who visited Kashmere Gardens and other neighborhoods to mark the anniversary of Harvey, described the problem as a federal and state issue, citing the $5 billion in federal Community Development Block Grant disaster-recovery funds that were approved for Texas, but that Houston has yet to receive. “We know that the city is going to receive $1.14 billion dollars in C.D.B.G. funding for housing,” Mr. Turner said. “But you can’t disperse what you don’t have.” Kurt H. Pickering, a spokesman for FEMA in Texas, said the agency had seen no evidence that low-income areas were receiving less support from the agency. He said that federal assistance was designed not to make a person whole after a disaster, but to help start the recovery process. “FEMA does everything possible to assist every family in every way,” within the bounds of its regulations, Mr. Pickering said. In Kashmere Gardens, Ms. Houston ended the tour of her house on Lufkin Street after a few minutes. “I can’t stay in here too long because I start coughing,” she said. She spoke of the past 12 months as a series of disputes and broken promises. She said she felt abandoned by FEMA, contractors, reporters and celebrities who visited the neighborhood and failed to follow up on repairs. “We’re no more than 15 minutes from River Oaks,” she said, referring to one of the wealthiest areas of Houston. “It’s not just the government. Don’t nobody care.”","Texas has made progress recuperating from Hurricane Harvey, but low-income and minority residents have had a much harder time.",2018-09-03T06:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","A Year After Hurricane Harvey, Houston’s Poorest Neighborhoods Are Slowest to Recover",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/hurricane-harvey-houston.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/us/00harvey1/merlin_142983849_2aec0b0c-ba1d-40aa-9127-db853d4ab48a-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

"Ralph Ellis, CNN","The fire was reported shortly before the mall was set to open Firefighters are close to declaring the fire out, an official says (CNN) At least 37 people were missing and feared dead Sunday, more than a day after a fire broke out at a shopping mall in the southern Philippine city of Davao, authorities said. The Davao City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office said the fire started around 9:40 a.m. Saturday in the third floor of the New City Commercial Center (NCCC) mall, according to CNN Philippines. The fire was reported not long before the mall was supposed to open. Sunday morning, Emmanuel Jaldon, the chief operating officer for the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, said firefighters were in the last phase before declaring the fire out and that the fire was ""technically contained."" Authorities have not provided a cause of the fire. The fire struck as the Philippines was reeling from a storm that killed dozens and caused flooding and landslides. In a Facebook post, Deputy Mayor Paolo Duterte quoted the ground commander of the Brigade of Fire Protection as saying the chances of finding the 37 people alive were zero. ""Please continue to pray for everyone's safety,"" the mall's management said in a statement Saturday, CNN Philippines reported. Davao is the hometown of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Local media showed photos of Duterte visiting the mall and meeting with the victim's families. He was mayor of Davao City and still has a residence there. The city is about 1,514 kilometers (941 miles) south of Manila.

Look at your knuckles real quick. Are they a bloody disaster?

If your lips are painfully dry right now, try rubbing a tiny dab of your regular facial moisturizer or eye cream on your bare lips, then slathering a thick balm on top. Lotions and creams contain more water and moisturizing ingredients than lip balm, but more importantly, theyre formulated to actually absorb into your skin. Layering something something waxy and occlusive on top slows down the evaporation process, keeping that moisture right where you need it: on your dry, cracked, miserable lips. This technique is a godsend for anyone with stubborn chapped lips, but its especially handy for people who cant use lanolin. Waxy sheep sebum heals dry skin like nothing else on earth, but its a fairly common allergen; trying to find an effective lip balm without it is both harder and more expensive than layering two products you already own.
Any moisturizer you like will work here, as long as it doesnt contain active ingredients. Sure, the concentrations of retinol, chemical exfoliants (AHAs, BHAs, or otherwise), and vitamin C derivatives found in moisturizers are tiny, but its not worth the risk. Dont put your favorite retinol cream on your lipsuse a facial oil, hydrating serum, eye cream, hand cream, or even body lotion instead. Your lips will thank you.","The perfect lip balm is both thin enough to sink into your lips and thick enough to sit on top of them in a protective, watertight layer.

"CAMPBELL ROBERTSON, RICHARD FAUSSET and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS","Dian Edge told her family that God had instructed her in a dream to wait out Hurricane Florence in her little wooden farmhouse, surrounded by soybeans and peanut plants, down near the South Carolina coast. The storm came down, the contents of the freezer were emptied — sausage, turkey, rotisserie chicken — and by the light of kerosene lamps, the family bided their time. Mike Edge, 22, kept vigil, his guns at hand; Meghan, 28, a granddaughter visiting from Boston, stayed in contact with the outside world on her laptop; Dian, 71, the matriarch, prayed and read Psalms aloud to the dark house as a wind-whipped sycamore tree tore at the roof. “She’s reciting the Bible,” the younger Ms. Edge said by phone in the middle of the storm, “and keeps saying evil can’t penetrate God’s word.” Florence, at least, did not penetrate their house, though the roof sustained considerable damage. The morning after, some members of the church brought the Edges a thermos of hot coffee and some ham sandwiches. The devotion does not let up with the weather. Billy Layton, who moved to Lumberton nearly two years ago to rebuild flood-damaged houses with the North Carolina Baptists on Mission, was planning to move on by the end of the year. He had been leading this nomadic lifestyle for nearly a decade, following disaster after disaster, and was ready to get to some long-delayed repairs on his own home. On Saturday night, with Lumberton looking more and more as though it would be flooded even more severely than it had during Hurricane Matthew, Mr. Layton contemplated the question he would soon face: whether to stay in the area on his now indefinitely prolonged mission.","Volunteers set up a mobile food station, capable of serving 30,000 meals a day, at Temple Baptist Church in New Bern, N.C., on Sunday.",2018-09-16T23:54:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In the Carolinas, Churches Provide Spiritual Refuge and Shelter From the Storm",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/us/hurricane-churches-shelter-relief.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/17storm-religion03/17storm-religion03-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
CHRIS DIXON and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON,"In a bad wind, a pile can quickly become an arsenal or at least clog storm drains. So far, though, the brunt of the storm has missed the areas with the most flood debris. Still, recovery efforts will be slow, officials said, as some flood-prone areas that had begun to rebuild now have to wait for waters to recede again. Theres people who had their homes damaged during Florence and now theres going to be some winds that could further damage their homes and property, said Mike Sprayberry, the director of the North Carolina Emergency Management agency, describing how a 50-mile-an-hour gust could rip the tarp off a house that was in the midst of repairs, sending rain pouring back inside. Federal disaster recovery centers set up in the Carolinas after Florence were closed on Thursday because of Michael. Schools in many parts of North Carolina have yet to reopen after Florence close to 90,000 students have been out of school for weeks. As Michael came into the state, there were more than 575 people still in shelters from the last storm and many others who would have likely needed them but are living in hotel rooms paid for with temporary disaster aid.

Dell Cameron,"Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., center, speaks with reporters while Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., left, and Minority Leader Chuch Schumer of N.Y., watch following their policy luncheon on Capitol Hill, in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018. Photo: AP By the time it was clear the fallout from the Equifax breach reached roughly three-fourths of adult Americans, Washington lawmakers were already tripping over themselves to churn out a law that they hoped would, in some future, analogous disaster, hold accountable the negligent hoarders of Americans personal, private data. By the time Facebooks Cambridge Analytica scandal reared its head six months later, however, nearly every effort to pass a comprehensive bill that might punish corporate data malfeasance had stalled. Today, only a handful of 2018 campaign websites even mention the issue at all. On Thursday, the office of Sen. Ron Wyden, one of Congress most vocal privacy advocates, began circulating a discussion draft of a bill aimed at bringing to heel Silicon Valley companies that have amassed billions trading in consumers private data. The tentatively named Consumer Data Protection Act would force sweeping changes at companies such as Google and Facebook, granting consumers the ability to opt-out entirely from having their data sold off for marketing purposes, while dramatically increasing the Federal Trade Commissions (FTC) authority to pursue privacy violators. To start, Wydens privacy bill sets forth a requirement that companies whose revenue exceeds $1 billion per yearor those who store data on more than 50 million consumers or consumer devicessubmit to the government annual data protection reports outlining the measures taken to ensure the security of all collected personal information. Inspired by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires executive officers to certify and approve company financial reports, Wydens bill would require data protection reports to be certified by top executives, including chief executive officers, who would face not only stiff fines but jail time if they were to fail to comply. The bills current language outlines up to 20-year prison sentences and fines not to exceed $5 million for executives who knowingly mislead the FTC, which at present has no authority to punish first-time corporate offenders. Companies that violate the standards established by the FTC under the laws authority would also face steep fines, up to 4 percent of their annual revenue. For perspective, a company such as Google could face up to a $5 billion dollars fine for a serious infraction. Individual Americans know far too little about how their data is collected, how its used and how its shared. But more than hanging a dagger over the heads of corporate officers, the purpose of the bill is to provide consumers with optionsand in particular, the option to not be tracked with each click online. As Gizmodo reported earlier this month, the Do Not Track privacy tool that comes standard in all browsers currently does nothing to actually dissuade companies from tracking users; a chief aim of the Wyden bill is to resurrect the power of consumers to control who monitors their online activities through an enforceable, one-stop shop feature. Ideally, consumers would be given the power to opt-out of being tracked by visiting an FTC website, and, as Do Not Track intended, their browsers would notify websites that their information is not to be shared with third parties. Relatedly, websites encountering do-not-track users would not be allowed to facilitate third-party collection either, meaning that ad network code added to websites for the purpose of vacuuming up information about users for third-party companies would essentially no longer be allowed Todays economy is a giant vacuum for your personal information. Everything you read, everywhere you go, everything you buy and everyone you talk to is sucked up in a corporations database, Wyden said. But individual Americans know far too little about how their data is collected, how its used and how its shared. Keenly aware that such a move would drastically impact (read: crush) companies such as Facebook, whose business model revolves around its ability to track users for marketing purposes, the bill offers a simple, if not elegant, solution: Companies would be allowed to notify users that the only way to continue using a service or website for free is to allow tracking. But companies that choose to do this cannot simply deny service to anyone who desires not to have their data collected. Instead, they must offer a paid version of the service. In practice, this would mean Facebook users would be faced with two options: allow Facebook to continue tracking them online so the company can continue to profit by targeting them with ads, or pay a monthly fee to offset the companys loss in revenue. The fee, as described in the bills language, shall not be greater than the amount of monetary gain the covered entity would have earned had the average consumer not opted-out. In Facebooks case, such a fee would be relatively small; in a 2017 annual filing, the company said it made on average $20.21 per user. (A third option, floating by one Wyden aide, might include allowing users to agree to continue using a service even if they opt-out for free if they agree to, say, watch a three-minute advertisement beforehand.) Whats more, when a user does agree to be tracked in exchange for using a free service, the bill requires that they be notified of which third-parties will be granted access to what specific information. Its time for some sunshine on this shadowy network of information sharing. The bill also includes two important carveouts: Nonprofit organizations and news companies are exempt from the law, the latter having been excluded intentionally to protect reporters from being forced to surrender data theyve collected on individuals in journalistic pursuits. The technology to accomplish what the bill requires may not yet exist. For example, even if companies did pay attention to the Do Not Track feature, the feature has no impact on applications running outside of browsers. The law would require such a mechanism. (Wyden aides acknowledged the complexities involved in devising a system that would cover the full range of Internet-of-Things devices; TVs and vehicles that are now tracking users online habits, for example.) The hope is that the bill will spur innovation in the privacy arena, but it meanwhile places the onus on the FTC to devise the technological means to create this new opt-out system. The commission would be outfitted to accomplish this feat, however, with an influx of cash and staff, as well as the creation of a Bureau of Technology overseen by a new chief technologist. The draft suggests the appointment of up to 175 additional FTC personnel with technological expertise, such as software engineers, including 100 additional personnel to the commissions privacy division and 25 personnel to its consumer protection bureau. It also tasks these employees with establishing the minimum privacy and cybersecurity standards to be met by the companies. Lastly, the bill compels companies, for the first time in U.S. history under the law, to assess the algorithms with which they process consumer data to study whether they are inherently prejudicial toward certain people, a well-observed technological issue intertwined with Americans civil rights. Of the bills purpose, Wyden said his ultimate goal is to bring about radical transparency while arming consumers with new tools to control their information. The bill supports those efforts, he added, with tough rules with real teeth to punish companies that abuse Americans most private information.

Vince Beiser,"The night before the mission, Kenji Matsuzaki could not sleep. For more than a year, Matsuzaki and a team of engineers had been developing their little robot—a bread-loaf-sized, red and white machine equipped with five propellers, a transparent dome, front and rear video cameras, and an array of lights and sensors. Nicknamed Little Sunfish, it was engineered to operate ­underwater, in total darkness, amid intense radiation. And after three months of testing, training, and fine-tuning, it was deemed ready to fulfill its mission: to find and photograph the melted-down radioactive fuel that had gone missing inside the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. More than six years had passed since an earthquake and tsunami hammered northeastern Japan and reduced the Fukushima facility to radioactive ruin. In all that time, no one had been able to locate the hundreds of tons of fuel inside the three reactors that had suffered core meltdowns. The uranium fuel had overheated, turned into lava, and burned through its steel container. That much was known. What happened after that was the big question. Did all the fuel flow out of the reactors, or was some still inside? Did it pile up in a heap, spread out in a puddle, spatter on the walls? Without knowing the answers to those questions, it was nearly impossible to devise a plan to get rid of it. And getting rid of it is imperative. Every day, as much as 165 tons of groundwater seeps into the reactors, becoming contaminated with radiation. And there’s always the possibility that another earthquake or some other disaster could rupture the reactors again, sending radiation spilling out into the air, sea, or both. Human beings couldn’t go into the heart of Fukushima’s reactors to find the missing fuel, though—at least not without absorbing a lethal dose of radiation. The job would have to be done by robots. But no robot had ever carried out such a mission before. Many had already tried and failed. Debris tripped them up. Yard-thick concrete walls threatened to block their wireless signals. Radiation fouled up their microprocessors and camera components. And so it fell to Matsuzaki, a shy-eyed, 41-year-old senior scientist with Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch, to help build a machine that wouldn’t end up as another one of the robot corpses already littering the reactors. Just getting the Sunfish and its support gear into position inside the enormous concrete building that housed one of the crippled reactors took two days. Four separate teams took turns setting up the control panel, cable drum, and other equipment the robot would need to function. Even in full protective bodysuits, each group of workers could spend only a few minutes inside the structure, working by the light of portable electric lamps amid a thicket of machinery, pipes, and catwalks. When one team absorbed its maximum permitted daily dose of radiation, it was replaced by another group. Matsuzaki himself made two forays inside to put the final touches on the Sunfish, sweating inside his face mask and bodysuit in the summer heat, his nerves jumping each time his portable monitor dinged to indicate he’d received another increment of his allowable radiation dose. The plan was for the Sunfish to spend three days mapping the debris and searching for signs of the missing fuel. Matsuzaki would monitor its progress from a control room about 500 yards away. He would be joined by a half-dozen top officials from his employer, Toshiba, and Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the mammoth utility that owns the plant. His success—or failure—would be broadcast daily around the world. Beyond the immediate danger, cleaning up Fukushima remains critical to repairing the image of Japan’s energy industry. In the wake of the disaster, Japan shut down every one of its dozens of nuclear plants, which had provided some 27 percent of the nation’s power. To cover the loss, it had to massively increase imports of expensive fossil fuels. A few nuclear plants have since been permitted to restart, following years of safety upgrades, but Fukushima cost the industry much of its public support. Polls consistently show that a majority of the public opposes nuclear power. Two of Japan’s former prime ministers, including the one in office at the time of the disaster, have flipped from supporting nuclear plants to calling for their elimination. The disaster also dealt a severe blow to the global nuclear industry, which had been gaining favor even among some environmentalists as a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. In the aftermath of the meltdown, Germany announced it would phase out nuclear power altogether, Vietnam dropped plans to build reactors, and the whole industry was thrown on the defensive. Every proposed new reactor now has to answer the question: How do we know this won’t be another Fukushima? Small wonder that in the nights leading up to the mission, Matsuzaki was feeling the pressure. “I’ve been having nightmares about failing,” he confessed to his boss, Akira Tsuyuki. “Me too,” Tsuyuki said. Late at night on July 18, 2017, the mission start time just a few hours away, Matsuzaki lay awake, wondering whether his team’s technology would be any match for Fukushima. The earthquake on March 11, 2011, was the biggest ever recorded in Japanese history, a 9.0 monster that devastated northeastern Japan and triggered a series of tsunamis that slammed into the coast, killing nearly 16,000 people. The tsunamis also knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, shutting down the pumps needed to keep cooling water circulating in the reactor cores. Over the next several days, as Tepco engineers worked by flashlight to regain control, the fuel in three of the plant’s six reactors—Units 1, 2, and 3—melted down. Gases unleashed by the damage exploded, sending plumes of radioactive particles like iodine, cesium, and plutonium into the atmosphere. The government ordered everyone within a 12-mile radius to evacuate, with about 165,000 people eventually displaced. Government officials originally estimated it would take about 40 years and $50 billion to clean up the plant, decontaminate the surrounding area, and compensate the disaster’s victims. In December 2016, they more than tripled that estimate to $188 billion. “We have never experienced a disaster as big as Fukushima,” Hiroshige Seko, the head of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, told reporters at the time, according to Bloomberg. “With our limited knowledge, it was very difficult to make the previous forecast.” The Fukushima cleanup is a project far bigger and more complex than those of even the world’s worst previous nuclear catastrophes. Chernobyl was literally covered up: The Soviets simply encased the whole thing in concrete and steel. Three Mile Island was tiny by comparison. Only a single reactor melted down, and none of its fuel escaped. “Fukushima is orders of magnitude more difficult,” says Lake Barrett, an American who oversaw the cleanup of Three Mile Island and who signed on as a consultant to Tepco and the Japanese government in 2013. The Hot Zone Following the meltdown, nearly 165,000 people had to evacuate the area surrounding the Fukushima plant to avoid radioactive exposure. Today, even after extensive cleanup efforts, 50,000 people still can’t go home. In the first chaotic weeks after the meltdown, with radiation levels far too intense for anyone to work inside the reactors, Tepco scrambled to deploy robots to assess and contain the damage. Tractor-treaded bots from iRobot, drones from Honeywell, and a prototype disaster-­response mech from Tohoku University scouted the rubble-­strewn facility and tried to measure the intensity of the radiation. A remote-­controlled concrete pumping truck was adapted so that its extendable spout could pour water into the reactors, cooling and stabilizing the overheated chambers. In the months and years that followed, Fukushima became both a market and a proving ground for ever-advancing robot technologies designed to operate in hazardous conditions. Remote-controlled front-end loaders, backhoes, and other heavy equipment were put to work breaking up radioactive debris and loading it onto remote-controlled dump trucks. A four-legged walking robot investigated the reactor buildings. Robots with 3-D scanners were sent in to gather imagery and map radiation levels. Swimming robots inspected pools where spent fuel rods were stored, taking pictures. But none of these robots were capable of penetrating the innermost areas of the reactors. In August 2013, the Japanese government assembled a consortium of public utilities and private companies, including Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Toshiba, to create robots specifically for the most challenging environments. Dubbed the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, it has developed some 20 machines that have been deployed onsite. Their ranks include a snakelike bot that crawled through a tiny accessway into Unit 1, then bent itself into a more stable U-shape to explore inside. Then there was the Scorpion, a tank-tread-driven machine with a camera mounted on an elevating “tail” that was sent into Unit 2. The Japanese government is bankrolling a $100 million, state-of-the-art R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant where robot operators train on digital models of the reactors in a giant 3-D Holo Stage and on life-size physical mock-ups. A robot undergoes testing at the government’s new $100 million R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant. But even with the massive government investment, many of the new robots still couldn’t hack it inside the reactors. The camera on one of them, sent to clear a path for the Scorpion, was shut down by radiation; the Scorpion itself got tripped up by fallen debris. The first version of the snakelike bot got stuck; the second did better but failed to find any melted fuel. “It’s very difficult to design a robot to operate in an unknown environment,” says Hajime Asama, a professor at the University of Tokyo who was one of the first roboticists the government turned to for help. “Until we send the bot in, we don’t know what the conditions are. And after it’s sent, we can’t change it.” Kenji Matsuzaki has worked in Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch for more than 10 years, and by May 2016, when he was assigned to the team developing a robot to explore inside Unit 3 of Fukushima, he was familiar with the plant’s basic architecture. All six of its reactors are boiling-water reactors, a type designed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and found all over the world, including in the United States. They generate electricity by circulating water through their infernally hot cores, converting it to steam that is used to turn turbine generators. Each reactor has three containers set one inside another like Russian nesting dolls. The smallest container, a steel capsule about the length of a tennis court, is called the reactor pressure vessel. That’s where the nuclear fission reaction takes place, powered by fuel composed of uranium dioxide baked into ceramic pellets. This capsule is enclosed inside a primary containment vessel, a concrete and steel structure shaped like a massive light bulb, designed to capture any radiation that might accidentally escape. The containment vessel in turn is housed inside the reactor building, a concrete and metal rectangle that offers only minimal protection from radiation. Technicians in protective gear can work for short periods inside the reactor building, but they can’t enter the far more radioactive containment vessel, which is where they were likely to find at least some of the missing fuel. Building a robot that could get inside and maneuver around the containment vessel presented several unique challenges. First, the containment vessel was only practically accessible through a 5.5-inch circular maintenance opening about 8 feet above the floor of the reactor building, so the robot would have to be small. Second, because the containment vessel had been pumped full of water to cool it down, the robot would have to be able to swim. Third, since the water and thick walls would defeat wireless signals, this small, swimming robot would need to be powerful enough to move under­water while dragging as much as 65 yards of electric cable behind it. It took months of research, experimentation, and testing in Toshiba’s labs and in an enormous simulation tank at the government-run Port and Airport Research Institute to balance all these capabilities inside the little machine. Matsuzaki’s team had to try different configurations of propellers, cameras, and sensors, boost the power of the propeller motors, develop a new type of coating to make the cable move more smoothly, and ensure the whole package could withstand a blistering level of radiation. Simulation facility at the Naraha Remote Technology Development Center. At midnight on July 19, the day the Sunfish was scheduled to make its first foray into the reactor, Matsuzaki’s alarm went off in his hotel room. He and his team were staying in Iwaki, the closest habitable city with a hotel, about an hour south of the plant. Starting their day in the dark of night was the only way to have enough time to drive to the plant, suit up in protective gear, and hold a last round of meetings before their start time. That would give them about eight hours; by noon it would be too hot inside the reactor building for the technicians monitoring the robot to do their jobs. At about 4:30 am, a group of Toshiba techs in full protective gear darted into the reactor building. They fast-walked to the outer wall of the containment vessel and climbed a step ladder up to the opening where the Sunfish and its equipment had been pre-positioned. They unsealed the valve over the opening, then pushed in a heavy guiding pipe, with the Sunfish at its tip, all the way through to the other side. Slowly and carefully, they angled the pipe until the bot slid into the water below. Inside, it was completely dark. On their monitors in the control room, Matsuzaki’s team, connected to the Sunfish’s controls via the electric cable, could see only a narrow swath cut through the turbid water by the Sunfish’s lights. Seated at a long table, one technician “drove” the Sunfish with a videogame-­type controller. Another reeled its cable in and out, keeping it taut so it wouldn’t get tangled as the bot swam this way and that. A third did his best to estimate the machine’s position using a 3-D software model of the containment vessel. Matsuzaki oversaw them all, trying to forget about the platoon of corporate officials watching over his shoulder. The Sunfish had to be able to swim (right), fit into the small opening of the containment vessel (top left), and withstand challenges that crippled an earlier robot, the Scorpion (bottom left). The first day, the Sunfish spent most of its time reconnoitering. The damage inside the containment vessel was worse than expected. Unidentifiable clumps of pebble-sized debris and pieces of half-destroyed equipment littered the floor. But there was no sign of the fuel, and after eight hours of searching, the team pulled the Sunfish back to the surface. They gave it a rest the next day while they discussed their findings and strategized their next steps. The following morning, they sent the Sunfish back into the water. The team drove it slowly and carefully, but time after time, the bot’s powerful propellers would stir up a blinding cloud of sediment, forcing them to wait until the water cleared again. After several hours of maneuvering, and with the noon deadline looming, Matsuzaki was growing nervous. Then, something startling appeared on the monitors. “What is that?” said Matsuzaki. Everyone began talking at once and pointing to what they saw on the screens: murky glimpses of what appeared to be stalactites of something dripping like candle wax from the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. They’d found the first signs of the missing fuel. They maneuvered the Sunfish around the area, documenting as much as possible, before pulling the bot out. When Matsuzaki declared the mission complete, the control room burst into applause. Kenji Matsuzaki, the lead scientist behind Little Sunfish. By now, much of Fukushima Daiichi itself, an expansive complex covering some 860 acres, is a lot safer than you’d expect. Most areas have been decontaminated to the point where full bodysuits are no longer required. The 5,000-plus workers tasked with cleaning the place up have cut down hundreds of the cherry trees that used to enliven the grounds, torn up and paved over once-grassy open areas, and scrubbed down buildings. They have covered the seafloor just off the coast with clay to seal in cesium that seeped into the mud after the disaster. Using an enormous, purpose-built fuel-handling machine, they have removed the hundreds of spent uranium fuel rods from Unit 4, a reactor that was damaged by an explosion but did not melt down. Still, when I visited the site last December with Lake Barrett, Tepco’s American consultant, we had to put on gloves, safety glasses, surgical masks, three pairs of socks, and plastic booties over our shoes, as well as a personal radiation detector, before being allowed inside the facility. At 72, Barrett is tall, fit, and astonishingly energetic. I first met him at the Narita airport outside Tokyo, where he bounced right off a 20-hour trip from his home in Florida, joined me in a car without stopping for so much as a cup of coffee, and talked cheerily for the entire two-hour drive to Fukushima prefecture. When Barrett heard the first news reports about the disaster, he “didn’t think much of it,” he says. “There’s always so much hype around these things.” Then he saw the picture of Unit 1 exploding. “I said, ‘Holy shit. I know exactly what that was.’ I knew they were in deep doo-doo.” When the call came to help out, he didn’t hesitate. “It’s personal for me,” he says. “Japan was the only country that helped us at Three Mile Island. We owe Japan.” Inside the Fukushima plant, each of these blue towers holds 100 personal radiation detectors. From atop a small hill, once covered with grass and now encased in concrete, Barrett and I survey the trio of hulking buildings outlined against the blues of the winter sky and the Pacific Ocean behind them. Remotely operated orange-and-white cranes lean over them like reverent metal giraffes. These are the reactor buildings: the intractable core of the disaster zone, the radioactive redoubts the robots must penetrate. Each poses a unique challenge. The amount and type of damage inflicted on each is different, as is the depth of the water flooding their bases. Of course, at the heart of each is a mess of melted fuel, presumed to have flowed in different ways to different places. Less than half a mile from these three reactors sits Unit 5, one of the three other reactors that had been shut down for regular maintenance when the tsunami hit. Since it escaped largely unscathed and is nearly identical to the damaged reactors, Tepco engineers use it to plan robot missions. Inside is a baffling maze of machines, ducts, cables, and catwalks. “You can see how hard it is to run the robots around in here,” Barrett says. We navigate our way through the building to the containment vessel. “That’s just like where the Sunfish went in,” he says, pointing up to an unassuming circular opening in the wall of the vessel. We enter the containment vessel and make our way through a narrow doorway into a chamber below the reactor pressure vessel. Control rod assemblies stud the reactor vessel’s underside; we have to crouch to avoid bumping our heads on them. Pointing out key areas and components, Barrett walks me through the current theories on what happened to the fuel in each of the meltdown units. “No one knows if the lava made a nice neat vertical pile or whether it flowed sideways,” he says. “Hot molten fuel could have fallen into the water and caused a steam explosion that would have blown it everywhere.” In Unit 3, at least, thanks to the Sunfish, Tepco is relatively certain about a few things. The pictures it took show that the control-rod mechanisms at the bottom of the reactor vessel disintegrated. Molten fuel mixed with melted metal dripped down through the openings they left behind, presumably creating the stalactites seen in the videos. The lava-like mixture burned through both the steel grate beneath the reactor pressure vessel and a refrigerator-sized machine used to insert the control rods, and some of it dripped down to the floor of the containment vessel. There also appear to be chunks of fuel on the vessel’s walls. Inside Unit 3 Each reactor is made up of three containers, one set inside another, that hold critical equipment. 1. Reactor Building: A large concrete and steel structure that acts as the last line of defense to keep radiation from escaping into the outside world. 2. Primary Containment Vessel: An airtight enclosure made of steel and concrete. 3. Reactor Pressure Vessel: A thick steel container that holds the uranium fuel, which powers the nuclear reactor. 4. Control-Rod Drive: A mechanical system that uses thin rods to speed up or slow down a nuclear fission reaction. The rods work by absorbing the stray neutrons that trigger a chain reaction. 5. Pedestal: A circular concrete structure that holds up the reactor. From inside, workers can access the control-rod drive. That still leaves an awful lot unknown. At the end of the day, “how much did we learn from the Sunfish mission?” Barrett asks. “It was a step, not a leap. We’re getting closer and closer, but we have a long, long way to go.” Tepco is continuing its efforts to scout the inside of the reactors. In January, a robotic probe using a remote­-controlled camera mounted on a long pole spotted for the first time what appears to be melted fuel inside Unit 2. There may be another Sunfish mission, though it won’t be the same robot that found the fuel in Unit 3. Despite emerging from the reactor undamaged, it had still absorbed a dangerous amount of radio­activity. Tepco engineers sealed it in a steel cask and interred it with other radioactive waste on the plant site. Limited and uncertain as the Sunfish’s findings are, they have helped move the ball forward. Engineers have now begun thinking about how to build the next generation of robots that will have to carry out the most complicated undertaking of all: removing the melted fuel. Their first challenge will be enabling the bots to reach their target. “These are cramped spaces filled with huge pieces of equipment that weigh many tons. You have to cut them up in pieces and pull them out,” Barrett says. One idea currently in favor is to build a massive 20-foot robot arm that would enter the reactor building on rails, reach into the reactor pressure vessel, and scoop up the fuel. Another is to send in a bot the size of a small refrigerator on tractor treads, equipped with cutting and gripping tools to wrangle debris. A second robot would lift the detritus into containers, seal it, and put it on a conveyor belt to the outside. Either system will take years to develop. Either or both might fail. Tepco has pegged 2021 as the target year to begin removing fuel debris. How long might the entire Fukushima cleanup take? “Good question. Nobody knows. No one in human history has experience with this,” says Naoaki Okuzumi, a senior manager with the decommissioning institute. “The government says 30 to 40 years. I think that is optimistic.” While the robots’ work inside Fukushima Dai­ichi drags on, human beings who once lived near the plant are waiting to go home. The national government has decontaminated several towns and urged residents to return. At the time of my visit in December, though, roughly 130 square miles of land was still off-limits, including the better part of a town called Okuma, perched in the hills a few miles from the plant. Yoshihiro Takada, a former resident who now works with the local government agency in charge of rebuilding, agreed to show me around. Takada spent almost his entire life in Okuma and had to escape with his wife, child, and parents when the disaster hit. They’ve relocated to another town 65 miles away. I met up with Takada in a parking lot just outside the exclusion zone, where we put on full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties over our shoes to protect us from the particles of cesium and strontium. Inhaling even a dust speck of one of those isotopes can be dangerous. That’s part of what makes radiation so terrifying : You can’t feel it, see it, or smell it. It can kill you without you ever knowing you encountered it. A few miles from the Fukushima plant, in the town of Okuma, visitors must wear full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties when walking along the abandoned streets. The desolation of the exclusion zone, in the town of Okuma. There was no one in the train station, the barbershop, the restaurants, or the stores. The modest houses and apartment buildings on the residential streets were all empty. The only sound I heard as we walked down the middle of the deserted main street was the chirping of clueless birds who didn’t realize they’d chosen to nest in a radioactive hot zone. “I remember this place—their pizza was so good,” Takada says, gesturing at a shuttered restaurant as we walk through town. Several shop windows have been smashed by wild boar that have come down from the hills to ransack the deserted town for food. Cars sit in driveways half-hidden by overgrown weeds. Takada only occasionally checks in on his own house. “Rats are running all over it inside. There are droppings and garbage all over,” he says. The area around Fukushima is mostly scenic farmland fringed with thickly wooded hills. But drive along practically any road and you pass fields filled with rows and rows of boulder-sized, black polypropylene bags. They are filled with contaminated earth; as part of the cleanup, a layer of topsoil is being scraped up from gardens, schoolyards, and fields all across the region. Roughly 20 million of the bags are scattered around the prefecture. Many of them will eventually be moved to the outskirts of Fukushima Daiichi itself for indefinite storage, along with an ever-growing array of tanks holding the radioactive water Tepco continues to pump out of the reactors. Ultimately, there is no technology that can simply fix what happened at Fukushima. The only certainty is that it will be a slow, incremental, frustrating process that may not even be completed in Kenji Matsuzaki’s lifetime. For now, all the scientists, engineers, and their allies can do is keep the radioactivity under control, track down its source, and try to capture it. But first, they need to create the robots to do it. Radioactive waste at the Tomioka contaminated waste facility. It will be buried for 200 years.

Alex Davies,"A world dominated by self-driving cars is no longer just possible, it’s inevitable. And the proof is everywhere. In Arizona, where Waymo (formerly known as Google's self-driving car project) is testing minivans sans humans inside. In Boston, where Lyft and robocar outfit Nutonomy are schlepping Patriots fans to and fro. In Sweden, where Volvo is testing its autonomous tech on impossibly photogenic families. These pilot projects aren’t just public relations stunts. They’re crucial for any company eager to bring this technology to market, because they pit the vehicle not just against the wild world, but against the people it will someday transport for money. Uber was the first in the US to launch this kind of program, in Pittsburgh in September of 2016. And while 2017 has been an overall disaster for the ridehailing company, the signs of progress on the self-driving front are clear. The vehicles have expanded their territory and their knowledge. They drive more smoothly, require less human intervention, and can change lanes on their own. But the way the car interacts with its surroundings is just part of the equation. What's happening in the backseat matters just as much. ""I don't think that there's a wide range of reactions,"" says native Pittsburgher Larry Lagattuta, who recently took a ride in a robo-Uber.

"Matt Rivers, Jo Shelley and Ben Westcott, CNN","(CNN) Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Indonesia's national disaster agency said the number of people killed in the disaster had risen to 1,234 on Tuesday. The toll is expected to continue to climb in the coming days as bodies continue to be retrieved from under the rubble. The situation for those left alive has grown increasingly dire, as families scramble to get even the most basic of goods. On Tuesday, motorists lined up for hours around the block in the blazing sun, standing among the ruins and debris, in the hope of obtaining a small amount of gas. At the last available gas pump in town, large group of men crowd around a single overworked attendant. In his hand is a wad of cash nearly too big to grip. Money though is of little use when their is nothing left to buy. Roads to Palu -- a city of 350,000 people -- remain blocked and aid has been slow to trickle in. Indonesian vessels carrying food and water has still yet to arrive. Indonesian military have been patrolling the streets in Palu over the past 24 hours to crack down looting by desperate survivors, searching for limited supplies and goods. An official from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent described the situation on the ground as ""nightmarish."" Bodies of victims remain unburied on the side of the roads. In a public cemetery on the outskirts of the city, workers are digging a mass grave the size of a football pitch to try to bury as many bodies as quickly as possible before disease begins to spread. Almost 200 bodies are in this pit alone, with more still being added every hour. A few ID cards lie on the ground next to the pit, but not all bodies have been identified before they were laid to rest. Amid the long wait for supplies and aid, the desperate search continues for survivors with reports of more than 700 houses buried under a mudslide in a nearby town, which still remain unexplored. 'I need to get the kids out of here' An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected by the disaster, according to Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said Tuesday that 799 were injured, and more than 61,000 people have been displaced. In total, Sutopo said 66,000 homes had been destroyed so far. Desperate to leave the scene of the disaster and escape the treat of looting, thousands of locals were queuing at Palu airport with children and belongings in the hope of a way out. ""People are trying to get stuff from my house so I needed to get the kids out of here... they're trying to rob us,"" one local woman told CNN Monday as she waited in line at the airport. While some residents are battling to escape the surrounding area, international aid organizations and Indonesian military are trying their hardest to reach as much of the region as possible. Palates of supplies are en route to the affected area courtesy of the organization like the Red Cross, who sent seven tons of logistical supplies from Jakarta on Tuesday. Countries from around the world have begun to announce aid packages for Indonesia as well. Australia, one of the country's closest neighbors, said it had already provided $500,000 of support immediately through the Indonesian Red Cross. ""Australia has some expertise and has resources in particular areas we can deploy, and we are looking to see how we can best fit the need,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday. The United States announced it had released $100,000 in initial disaster assistance on Monday, according to a state department spokesman. But on the ground, there's little evidence so far of the pledged aid with shipments expected to arrive in the days ahead.","Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami.",2018-10-02T08:09:11Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","More than 1,200 were killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami",https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/asia/indonesia-palu-tsunami-earthquake-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181002151513-03-palu-tuesday-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,1
KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center.

 Rescue teams from Indonesia's disaster agency, the BNPB, worked through the night to reach survivors
At least 60 people are feared to have been buried by a landslide at an illegal Indonesian gold mine.
Rescuers are searching for survivors at the site, in the Bolaang Mongondow area, on the island of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's disaster agency said one person had been found dead and at least 13 rescued by 0500 on Wednesday (2200 GMT Tuesday).
A spokesman said supporting beams gave way at the mine ""due to unstable land and numerous mining shafts"".
""It is estimated that as many as 60 people are buried under landslide and rock material,"" the agency said. 
Images from the scene showed rescue teams and local people working through the night to carry survivors off a mud-covered hillside.
Small-scale gold mining is banned in Indonesia, but remains widespread in rural areas. Lack of regulation and the poor construction of makeshift mines means accidents are relatively frequent. 
Campaigners have long argued that a lack of local employment opportunities meant people felt forced to rely on illegal mining.",At least 60 people are feared to have been buried after a landslide at an illegal gold mine.,2019-02-27T02:07:53Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",'Dozens buried' in Indonesian mine collapse,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47381579,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1615D/production/_105816409_indonesiamine.png,bbc-news,BBC News,1

 Pope Francis spoke to tens of thousands of pilgrims
Pope Francis has launched an app to encourage Catholics around the world to pray with him.
Click to Pray tells the user what the pontiff is praying for, such as a country hit by a natural disaster or conflict, so they can join him.
Thousands watched in St Peter's Square as the Pope, who once said he was a ""disaster"" with technology, showed it on a tablet held by an aide.
After swiping on the tablet, he turned to his aide and asked ""Did I do it?""
From the upstairs window of the Apostolic Palace, Pope Francis said: ""Today, I have two pains in my heart. Colombia and the Mediterranean.""
He was referring to a car bomb in Colombia that killed 20 police cadets and the death of 170 migrants in shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. 
Pope Francis said the internet was a way ""to stay in touch with others, to share values and projects and to express the desire to form a community.""

Nathan Mattise,"reader comments 0 AUSTIN, Texas—""So this happened—this is September 2017,"" Juan Ramírez Lugo, president of the AAAS Caribbean division, tells the audience at the 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Conference. The slide that soon greets the room depicts an almost surreal reality: the available power (or lack thereof) on the island of Puerto Rico in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. ""The island went dark; the Virgin Islands basically disappeared off the map. This blew my mind to not have my cell phone in this day and age,"" Ramírez Lugo continues. ""The routine eventually became get up in the morning, then try to check the news and Status.pr to see how much service has returned to normal."" Ramírez Lugo cited estimates that the cost of Hurricane Maria's damage will total 34.1 percent of Puerto Rico's GDP, so calling the storm devastating almost seems like an understatement. The routine Ramírez Lugo shared highlighted another crucial (re)building block for disaster recovery, one that's now joined general infrastructure and health needs: connectivity. With the vast amount of electrical grid and ground towers damaged, FEMA estimates put cell service availability at a mere 60 percent an entire month after the storm. That’s precisely when Project Loon stepped in. Project Loon is the high-profile balloon Internet experiment from Alphabet's X (formerly Google X); on October 20, project lead Alastair Westgarth wrote a blog post revealing that it was working with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile to support basic communications on the island, including text messaging and Internet access through LTE-compatible phones. This marks the first time Project Loon pointed its machine-learning algorithms toward keeping balloons over Puerto Rico—the island previously only hosted launch sites—and the first time its leaders recognized that their goal of connecting underserved areas may mesh perfectly with disaster response. ""We usually think about [Project Loon] in places with no existent network, but when a network goes out, people who were served become underserved,"" says Sal Candido, a director and principal engineer at X, who presented with Ramírez Lugo at this weekend's conference. ""In the future, being prepared for these kind of things is something we hadn't really thought of, but it could be done in advance as a contingency."" Candido's video aid when the time came to explain how Project Loon functions. ""The team back in Mountain View knows presentations aren't my strength."" Candido notes that the pace of partnerships made Project Loon's Puerto Rico deployment so successful—the initiative delivered Internet to 100,000 Puerto Ricans by early November, and Candido says the number exceeds 200,000 now. Typical deployments require Project Loon to work out ground network hardware with local governments, recruit existing carriers in the area for service, and then acquire the rights to use the spectrum. ""This usually takes four to six months; spectrum licenses alone can take years,"" he says. ""We managed to get it all to happen within a couple of weeks, much faster than we previously thought possible."" And going forward, Candido believes Project Loon may be able to help areas more susceptible to natural disasters set up such contingency partnerships in advance. Beyond the bureaucratic elements, another major challenge for Project Loon's Puerto Rico deployment was quickly plotting effective balloon patterns and then figuring out how to maintain them. The company simulates 30 million kilometers of potential navigation daily to better understand how jet streams and weather patterns will impact balloon routes. Eventually, the team settled on a path that launches from Winnemucca, Nevada, and travels south. To date, balloons are still being launched on this trajectory and as many as five to seven can be canvassing the island at a time. A Project Loon coverage map of Puerto Rico (slide shown by Sal Candido at AAAS2018) Candido shared that the number of people in Puerto Rico helped by Project Loon has doubled since November (slide shown by Sal Candido at AAAS2018) ""Here's a nice picture, one when it's working really well,"" Candido says, introducing a slide in which a handful of balloons can provide coverage for a majority of the island. ""[After a disaster] there's a lot of things needed, but this was one very small thing that could help people out."" Although what Loon accomplished shows great potential for future use, Candido remained quick to acknowledge it's just one small contribution to the massive recovery efforts still needed in Puerto Rico. In fact, being on the ground there during the planning stages of this Loon implementation only further drove that point home for the engineer. He unexpectedly took part in much heavier lifting. ""We quickly realized this was a situation with very mission-oriented tasks, and many mission-oriented people were down there. It was hard to get things on and off the island, so we'd take water for other organizations or partner with military, and they'd all do favors back for us,"" Candido says. ""I actually learned Chinook helicopters come in pieces—you have to pick up the motor mount and literally put it on top of the helicopter. Once, the government contractor with the crane couldn't get there in time, but Google happened to have one around to lift our boats out of the water. They came right over and said, 'You know that thing over there, it might work.' It did.""

Cameron Kunzelman,"An intrepid filmmaker going by the name of TDB Games has created a rousing 24-minute movie called “Yoko” about the destruction of a small city. It’s very good. It’s no secret that I’m a big fan of a good Cities: Skylines cinematic flythrough, but it’s rare that I see a creator attempt to do something that looks more like a traditional film with their video capture of the game. After all, it’s hard to do; there are no characters who might perform speaking roles, and it’s very hard to have any kind of control over the little simulated vehicles that populate the game. “Yoko” breaks all of my preconceptions about what you can do with Skylines as a filmmaking tool. Running nearly a half hour, the short film has a narrative structure like any other movie you might be interested in. We’re introduced to our “characters,” the different districts of the city of Yoko, with occasional glimpses of fire trucks and ambulances. This is a traditional cinematic flythrough of a nice-looking city, and if that was all we got I would be happy. Except that isn’t all we get. A few minutes into the film, all hell breaks loose. Multiple tornadoes begin to rip through the city of Yoko, and then a meteor hurls into it from the sky. These are followed by fires and the decimation of buildings in some really, really well-filmed segments. Then the disaster relief heroics kick in, all new day sunshine and steely music. It’s so emotionally resonant that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson would be proud. All of this is accomplished through really excellent camera work, sound design, and editing. “Yoko” demonstrates how much you can do to communicate mood and tone, not to mention story, without human characters at all. It’s so good, and if you’ve ever seen anything like this before, please let me know in the comments.",An intrepid filmmaker going by the name of TDB Games has created a rousing 24-minute movie called “Yoko” about the destruction of a small city.

Shannon Connellan,"A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday. The natural disasters claimed at least 1,234 lives, according to the death toll reported on Tuesday. Officials fear the toll will continue to rise. Most of these deaths have occurred in the coastal city of Palu, with many victims still to be located within the ruins. Mass burials have begun in the area, and thousands are now homeless across the region, sheltering in some 200 displacement sites. SEE ALSO: An Indonesian tsunami's devastation captured in new, horrifying video We don't know the full breadth of the impact of the disaster just yet. As Reuters reports, more remote areas have been out of contact for over three days, though rescuers are finally reaching those locations. Thousands of homes have collapsed in the Sulawesi region, along with hospitals, hotels, and shopping centers. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo has requested ""urgent"" international aid, and the global community is identifying different ways to assist Indonesia during the disaster. The hardest hit cities, Palu and the coastal city Donggala, are the most in need. According to Charity Navigator, officials are reporting that supplies like food, water, and medicine are running low, shelter is scarce for thousands of displaced people, and some of the affected areas are proving hard to reach. Clearing a path to reach victims and deliver aid is a priority. BBC reports that aid agencies have been struggling to access affected areas due to damage at Palu's main airport, roads cut off by landslides, and power is out across much of the region. So, how can you personally help? Here's our list of ways you can support survivors, which will be updated to reflect the ultimate scale of the earthquake and tsunami's devastation: 1. Donate to reputable nonprofits and charities. Charity Navigator has published a list of highly-rated organisations that are focused on delivering general aid and relief, medical services and hygiene kits, as well as food, water, toilets, and basic shelter. Here are the organisations listed as working on tsunami recovery for Indonesia: Heart to Heart International, World Vision, Direct Relief, Project HOPE, Water Mission, GlobalGiving, Save the Children, International Medical Corps, Helping Hand for Relief and Development, and World Help. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Indonesian Red Cross Society (or Palang Merah Indonesia), Red Cross Australia, UNICEF, Oxfam, and CARE Australia, are organisations already on the ground or preparing to help victims. Indonesian Red Cross (or PMI) rescue workers use a tracked vehicle to move through an area destroyed by the tsunami in Palu. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Doctors Without Borders has also deployed a local team to Central Sulawesi. The team includes medical, logistics, and water and sanitation specialists. 2. Consider ways to help the most vulnerable communities. Natural disasters affect people in different ways, but the most vulnerable communities are often overlooked in the aftermath. Humanity and Inclusion, a U.S.-based not-for-profit that promotes disability rights, is taking donations for basic aid and rehabilitation care for tsunami survivors with serious injuries and disabilities. Thousands of people have been left homeless from the tsunami, in addition to locals who were already experiencing homelessness. Consider donating to local, national, or international organisations that are trying to address the immediate crisis of homelessness. Oxfam, for example, is working with local Indonesian partners to deliver essential aid like emergency shelters, soap and sanitary items, water containers, tarps, and toilets. Some of the most vulnerable survivors of a natural disaster are the youngest among us. Consider supporting nonprofit groups that serve children. Save the Children is on the ground in Sulawesi, providing medical care, emotional support, and child-friendly spaces in shelters with diapers and cribs. 3. Keep checking in after the headlines have faded The fallout after a natural disaster is immense, but it eventually stops making headlines. Once the media coverage has ebbed, those affected by the disaster still have to piece together their lives. Keep checking in with your chosen charity to see how things are progressing, and check situation updates from the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Center). Finally, if you need guidance on deciding which cause to support amongst so many worthy aid and recovery efforts, consult Charity Navigator's tips for how to give in a crisis. Strategies include giving money instead of material items and making long-term donations.","A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday.

Mariella Moon,"Festival-goers paid anything from $490 (day pass) to $250,000 (VVIP) for the two-weekend event, which was heavily promoted by huge Instagram influencers, including Kendall Jenner, Emily Ratajkowski and Bella Hadid. McFarland's Fyre Media and partner Ja Rule promised them hotel-like luxury tents to live in, gourmet meals by celebrity chef Stephen Starr's catering company, the chance to rub elbows with models and headliners like Blink-182 and Migos. Instead, they were met with USAID disaster-relief tents, sloppy cheese sandwiches and chaos. McFarland apparently bought a $150,000 yacht for Blink-182, but the band pulled out of the event before it even started. According to the Justice Department, McFarland has been misleading investors since 2016. He manipulated income statements to show that Fyre Media was earning millions from talent bookings -- the company's main business -- when it only earned $57,443 from May 2016 to April 2017. Since those fake millions had to come from somewhere, he also falsified documents to show that his company made 2,500 bookings for artists in a month, when in truth it only booked 60 within the entire year. It doesn't end there, though. The Fyre Media chief also falsified stock ownership statements, showing investors that he owns more stocks in a publicly traded company than he actually does. He also forged emails from banks showing approved loans that were actually declined. Further, he lied and told them that a famous venture capital vetted Fyre Media and decided to invest in it. In truth, the VC couldn't vet the company properly, because McFarland couldn't provide the documents it needed. He used the same tactics to convince a ticket vendor to pay for $2 million worth of advance tickets for future Festivals over the next three years. In court, McFarland said: ""While my intention and effort was directed to organizing a legitimate festival, I grossly underestimated the resources that would be necessary to hold an event of this magnitude.""

Jessica Taylor,"Donald Trump Jr. and Rick Saccone, GOP nominee for Pennsylvania's 18th district, shake hands with supporters during a campaign rally on Monday. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Tuesday's neck-and-neck special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional districts carries a lot of weight for both parties — despite the fact that it won't even exist in its current iteration come November. Republicans have gone all-in to try and save underperforming state Rep. Rick Saccone. The GOP nominee got an 11th-hour rescue-mission visit Saturday from President Trump, who carried the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election. GOP-allied groups have poured in more than $10 million to help Saccone, who's underwhelmed in fundraising. If that's not enough to save him, it would be an embarrassing and alarming loss for Republicans eight months from the midterm elections. Meanwhile, even Republicans privately concede that Democratic nominee Connor Lamb — a charismatic, young former Marine and prosecutor — is the superior recruit. He's brought in far more money than the GOP candidate in this traditionally solidly red district near Pittsburgh. Lamb has raised $3 million in the race, while Democratic outside groups stayed mostly on the sidelines. They have put in only about $1.7 million, allowing Lamb to run a more independent race. Lamb has cut a moderate profile with a populist tinge. He has said he would oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader and has also wooed steel workers, coal miners and union activists in this blue-collar districts. He's had a somewhat similar economic message to Trump when he campaigned and won here. This special election was triggered by the resignation of former Rep. Tim Murphy, who stepped down after it was revealed that the anti-abortion rights congressman had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to terminate a possible pregnancy. Due to court-ordered redistricting, the district as it's drawn now will cease to exist come Election Day 2018, and neither Saccone nor Lamb will even live in the rejiggered seat. So the fact that Republicans are spending so heavily to save what's essentially a phantom district underscores what is on the line: They don't want a loss in such a GOP stronghold to spur even more panic among their ranks that Trump is dragging them down. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating for an upset that will further galvanize their energetic base hoping for a blue wave in November. To this point, since Trump has been president, Republicans have underperformed in GOP-held House special elections, but still won all five of them. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are four questions to ponder in the meantime: 1. Will this be a canary in the coal mine for the GOP? A few months ago, when a rash of retirements seemed like the latest alarm bells for Republicans, GOP strategists urged caution. Some pointed to this Pennsylvania race — where Saccone was still heavily favored — as the possible canary in the coal mine to watch for Republicans. This race, they said, could be a much bigger sign of danger ahead for the GOP. If Lamb does win on Tuesday night, it could send even more GOP members of Congress heading for the exits, adding to what's already a record number of retirements. The ominous signs have been there for some time for Republicans. Since Trump's election, 39 state legislative races have flipped from red to blue. Democrats notched big wins last November in both the Virginia and New Jersey governor's races. And special House elections last year across the board showed a major shift toward Democrats, even if they didn't notch a victory in a GOP-held race yet. Republicans have far underperformed in special elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina — all solidly GOP territory. Democrats did score a major upset in December in the Alabama Senate race, flipping a seat in a state that Trump carried by nearly 30 points. In that contest, Republicans were running a deeply flawed candidate in GOP nominee Roy Moore, long a controversial figure in state Republican circles. Several women accused him of sexual misconduct and pursuing them romantically when they were teenagers, and he was much older. Republicans are already trying to paint Saccone as a weak candidate, but blaming him for underperforming is hardly a credible excuse in such a Republican area. It would instead be a sure sign of danger ahead, at least in the narrative that would form about 2018, what it would mean for GOP morale, fundraising and the power of the president to help candidates over the line. No race is a perfect predictor, and Republicans will also surely note that before their own massive wave in 2010 that helped them capture control of the House, there was another Pennsylvania special election that went Democrats' way. That race certainly was no sign of their fortunes come November. Still, there's been more than enough evidence in the 16 months since Trump was elected that the energy on the Democratic side is very real. Now, a Lamb win would mean that even areas that were once considered safe GOP territory might no longer be. 2. Is the Trump coalition transferable? Trump rode into town Saturday night in nearby Moon Township to campaign for Saccone. He had a trademark wild and unpredictable rally to help Saccone. He boasted that he was able to help save the Georgia special election in a similar fashion and later tweeted about it : The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2018 The president even gave the Democratic nominee his own Trump-branded nickname, ""Lamb the sham."" He made the case for Saccone, who has run as an unabashedly pro-Trump candidate, before turning to a myriad other topics and insults. It was all classic Trump — eager to claim credit despite scant evidence he helped move many poll numbers, as in Georgia. He didn't mention other places where he's gone in and lost — like Alabama, where he first backed the losing primary candidate and then failed to get Moore across the finish line. For Trump, every day is Nov. 8, 2016. He revels in reliving that historic night and boasting of his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton. But now Tuesday night could show if Trump's winning coalition is transferable to other candidates — or not. Democrats faced a similar problem under President Obama. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro calculated, when Obama was on the ballot, Democrats gained 31 seats in the House and nine in the Senate. When he wasn't, the party lost 82 seats in the House and 17 in the Senate. Obama's popularity dropped during his tenure, and he was, indeed, a drag on his own party in 2010 after the Affordable Care Act passed. But Obama's numbers were stronger than Trump's, and there wasn't the constant chaos and scandal plaguing the White House. Ultimately, Trump's unpopularity, remains the biggest detriment for Republicans in the midterms. It raises the question of how Trump could be — or is willing to not be — dispatched on behalf of Republicans on the trail over the coming months. That will be even more acute if Saccone loses. Even in places like the Rust Belt where he was once seen as an asset may not be a given any longer. While Trump doesn't like to be associated with anything losing, he also never passes up a chance to get before a crowd. So while he may salivate at campaigning more, it could be hard for anyone in the GOP to make the case to the president he would hurt more than help. Republicans have already been trying to downplay expectations ahead of a loss too, with Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio making the stunning argument on Fox News Monday that ""this is a Democrat district"" despite Trump's heavy win — even though past GOP presidential nominees also performed similarly and Murphy routinely won re-election easily, or even went unopposed. A Democrats hasn't won here in 15 years. 3. Can the economy and tax bill save Republicans — or not? The silver bullet for Republicans in the midterms could be the positive economy — and the GOP tax cuts they passed last year that are growing in popularity. Yet that argument wasn't used much in the final stretch to help Saccone in Pennsylvania. Early ads touted economic growth and the tax overhaul, while hitting Lamb for downplaying the impact of the tax cuts. But in the final stretch, that message was abandoned for much more ominous ads hammering Lamb over immigration and crime. That was the same dark turn Republicans took in Virginia last fall — a gambit that failed. So if that's their closing message, it's a sign that the political boon they hoped to gain from an economic boom might not be working. And, as much as Democrats haven't figured out messaging on the tax bill, Republicans may not have either. One of the unknowns is how the recently announced tariffs could affect the race. Areas like the 18th district, where blue-collar Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Trump, have been hard hit in an age of globalization. Trump's imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum would seem to be tailor-made to boost political support in economically distressed areas like this. However, a Monmouth University poll (taken before Trump's visit), which showed Lamb with a narrow lead — both under regular- and high-turnout scenarios — found the tariff announcement didn't seem to sway voters at all. Plus, both Saccone and Lamb have been supportive of the tariffs.

Can Republicans' anti-Pelosi message still work? Lamb has run a more centrist campaign and underscored local issues. That has helped him close the gap and win crossover Republicans. But this race is also a test of whether Democrats can blunt what has been one of Republicans' most effective weapons — Nancy Pelosi. Lamb has run ads boasting of how he would oppose Pelosi as Democrats' House leader — or even speaker — if he's elected, echoing pushes by like-minded legislators such as Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton in calling for new leadership. And the surrogates he's had campaign for him, like former Vice President Joe Biden, have a much different appeal to voters in this area than the San Franciscan could. Nevertheless, Republicans have been repeatedly able to turn Pelosi into a political bogeyman, dragging down surging candidates by tying her to them. It was a strategy they first employed successfully in 2010 — and replicated it. They most recently used it in last year's Georgia special election. Ads from outside GOP-aligned groups have continued to argue that Lamb would still be a Pelosi lackey even though he says now he wants new leadership. But if Lamb is able to survive being linked to Pelosi, it could be an encouraging sign for Democratic candidates across the country, some of whom have already signaled they want new leadership, as well. Pelosi remains a fundraising machine for the Democrats, and she still wields considerable influence. But if Democrats want to win back the House, a Lamb win might show they need more candidates like the Pennsylvanian in conservative areas who are willing to buck the status quo and go against party leadership. And that could raise even more questions of who will be in the leader's chair come 2019.","President Trump won the congressional district by 20 points in the 2016 election.

 Anak Krakatau as it looked on New Year's Day. Planet's constellation maximises the chances of getting a cloud-free view
There is now some very good optical satellite imagery of the collapsed Anak Krakatau volcano, which generated a devastating tsunami on 22 December.
Poor weather conditions over Indonesia's Sunda Strait had frustrated spacecraft that view the Earth in the same type of light as our eyes.
But the team at Planet has managed to find windows in the cloud.
Pictures from its Dove and SkySat platforms show the extent of the volcanic cone's failure.
It is easier to appreciate now how the island has been reshaped.
What was once a crater at the summit of a 340m-high edifice has been completely broken open to form a small bay.
Indonesia's disaster agency says more than two-thirds of Anak Krakatau's volume (150-170 million cubic metres) is missing. Much of it is assumed to have slipped into the sea in the colossal landslide that produced the tsunami.

 After the event: One of Planet's Doves observes the scene a week after the disaster (30/12/2018)
Earth observation company Planet, which is based in San Francisco, operates one of the world's largest satellite constellations.
The big network maximises the chances of seeing the ground when cloud clears above a target. 
Planet's small Dove spacecraft capture details on the ground larger than 3m - what is termed medium resolution. While its SkySat platforms have a high-resolution capability, capturing details larger than 72cm. 
SkySat was responsible for the picture at the top of this page, taken on New Year's Day.
The satellite pictures acquired immediately after the disaster came from radar spacecraft, and gave the first hints that Anak Krakatau had collapsed. 
Radar instruments can pierce cloud but they return a very different type of view to optical satellites, and need a particular skill to interpret. 
It's now thought some 430 people died along the coastlines of Java and Sumatra when the tsunami hit.
Thousands more remain displaced.

Tom Nardi,"On February 1st, 2003 at eighteen seconds past 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, the Space Shuttle Columbia broke up during atmospheric entry over Texas. Still traveling at approximately Mach 18.3, the disintegration of Columbia was complete and nearly instantaneous. According to the official accident investigation, the crew had at most one minute from realizing they were in a desperate situation to complete destruction of the spacecraft. Due to the design of the Space Shuttle, no contingency plan or emergency procedure could have saved the crew at this point in the mission: all seven crew members were lost in this tragedy. While the Space Shuttle, officially known as the Space Transportation System (STS) would fly again after the Columbia disaster, even the program’s most ardent supporters had to admit fundamental design of the Shuttle was flawed. Steps needed to be taken to ensure no future astronauts would be lost, and ultimately, the decision was made to retire the Shuttle fleet after primary construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was complete. There was simply too much invested in the ISS at this point to cancel the only spacecraft capable of helping to assemble it, so the STS had to continue despite the crushing loss of human life it had already incurred. Between the loss of Challenger and Columbia, the STS program claimed fourteen lives in its thirty year run. Having only flown 135 missions in that time, the STS is far and away the most deadly spacecraft to ever fly. A grim record that, with any luck, is never to be broken. The real tragedy was, like Challenger, the loss of Columbia could have been prevented. Ground Control knew that the Shuttle had sustained damage during launch, but no procedures were in place to investigate or repair damage to the spacecraft while in orbit. Changes to the standard Shuttle mission profile gave future crews a chance of survival that the men and women aboard Columbia never had. Determining Risk During Columbia’s climb to space, a piece of insulating foam came off of the external tank and struck the wing. The impact was observed by Ground Control, but as there was no way to tell how large and heavy the piece of foam was, or what damage it actually caused, the decision was made to continue with the mission as normal. During reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere, this damaged section of wing allowed hot gasses to enter the vehicle: ultimately leading to a structural failure. Rendering of the Space Shuttle performing a self-scan with the laser depth camera. Credit: NASA It’s impossible to say if knowing the full extent of the damage to Columbia’s wing would have saved the crew. There was still no formal procedure for a Shuttle rescue mission in the event reentry was deemed to risky, and post-incident reports on the event came to the conclusion that putting a rescue mission together on such short notice would have been pushing the very limits of plausibility. Accordingly, one of the first tasks scheduled for every Shuttle crew to fly after the loss of Columbia was to conduct a thorough examination of the vehicle’s heat shield, paying close attention to the nose cone and leading edges of the wings. This was conducted using sensors mounted to the vehicle’s robotic arm, including a laser depth camera and high resolution cameras. Taking between 5 and 7 hours to complete, these examinations represented a significant loss of productivity for a vehicle that was already extremely expensive to launch and operate. But the fragility of the heat shield left NASA no alternative. Station As A Safe Haven Shuttle docked with ISS in 2011. With the exception of the mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, every Shuttle that flew after the loss of Columbia went directly to the ISS. Gone were the days where the Shuttle flew off on its own to conduct independent research and experiments; it was now firmly a vehicle to take crew and cargo to the ISS and bring them back home. This was a task which the Shuttle was vastly overqualified for, and which is now accomplished with much more simplistic spacecraft at a fraction of the cost. The reasoning behind always flying to the ISS was simple: if damage to the heat shield was found during the examination, the crew would be able to stay docked to the Station for far longer than the Shuttle itself could have remained aloft. In addition, further examinations of the heat shield would be possible from the Station, allowing Ground Control to better assess the situation. In the absolute worst case, the Shuttle being too badly damaged to return them to Earth, crew members could then return home via one of the Russian Soyuz capsules which remain docked to the Station at all times. In Space Repairs In the event damage to the Shuttle’s heat shield was found, the astronauts needed a way to conduct repairs. A procedure was developed in which a thick gel, described as having the consistency of peanut butter, could be shot into damaged thermal tiles with a device not unlike a caulk gun by an astronaut on an Extravehicular Activity (EVA, or “spacewalk”). Once shot into the damaged area, it would then be smoothed out with a spatula so it was flush with the rest of the heat shield. This operation was no small feat when in a bulky EVA suit, but was tested successfully by astronauts inside the cargo bay of the Shuttle. In 2005, astronaut Steve Robinson became the first person to ever attempt a repair on the Shuttle’s heat shield. In fact, he was the first astronaut to ever even approach the belly of the Shuttle while in space. As the bottom of the Shuttle is completely smooth, he had to be maneuvered into place at the end of a robotic arm, and carried the absolute minimum amount of tools and equipment to lower the chances of anything floating loose and hitting the spacecraft. Sending the Shuttle Home Alone In the event the Shuttle could not be repaired to the satisfaction of Ground Control, the crew could either return to Earth via Soyuz capsule or on a second Shuttle launched to come get them. But what would happen to the damaged Shuttle? At a cost of approximately $2B each, they aren’t the kind of thing you want to just cut loose and let float away. Even if reentry was deemed too dangerous to do with humans aboard, sending it down autonomously was at least worth a shot. The only problem was that the Shuttle, unlike its Soviet-made counterpart, couldn’t actually land without somebody to flip the switches in the cockpit. RCO Cable installed in Flight Deck. Credit: NASA Certain tasks like lowering the landing gear or deploying the drogue chute to slow the Shuttle after touchdown could only be performed from the physical controls on the Flight Deck, but the Shuttle’s avionics are located on the Mid Deck. To fix this, NASA engineers created the Remote Control Orbiter Cable (RCO Cable), a 28 foot long wiring harness that would connect the Shuttle’s computers to the controls on the Flight Deck. To install it, the astronauts would open up panels in the Shuttle’s cockpit, and attach the connectors of the RCO Cable in place of the original switches and buttons. The cable was then run down the hatch to the Mid Deck, and then forward to the avionic bays in the nose. Once the controls on the Flight Deck were physically linked with the computer, the astronauts could depart the Shuttle and Ground Control would be able to remotely command its return. The Shuttle would follow a modified flight path towards Edwards Air Force Base to lessen the chances of possible debris coming down over populated areas, but otherwise the landing would proceed as normal. The Post-Shuttle Era The STS program officially ended in 2011. The remaining vehicles in the Shuttle fleet: Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour, are now on a permanent “ Mission of Inspiration ” in museums across the United States. But the lessons learned during the STS program continue to shape manned spacecraft in the era of commercial spaceflight. All current and purposed spacecraft designs have returned to a more traditional arrangement with the crew vehicle riding atop the booster rocket; the risk of debris damaging a side-mounted vehicle are simply unacceptable. NASA’s safety requirements for the Commercial Crew Program include things like enhanced thermal protection systems and extended abort windows, with an end goal of lowering the odds of losing a crew member to 1-in-270 (down from 1-in-90 with the Shuttle). The SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft is a front-runner in the Commercial Crew Program, and offers many safety features designed to meet or exceed NASA requirements. It has abort capability from the launch pad all the way to orbit, can be remotely operated in case of an incapacitated crew, and has a heat shield so over-built that it can survive multiple reentries before needing replacement. Spaceflight will never be safe. Nature abhors a vacuum, and as such, crew members aboard a spacecraft will always be putting themselves in a situation where only a mistake or two separates them from death. But with the hard-learned lessons of the Space Transportation System, we’ve identified some of those mistakes and can do everything in our power to ensure they aren’t made again.","On February 1st, 2003 at eighteen seconds past 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, the Space Shuttle Columbia broke up during atmospheric entry over Texas.

Jie Jenny Zou,"West Delta 105 E is an oil-producing platform located a dozen miles off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico. A 2014 explosion on the lower deck killed Jerrel ""Bubba"" Hancock. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement Within seconds, a bright, white flash erupted on the lower deck of West Delta 105 E, an oil-production platform positioned a dozen miles off the Louisiana coast. Disoriented, one crew member found himself 10 feet away from where he had been working before he blacked out. Another likened the impact to a sledgehammer blow to his head. A third told investigators he felt like he'd been hit by an 18-wheeler, his hard hat, glasses and earplugs knocked off in the blast. For a fourth, death came instantly. Jerrel ""Bubba"" Hancock, a 24-year-old father of two, was the closest to the hatch of a large metal tank when flammable vapors ignited, unleashing a fireball the afternoon of Nov. 20, 2014. He died of blunt-force trauma to the head and chest. Hancock's death during a maintenance job could have been avoided, federal investigators concluded in late 2016. Safety lapses leading up to the accident were laid bare in a 73-page report by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), a little-known agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior responsible for policing the sprawling offshore industry. It was the sort of comprehensive post-mortem for which BSEE had been designed. But the agency has faced crippling challenges on several fronts, from staffing to its ability to hold companies accountable. Born in the wake of 2010's Deepwater Horizon explosion — which killed 11 workers and dumped millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico — BSEE has struggled to implement safety regulations that are now under threat of being rolled back. The agency's team of roughly 130 inspectors is responsible for conducting 20,000 inspections annually across 2,000-plus facilities from the Gulf to the Alaska coast. Its annual budget of $204 million is about a third of the cost of the sunken Deepwater rig. Under the Trump administration, the very fate of the small bureau — and its roughly 800 employees — is also in doubt. BSEE engineers inspect Royal Dutch Shell's new Appomattox floating platform on March 27, 2018. The agency says ten inspectors spent three days in the facility. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement As the White House and the Interior Department pursue ""energy dominance,"" opening more federal lands and waters to drilling than ever before, BSEE's status — along with the safety reforms that helped empower it — has become increasingly tenuous. Concerns over the agency's potential demise have swirled on Capitol Hill for months, buoyed by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's calls for deregulation, restructuring and his controversial pick to lead BSEE: Louisiana native and longtime oil-industry ally Scott Angelle, who has pledged to take the bureau ""from an era of isolation to an era of cooperation."" Companies have welcomed the change. Randall Luthi, head of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore sector, is a fan of the agency's ""better dialogue"" with businesses. ""No company wants to have an accident,"" said Luthi. ""Safety and good economics go hand in hand."" The bureau has always strived to take a collaborative approach with industry, but critics worry BSEE is going too far. ""I do have a problem when the relationship becomes so cozy that it's not an arm's length relationship anymore,"" Michael Bromwich, BSEE's first director, said in an interview with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR. ""I'm concerned that that's what's happening now."" Safety advocates agree that conditions offshore have improved under BSEE's watch. But the agency has faced hurdles over the years, troubles that predate the Trump administration. Reports by the Government Accountability Office in 2016 and 2017 detailed how the bureau suffered from poor leadership, relying on a series of pricey outside consultants to determine priorities and strategic goals. Auditors also found a key program aimed at improving the bureau's inspections had been beset with delays over several years and the agency had missed a critical opportunity to staff up. The bureau has had difficulty attracting employees, competing directly with higher-paying oil and gas companies for technical experts. Weeks after the 2016 election, the agency was dealt a blow in the courts, which sided with industry and ruled that BSEE had no authority to hold contractors — like the companies working on West Delta 105 E in 2014 — liable for violations that could lead to spills, injuries or deaths. By early 2017, the agency appeared to have abandoned what was once a priority: getting industry to report near-misses with the aim of averting catastrophes. The consequences of an ineffective regulator ripple far from Washington. Oil workers are seven times more likely than the average U.S. worker to die on the job, according to a 2013 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On April 21, 2010, a large plume of smoke rises from BP's Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven men died in the blast. Gerald Herbert/AP Deepwater and a sex-and-drugs ethics scandal force change The first explosion on Transocean's Deepwater Horizon rig hit at 9:50 p.m. on April 20, 2010. Video captured 4,800 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico showed grayish-orange oil gushing so fast from BP's Macondo well it looked like steam from a locomotive. Desperate to contain the leak caused by the blast, scientists and engineers shot tires and golf balls underwater in a failed attempt to plug the well. Researchers initially estimated crude oil was spilling at a rate of 5,000 barrels per day; the actual number was closer to 50,000.After 86 days, the well was temporarily capped on July 15, 2010, ending the first chapter of what would become the largest and most expensive environmental disaster the U.S. petroleum industry had ever seen. But the Interior Department was also reckoning with a debacle of its own. A high-profile ethics scandal uncovered in 2008 continued to cast a shadow on the agency's Minerals Management Service, which, awkwardly, oversaw both offshore leasing and enforcement. Investigations uncovered coziness between MMS employees and the companies they regulated, ranging from lavish gifts and self-dealing to cocaine-and-sex-fueled industry events. With Deepwater making national headlines, Interior officials could no longer ignore MMS's fundamental conflict: generating revenue from offshore drilling while simultaneously regulating the industry. Oversight had taken a back seat to leasing and it showed. MMS had fewer than 60 inspectors to cover 3,000-plus offshore facilities and had never established an environmental enforcement program. In October 2011, MMS was dissolved and three separate agencies — including BSEE — were formed to take its place. 'We kiss our families goodbye' The man now running BSEE delivered a rallying cry following the Deepwater disaster that led to the agency's creation. Just days after the well was capped, Angelle took to the Cajundome stage in Lafayette, Louisiana, and bellowed, ""Enough is enough! And it's time to quit punishing innocent American workers to achieve some unrealistic political agenda."" He wasn't talking about safety problems. He meant the moratorium on deep-water drilling imposed by the Obama administration in response to the spill. ""We proudly do what few other states are willing to do,"" Angelle, the state's then-lieutenant governor, told the cheering crowd in the 13,500-seat arena. ""We put on our hard hats and our steel-toe boots. We kiss our families goodbye, and we begin the tough work of exploring, producing, processing, storing, refining and transporting the fuel to energize the great United States of America."" Handpicked by the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association to headline the "" Rally for Economic Survival,"" Angelle was key to helping overturn the moratorium. After the rally, Angelle spearheaded the ""Back to Work Coalition,"" coordinating with lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute to reverse the ban that same year. His efforts elevated his profile within the Republican party, though he subsequently failed in bids for governor and U.S. Congress. BSEE declined requests by the Center and NPR to interview Angelle, or others, about BSEE's safety mission and how it comports with the Trump administration's ""energy dominance."" An agency spokesman wrote in an email that he was ""told not to respond"" to written questions sent by the Center for Public Integrity. In a written statement to NPR, the agency says Angelle is ""laser focused on safety,"" and that this is not at odds with also focusing on robust production. BSEE says starting this month, it is increasing the time its inspectors spend on offshore oil and gas facilities. In a March press release, Angelle also said he wanted ""BSEE's programs and processes to be the best in the world, and I'm not afraid to subject them to scrutiny to determine where improvements are needed."" Not 'just a strange and unprecedented event' To this day, Angelle — like many hardline industry voices — casts the BP disaster as a fluke. But safety experts have argued since 2011 that the problems that doomed Deepwater — like faulty equipment and disregard for safety protocols — are far more common than companies admit. ""It's just not accurate to point to Deepwater Horizon and say, 'Well, this is just a strange and unprecedented event unlikely to recur,'"" says Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general who oversaw the bureau's formation in 2011 and now runs a Washington-based public affairs firm. He points to a special presidential commission that investigated the disaster and found the Macondo blowout was not an isolated incident. Previous close calls could have been just as catastrophic had it not been for luck. The commission's report in 2011 found that regulators hadn't kept pace with the offshore industry, which was increasingly outsourcing work to contractors while drilling deeper and deeper. Although the U.S. had the highest rate of offshore fatalities globally, it had the lowest rate of reported injuries, a ""striking contrast"" suggesting significant underreporting by industry, according to the commission. Among the report's recommendations was the creation of an offshore safety group similar to a watchdog formed by the nuclear power sector after Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island reactor partially melted down in 1979. Within months of the report's release, the American Petroleum Institute — a lobbying powerhouse representing more than 650 corporate members — founded the Center for Offshore Safety in Houston. ""We quite specifically in our report said, 'We recommend this not be done within the American Petroleum Institute,'"" says Don Boesch, a University of Maryland professor of marine science and a commission member. ""Even though it's long been dealing with safety, it's lobbying, it's doing politics instead. So, who would believe it?"" API has long opposed offshore reforms, arguing that industry should be allowed to self-regulate. Over nearly a century, the trade group has developed a plethora of voluntary industry standards covering everything from drilling liquids to refining. But when BSEE tried to revamp its workplace safety rules and make some of these API standards mandatory, the process took the agency six years. Boesch says the hope was that API's offshore center would help build consensus and speed adoption of regulations. It didn't work out that way. In 2016, API opposed the bureau's well-control rule, which standardized measures such as blowout preventers, claiming it would saddle the industry with $30 billion in unnecessary costs. The regulation — which also took several years to develop — was ultimately criticized by safety advocates for being too weak. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board, which investigates industrial accidents, urged revisions that would ""give BSEE more explicit authority."" Neither API or its Center for Offshore Safety responded to requests for comment. API's offshore center was enlisted early on to help develop the bureau's near-miss reporting system, a confidential program that tracks close-call incidents like equipment failures. Launched in 2015, SafeOCS (for ""outer continental shelf"") was modeled on a similar program used by commercial airlines. Despite guarantees of anonymity for companies that file reports, SafeOCS languished. Just before the 2016 presidential election, Doug Morris, BSEE's chief of offshore regulatory programs, described industry response to the program as "" lukewarm."" During a conference in May 2017, Morris again lamented lackluster participation in SafeOCS. "" We built it, and nobody came,"" he said. As of last November, only three of 88 companies operating offshore had signed on. BSEE refused to make Morris — who previously worked for API as a managing attorney — available for an interview. It also declined to answer any questions about SafeOCS. Activity in the Gulf has drawn down in recent years due to low oil prices and a surge in onshore production, but experts predict it will pick up soon. Amid the downturn, offshore accidents continue to make headlines. In October, a broken pipeline from a platform leaked roughly 672,000 gallons of oil in the largest Gulf spill since Deepwater. In December, a worker off the coast of Louisiana died after getting pinned against a bar known as a stanchion. BSEE is investigating the February death of an offshore contract worker killed while handling fire-fighting equipment. In media interviews last year, Angelle faulted the Obama administration for not doing enough to bolster near-miss reporting.He pledged to better promote the program and formed a special team to figure out why it hasn't caught on. A legal setback to holding contractors liable The agency has also faced setbacks in its attempts to hold contractors liable. When Michael Bromwich was brought on to overhaul offshore regulation in June 2010, he was surprised to learn that violations historically had not been issued to contractors — even when it was clear that they, not platform owners, had engaged in misconduct. Interior's authority, he was told, stopped at leaseholders, despite the ubiquity of contractors and the inherent dangers of deep-water drilling. Eighty percent of offshore workers killed from 2003 to 2010 were contracted employees, according to CDC data. So was Bubba Hancock, killed in 2014. ""The fact that we had unilaterally decided to grant immunity to all non-operators was a misguided act of administrative grace,"" Bromwich told an industry crowd in 2011, vowing to continue BSEE's new policy of holding contractors liable. The first violations the agency issued to contractors went to Transocean and Halliburton, two companies involved in the BP spill. The point of the speech, Bromwich said in a recent interview, was to tell industry it could no longer ""get away with murder."" ""It was really kind of going into the lion's den and telling them, 'We're coming after you,'"" he says. But industry fought back and won. In USA v. Black Elk Energy Offshore, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled the government had no authority to bring criminal sanctions against contractors for their role in a 2012 explosion that killed three workers and left an oil sheen in the Gulf. In Island Operating Co., Inc. v. Jewell, the Interior Department fined Island for its role in a 2012 near-miss in which two workers dived 40 feet off a platform to escape a chemical fire. But a trial court agreed with the company that the government also lacked authority to bring civil sanctions and Interior did not pursue an appeal. Island had especially strong backing for its case. Joining in support was the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the National Ocean Industries Association, the group headed by Luthi, the former Wyoming legislator who served as MMS director from 2007 to 2009 and investigated the sex and drugs scandal. Representing Island was Bracewell LLP, a top-dollar law firm known for vigorously defending the oil industry. Island did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In an interview, Luthi said that it's up to companies to ensure the contractors they hire are safe. ""As a leaseholder you're the one who is ultimately primarily responsible for what goes on,"" says Luthi. ""The leaseholder becomes the regulator to ensure all the standards are met."" 'Not adhering to basic tenets of a safety culture' Contractor safety was one area BSEE officials asked the National Academy of Sciences to study in 2016 as part of a review of the bureau's inspection program. But in December, Secretary Zinke abruptly suspended the study, drawing the ire of environmentalists and safety advocates. In March, Zinke announced several initiatives to ensure ""responsible energy development,"" such as increasing the time BSEE inspectors spend offshore. The explosion that killed Hancock in 2014 is proof that ""not adhering to the basic tenets of a safety culture can lead to tragic results,"" then-BSEE director Brian Salerno wrote in a 2016 memo. According to the agency's report, a switch powering a unit called a heater-treater hadn't been turned off, despite assurances by an employee of Island Operating Company, a firm contracted by platform owner Fieldwood Energy LLC to handle daily operations. Hancock worked for a cleaning company hired by Fieldwood to wash down the unit. At the time of the accident, Island was a contractor for 625 structures in the Gulf. Island did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Fieldwood CEO Matt McCarroll wrote in an email to the Center for Public Integrity, ""We have no higher mission or responsibility than the safety of our operations, employees and contractors."" The company also provided documents in which it asserted that Hancock and the company he worked for, Turnkey Cleaning Services, were responsible for safety failures that led to the accident. While BSEE found that Turnkey did not effectively follow safety procedures, the agency concluded that power flowing through the unit was the ""probable cause of the ignition"" that led to the explosion. Dale P. Martin Jr., who is listed as the principal of Turnkey, did not respond to calls for comment. Fieldwood, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February, is currently appealing several safety citations BSEE issued to the company as a result of the 2014 explosion. The night of his death, Hancock's body was airlifted to New Orleans and transported 150 miles west to Abbeville — the city where he and his wife, Kayler, fell in love and raised their children. Three days before Thanksgiving 2014, she laid her husband to rest. ""I was mad at everyone on that platform,"" Kayler said by telephone. She settled a wrongful-death case against Island and Fieldwood last year for an undisclosed amount. ""I needed justice for my children,"" she said. ""I felt like they owed me the world, because they took the world away from me."" NPR reporter Jeff Brady contributed to this story.

 A man injured in the cyclone in Zimbabwe is carried away from a helicopter.
Cyclone Idai, which struck the coastline of Mozambique on 14 March, has caused devastation and heavy loss of life. 
The UN says 1.7 million people in Mozambique lived in the path of the cyclone, with a further 920,000 people affected in Malawi and many thousands more in Zimbabwe. 
So how common is extreme weather in southern Africa, and were these countries sufficiently prepared? 
Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. 
Most form in the central Indian Ocean, sufficiently far enough off the coast for some preparations to be made. 
Cyclone Idai was unusual in that it formed in the Mozambique Channel, close to the coastline, giving governments and aid agencies less time to issue warnings and make plans.
""The cyclone was by no stretch of the imagination the most powerful... but what made it so devastating was where and how it hit,"" said Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization.
""The ocean floor along the coast by Mozambique is conducive to give storm surges, which reached roughly 3.5m-to-4m in the coastal city of Beira - which is absolutely huge.""
The low-lying coastal areas of central Mozambique are highly vulnerable to natural disasters but the budget for preparing and responding to them is very small. 
Last year, the government received support from international donors for a disaster fund of $18.3m (£13.9m) for 2018 and 2019.
This contingency plan is the main source of funding for any disaster response and is intended specifically for search and rescue within the first 72 hours.
For a major disaster such as Cyclone Idai, most of the funds for recovery and reconstruction are raised after a disaster has struck. 
And even without this latest emergency, Mozambique was facing economic strains as a result of a controversial loan deal in 2016 which resulted in a suspension of some international donor aid to the government.
Media captionAerial footage showing the disaster in Mozambique
How much warning?
The meteorological office of Mozambique, Inam, issued weather alerts as the storm developed.
Three days before the cyclone struck, the government raised the alert to the highest possible level, telling people to evacuate threatened areas. 
Some people were moved out by boat beforehand, but many didn't respond to warnings or weren't aware of them. 
""These public alerts were made in a timely fashion but it's always down to actors along the chain to decide how to act on this type of information,"" says Joao de Lima Rego, an adviser at Deltares, a research organisation focusing on coastal regions and river basins that has helped develop a forecasting system in Mozambique. 
As part of the forward planning for severe weather, safe zones had been created in rural areas for evacuation above the flood plain. 
On this occasion, however, the flooding was far more severe than anticipated.

Preparations in urban areas
The port city of Beira, with a population of half a million, had introduced measures to strengthen resilience to cyclones and flooding. 
Preparedness has focused on drainage systems, says Dinis Juizo, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo. 
Drainage canals and flood-control protection, such as a large water basin, have also been introduced.
However, much of the population of Beira outside the city centre live in informal housing often made of materials unable to withstand severe weather.
""The level of investment has not been high enough for an event of this scale,"" says Dinis Juizo.

 Aid agencies have faced challenges in getting resources to flood-hit areas of Mozambique
Malawi and Zimbabwe
The storm that eventually became Cyclone Idai had caused deaths in Malawi, to the north of Mozambique, in early March.
People in lowland areas were warned, but because warnings about flooding and rainfall are an annual occurrence during the rainy season, many people were reluctant to move and didn't anticipate the extent to which the country would suffer.
In Zimbabwe, there were also warnings about the approaching storm. 
But Zimbabwe's Minister of Defence, Oppah Muchinguri, has said her government failed to anticipate its strength. 
By the time the storm reached Zimbabwe it had weakened considerably and was no longer a tropical cyclone.
Nevertheless, it had a severe impact on the eastern regions of the country.

"Tilly Alcayna, Harvard University / The Conversation","In an era of seemingly ceaseless tragedies, it can be hard to stay on top of the news. This week, six wildfires have burned up over 141,000 acres in California – an area larger than the cities of New York and Boston combined – killing two people. A few weeks prior, the headlines were on Iran’s deadly earthquake. Before that, it was the Rohingya refugee crisis. You may have managed to take in all that information. But do you know about the November plague outbreak in Madagascar that has infected 2,119 people and killed 171? What about flooding in South Asia a few months back, which affected more than 41 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal? If it’s all new to you, you’re hardly alone. According to the International Federation of the Red Cross, 91 percent of global crises go unnoticed. As a researcher at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, a Harvard University center dedicated to advancing the science and practice of humanitarian action, our aim is to change that. Why? Evidence shows that ignoring all these small crises is a recipe for global disaster. The many sides of world crises Crises can take many forms, from hurricanes and floods to epidemics and complex emergencies like war. They also have varying levels of intensity: Taking only Latin America and the Caribbean, between 1994 and 2014, for every one large-scale crisis, there were approximately 177 smaller crises. November 2017 saw not only a 7.1 magnitude earthquake kill over 400 people in Iran and Iraq, for example, but also flash floods, a typhoon and earthquakes in Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia, among other countries. People generally pay less attention to these events, in part because there isn’t much data on them. Still, while the impacts of an individual small crises may be less – both in terms of death toll and physical damage – together minor crises can have huge human consequences. According to a 2015 United Nations report, the accumulated losses from small and recurrent events like flash floods, fires and drought account for 42 percent or more of total economic losses in low- and middle-income countries. For particularly disaster-prone nations, the toll can be much higher. In Madagascar, for example, the annual economic losses from minor crises between 2001 and 2011 were equivalent to 75 percent of annual public investment during that same period. This is a serious economic erosion challenge for any country, but especially a low-income nation like Madagascar. Plus, even in places where insurance exists, such events are rarely covered. As such, small crises can plunge families into debt. They also create food insecurity, drive environment damage and hurt mental health. Small crises may also lay the foundations for greater tragedy to come. Before the Syrian civil war began in 2011, for example, drought and food shortages were compelling out-of-work farmers to leave rural areas starting in 2007. Over several years, people from the countryside migrated en masse into big cities like Damascus. This influx, in turn, exacerbated Syria’s existing political instability and contributed to the initial waves of political unrest that began rocking the country in 2011. The end result is now one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time. Neglected crises I call the kind of incidents that occasionally grace international headlines but tend to fade quickly into the background “neglected crises.” Currently, repeated famines in Somalia and Ethiopia fall into this category, as do the ongoing civil wars in Yemen and the Central African Republic. Protracted violence and displacement in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda have also made brief appearances in international news, only to disappear for those not suffering through them. These problems aren’t just neglected in the news – they’re also critically underfunded. From 2016 to 2017, the United Nations fell short of its requested US$22.8 billion in global humanitarian assistance by fully $20.1 billion. Consequently, neglected crises tend to get little economic and humanitarian support, even when great human suffering results from them. More than a million people have been uprooted by conflict in the Central African Republic, yet budget shortfalls compelled aid workers distributing food to displaced people to withdraw in early 2017. Silent crises Then there are what I call “silent crises.” These events may be noteworthy for local government and the United Nations, but less so internationally. Zika is a case in point. For two years before this mosquito-borne illness exploded across Latin America in 2015, it infected 30,000 people in French Polynesia. But as no deaths were reported and the consequences of infections remained uncertain, almost no one paid attention. Unseasonably wet or dry weather is another issue that both the media and humanitarian relief organizations tend to neglect. That, too, is short-sighted. The United Nations has found that between 1990 and 2014, the cumulative effects of droughts and floods in Latin America “generated more than half of all human losses due to climate events.” Bad weather during those 15 years damaged the homes, crops and land of 115 million Latin Americans. And because climate change-related disasters are strongly associated with poverty and inequality, these aberrant weather phenomena disproportionately hurt people in low- and middle-income countries. Neglected rural problems often culminate in big urban crises. Take the 2010 Haitian earthquake, for example. Its epicenter struck near Port-au-Prince, a city that had doubled in size between 1986 and 2006 as government neglect of agricultural policy and the well-being of people in the countryside forced millions of farmers to relocate to the capital. By 2010, 86 percent of Port-au-Prince residents lived in dense informal settlements, many of them located on mountainsides, along rivers and in other fragile areas. Urban crises Haiti’s exploding urban growth echoes a global trend. In 1950, only 30 percent of people lived in cities. Today, the global urban population exceeds the rural population. Exploding urban populations, combined with poor planning, have led to overcrowding, insufficient public services and rising urban inequality. When disaster then strikes in such cities, the death toll can be astounding. Haiti’s 2010 earthquake claimed approximately 310,000 lives, including 25 percent of all the country’s civil servants, and displaced more than 1.5 million. Today, 2.5 million Haitians still subsist on humanitarian assistance. Seven years later, more than $13.5 billion in international aid money has gone into funding the country’s recovery, including the added toll of 2016’s Hurricane Matthew. That’s because post-disaster response is incredibly expensive. In 2013, the Red Cross calculated that for every $1 spent on preparedness activities, $4 could be saved in response internationally So, if saving lives is not reason enough to pay more attention to small crises, perhaps money will be.

Brian Heater,"A few weeks after passing both the Senate and House with an overwhelming majority, the controversial Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) has been signed into law. In spite of only becoming official today, the bill has already begun to have a profound impact around the Web. Craigslist notably shuttered its Personals section here in the U.S., and Reddit adjusted its own rules in an attempt to brace for the coming law. The Justice Department also began cracking down on sites — late last week, Backpage was seized by the DOJ and its owners were hit with a staggering 93-count indictment that reads like a laundry list of things for which you don’t want to get indicted. “Trafficking is probably worse today than at any time in our history,” Trump told the press during a signing ceremony today. Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who co-sponsored the bill, sent out a press release stating, “This is a momentous day in the fight to help stop online sex trafficking, and a big victory for trafficking victims and survivors who for too long have been denied the opportunity to get the justice they deserve.” In spite of overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle, the bill has been a controversial one, both among sex workers and internet rights advocates. In a post from late-February, the Electronic Frontier Foundation called the potential bill “a disaster,” noting that the onus for policing content would fall exclusively in the hands of sites hosting third-party content. “[The bill] might sound noble, but it would do nothing to stop sex traffickers,” the EFF writes. “What it would do is force online platforms to police their users’ speech more forcefully than ever before, silencing legitimate voices in the process.” Sex workers have been equally critical of the bill and have called it, “devastating,” both with regards to their livelihood and a fear of increased violence if these sites are shuttered.","A few weeks after passing both the Senate and House with an overwhelming majority, the controversial Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) has been signed into law.

Joe Berkowitz,"It was a tragic accident with mass casualties. Now it’s being used as stock disaster footage in the dystopian movie Bird Box. And Netflix has no plans to remove it.The Sandra Bullock-starring sci-fi streamer is an undisputed hit, spawning culture-saturating memes and racking up a staggering 80 million viewers in its first four weeks. At least one of those viewers, however, noticed that some of the world-building footage intended to convey the level of chaos in the film’s reality looked familiar. This footage comes from the 2013 Lac-Mégantic rail disaster, a Canadian tragedy in which an unattended freight train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded, destroying a large swath of the city and taking 47 lives.
Once Lac-Mégantic Mayor Julie Morin became aware that footage of the disaster was being used this way–first on the Netflix series Travelers and later on Bird Box–she called upon the company to remove it.
“We find that it’s really a lack of respect,” Morin told Canadian press on Tuesday. “It’s hard enough for our citizens to see these images when they are used normally and respectfully on the news. Just imagine, to have them used as fiction, as if they were invented.”
Peacock Alley Entertainment, the company behind the series Travelers, quickly apologized for using the footage and vowed to replace it. However, as far as Bird Box goes, Netflix is leaving the footage in the film.
According to TheNew York Times, the footage came from a stock agency called Pond5, which has a library of over 14 million video clips depicting military conflicts, natural disasters, and fictional scenes. The CEO of Pond5 has since apologized for the way the footage was used, saying “We didn’t do all we could on our end to make sure that people understood the sensitive nature of the content, because what happened is not appropriate.”
After a spokesman from Netflix called Morin on Thursday morning to let her know the company would not be removing the footage from the film, Morin said in a statement that she is satisfied Netflix has “committed to reflect with their partners on the use of images so that this situation is not repeated.”
Being vigilant not to repeat the mistake is a productive step forward; however, it must be cold comfort to anyone affected by the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster seeing it used to amplify Sandra Bullock’s fictional sense of danger. And it’s hard not to wonder what Netflix’s reaction would be if instead of Lac Megantic, Quebec, the tragedy had taken place in Sausalito, Calif.","Footage of the 2013 Lac-Mégantic rail disaster appear in “Bird Box,” as part of the film’s world-building, and the mayor of the Quebec town is not happy about it.

Megan Farokhmanesh,"The beloved and deeply disturbing anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion is heading to Netflix. All 26 episodes, as well as films The End of Evangelion & Evangelion: Death (True)2, will be available to stream come spring 2019. Set 15 years after a cataclysmic event, Evangelion follows a mysterious organization called Nerv as they fight against alien invaders known as Angels. The only thing stopping another disaster is a group of teenagers who pilot giant mechs known as Evangelion units. Netflix already offers a fair mix of anime, from beloved shows like Naruto, Death Note, and Fullmetal Alchemist to newer series like Devilman Crybaby, Aggretsuko, and Castlevania. The streaming service will also add Rilakkuma and Kaoru, Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac, and Ultraman next year. Evangelion first aired in 1995, and it remains one of the most celebrated and influential anime to date. Heavily doused in religious imagery, the show explores themes of depression and existential dread. Its arrival on Netflix marks the first time the show will be available to stream, which means a whole new generation of anime lovers will have the chance to celebrate and be scarred by its unforgettable story.

Devindra Hardawar,"Apple gave us a hint of where the Watch was headed last year, when it announced new heart tracking features and a Stanford-led study to detect atrial fibrillation. But while they were intriguing, they weren't as potentially life-saving as the world's first consumer ECG device. With that feature alone, Apple has made its latest Watch essential, something practically unheard of in the wearable world. If you own an iPhone, your well-being is easily worth a $399 smartwatch (or $499 if you want cellular connectivity). Good luck beating that, Fitbit and Samsung. Of course, it's only a matter of time until competitors bundle in ECGs of their own, but Apple will always have bragging rights -- not to mention a very dedicated user base -- for doing so first. At this point, it makes sense for wearables to take more cues from sophisticated medical devices, instead of just try to replicate the things we normally do on smartphones. We're also taking Apple at its word so far, it remains to be seen how well its heart monitoring actually works. (It also would have been nice to see some battery life upgrades to go alongside such an important new feature.) This is bold new territory for Apple -- it can't afford a Maps-like disaster now that it's handling important personal health data. Too many false positives could quickly lead to consumers ignoring real issues. Still, there are already several reports about earlier Apple Watch models saving lives, so there's a good chance Apple's claims aren't just marketing bluster.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Is Hawaii part of the Ring of Fire? Could the ongoing eruption at Kilauea volcano trigger similar outbursts along the West Coast, or explode like Krakatoa? If it weren’t for volcanoes, would the Earth itself explode? The answer to each of these questions is a resounding “no.” And yet all of them were recently promoted by high-profile news outlets or respected individuals with large social media followings. And that’s not even the worst of it. In more conspiratorially-minded corners of the internet, folks have been wondering whether shockwaves from North Korean nuclear tests rippled through the Pacific tectonic plate, triggering Kilauea’s eruption. Or perhaps it’s all just ancient aliens messing with us. (Again, no on both counts.) Every major scientific event, from a solar eclipse to an iceberg calving in Antarctica, spawns its share of sensational media coverage, false claims, and conspiracy theories. But for whatever reason, volcanic eruptions seem especially prone to getting swept up in hyperbole. And that’s unfortunate, because while chemtrails aren’t going to kill you, getting the wrong information on an eruption just might. That’s why official sources like the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and a cadre of scientists have been working overtime to disseminate accurate information and debunk myths as the eruption at Kilauea continues. And they’ve seen some success. In an article published on May 13, the Associated Press spread the idea that Kilauea is part of the geologically-dubious Ring of Fire (it’s actually a hotspot volcano in the middle of the Pacific plate), and that its eruption might trigger heightened volcanic activity on the West Coast (the two systems are unconnected). Scientists were quick to respond on social media, prompting the AP to delete a tweet and slap a correction at the top of its story. Then there’s the notion that Kilauea “could be another Krakatoa,” a reference to the Indonesian volcano’s massive 1883 eruption that killed over 36,000 people. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard constitutional law professor, tweeted this nonsensical scenario to his 334,000 followers on Sunday. According to Michael Poland, a volcanologist with the USGS Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, the size of Tribe’s audience prompted USGS Volcanoes to issue a rare direct rebuttal on Twitter. Tribe subsequently deleted the tweet. Poland is one of several scientists that USGS has called in to help field social media questions and disseminate information while staff in Hawaii focus on the local response. He told Earther the flood of queries regarding Kilauea’s activity has been “incredible.” While the social media team tries to respond individually as much as possible, sometimes, when a false rumor pops up over and over again, they issue a more official response. That happened on Monday, when the USGS Hawaii Volcano Observatory published an article explaining that no, Kilauea is not going to fall into the ocean and generate a Pacific-wide tsunami. The wild-sounding idea stemmed a respected source: A May 7 article published by UC Berkeley’s Seismology Lab, which discussed a low-probability scenario in which the collapse of Kilauea’s south flank generates a giant undersea earthquake. On the whole, the Berkeley article was “very well written” and accurate, Poland said. “But [at the end] it needed that one more paragraph that said the odds of this happening are very small.” Emphasizing the likelihood of a specific scenario is a hallmark of good disaster communication, according to Concord University volcanologist Janine Krippner. “There are people who look at limited data and make wild predictions very confidently, but if you really know how uncertain they are, [you] don’t do that,” she told Earther. “We don’t want to scare people, we don’t want to unnecessarily dramatize things. ” For an example of how exaggerated warnings can have real impacts on people’s lives, Krippner pointed to the eruptions at Mt. Agung in Bali, Indonesia last fall, the build-up to which generated a seemingly-endless buffet of sensational stories. She recalled receiving emails and Twitter messages from families who canceled their hard-earned vacations solely because of tabloid headlines, even if those vacations were to somewhere outside the affected area. “This was affecting local people... because [visitors] were frightened away from going.” “We don’t want to scare people, we don’t want to unnecessarily dramatize things.” There’s also the concern misinformation will erode trust in real information, causing people to, say, not take evacuation orders seriously when their lives are at risk. Poland said he was especially disturbed by the rumors of Kilauea sliding into the sea because of how much it upset locals. “The people in the disturbance zone get concerned, and many of them that know the USGS come to us and say ‘what is this, why aren’t you telling us?’” he said. “It creates a nervousness [among] the public, and [extra] work for those people trying to respond to the real threat.” Compounding the difficulty for scientists is the fact that the outlets doing the most damage—several volcanologists I spoke with cited “the UK tabloids” as the worst offenders—have outsized platforms compared with the folks trying to clear the air. Another problem is that most of the lay public learns next to nothing about volcanoes in school. “A lot of people don’t get any geosciences or Earth sciences at any point,” Denison University volcanologist Erik Klemetti told Earther. “If you don’t take it in college or don’t go to college, you [may] just get the colloquial knowledge.” By and large, “colloquial knowledge” is the stuff we pick up from disaster flicks: think 2003's The Core or the 1997 classic Volcano. Fun as they may be, movies like these have ultimately reinforced a smorgasbord of false beliefs, from the idea that every eruption will be a global event (there are often more than a dozen happening around the world at once), to the notion that eruptions are only dangerous if they’re spewing fountains of lava ( giant ash clouds can be just as bad ), or that maybe you can just outrun a pyroclastic flow (you can’t). Asked how the media can help combat these ideas, Klemetti said it’s important to make sure information is from good sources like the USGS, and to cool the discussion of worst-case scenarios. Ultimately it’s important to remember that eruptions are natural, normal events, and that just because you’re hearing about one in the news right now doesn’t mean the Earth is entering some sort of state of heightened activity or unrest (yet another very common misconception). “I think people look for patterns, want there to be patterns,” Poland said. “I think in some ways we’re programmed to do that.” But as long as volcanologists have to fight our psychological programming, they will. After all, lives are at stake. Geophysicist and disaster researcher Mika McKinnon emphasized how important it is that every expert with a platform step up when they see bad information making the rounds. “The USGS is doing amazing job but it does not have the social media clout of NASA,” she said. “All the disaster and science communication people who do have an established platform? Right now it’s important for them to be identifying misconceptions, [and] slapping them down.”","Is Hawaii part of the Ring of Fire?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" Volunteers have begun burying victims of Indonesia's deadly earthquake and tsunami in a mass grave. The disaster devastated swathes of Sulawesi island and has left at least 844 people dead. Four days after the natural disaster hit, some remote areas have yet to be contacted. A lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Dozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated coastal resort of Palu. Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and ""power is out almost everywhere"". Some survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies. Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen. President Joko Widodo has welcomed offers of international help. On a visit to the region, the president urged a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Meanwhile, government officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck.

The authorities say they want to prevent an outbreak of disease caused by decomposing bodies. In the hills above Palu, AFP news agency reports, volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive. Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since. ""When the wave came, I lost her,"" he said. ""I was carried about 50 metres. I couldn't hold anything."" Patients and corpses side by side By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Why was the tsunami so destructive? The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. A tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake hit on Friday, but many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. Videos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesia, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

Devin Coldewey,"Last week brought an extraordinary demonstration of the dangers of operating a surveillance state especially a shabby one, as China’s apparently is. An unsecured database exposed millions of records of Chinese Muslims being tracked via facial recognition an ugly trifecta of prejudice, bureaucracy, and incompetence.
The security lapse was discovered by Victor Gevers at the GDI Foundation, a security organization working in the public’s interest. Using the infamous but useful Shodan search engine, he found a MongoDB instance owned by the Chinese company SenseNets that stored an ever-increasing number of data points from a facial recognition system apparently at least partially operated by the Chinese government.
Many of the targets of this system were Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic and religious minority in China that the country has persecuted in what it considers secrecy, isolating them in remote provinces in what amount to religious gulags.
This database was no limited sting operation: some 2.5 million people had their locations and other data listed in it. Gevers told me that data points included national ID card number with issuance and expiry dates; sex; nationality; home address; DOB; photo; employer; and known previously visited face detection locations.
This data, Gevers said, plainly “had been visited multiple times by visitors all over the globe. And also the database was ransacked somewhere in December by a known actor,” one known as Warn, who has previously ransomed poorly configured MongoDB instances. So it’s all out there now.
A bad idea, poorly executed, with sad parallels
Courtesy: Victor Gevers/GDI.foundation
First off, it is bad enough that the government is using facial recognition systems to target minorities and track their movements, especially considering the treatment many of these people have already received. The ethical failure on full display here is colossal but unfortunately no more than we have come to expect from an increasingly authoritarian China.
Using technology as a tool to track and influence the populace is a proud bullet point on the country’s security agenda, but even allowing for the cultural differences that produce something like the social credit rating system, the wholesale surveillance of a minority group is beyond the pale. (And I say this in full knowledge of our own problematic methods in the U.S.)
But to do this thing so poorly is just embarrassing, and should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks a surveillance state can be well administrated in Congress, for example. We’ve seen security tech theater from China before, in the ineffectual and likely barely functioning AR displays for scanning nearby faces, but this is different not a stunt but a major effort and correspondingly large failure.
The duty of monitoring these citizens was obviously at least partially outsourced to SenseNets (note this is different from SenseTime, but many of the same arguments will apply to any major people-tracking tech firm), which in a way mirrors the current controversy in the U.S. regarding Amazon’s Rekognition and its use though on a far, far smaller scale by police departments. It is not possible for federal or state actors to spin up and support the tech and infrastructure involved in such a system on short notice; like so many other things the actual execution falls to contractors.
And as SenseNets shows, these contractors can easily get it wrong, sometimes disastrously so.
MongoDB, it should be said, is not inherently difficult to secure; it’s just a matter of choosing the right settings in deployment (settings that are now but were not always the defaults). But for some reason people tend to forget to check those boxes when using the popular system; over and over we’ve seen poorly configured instances being accessible to the public, exposing hundreds of thousands of accounts. This latest one must surely be the largest and most damaging, however.
Gevers pointed out that the server was also highly vulnerable to MySQL exploits among other things, and was of course globally visible on Shodan. “So this was a disaster waiting to happen,” he said.
In fact it was a disaster waiting to happen twice; the company re-exposed the database a few days after securing it, after I wrote this story but before I published:

Living in a glass house
The truth is, though, that any such centralized database of sensitive information is a disaster waiting to happen, for pretty much everyone involved. A facial recognition database full of carefully organized demographic data and personal movements is a hell of a juicy target, and as the SenseTimes instance shows, malicious actors foreign and domestic will waste no time taking advantage of the slightest slip-up (to say nothing of a monumental failure).
We know major actors in the private sector fail at this stuff all the time and, adding insult to injury, are not held responsible case in point: Equifax. We know our weapons systems are hackable; our electoral systems are trivial to compromise and under active attack; the census is a security disaster; and unsurprisingly the agencies responsible for making all these rickety systems are themselves both unprepared and ignorant, by the government’s own admission… not to mention unconcerned with due process.
The companies and governments of today are simply not equipped to handle the enormousness, or recognize the enormity, of large scale surveillance. Not only that, but the people that compose those companies and governments are far from reliable themselves, as we have seen from repeated abuse and half-legal uses of surveillance technologies for decades.
Naturally we must also consider the known limitations of these systems, such as their poor record with people of color, the lack of transparency with which they are generally implemented, and the inherently indiscriminate nature of their collection methods. The systems themselves are not ready.
A failure at any point in the process of legalizing, creating, securing, using, or administrating these systems can have serious political consequences (such as the exposure of a national agenda, which one can imagine could be held for ransom), commercial consequences (who would trust SenseNets after this? The government must be furious), and most importantly personal consequences to the people whose data is being exposed.
And this is all due (here, in China, and elsewhere) to the desire of a government to demonstrate tech superiority, and of a company to enable that and enrich itself in the process.
In the case of this particular database Gevers says that although the policy of the GDI is one of responsible disclosure, he immediately regretted his role. “Personally it made angry after I found out that I unknowingly helping the company secure its oppression tool,” he told me. “This was not a happy experience.”
The best we can do, and which Gevers did, is to loudly proclaim how bad the idea is and how poorly it has been done, is being done, and will be done.","Last week brought an extraordinary demonstration of the dangers of operating a surveillance state — especially a shabby one, as China's apparently is.

Thuy Ong,"Toyota has revealed its third generation humanoid robot, the T-HR3, which can be controlled and synchronized with the operator’s movements. The user wears data gloves and an HTC Vive VR headset that’s linked to cameras to show the robot’s perspective. T-HR3 stands 1.54 meters tall and weighs 75kg ( 5 feet, 1 inches / 165 pounds) and was developed to explore the possibility of assisting humans in the home, medical facilities, construction sites, disaster areas, and even in space, Toyota says. The operator can control the robot’s entire body using what's called the Master Maneuvering System (MMS) — 16 torque servo modules in the chair, motion and force sensors at the feet, and 29 more torque servo modules located in the robot’s joints. When the user moves, the MMS signals to the robot’s 29 body parts (including 10 fingers) to move. The operator can move the robot forwards or laterally by making walking movements while remaining in place. The robot also has balance control, so if it collides with an object, it can keep its balance. Force can be controlled as well, as highlighted by the video when the robot gently picks up a balloon-like ball. ""The Partner Robot team members are committed to using the technology in T-HR3 to develop friendly and helpful robots that coexist with humans and assist them in their daily lives,"" said Akifumi Tamaoki, general manager of Toyota’s robots. ""Looking ahead, the core technologies developed for this platform will help inform and advance future development of robots to provide ever-better mobility for all.""

Associated Press,"(JAKARTA, Indonesia) — Indonesia has identified the suspected location of an overcrowded ferry that sank last week in a deep volcanic crater lake but will need international help to recover the wreck, the chief of the national search and rescue agency said Monday. The ferry had some 200 people on board, about five times over capacity, but only 18 people including the boat’s captain survived the sinking in rough weather June 17 on Lake Toba. The rescue agency said in a statement Sunday an object that was possibly the ferry was at a depth of 490 meters (1,607 feet). Few bodies have been recovered and officials have said many of the dead are likely trapped inside the vessel. Separately, police said four people including transport officials have been arrested on suspicion of negligence that led to the sinking. The search agency chief, Muhammad Syaugi, said in a television interview that Indonesia needs international help to recover the wreckage. Sonar equipment from Indonesia’s navy was deployed on Friday. Divers could reach depths of only 50 meters (164 feet) in the lake’s cold and dark waters. Anguished relatives have criticized the search effort but Syaugi defended it, saying there had been an “all out” effort. The object believed to be the ferry is about 20 meters long (66 feet) and 5 meters (16 feet) wide, Syaugi said, consistent with its dimensions. “We will do our best to salvage this wreck,” he said. “Because we do not have robots, we are trying to find from other countries, but most of them have tools to lift a vessel from just 100 meters depth and the wreck must be cut first.” “For us, the most important thing is to get as many victims as possible,” Syaugi said. Ferry tragedies are common in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, with weak enforcement of safety regulations often to blame. Lake Toba, formed out of an ancient super volcano, is a popular sightseeing destination on the island of Sumatra and among the destinations that Indonesia’s government is promoting as a magnet for domestic and foreign tourists. North Sumatra police chief Paulus Waterpau told Indonesian TV that the boat’s captain and three regional transport officials including the head of the port authority at Lake Toba and the head of North Sumatra province’s transport office were arrested. “We’ve arrested them because of negligence that resulted in people losing their lives,” he said.",Only 18 people including the boat's captain survived the disaster,2018-06-25T06:05:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Indonesia May Have Found Wreckage of Ferry That Sank While Carrying 200 Passengers,http://time.com/5320782/indonesia-ferry-tragedy-lake-toba-location/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/rtx6a2am.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1

Frederic Lardinois,"Aurora, AWS’s managed MySQL and PostgreSQL database service, is getting an undo feature. As the company announced today, the new Aurora Backtrack feature will allow developers to “turn back time.” For now, this only works for MySQL databases, though. Developers have to opt in to this feature and it only works for newly created database clusters or clusters that have been restored from backup. The service does this by keeping a log of all transactions for a set amount of time (up to 72 hours). When things go bad after you dropped the wrong table in your production database, you simply pause your application and select the point in time that you want to go back to. Aurora will then pause the database, too, close all open connections and drop anything that hasn’t been committed yet, before rolling back to its state before the error occurred. Being able to reverse transactions isn’t completely new, of course. Many a database system has implemented some version of this already, including MySQL, though they are often far more limited in scope compared to what AWS announced today. As AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr notes in today’s announcement, disaster recovery isn’t the only use case here. “I’m sure you can think of some creative and non-obvious use cases for this cool new feature,” he writes. “For example, you could use it to restore a test database after running a test that makes changes to the database. You can initiate the restoration from the API or the CLI, making it easy to integrate into your existing test framework.” Aurora Backtrack is now available to all developers. It will cost about $0.012 per one million change records for databases hosted in the company’s US regions, with slightly higher prices in Europe and Asia.","Aurora, AWS’s managed MySQL and PostgreSQL database service, is getting an undo feature.

KERRI MacDONALD and MORRIGAN McCARTHY,"Ms. Rodriguez, a freelance photographer who covers Puerto Rico for The New York Times, “searched for something else” in familiar places. When I first read the poem, I felt like it was both a reminder and permission to see the beauty in life, something I feel I had forgotten after covering and living the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The disaster left me in some ways hopeless. I felt it was a permission to accept that nothing is perfect, that life is made by experiences of love and of hurt, but that it is important to live it — to feel it and to remember that we are all “a working title.” I went to photograph familiar places where I usually look for images that speak to the economic crisis or the disaster, and I searched for something else. I wanted to avoid repeating the visuals that have become the representation of my homeland in the past years. We are more than the crisis. I photographed the ocean with a little palm tree in the corner. I come from three generations of people from islands — in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Spain. The ocean is part of who I am. I photographed in Old San Juan, searching for daily moments and color, life. I photographed in Cayey, the town where my family is from. And I photographed my grandmother, because life is deeply connected to ancestry and the experiences of love and hurt by those that came before me. She did not want to have her photo taken because she had not dyed her hair and she said did not look “beautiful” — so I photographed her hidden white hair, her years, her wisdom.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Riley MacLeod to Kotaku","Japan is currently dealing with its deadlist rain-related disaster since 1982. Over the past week, heavy rains have wreaked havoc across the nation but especially in the western region, causing flooding and landslides. So far, the death toll sits at 176, but more than 50 people are still missing. Some of the deceased include two sisters, ages 6 and 9, who died in a landslide, reports the BBC. A landslide also killed a 3-year-old girl, per Reuters. By Wednesday, the risk of landslides had largely diminished, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, but the disaster isn’t over. More than eight million people are under evacuation order with many now living their days in shelters. Thousands of home have lost power, and roughly 270,000 homes are without water, per the BBC. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Okayama, a hard-hit city in western Japan, Wednesday to meet with survivors. The torrential rainfall—roughly 70 inches over the last two weeks, per the Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang —was brought on by moisture from the tropical Pacific, connected in part to last week’s Typhoon Prapiroon. While heavy rains are nothing new for this region of the world, residents weren’t prepared for this level of flooding. Flood hazard and landslide maps weren’t complete for most of the nation until 2013, Reuters reports. And homes were already sitting on flood-prone areas by then. The impacts of climate change are bringing the threat of more floods like this front and center. The number of heavy rainfall days and strong typhoons are projected to increase in Japan as the Earth warms, according to a 2015 government report. A 2016 study further supported the possibility of an uptick in powerful typhoons—not just for Japan but for East Asian countries, in general. Meanwhile Typhoon Maria, which hit Category 5 intensity at its peak, is causing trouble elsewhere in the Pacific. It poured rain upon Japan’s Ryukyu Islands, but now it’s hitting China with rainfall expected to last until Thursday. This is looking more and more like the norm as climate change ruins everything.","Japan is currently dealing with its deadlist rain-related disaster since 1982.

Hallie Golden,"Inside a small, rectangular room at the University of Washington is a series of shelves filled with more than 300 high-tech tools. There’s a collection of drones, cameras, and tablets, and even a mobile EEG kit, able to measure a brain’s electrical activity and detect stress levels in disaster victims. Each one has been meticulously organized, labeled, and packed away in a protective case, ready to be sent hundreds or even thousands of miles to the next natural disaster.
This is one of the three rooms that make up the RAPID Facility in Seattle, a first-of-its-kind center pushing the boundaries on natural disaster research, along with the world’s ability to mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of these hazards.
At a time when extreme weather, such as hurricanes and wildfires, is having a major impact on our daily lives, gaining this type of information is becoming especially vital, says Joseph Wartman, director of the RAPID Facility and geologic hazards professor at the University of Washington. In 2018, these types of hazards resulted in 247 deaths and almost $100 billion in damage in the U.S. Globally, natural hazards resulted in $330 billion in global losses in 2017, up from $200 billion in 2014. Wartman said there does appear to be a trend toward more frequent weather-related disasters, as well as an uptick in their intensity, so it’s very important to understand these hazards better.
Launched in September through a National Science Foundation grant, the center–officially called the Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Experimental Facility–acts as a type of natural disaster research hub. Entities across the world reach out when hazards strike (occasionally right before, if there’s any type of warning), and the small team ships them equipment to use temporarily, travels out to the site to operate the tools themselves, or actually collects and processes the data for them.
The facility has already been instrumental in research following hurricanes Michael and Florence, earthquakes in Japan and Indonesia, and large landslides in Alaska and Oregon. In each case, the team of about a dozen researchers has facilitated the collection of huge swaths of data of the disaster zone during the crucial period before serious clean-up begins. They then organize this evidence into comprehensive tables or transform it into point clouds, 3D visualizations of a scene made up of a large number of individual points, or even Google-type streetview images.
But no matter how they process this data, they make a point of always sharing it online.
“Whatever we collect goes up to a public repository very quickly, and then researchers from around the world can use that,” said Wartman. “Let people not only use it, but let them dream up new uses for this data. It’s a public asset after we use it.”
RAPID Operations Specialist Dr. Jake Dafni demonstrates one of the facility’s long-range laser scanners, which are used to create high resolution three-dimensional models of damage sites [Photo: Hallie Golden]
Along the first grouping of boxes inside the center, Jake Dafni, the facility’s operations manager and only full-time employee, pulled out a large black box, revealing a street view camera. The small, white device is equipped with six cameras facing in all directions and can be hooked on the top of a car to capture images while driving.
When Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina last September, Dafni and a small team used the camera to assess the wind damage to residential areas. In three days, he said, one of the researchers was able to drive through 12 neighborhoods and capture images every few meters. They then used software to tie all of those images together, creating a type of extremely detailed Google street view of the damage.
“They could take this imagery and zoom in and see, okay, did the roof tiles come off, did the roof peel back at all, are the windows cracked and damaged?” says Dafni. “All of that is captured in a very short amount of time in the field, and then they can spend as much time as they want later on actually looking at the data.”
In the facility’s adjoining room, Dafni switched on a laser-scanning device known as the Maptek I-Site XR3. He used it to collect location data inside of a marina that had been damaged in Florida following Hurricane Michael. Wherever the device was placed, it rapidly sent out laser pulses to measure the distance between it and everything around it. The result was a detailed 3D image of the marina and thus all of the damage it had endured.

Next to the laser-scanning device was a large black drone, equipped with a high-definition camera. Wartman explained that he used it in November in Indonesia after the Sulawesi Earthquake in order to collect aerial photos of the scene. He flew the drone 180 feet above the area and collected high-resolution images every 15 to 30 feet. After six hours, he had about 1,000 photos and was able to stitch together a digital scene consisting of several square miles of damaged properties.
This is the type of information the facility, a partnership between the University of Washington, Oregon State University, Virginia Tech, and the University of Florida, has been focused on–perishable data. Teams of researchers work to take measurements and capture images of destroyed homes or muddied hillsides or anything else that would likely disappear within a few weeks or even days as rescue and recovery efforts unfold. (Their inventory even includes a boat: The remote-control Z-boat uses cameras and echo sounders for underwater damage assessment.) The facility is also working to bring social science into their research by measuring how these hazards impact communities and individual people.
Drone image of wind damage from Hurricane Micheal [Photo: Jake Dafni]
With this type of data and sharing, the entire scientific community has already started to gain extremely precise information about what actually takes place when these hazards strike. That can be very helpful when it comes to reworking or building new predictive models that help anticipate the type of damage and effects on communities resulting from each natural disaster.
“What we’re trying to do is anticipate and ultimately be able to better forecast hazards, because if we can do that then we can begin to understand where our weak points are and take measures to reduce the risk and increase resilience,” said Wartman.
He offers the example of the RAPID team’s examination of the marina and other large buildings after Hurricane Michael. The team discovered that these types of large, metal buildings weren’t necessarily destroyed by the heavy winds, but by “this accordion effect of these buildings vibrating, and those vibrations are almost similar to having an earthquake that will collapse the building,” said Wartman. That information can then be useful for retrofitting these buildings to prevent these types of collapses.
The facility is expected to continue to help boost natural disaster research for at least a few more years. It’s running on a five-year contract from the National Science Foundation, along with about $5 million in funding from the agency.
But Wartman said their goal is in no way to make this facility a permanent fixture in the research community. In fact, in some sense it’s just the opposite.
“If all goes well, we’ll put ourselves out of business,” he said. “If we can get to the point that we’ve made so much progress that this becomes a secondary concern among the other kinds of challenges and issues facing society, that will be a measure of our success.”

Kohler,"For developing communities in many parts of the world, safe drinking water is far from a guaranteed part of daily life. Hand in hand with water safety is the issue of proper sanitation. A lack of resources, infrastructure, and education often means that practices like open defecation or poor hand-washing further threaten a community's already precarious water supply. Water Mission, an engineering nonprofit that designs, builds, and implements safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) solutions in developing regions and disaster areas, understands that both education and engineering play a key role in addressing the world's water crisis. With World Toilet Day coming up this November 19, WASH issues are a particularly timely topic. We spoke with Water Mission's Director of Community Development Andrew Armstrong and Community Development Specialist Caroline Foster to dig into the organization's goals for responding to these pressing global issues. To date, Water Mission has provided access to safe water to more than 3.6 million people across 55 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Water Mission understands that no two communities are the same. The organization tailors sanitation solutions to the parts of the world in which it operates in part by having boots on the ground. In addition to Water Mission's Charleston, South Carolina-based team of scientists and staff, the organization also deploys volunteers to work on-location in rural communities around the globe. This on-the-ground expertise is especially important in times of natural disaster, particularly when it comes to informing relief efforts that may require knowledge of cultural sanitation norms. The organization has helped out with relief efforts ranging from treating water and combatting ebola in Liberia to working with UNICEF Malawi in response to extreme flooding. They've also contributed to efforts in Nepal (in the wake of the 2015 earthquake), Tanzania (working with refugee camps), and Haiti (in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, Water Mission provided safe water to more than 100,000 people). Image: Water Mission One of the company's core beliefs, says Armstrong, is that scalable solutions don’t have to come at the expense of high-quality service. In other words: It's possible to prioritize both quantity and quality. When it comes to sanitation, ""Water Mission's overarching goals are to protect human health and human dignity,"" says Armstrong. ""So we want to protect people from microbiological contamination, but we also aim to protect privacy."" The best solution, he says, to achieving these goals across the board is the pour-flush latrine — or a toilet without a tank that's flushed by pouring a small amount of water into the bowl. When it comes to installing and maintaining these types of sanitation solutions, Foster says that community mobilization is a major part of the process. ""Members of the community run the show,"" she explains. ""They all get training — be it financial training or training on the WASH systems — and they’re in charge of keeping everything going throughout the lifespan of the project."" Our overarching goals are to protect human health and human dignity. This system of education and accountability, she explains, has proven successful in the long-term: In a 2008-2015 initiative in Honduras, for example, Water Mission installed 15,664 latrines throughout 464 communities. In 2016, 85% of installed latrines were still functioning, and 82% were still in use. These numbers, Armstrong and Foster say, are high compared to other approaches (such as implementing homemade latrines, which often last no longer than one year). Armstrong explains that initiatives are carried out both on the community and household level. In homes that qualify for subsidized latrines (such as The Healthy Latrine, one of the most common solutions Water Mission utilizes), the capital cost is typically funded by a donor. The fraction of the subsidy varies based on different contexts, such as how much a family is able to contribute on their own. ""The pour-flush design is a more expensive design, but ultimately it’s those [costlier qualities of the latrines] that keep people using them,"" says Foster. In other words, the up-front investment is worth it in the long run. Water Mission is now turning its focus to Western Honduras in an effort to bring sanitation solutions to even more Honduran homes. They're working with companies like Kohler to improve upon the designs that have been effective in other parts of the country. ""We want to continue investing in pour-flush toilet technology,"" says Armstrong. In addition to installing Kohler toilets as part of this upcoming project, Water Mission is especially excited by the broad product potential of the partnership. “We’re also working with Kohler to develop a low-cost, efficient, and aspirational hand-washing station that can be used in all kinds of contexts,” says Armstrong. “So, it's a multi-faceted relationship."" ""Kohler is all about high-quality products and aspirational living, and that very much lines up with our core values,"" he adds.","For developing communities in many parts of the world, safe drinking water is far from a guaranteed part of daily life.

Authorities said the accident happened after shafts and underground tunnels where the illegal miners were working became flooded by water from a burst dam last Tuesday. The survivors were rescued last Saturday at the mine located 90 miles southwest of the capital, Harare.
Zimbabwe's deputy mines minister, Polite Kambamura, on Monday said search operations would continue in the area, saying that around 70 workers are feared trapped in the incident. 
Kambamura said rescuers were experiencing difficulties accessing the area due to the size of the shafts in the flooded tunnel.
A photo from the scene of the disaster showed one of the rescued miners covered in thick brown mud being pulled from a pit at the mines.
Victor Rupende from the Zimbabwe Miners Federation, one of the groups coordinating the search, told CNN heavy rains have also hampered rescue operations at the mine.
Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared the incident a national disaster, adding that the government will continue to provide assistance to those working to find the missing miners.
Families and residents awaiting the news of their loved ones have camped out at the mining site in Battlefields, a rural settlement rich in gold deposits, where artisanal mining is common.
Henrietta Rushwaya, president of the Zimbabwe Miners Federation, urged the government to formalize the operations of artisanal miners to promote safety in the sector.
Zimbabwe is rich in minerals such as diamonds, uranium, chrome, platinum and gold. Revenues from the industry still account for about 30% of government income.","The bodies of 24 gold miners have been recovered from a flooded mine in Zimbabwe, and rescuers have pulled out eight survivors who had been trapped underground, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation reported.",2019-02-18T15:10:19Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",24 bodies recovered from flooded gold mine in Zimbabwe,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/18/africa/zimbabwe-mine-disaster-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190218110826-05-zimbabwe-mining-accident-0216-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,1
Michael Hardy,"In 2011, a devastating tsunami crashed into the northeast coast of Japan, destroying entire villages, killing thousands and causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In the wake of the disaster, the Japanese government implemented a number of reforms, including relocating coastal villages to higher land and forbidding further development along the northeast coastline. The most controversial of these tsunami prevention measures was the construction of hundreds of miles of concrete seawalls and breakers along the most vulnerable stretches of the coast. So far, Japan has spent approximately $12 billion building towering concrete walls, some as high as 41 feet. Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who now lives in Paris, traveled to Japan’s northeast coast after the 2011 tsunami to document the destruction, and recently returned to see how the impacted areas have changed. (He took the photos while serving as artist-in-residence at L'institut Français's Villa Kujoyama in Kyoto.) He was shocked by the ominous grey walls that now line the coast. ""What I’m interested in as a photographer is how they’ve totally shut out the views of the sea,"" Ono says. ""I'm walking in the sea coast area, I want to take a photo of the coast, but I can’t see it."" Many local residents make their living in either fishing or tourism; now, both industries are under threat from the walls. Fishermen worry they will disrupt runoff from the mountains into the sea, which helps replenish the water’s rich nutrients. And how many tourists will want to visit the coast if they can’t actually see the coast? Ono blames the impetus for the massive infrastructure project on a powerful central government unresponsive to local concerns, as well as the giant Japanese construction companies who benefit from massive government contracts. What’s more, Ono believes the walls are unnecessary. Coastal villages have already been moved to higher ground. ""Before the tsunami there were towns in those areas, but now nobody lives there—it’s just rice fields or vacant land. So the seawalls protect nothing,"" he says. ""They were constructed just to be constructed."" Some people have even argued that seawalls are counterproductive, since they might provide a false sense of security, discouraging people from moving to higher ground. On a deeper level, Ono sees the walls as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. ""Our richness as a civilization is because of our contact with the ocean,"" he says. ""Japan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.""

Brett Williams,"It's been nearly two months since Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, and the island is still in the midst of a long road to recovery. While most of its people have gained access to potable water, more than 25 percent of Puerto Rico is still without reliable telecommunications service, cutting them off from the outside world. Google's parent company Alphabet is trying to help return connection for the people of Puerto Rico. Project Loon, the aerial internet endeavor from the X innovation lab, was given FCC permission and began launching its LTE-beaming balloons over the island last month. After a few weeks of service, Alphabet says the efforts have paid off. Project Loon's reps claim the balloons have been able to bring basic internet connectivity to more than 100,000 people in Puerto Rico. SEE ALSO: Tesla installs Powerpack and Powerwall batteries at hospital in Puerto Rico The Loon team joined forces with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile for the efforts, which sends the balloons some 65,000 feet in the air to create a network that relays LTE signals to telecom partners on the ground below (in this case, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). People on the ground can then access the internet using LTE-connected devices. This augmented connectivity is essential for those who haven't yet regained access to normal communications, so the project's effectiveness has been extremely important. There's still much work to begun to bring Puerto Rico back up to full strength, so hopefully, special projects like Loon can continue to serve as a temporary reprieve as larger recovery efforts are undertaken.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""A lofty idea becomes reality."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QTngSsCMz6ThXNcOTF7fLyie_qc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F10%2F92c3c739-4c4b-2b31%2Fthumb%2F00001.jpg"",""mediaid"":""YxlJrBXl98"",""prelo…",2017-11-09T21:42:37Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Google: Project Loon has provided internet access to 100,000 people in Puerto Rico",http://mashable.com/2017/11/09/project-loon-puerto-rico-progress/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Msnq9tdHgYKLzZyxirrsev2L1OI=/1200x630/2017%2F11%2F09%2F5a%2Fb2578c6ea7904071804e80cf6ca540d4.d78f4.jpg,mashable,Mashable,1

Sasha Ingber,"Rescuers stand at the entrance of a collapsed mine in Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Thursday. The shouting of trapped miners ceased on Saturday.
AP
The desperate shouts for help fromgold miners who have been trapped for days under debris on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi have fallen silent, an official said Saturday.
The illegal mine collapsed on Tuesday in Bolaang Mongondow, after soil shifted in the sloping, green terrain and wooden support beams at the site suddenly broke.
Eight miners have died and 20 have been rescued, according to The Associated Press. About three dozen people are thought to still be trapped.
""Since yesterday we have heard no more voices from inside,"" said local disaster official Abdul Muin Paputungan, according to the AP. ""On this fourth day the signs of life faded away.""
Paputungan added that rescuers will still try to save the miners, ""even though at the moment it seems like a miracle if they can survive.""
Some have already lost hope.
""There is no hope for survivors,"" said a spokesperson at the National Search and Rescue Agency, according to CNN.
The father of one trapped miner told Agence France-Presse earlier in the week that he had been talking with his son beneath the rubble.
""He asked for water because he was thirsty,"" Amrin Simbala said. ""Later in the afternoon, no more voices could be heard.""
More than 200 people have been working to rescue the trapped workers, using ropes, spades and their fingers in an attempt to carve out spaces in the ground. They were able to give food and water to some of the miners, but officials have expressed fear that oxygen is running out in some areas of the pit.
Miners who made it out were taken away on makeshift stretchers.
One survivor was pulled out of the debris after his leg was caught underneath a fallen rock. Medical personnel amputated the leg and he died from blood loss, according to AFP.
Authorities have hesitated to bring in more people and to use heavy machinery for fear of causing new landslides, Paputungan said. An excavator reportedly began to hollow out ground on Friday morning after relatives approved the plan. 
For an archipelago rich with minerals, a number of illegal mines pockmark Indonesia's landscape.
A World Bank report from 2000 detailed how artisanal and small-scale mining persisted in the country despite the government's awareness of environmental damage, either because of a lack of will or a lack of ability to halt the practice.
In one part of the country, West Java, some 26,000 people were working in illegal gold mines a 500 percent increase in three years, the World Bank said. 
In North Sulawesi, corruption prevented the closure of illegal mines, according to the report. The Ministry of Forestry mounted a campaign to crack down on illegal gold mining but local police did not enforce government orders. Three months later, the same number of mines were operating. 
In more recent years, authorities have raided unlicensed mines. Law enforcement arrested people on suspicion of trading illegally-mined gold in 2016. After the arrest, the police station was set on fire in apparent retaliation, the AFP reported.
Locals are often lured into the business because they lack job opportunities.
""This is all I can do to earn a living,"" a miner identified only as Iwan told the outlet.
But illegal mines leave them vulnerable to hazardous work conditions.
Agus Budianto, a landslide expert at the Indonesia-basedCenter for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, told CNN that local construction techniques of unlicensed mines don't involve feasibility studies.
He said that on Tuesday, the supports for the shaft's entrance caved under pressure from the soil, closing the miners' exit path.
""This is not a landslide disaster but it is caused by human activity itself,"" he said.
Relatives of the trapped miners were gathering at the rescue site, offering to join the search and hoping for good news.","""Since yesterday we have heard no more voices from inside,"" said a local disaster official.

George Dvorsky,"Archaeologists working at a 15th-century site in Peru have unearthed the remains of 137 children and 200 llamas in whats now considered the largest mass child sacrifice known from the New Worldand possibly of all time.
The scene is almost impossible to comprehend. 
The researchers speculate it went something like this: One after one, the children were led to a clifftop overlooking the Pacific, the young llamas in tow. There, amid a salty ocean breeze and the sound of lapping waves, the children were made to lie down as a priestwith a skillful handcut open their chests, reaching in to pull out their still-beating hearts. The ritual sacrifice complete, the bloodied, limp bodies were placed carefully into individual graves, their faces positioned in a westerly direction toward the sea. The llamas, none older than 18 months, met the same fate, their heads made to face east towards the Andes mountains. In all, 137 children and 200 llamas were ritually sacrificed in this manner. Three adultstwo of whom suffered blunt force trauma to the headwere also killed.
Such is the interpretation of what happened along the northern Peruvian coast around 570 years ago, as detailed in a new study published today in PLOS ONE. The authors of the new study, led by Gabriel Prieto from the National University of Trujillo in Peru, claim its the largest single mass sacrifice of children and llamas known to have happened in the New World, the previous largest being the sacrifice of 48 children at Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlán, what is now Mexico City.
The ritual sacrifice of so many children certainly seems barbaricand its unquestionably horrificbut the civilization involved, the Chimú people of Peru, were likely working in accordance with their spiritual and metaphysical beliefs. And as the new research shows, a terrible natural disaster seems to have struck this civilization shortly before the ritual, which may have prompted the killings.
This mass sacrifice was likely as astoundingly extreme to the Chimú society as it is for us.
Nawa Sugiyama, an anthropologist at George Mason University whos not affiliated with the new study, said the motivations behind ritualized violence are complex and difficult to rationalize from a modern perspective, especially in such a brutal case such as this. 
Though it may never be possible to satisfactorily recover or reconstruct [the reasons], what I can say is that this mass sacrifice was likely as astoundingly extreme to the Chimú society as it is for us, and would likely have signaled the prevalence of extraordinary circumstances answerable only to similarly extreme measures, said Sugiyama.
This Chimú site, called Huanchaquito-Las Llama, is located along the northern coast of Peru. This civilization flourished between the 11th and 15th centuries CE, dominating a 600-mile-long stretch of the Peruvian coastline. The only other major civilization in South America at the time was the Inca Empire, which vanquished the Chimú people around 1475 CE, roughly 25 years after the mass child and llama sacrifice.
Excavations at Huanchaquito-Las Llama took place between 2011 and 2016, with the bodies scattered along a 700-square-meter (7,500-square-foot) area. Aside from the three adults, all human remains belonged to children, both boys and girls, who ranged in age from five to 14 years, with the majority falling between eight to 12 years of age. The llamas were typically under 18 months old. Physical, chemical, and genetic analysis suggests the children came from a broad cross-section of Chimú society, though future work is planned to learn more about each individual, such as which geographical region they came from. 
Analysis of the childrens skeletons revealed distinctive cut marks along the sternum, along with dislocated ribsa sign that the chests were pulled open. The cuts were consistent and made with great precision, and the absence of hesitation cuts, or false starts, suggests an experienced individual was recruited for the task. As the authors write in the study, the purpose of opening the chests of the children and llamas
can only be hypothesized, but heart removal is a likely motivation. Soft tissue preservation was not sufficient to demonstrate that the Huanchaquito childrens hearts were removed, but some ethnohistoric accounts of ritual practices of the Inca describe heart removal as a sacrificial method. For example, the sixteenth century Spanish chronicler Cristobal de Molina described various forms of Inca child sacrifice, including extraction of the heart. In his Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas, he wrote Other [children] had their live hearts taken out, and so the priests offered the beating [hearts] to the huacas to which the sacrifice was made.
The bodies of the children were positioned such that their faces looked west toward the ocean, while the llamas were made to face east toward the Andes mountains. Radiocarbon dating of ropes and textiles found buried within the graves places the event at around 1450 CE, at the very apex of the Chimú civilization.
An analysis of the sediments found at Huanchaquito-Las Llama suggests the region had been hit with a natural disaster shortly before the ritual killings, likely a massive flood or heavy rainfall. This disaster, the authors speculate, may be connected to the mass sacrificea climatic event that could have impacted the economic, political and ideological stability of one of the most powerful states in the New World during the 15th century CE, the authors wrote.
It would have been a bloody and visceral scene charged with powerful emotion.
That the mass child and animal sacrifice was a response to a natural disaster is wholly conceivable, said Sugiyama. 
Ritual sacrifice is, among other things, an instrument through which humans have often believed it possible to directly engage and exchange with cosmological powers and entities in order to reinforce favorable stabilityan annual harvest, for exampleor effect desirable changesuch as stopping the floods, Sugiyama told Gizmodo. A mass sacrifice of this scale is an exception and not a norm for Chimú or even among broadly Andean sacrificial practices, and I suspect in this case the motivation may have been a catastrophic trigger, such as a massive disaster or environmental strain, that called for a commensurately radical ritual sacrifice to address.
More evidence, she said, will be required to make more specific interpretations. That said, she found the method of sacrificing the children to be extremely surprising, as the degree of trauma inflicted on both the children and the llamas was atypical of New World cultures.
It would have been a bloody and visceral scene charged with powerful emotion, said Sugiyama. 
As to why children and juvenile llamas were sacrificed and not adults, Sugiyama said it likely had to do with their transitional nature. 
Children are liminal creatures and are some of the most precious members of a society, she said. The scale of both child and animal sacrifice carried out suggests urgency and desperation and perhaps a deliberate [choice] to offer only the two most valued members of their societytheir children and the their staple food source.
With the excavation and preliminary analysis complete, Prieto and his colleagues are now planning to analyze the skeletons in more detail. Using oxygen and strontium isotopes, for example, the scientists should be able to discern diet and the geographical origin of the children and the llamas. Knowing the life-histories of those involved could shed new light on this disturbing, but significant, historical event.

Bob House,"Disaster preparedness is something every small business owner should be incorporating into their planning and new data is showing us just how important it can be to saving the future of a life's work. In a recent Federal Reserve Banks survey, this report examined the business conditions, insurance coverage, and credit environment of small businesses located in FEMA-designated disaster zip codes. Of the affected firms, the survey revealed that only 4 percent did not have any revenue losses, 61 percent had revenue losses ranging from $1-$25,000, and 35 percent suffered in losses more than $25,000. The reality is that most small business owners can't recover from those type of loses. In fact, as many as 40 percent of small businesses will never reopen their doors following major natural disasters such as these. A BizBuySell poll just last year revealed that while one in five business owners believe climate change poses a threat to their business, a whopping 77 percent of shopkeepers do not have a natural disaster plan in place. For small businesses situated along the coast and in designated disaster areas, the recovery from events like hurricanes and flash floods can take years -- assuming they can even recover at all. As seen with last year's hurricanes Harvey and Irma, it's crucial for companies to consider environmental emergency plans as part of their long-term business strategy. How small business owners can mitigate damage from the unexpected natural disaster Almost every state is subject to some kind of natural disaster throughout the year, with some regions more susceptible than others. Small businesses in California, for example, are likely to experience wildfires and earthquakes while businesses in Florida should expect to deal with hurricanes and tropical storms. Similarly, businesses situated in the Midwest are privy to tornadoes and flash floods while companies in the Northeast battle blizzards every winter. But even without physical damage, the loss of power and lack of customer spending can leave small businesses hurting for cash for several months at a time. Mother Nature waits for no one, and small business owners can't afford to be caught off guard when the next natural disaster lands in their city. Proper disaster planning can go a long way in providing shopkeepers peace of mind and reassurance that, in a worst-case scenario, their business is ready and able to withstand the elements. With the unique location-based challenges in mind, small business owners can take several steps to mitigate damage and reopen for business much sooner: Transfer business documents to the cloud : Whether your business is threatened by a hurricane or a fire, the loss of paper documents and physical records can be devastating. To prevent the loss of documents like invoices, payroll and other financial paperwork, small business owners should try moving their paper records to the cloud. Digitizing important documents ensures shopkeepers can access their records from anywhere, making it easy for employees to continue working on projects wherever there is Internet access. Get appropriate coverage for regional disasters : Depending on location, insurance rates for small businesses can fluctuate and cover a variety damages. Businesses in tropical areas like Florida will need insurance to cover hurricane and flood damage, while companies in drier regions need to protect themselves against wildfires. The SBA offers two different loans to help disaster victims; one assists with physical damage incurred while the other covers any economic injury. Before owners seek out insurance quotes and coverage plans, they'll need to evaluate what type of disaster they're protecting against and to reduce extraneous costs. Put aside enough funds to cover several weeks of expenses : One of the first things affected by a natural disaster is the spending power of the consumer. With jobs on hold and damages to repair, customers will be prioritizing items like food and water over luxury goods. Well before disaster strikes, small business owners should be saving enough funds to cover at least two weeks of operating expenses, payroll and inventory management. Taken from BizBuySell's poll, 40 percent of owners who have both insurance and savings responded as confident, that their business could survive a natural disaster if they were forced to close for more than one month. Small business owners need to prepare for anything that could harm their business and shopkeepers who assume they are impervious to any natural disaster puts their entire business at financial risk. From short-term disruptions to long-term damages, business owners need disaster plans in place to minimize the impact of any disaster on their livelihood.",Why All Business Owners Need to be Ready for Anything,2018-05-08T14:38:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Is Your Small Business Prepared for Disaster?,https://www.inc.com/bob-house/is-your-small-business-prepared-for-disaster.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_486749550_356039.jpg,,Inc.com,1

Richard Gonzales,"Soldiers from the 541st Sapper Company headed to the southern U.S. border prepare to board an air transport plane on Tuesday in Ft. Knox, Ky. Airman 1st Class Daniel Hernande/U.S. Department of Defense President Trump said Wednesday he could send up to 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, which would surpass the number of soldiers currently stationed in Afghanistan. Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a campaign rally Wednesday night in Florida, Trump said the number of military personnel on the border ""will go up to anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 military personnel on top of the Border Patrol, ICE, and everybody else at the border."" The current number of troops deployed to the border is 5,239, the head of Northern Command, Gen. Terence O'Shaughnessy, said on Tuesday. He said that number would likely grow even larger. A contingent of 2,092 National Guard members are already stationed at the border. That total alone is roughly equal to the number of U.S. troops remaining in Iraq and Syria. Troops load equipment as they prepare to leave Fort Campbell, Ky., on Tuesday, for deployment at the southern border. Maj. Martin Meiners/U.S. Department of Defense The president's announcement comes as the midterm elections next week are widely viewed as referendum on his administration. Trump has made it clear that he will make his anti-immigration policies a key issue in the elections. The original plan to send about 5,000 troops to the border was announced Monday. On Tuesday, Trump said he's considering changing the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by executive order in order to deny citizenship to people born on U.S. soil. In his remarks Wednesday, Trump repeated his threat to cut off foreign assistance to Central American countries whose people have joined the caravan of migrants moving north to the U.S. Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, speaking at the Pentagon, was asked whether the troop deployment was a political stunt as some critics allege. ""The support that we provide to the secretary for Homeland Security is practical support based on the request from the commissioner of Customs and Border [Protection], so we don't do stunts in this department,"" said Mattis. He also compared the mission to what the Defense Department might do after a natural disaster. ""We do this following storms, we do this in support of the Department of Homeland Security. This is a different aspect of it, but that's what we are doing,"" he added.",The president says he may triple the number of forces that were deployed just this week.

Judy Berman,"Was anyone actually looking forward to the 2019 Oscars? In the lead-up to this year’s ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made—and quickly backed off from—a remarkable number of bad decisions. From the announcement of an “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film” category to that time earlier this month when they earned the ire of cinema royalty with a short-lived plan to hand out several major awards during commercial breaks, each new decision felt more damaging than the last. Kevin Hart’s abortive hosting gig, followed much later by the news that he wouldn’t be replaced, also didn’t seem to bode well. Aubrey Plaza spoke for a nonplussed American public when she opened Saturday’s Independent Spirit Awards with an easy but effective Oscars joke: “The network’s first choice to host was no one, but they’re already booked for tomorrow, so you’ve got me.”
Little did we (or, for that matter, the Academy) know that “no one” was precisely the host this ailing Hollywood institution needed. With some notable exceptions—Roma’s handful of trophies, the awards for the women behind Black Panther‘s extraordinary costumes and sets, Olivia Colman’s Best Actress victory and the triumph of short doc Period. End of Sentence., whose director Rayka Zehtabchi endearingly blurted out, “I can’t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar!”—it wasn’t a great night for winners. Green Book, which many found retrograde, took Best Picture. A damning #MeToo exposé on its director, Bryan Singer, didn’t stop Bohemian Rhapsody from racking up awards. Yet without a designated emcee to slow things down with groan-worthy sketches and stupid audience participation segments, the telecast even felt punchy enough to compensate for the Academy’s hit-or-miss taste in movies.
Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s steamy “Shallow” performance was a highlight, and it helped that neither the 2016 election nor the public reckoning with Harvey Weinstein and Co. had happened recently enough to cast a pall over this year’s proceedings. But it was the inspired lineup of presenters that made the ceremony so watchable. Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were the perfect crowd-pleasing trio to open the Oscars by roasting the Oscars, on the heels of Queen and Adam Lambert’s energetic medley of the band’s blandest hits. Barbra Streisand introducing BlacKkKlansman sounded like a bad joke but turned out to be a well-researched bit of Brooklyn synergy that tickled Spike Lee. (And it was a relief to see him win a statue he’s deserved since Do the Right Thing, while speaking on slavery and the sacrifices made by women in his family.) I teared up when Guillermo Del Toro gave Alfonso Cuarón the Best Director Oscar and the two amigos embraced. It’s hard to imagine anyone more qualified to make the case for Green Book than a Civil Rights hero like Rep. John Lewis.
Even the less flashy presenter duos were low-key ingenious: 30 seconds of Jason Momoa and Helen Mirren, both in pink? Delightful. Javier Bardem—speaking Spanish, in a gesture that has taken on political resonance in this “build the wall” era—and Angela Bassett serving all the class that the foreign-language film category demands? Lovely. John Mulaney and Awkwafina, two of the funniest people in the entertainment industry, commiserating over their first-time Oscar jitters? Divine. Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson, followed by Constance Wu, a vision in yellow on the arm of a glittering Chadwick Boseman? #TrueDetectiveSeason4 vibes. The presenters didn’t waste time with endless stiff, scripted repartee, either.
I’m no great fan of Hart, but I did worry that a ceremony without a host would feel disjointed. Instead, the lack of an emcee made every interaction less awkward; the atmosphere was more genuinely celebratory than it had been since Ellen DeGeneres’ sweet, goofy, pre-Trump Oscars of 2014. By the end of the evening, I was fully convinced that the Academy should give up on hosts for good. But I reserve the right to change my mind if Tina, Amy and Maya agree to do it next year.

Ran Geva,"The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal was a disaster for everyone: for Facebook’s users, whose personal data was exposed and misused. For Facebook itself, which breached and then lost the trust of a billion-plus people. And lastly for the thousands of third party app and game developers, marketers, and researchers who relied on Facebook for access to its data and its users, and have now seen that source run dry as Facebook pulls back its information. When it comes to utilizing data, Cambridge Analytica is not an anomaly; Facebook estimates that the majority of its users have had their data accessed by third party apps, and any time a person downloads an app, their permission is requested for access to specific data. Have you visited TNW's hype-free blockchain and cryptocurrency news site yet? It's called Hard Fork. What is an anomaly is the way Cambridge Analytica handled (or mishandled, as the case may be) the data it received, taking it one step further and using it to access Facebook users’ friends and selling their data to political consultants. As a result, Facebook became much stricter with the data it was making available. But while tightening the reins may seem like a good thing, it leaves the companies that relied on Facebook for data in a conundrum, needing to find a new avenue in order to keep their revenue stream flowing. So where can companies turn when Facebook turns off the faucet? One solution is to go straight to the source, aggregating data directly from across the web. Filling the hole left by Facebook The fact that companies collect consumer data for marketing purposes is nothing new. Even before the Internet, advertisers targeted consumers based on their communities, their spending habits, and by purchasing mailing lists from other companies. Think of the number of catalogs and coupons you used to receive in the mail without having subscribed to them. The internet digitized that process through everything from online newsletters to shopping to subscription web streaming. And Facebook, with its pages, groups, events, and likes by its billion users—who also willingly gave away information such as date of birth, alma mater, and relationship status—made that data collection even easier by putting it all in one place. That ease of information is why returning to the roots of data collection may seem like a daunting task for companies that have come to rely on Facebook. But much of the information that exists on Facebook exists elsewhere—you just need to know how to look for it. Before Facebook, companies were using data aggregators to collect information from across the web. They were listening in on message boards, which covered everything from finance to fertility, to hear brand opinions, lifestyle suggestions, and the always popular humble brags. They were scanning the comments on blog posts news feeds, review, and e-commerce sites, and they were converting that content into machine-readable information. It was anonymous content, but it was just as usable, and those message boards and blogs still exist; they didn’t disappear with the advent of Facebook. If anything, as users become more wary of Facebook’s disregard for privacy, those avenues—which provide more anonymity—will thrive more than ever. The benefits of roots-based data mining Returning to the roots of data collection is a change companies are going to have to get used to, but in the end it may prove to be a stronger model than depending solely on Facebook. For one thing, there is an inherent danger in constructing a business model so heavily reliant on the success and cooperation of another entity. It’s exactly what these companies did with Facebook, and it’s exactly what’s failing them now. But this isn’t the only reason going to the source is better. The lack of anonymity and the tendency for people to congregate with like-minded people means that the data being collected on Facebook wasn’t necessarily accurate. Instead, it presented a small sliver of the populations’ opinions, ones they were willing to express out loud within their own echo chambers. Message boards and e-commerce sites are not only automatically sorted by interest, they also give people a safe space to express their opinion without the judgment of their friends, and they include people from a broad segment of the population. Similarly, data from e-commerce sites presents a more accurate picture of consumer habits than Facebook posts and likes. More importantly for companies looking to avoid a PR nightmare, aggregating anonymous content from across wide swaths of the web presents a more ethical form of data collection than doing so from Facebook. There’s no question that data collection and analysis is about to go through a significant upheaval, and companies will need time to adjust. But I predict that as companies begin to return to their data “roots” and to the people themselves, they’ll find that the depth of information they get is worth the revolution.","The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal was a disaster for everyone: for Facebook’s users, whose personal data was exposed and misused.

Gina Martinez,"With the Mega Millions jackpot up to a whopping $1.6 billion, coworkers, friends and families all around the country are surely participating in lottery pools. That’s where players share the cost to buy a greater number of tickets and, impossible as it may seem, split the huge jackpots. But the worst case scenario, should your pool win, is that greed can take over. Winning the lottery can be a messy affair, and one or more players may try to shut the others out after discovering your pool has the winning numbers. If you happen to be a part of a lottery pool who wins, here are some practical steps to make sure everyone gets their fair piece of the pie. Make photocopies of the tickets According to Rubin Sinins, a New Jersey civil and criminal lawyer, the easiest way to avoid any confusion is to be organized. In 2009, he represented five New Jersey construction workers against their coworker Americo Lopez, who tried to cheat his lottery pool out of a $38.5 million Mega Millions jackpot that the group won. Sinins won the case and the five men took home $2 million each after taxes and lawyer fees. “People who are getting into a pool should understand while it’s often a lark and obviously the odds are against winning, it’s very serious business because you’re talking about substantial amounts of money,” Sinins tells TIME. “So if you are in a pool and tickets are pool tickets, if they can be copied before hand that would be optimal.” Criminal and Civil Litigation Attorney Jason Kurland, also known as the “lottery lawyer,” agrees. He said he has represented cases where people spend years fighting over jackpots won in an office pool. Kurland said the most common problems in office pools are when regularly contributing people, who weren’t there when money was collected for the winning tickets, argue that they still deserve a share. He said problems arise when coworkers think there is an understanding that everyone in the office was going to split the winnings or there is confusion over who put money into the pool. “This amount of money changes people,” Kurland said. “In a perfect world, there would be contracts for this stuff, but it’s impractical. So, at the very least, the person buying the tickets should photocopy them, scan them and send an email to the group simply stating: ‘these are our tickets, these are the people in our group, everyone paid, if we win a small amount we’ll roll it into the next drawing.'” Pick a leader, and make sure you trust them Kurland suggested picking a leader for the group, both to organize responsible buying and in case the pool wins. Kurland said if the pool hits the jackpot, then the leader should be responsible for hiring a lottery lawyer. They should also be the point person in claiming the ticket and, after all the expenses are paid, making sure everything gets split up evenly. In most lottery pools, there is usually one person who takes responsibility for purchasing the tickets. But, they might also decide to purchase individual tickets to increase their odds. If they win, it might be hard to tell if it was their personal ticket or the group’s. “If it’s not done right can be a disaster,” Kurland said. “You can look at cases where there is a ‘leader’ collecting all the money, buying tickets and if not done right, that leader might win on their own ticket and no one in the pool will believe them. It’s pretty scary especially in states where it’s an anonymous winner, no one is going to know if the tickets aren’t photo copied. Even if you’re a member of the pool, you need to know what the numbers are going into the drawing.” What to do if you think you’re being scammed Kurland said if you’re part of a winning pool and suspect wrongdoing, you should contact the lottery commission. “All of these lottery commissions have independent investigators. So, if you feel like something fishy is going on in your office pool, then you should report it to the lottery commission as soon as you can because they’ll have that information and conduct an investigation,” Kurland said. Sinins said that ultimately lottery pools don’t need to be complicated as long as participants are well aware of who is part of the pool and that there is a trust among participants. “Basically if you join a pool do it with your eyes open and understand that it is potentially a very serious endeavor because of the consequences and you certainly don’t want a dispute to arise,” he said. “Money is often the cause of disputes among people whether friends, family or coworkers. And when you add over a billion dollars, emotions would run high to say the least.” Is it even worth participating in a lottery pool? “When someone goes around the office collecting, you don’t want to be the one person who didn’t contribute,” Kurland said of office pools. “You kind of don’t have a choice. It’s the ultimate peer pressure.” He said one of the pros of playing the lottery in a pool is if your group gets lucky, it can make the spotlight less bright. Sudden fame tends to be a problem for winners. “If a group wins, it takes the pressure off of a single winner,” he said. “It alleviates the stress level of one person claiming it and the whole world looking at that person. It’s now a group that won. They just remember the group, not the individual person.” Sinins said, for the most part, joining a pool is more of a bonding experience than a strategic tactic to win the lottery. “A lottery pool, office or otherwise, is a fun way to have a rooting interest in a particular lottery,” he said. “There’s often camaraderie in these pools, whether among friends or workers or family in that regard. Is it smart? It certainly is fun. And if you win it’s definitely very fun.”","""If it’s not done right can be a disaster""",2018-10-24T01:12:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Here Are the Best Ways to Protect Yourself in an Office Lottery Pool,http://time.com/5432455/protect-yourself-office-lottery-pool/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/160203_em_lostlottoticket.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Facebook has been revamping its policies over the last few weeks, undoubtedly in response to the fact that it impressively failed at protecting many of its users’ data. In its latest batch of updates, the social network announced that new third-party apps will no longer be able to post on Facebook on behalf of users. The company announced in a post on its developers page that apps created Tuesday and on will no longer have permission “to publish posts to Facebook as the logged in user.” For existing apps, this permission will be revoked on August 1st. Facebook users have long offered users the option to opt out of this particularly invasive feature. A separate settings page on Facebook allows you to block apps with these permissions from posting to your wall without disconnecting from the app altogether. This was of course not feasible for ALL apps—some required this condition in order to use them. In that case, users could change the visibility settings so that only they could see any posts published by the app. But for users who may have not known this workaround, or who may have forgotten to opt out, today’s deprecation is great news. Facebook is clearly trying to gain user trust back following the Cambridge Analytica disaster. While it can’t retroactively change the fact that 87 million of its users were impacted by the massive screw-up, at least Facebook can belatedly limit the permissions of third party apps going forward.","Facebook has been revamping its policies over the last few weeks, undoubtedly in response to the fact that it impressively failed at protecting many of its users’ data.

Tom Simonite,"On a trip to Silicon Valley last year, Defense Secretary James Mattis openly envied tech companies’ superior use of artificial intelligence technology. To help close the gap, one Pentagon unit is now offering $100,000 in prizes to develop algorithms that can interpret high-resolution satellite images. The contest is called the xView Detection Challenge, and starts next month. Entrants will use a trove of hand-annotated satellite images released by the Pentagon to train algorithms to identify details relevant to disaster relief or humanitarian missions. Objects of interest include damaged buildings, utility trucks, and fishing boats. The project is being run by DIUx, an organization started by former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter to make it easier for his department to work with technology companies, particularly startups. The need to close the Pentagon’s AI gap with industry was a major motivation for the creation of DIUx, says Brendan McCord, head of machine learning at the organization. DIUx’s challenge is a partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which serves the US military and intelligence apparatus. The competition is modeled on the NGA’s work after events such as hurricane Irma, which swept a trial of destruction and flooding from the Bahamas to Florida last year. Each day, a team of 10 analysts scrutinized hundreds of high-resolution satellite images of the disaster zone, grading damaged or destroyed buildings, and annotating details like impassable roads or bridges. The data was passed onto other agencies helping with the clean up, including FEMA. One goal of the challenge is to automate such work. McCord says algorithms developed for the xView challenge could help NGA after future disasters. If software could make a first pass at annotating new images for damaged buildings and the like, for example, analysts could be more productive. Algorithms good at tagging items of humanitarian interest might also be re-trained to aid other work, such as NGA’s core mission of supporting U.S. warfighters and intelligence analysts. The contest rules grant NGA license to both use and build on winning software. DIUx says winners may be offered the chance to do follow-on work on other defense missions. It is also offering a special prize of $5,000 for the best open source entry, to encourage sharing of ideas created for the contest. The satellite images for the contest are released under a public, noncommercial license for anyone to use. Anyone hoping to win money in the challenge should start by checking their nationality. Contest rules disqualify entrants from several countries, including Cuba and Iran. For those whose papers are in order, the next step is to download a cache of satellite images covering 1,400 km 2 from locations around the world at a resolution of 30 centimeters (1 foot). The images cover both visible and infrared light, and have been hand-annotated with a million examples of 60 different objects. Entrants will use the labeled images to train their algorithms; their software will be tested against a collection of images not made public. The contest will be judged on accuracy, but DIUx also wants the software to be practical, says McCord. LEARN MORE A new Pentagon competition challenges developers to create software that can analyze images like this one. Software competing in the challenge must identify and distinguish objects such as trucks with tanker trailers and cement mixers. The objects were chosen to be relevant to humanitarian projects, and push the limits of existing image-processing algorithms. Stefano Ermon, a professor at Stanford, says that the challenge and dataset could become an important contribution to both machine-learning research, and humanitarian projects worldwide. His research group has developed machine-learning software that maps areas of poverty in African countries using clues such as roads and waterways. The most mature image-recognition technology is focused on online consumer and product photos, thanks to the piles of readily available data, and strong commercial interest from internet companies such as Google. Much less work has been done on interpreting satellite imagery, and the data needed to do so is scant, says Ermon. “We don’t have a lot of labeled data, which is crucial,” he says.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"The tsunami that killed hundreds of people on Sumatra and Java in Indonesia late Saturday is a reminder that such destructive waves are not always caused by earthquakes.
This disaster, which struck without warning and killed at least 222 people and injured more than 800 others, appeared to have been caused by volcanic activity.
No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said. But there had been an eruption on the volcanic island of Anak Krakatau about half an hour before, they said, one of a series of eruptions there in recent weeks.
Tsunamis are created when large amounts of water in the ocean, a bay or even a lake are quickly displaced. In an earthquake, that displacement can occur when the ground moves as a fault breaks.
This was the mechanism by which a 9.1 magnitude earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, off Aceh Province in northern Indonesia, spawned large waves that traveled across the Indian Ocean and killed 250,000 people.
Many other tsunamis have also followed earthquakes, including those in September that devastated the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude quake.
Volcanic activity creates tsunamis differently. One possibility is an explosive eruption, or general weakening of the flanks of a volcano by hot magma passing through it. Either way, part of the volcano perhaps, in the case of Anak Krakatau, a part that is underwater can collapse, creating a landslide that displaces water.
Another possible mechanism is the collapse of a magma chamber below the volcano as it empties during an eruption.
Volcano-related tsunamis are not uncommon. An eruption in 1792 in Japan created waves that were several hundred feet high. Landslides during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington spawned large waves in a lake nearby.
Perhaps the most famous volcanic disaster in history, the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, also called Krakatoa, triggered tsunamis that killed tens of thousands of people. (Anak Krakatau island was built up in place of Krakatau, which was obliterated in the 1883 event.)
Landslides hitting water can sometimes create huge waves. The largest wave ever recorded was caused by a landslide into Lituya Bay, in southeast Alaska, in July 1958. It followed an earthquake, not an eruption, but created a wave that wiped vegetation off the hillside on the opposite side of the bay.
A United States Geological Survey geologist, measuring the scouring marks, determined that the height of the wave had been more than 1,700 feet.","No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said.

The NPPD’s stated goal is to “protect and enhance the resilience of the nation’s physical and cyber infrastructure” by specializing in cybersecurity threats the same way that an agency like FEMA specializes in disaster relief and preparedness. While Nielsen reportedly “waffled,” ultimately not leaving her post as the DHS chief of staff at the time, the role would have effectively made her the head of cyber operations for agency. Nielsen later followed Kelly to the White House to become his deputy chief of staff. Given the ever expanding nature of cyber threats, particularly those against U.S. critical infrastructure, Nielsen’s specialization in cybersecurity could prove timely. We’ll be following Nielsen as she takes on the new role and shapes policy at DHS moving forward. “I will do my utmost to ensure that the Department meets the threats of today and tomorrow, and to ensure our frontline personnel have the tools and resources to accomplish their vital missions,” Nielsen said of her confirmation. “I look forward to continuing this Administration’s work to raise the standards for the security of our homeland in all areas – including securing our borders, protecting Americans from terrorist threats, and securing our cyber networks.” Featured Image: Tom Williams/Getty Images","After a Senate vote on Tuesday, Kirstjen Nielsen has now been confirmed as John Kelly’s replacement to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

Andrew G. Keeler Dylan McNamara and Jennifer Irish,"Coastal communities around the world are struggling to adapt to rising sea levels and increasingly severe coastal storms. In the United States, local governments are making investments to reduce those risks, such as protecting shorelines with seawalls, “nourishing” eroded beaches by adding sand and rerouting or redesigning roads and bridges. In the short run, spending public money this way is economically rational. But in the long run, many people who live near coastlines will probably have to relocate as seas continue to rise. We have studied this problem by combining insights from our work in economics, coastal geomorphology and engineering. As we have explained elsewhere, short-term actions to adapt to coastal flooding can actually increase risks to lives and property. By raising the value of coastal properties, these steps encourage people to stay in place and delay decisions about more drastic solutions, such as moving inland. [Photo: Flickr user George Pankewytch ] Keeping millions in harm’s way According to recent estimates, a 1-foot increase in sea levels will put about 1 million people in the United States at risk, and 3 feet will threaten about 4 million people. Global sea levels currently are projected to rise 0.5 to 2.1 feet by 2050 and 1.0 to 8.2 feet by 2100. As we see it, market forces and public risk reduction policies interact in unexpected ways, reducing incentives for communities to make long-term plans for retreating from the shore. Nourishing beaches and building seawalls signal to individuals and businesses that their risks are lower. This makes them more likely to build long-lasting structures in risky areas and renovate and maintain existing structures. As a result, their property values increase, which reinforces economic and political arguments for more risk-reduction engineering. To illustrate this pattern, we compared a sample of houses in Nags Head and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, two popular beach towns less than 10 miles apart on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. When we consulted county tax appraisal values, Nags Head beaches had routinely received sand from beach nourishment, whereas Kitty Hawk beaches had not. On average, homes in our Nags Head sample were worth over US$1 million, while homes in the Kitty Hawk sample were worth about $200,000. Other researchers have found that in some locations, the threat of rising seas is eroding coastal property values. But this tends to be true for properties that are viewed as highly vulnerable–for example, homes that have already flooded. In contrast, homes that are elevated or have other flood-proofing features tend to have much higher values, so they are perceived as assets. [Photo: Flickr user George Pankewytch ] Subsidizing risky choices Some amount of risk reduction makes sense. If people who benefited paid its full cost, and everyone involved understood how imminent the risk was and how much engineering solutions would cost, then market forces would likely produce reasonably efficient solutions. As an example, flood-prone Norfolk, Virginia recently adopted an ordinance requiring almost all new homes and many major renovations to be elevated and include other flood-proofing features. This approach will help to price flood protection into the cost of homes and will tend to reduce demands to directly subsidize protective engineering, flood insurance and post-disaster assistance. In our view, such solutions are a move in the right direction. But they will not break the positive feedback loop we describe as long as other public policies continue to skew perceptions of the long-term viability of coastal communities. Engineering projects to slow shoreline retreat and reduce flooding generally receive smaller subsidies now than in past decades, but many communities still benefit. For example, beach nourishment in Ocean City, Maryland is cost-shared between the federal government, which pays about half, and state and local agencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency helps pay to rebuild homes and public buildings damaged in major disasters. And allowing people to deduct local taxes on their federal tax forms partly subsidizes local tax financing for risk reduction. Inaccurate perceptions of risk Information and uncertainty are larger problems. Many coastal residents do not perceive medium- and long-term climate risk to be as serious as the scientific consensus suggests. Moreover, scientists are still analyzing how fast sea levels are likely to rise. Future storm frequency is uncertain, and could be affected by changes in global greenhouse gas emission trends. On the positive side, engineering innovations such as designing storm-resistant homes could become more effective. But existing approaches like beach nourishment are likely to become more expensive as sand resources diminish and more communities compete for them. And growing uncertainty is likely to increase near-term demand for risk reduction engineering. The most critical time for adaptation decisions is immediately after a storm or flood. Faced with expensive repairs or rebuilding, property owners face higher costs to return to the status quo. But if homeowners expect that public resources will be spent to protect them against future disasters, they are less likely to consider making big changes. Federal or state financial rebuilding assistance creates a similar bias. If that money were used to subsidize relocation or other drastic adaptive actions, rebuilding patterns would be different. So far, however, programs for buying out flood-damaged properties have been largely unsuccessful. Many factors, including residents’ level of experience with disaster recovery and financial concerns, can make people unwilling to consider relocating. Incentives to think long-term There is no perfect formula for balancing near-term climate-proofing against more drastic steps to move people away from the coasts. But we believe that when communities focus excessively on reducing near-term threats, they risk inhibiting the successful adaptation that they are trying to promote. We have three suggestions for breaking this cycle. First, local land use policies could be designed to discourage rebuilding homes to similar or higher property values after damage from storms. Second, communities could put increasing emphasis on adaptive engineering and large-scale planning practices–for example, sunsetting beach nourishment projects when sea level rise reaches some preannounced level. Finally, adaptation decisions could be planned and implemented at a multi-jurisdictional level, rather than town by town. This approach would help to avoid “rich towns get richer” dynamics that can develop when wealthier jurisdictions deploy sand resources and other protective measures in a way that reduces their own risk while ignoring or heightening threats to nearby locations. Change is coming to coasts around the world. We believe that broader understanding of how markets and public policy interact is essential to minimize the social and economic costs of this change.

Pavithra Mohan,"Millions of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, with very little room to survive missed paychecks or sudden financial hardship. In fact, 4 in 10 Americans say they would not be able to cover a $400 unplanned expense without racking up credit card debt, according to a 2018 report by the Federal Reserve. According to Nerd Wallet, about half of households reportedly carry credit card balances of nearly $7,000 from month to month; across the U.S., that amounts to about $944 billion in outstanding credit card debt. When that’s combined with things like home, car, and student loans, the the total personal debt for Americans comes to an astonishing $13.5 trillion.
So when you find yourself financially adrift or deep in the red, how do you begin to pull yourself out?
We talked to three people about how they did it, whether it meant becoming more financially responsible or making drastic lifestyle changes.
When you get divorced with no safety net: “I never thought, if he leaves, can I afford this place by myself?”
When Ashley Davidson separated from her husband in 2016, she was suddenly saddled with maintaining a lifestyle that had been affordable with two salaries but was exorbitant with just one, especially living in Washington, D.C. “I never moved into a place thinking, if he leaves, or if I leave, can I afford this place by myself?” she says. “Divorce was never, ever, in a million years, on my mind.”
It wasn’t just rent. Davidson had to start footing her own health insurance and replace many shared household items when her husband moved out. He had always earned more than Davidson did, to the tune of an additional $15,000-$20,000.
While married, the couple didn’t live paycheck to paycheck, but they never prioritized building up a robust savings account; Davidson says she usually had no more than a few thousand dollars saved at any given point. And since money had been tight for Davidson in college and immediately after–which was compounded by high student loans–she wanted to spend more freely on things like travel when she came into more money. “We were living that young, twentysomething life,” she says. “We were starting to make a little bit more money in our later 20s, and we were having fun. We weren’t afraid to go out and eat because we could afford it.” But by the time they got divorced, Davidson had virtually no savings–more or less the situation she had been in before getting married at 24.
After their separation, Davidson found herself with about $12,000 of credit card debt, between paying thousands for a divorce lawyer and spending money she didn’t have on social activities and seeing friends. “When you’re going through a divorce and your friends say, ‘Hey, come out, you need to get out of your house and stop sitting around watching Netflix,’ you say sure,” she says. “I wanted to get out and have fun and forget about the fact that I was getting divorced. But the social budget kind of blew everything out of whack.”
About six months in, Davidson knew she had to do something about her debt. “I was finally like, this is insane,” she said. “Not having a plan was just suffocating.” She took on additional work–a freelance writing gig–and put all that money toward paying off her credit card; she did the same with her yearly bonus. Once her lease was up, she moved into a cheaper apartment (though she still had to borrow money from her parents for a security deposit). Davidson paid off the debt in just over two years.
Now, she immediately puts part of her paycheck into her savings account and has heavily cut back on social spending. “I think the biggest thing is, I’ve learned to say no,” she says. “I’ve learned to stay home and eat in. For me, personally, it was these small changes I could make, and those add up significantly.” The experience has also shown her the importance of being transparent about finances with a significant other, which wasn’t always the case in her marriage, so Davidson has carried that into her new relationship.
“I don’t ever want to experience that again, but I think it takes being in that to wake up,” she says. “It’s a little disconcerting to know that I’m turning 33 next month, and I’m not where I want to be. But unfortunately I had a curve ball thrown at me, and that’s the situation I ended up in.”

When a recession hits after you retire: “We decided to just take off and live in a tent”
Richard and Laura Pawlowski took a more drastic approach to pulling themselves out of debt than most people would. In 2010, the Pawlowskis were retired and both on the verge of turning 70, but they had been hit hard by the recession. Their investments bottomed out while their monthly house payments and credit card debt climbed higher. “We had to live on our social security income,” Richard says. “Our savings were pretty much wiped out, and we were going back into debt again, and then deeper into debt. It was traumatic.” They considered selling their home in Los Angeles where they had lived their whole lives and finding an apartment instead, but even that felt like a stretch financially. “The prices were going up around us, so we felt we had to learn something new about another place,” Richard says. “It was kind of a wrenching decision, but we had to do it.”
So they gave up their home and became “homeless by choice,” as Richard calls it. “We decided to just take off and live in a tent,” he says. “We had been camping most of our lives, for two or three weeks at a time, so we took it on as an adventure.” For two years, the couple camped out in national parks across the western U.S., pitching their tent in 15 parks and across 10 states. “The way we lived for this two-year period allowed us to not only get out of debt–we had crawled into a pretty deep hole there for a while,” Richard says, “but living this way and traveling, we saved a lot of money because we didn’t have to pay rent and our car was paid off. It turned out to be a great blessing in disguise.” The couple had a laptop on hand and sought out libraries and Starbucks locations wherever they went, which made it easy to manage their finances on the road.
They hadn’t planned on camping out for two years–the goal, when they had set out, had been to find a new place to settle down. Eventually, they found themselves drawn to the central coast of Oregon, where rent was cheaper and there was no sales tax. “We found some nice older people that were renting out a triplex—a great 600-square-foot apartment with a 180-degree ocean view,” Richard says. “We landed on our feet. Medicare and everything is covered. And I’m just trying to stay relevant by writing books now and sharing what we’ve learned.” (The Pawlowskis have already published an e-book detailing their experience living in a tent for two years.)
You could say the Pawlowskis’ experience is an extreme version of the method Marie Kondo espouses. They were forced to part with most of their possessions when they hit the road, which meant carrying important documents and photos on a flash drive. But one of their key takeaways is that as hard as it is, people can pare back their life to survive financial hardship. “Go without for quite a while,” he says. “You can always get stuff. But don’t let your trappings define who you are.” In fact, sometimes, the Pawlowskis miss those two years on the road. “It was fun,” he says. “We wish we had done this sooner in life.”

When you live outside your means: “I didn’t have a logical approach to money”
“I didn’t have a logical approach to money,” Kassandra Dasent says of how she managed her finances in her twenties and early thirties. “I was working and looking forward to my payday every few weeks, and most of the time, I had already planned what I was going to spend it on.” As she puts it, Dasent spent on her “wants” first. The little she had saved for retirement was because she had to maintain a minimum contribution to ensure her employer would match it.
Growing up, Dasent had been privy to her mom’s overspending. A turning point in her mom’s financial life was when she had to file for bankruptcy after losing her job, but Dasent didn’t interpret that as a lesson. “I looked at it from the point of view of, well, she’s still managing her money day-to-day,” Dasent says. “She’s making it work. I figured I could make it work, too. I had a bigger income to work with than she did.”
By her early thirties, Dasent had gone through a divorce and was carrying a whopping Canadian $55,000 in debt (nearly $42,000 in U.S. dollars), between her credit card, car payments, and a business loan that went sideways. At the time, she was earning around $50,000 CAD (about $38,000) before bonuses. While she had put away $20,000 CAD (about $15,000) in retirement savings, Dasent was otherwise living almost paycheck to paycheck. (She also points out that even her retirement savings were minimal, given she had worked for more than 10 years and lived at home early on.) Had she earned more money, Dasent says, her financial habits wouldn’t have been any different–if anything, she would have spent more.
In 2009, the debt began to consume her. “I started to feel physically anxious,” she says. She gave herself a crash course in personal finance and mapped out a plan to pay it all off in five years. She got a sizable raise at work, which gave her a leg up; she started charging money for her side hustle as a singer-songwriter. “The biggest decision I made, which was very hard for me, was to give up my apartment and move into a roommate situation for a year,” she says. “That cut my living expenses in half.” Dasent heavily pulled back on discretionary spending, from shopping (“I don’t think I saw a store for the first two years”) to travel.
“It was the first time I really started thinking consciously about, What am I spending on and why am I spending on it?” she says. Dasent realized that as someone from a low-income immigrant household who grew up in a more affluent environment, her overspending was partly tied up in her self-worth. “I was constantly thinking one day, I’m going to be able to show that I’m successful and can have nice things,” she says. “I had to figure out that I don’t need money to say that I’m a good person; I don’t money to show that I am successful and worthy. So much of our experience with money is rooted in how we feel, and how we’ve experienced money in the past.”
Dasent finished paying off her debt in 3.5 years, right as she got remarried. Now, Dasent and her husband try to live on just one income. “One of the biggest things was spending significantly below our incomes, so if one of us were to lose our income, we could still survive,” she says, adding that her earnings have increased. “That remains the No. 1 thing for us.” Dasent uses Personal Capital to monitor their spending, and the couple has retirement and brokerage investments; Dasent says they no longer need to stick to a stringent budget. “We’ve reached a point where we are controlling and directing our money,” she says. “It’s a really interesting place to be in, compared to where I was 10 years ago.”","From a retired couple who lived in a tent to a young woman who got divorced, we talked to people about how they stopped the debt spiral.

Since eruptions in the Leilani Estates neighborhood began on May 3, the flows of lava have destroyed 36 structures as of Friday — at least 26 of them homes — and covered 117 acres. The fissures across the neighborhood have also been emitting dangerous sulfur dioxide gases, local authorities said. About 25 miles away from the neighborhood, the island is on alert for the possibility of a explosive eruption in coming days or weeks at Kilauea volcano’s summit, which could launch 10- to 12-ton boulders within a half-mile radius. As of Friday, 15 separate fissures have opened up in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens area. No deaths or injuries have been recorded so far. “I don’t think anyone thought it would be a reality,” said Heath Dalton, a resident of Leilani Estates. “They know it was coming, I just don’t think anybody ever thought it would be in their lifetime.” On May 4, Mr. Dalton was packing up some belongings to evacuate the neighborhood when he could see a fissure just a block away from his house. He said the rupture sounded like a jet engine as it exploded with bright red lava. When he returned the next day to save more of his family’s possessions, he found his home in flames. Though the neighborhood had been evacuated, residents have been frantically trying to gather their belongings, when permitted by authorities. The island of Hawaii is made up of five volcanoes. Four of them are active.

Mauna Kea Last eruption at least 4,500 years ago Hilo Kilauea summit and lava lake Pu’u O’o Kilauea Erupting since 1983 20 miles For 35 years, Kilauea has been erupting almost continuously, according to the United States Geological Survey. The volcano takes up the entire southeast portion of the island of Hawaii. Because of that, residents of Leilani Estates — though living in Hazard Zone 1, an area most at risk from lava flows — have often been miles away from danger. “You’re in Lava Zone 1, so it’s always in your head that it could happen. But for the last 30 years, it’s been flowing down to Kalapana. Then in 2014, it almost cut Pahoa in half,” Mr. Dalton said. Kalapana is a small town resting on top of a lava field about 10 miles southwest of Leilani Estates. Pahoa, much closer, is only about two miles to the north. “I never thought I’d ever be faced with this, I’m just shell-shocked,” said Carl Yoshimoto, 69, who has lived in the neighborhood for eight years and left his home in a “mad scramble,” grabbing his wallet, medications and important paperwork. “The local people just kind of take it as something you live with.” The most recent eruption near the Leilani Estates area was in 1955, before subdivisions were built in the area. The volcano had long been dormant, until its eruption forced villagers in the area to flee.

It’s a rural neighborhood that has offered relatively affordable homes, in contrast with Hawaii’s more expensive real estate on Oahu and Maui. Despite the neighborhood’s position in an area where lava flows are most likely to occur on the island, there are no building restrictions, Mr. Arai said. Kilauea is known as a “shield” volcano because its gentle slopes resemble those of a shield lying on the ground. The initial eruptions in Leilani Estates are about 15 miles from the Pu’u O’o crater, a primary vent of Kilauea, and about 25 miles from the peak of the volcano. As the surface of the lava lake at the summit has receded, it has forced molten rock underground to travel through conduits and erupt miles away. Hundreds of earthquakes have registered on the island in recent days, including one with a magnitude of 6.9 on May 4.

In a call with journalists on May 9, Don Swanson, a geologist with the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, explained that an eruption at the summit carried a range of risks. He said that 10- to 12-ton boulders could be flung within about half a mile of the summit, marble-size rocks could reach within about 10 miles and snow-like ash could spread about 20 miles downwind. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed indefinitely on Thursday. The potential steam-driven explosion is not expected to be life-threatening, but a “nuisance event,” Mr. Swanson said. The string of eruptions at Leilani Estates seemed to have paused on Friday, but authorities said that new fissures and eruptions are likely to continue east of the neighborhood where earthquakes have registered in the past two days.","New York Times 'Shell-Shocked' in Hawaii: How Lava Overran a Neighborhood New York Times The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island unleashed havoc when the earth split open, lava spewed hundreds of feet into the air and molten rock swallowed streets in a res…",2018-05-12T09:00:42Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",'Shell-Shocked' in Hawaii: How Lava Overran a Neighborhood - New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/12/us/kilauea-volcano-lava-leilani-estates-hawaii.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/11/us/kilauea-1526079544004/kilauea-1526079544004-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political. There will always be those who chastise the climate-concerned public for politicizing the storm but theres also an argument for doing just that when it is the refusal of specific politicians to act on climate that increases our vulnerability to powerful storms, wildfires, and more. But drawing linkages between our weather, our climate, and our politics is quite a different thing than blaming victims of a tragedy for their own suffering. That latter, far uglier form of politicization reared its head last week when the Guardian ran an article under a headline seemingly tailor-made to drive the partisan wedge between us even deeper: Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers. The headlines implicationthat by voting for the wrong politicians, folks in the Florida Panhandle were somehow getting whats coming sparked swift condemnation on social media. And to the credit of author John Abraham, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, he asked the Guardian to change it after publication, and the Guardian did. But the victim-shaming sentiment the Guardian telegraphed is sadly nothing new. In the aftermath of a storm, those who stay behind are often condemned for not evacuating, even though evacuation is a privilege not everyone can afford. In the wake of the deadly Oso landslide that struck Washington State in 2014, people whose homes were destroyed were blamed for building on unstable ground in the first place. When Hawaiis Kilauea erupted last spring, residents of Leilani Estates took heat for buying property atop an active volcano. The list goes on and on. After a disaster happens, it is a very common human trait to immediately find a way to assign blame, disaster researcher and former Gizmodo writer Mika McKinnon told Earther. A large chunk of why we do this is to say well, it wouldnt happen to me. Perhaps, then, it isnt surprising that how victims voted is starting to creep into conversations about who is to blame when it comes to climate change-fueled disasters, however reprehensible that kind of talk may be. Faith Kearns, a scientist at the California Institute for Water Resources, says shes seen victim shaming based on ideology become increasingly common as we wrestle with how to talk about climate change after a disaster. As an example she pointed to the massive wildfire that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, which brought out the worst on social media, with some, including former New Democratic Party candidate Tom Moffatt, calling it karmic that a town in the Canadian oil-sands was devoured by a blaze likely exacerbated by climate change. A brief scan of responses to the recent Guardian article reveals there are indeed jerks who saw citizens of the red-leaning Florida Panhandle getting what they deserve when Hurricane Michael struck last week. Matthew Motta, a postdoc studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania, wasnt aware of any research showing that a significant number liberals blame conservative voters for extreme weather, or, more perniciously, revel in disasters striking their communities. But he said the deep partisan divide over climate change makes it the sort of issue where we might expect to see affective polarization, that is, polarization that causes us to dislike the other side even more. And its not just random internet commenters who are liable to resent and blame those they disagree with on climate change. Sarah Myhre, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, told Earther that derision or dismissal of the uninformed or misinformed public is a sentiment shes been exposed to quite a few times, particularly among male colleagues whove never had their authority questioned ever. The righteousness of male power brokers when they are not believed gets re-routed into anger and cynicism, Myhre told Earther. She said we need more leadership from women, particularly women of color, to reframe our conversations about climate change centering the values of human rights. NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel emphasized that blaming disaster victims, which she described as at best unproductive and at worst just morally abhorrent, sets up a false narrative when it comes to climate change. After all, its hardly the citizens of the Florida Panhandle among the poorest in the statewho are responsible for our planetary fever. That distinction goes to the fossil fuel industry, which has reaped unimaginable profits off our outdated energy system. It goes to the shareholders and executives whove hid their own companies research on the link between carbon emissions and warming, whove built misinformation campaigns to sow confusion among the public, and even now, when the science is too clear for bald-faced denials, who have convinced us we are all equally to blame. And it goes to politicians who continue to bury their heads in the sand at industrys behest. Politicizing the storm can be the right thing to do. But if were using politics to punch down, were giving these real power brokers a pass.","As scientists’ warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political.

Aaron Sheldrick,"OKUMA, Japan (Reuters) - A costly “ice wall” is failing to keep groundwater from seeping into the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, data from operator Tokyo Electric Power Co shows, preventing it from removing radioactive melted fuel at the site seven years after the disaster. FILE PHOTO: Workers prepare frozen pipes during operations to construct an underground ice wall at Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s (Tepco) tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture July 9, 2014. REUTERS/Kimimasa Mayama/Pool/File Photo When the ice wall was announced in 2013, Tepco ( 9501.T ) assured skeptics that it would limit the flow of groundwater into the plant’s basements, where it mixes with highly radioactive debris from the site’s reactors, to “nearly nothing.” However, since the ice wall became fully operational at the end of August, an average of 141 metric tonnes a day of water has seeped into the reactor and turbine areas, more than the average of 132 metric tonnes a day during the prior nine months, a Reuters analysis of the Tepco data showed. The groundwater seepage has delayed Tepco’s clean-up at the site and may undermine the entire decommissioning process for the plant, which was battered by a tsunami seven years ago this Sunday. Waves knocked out power and triggered meltdowns at three of the site’s six reactors that spewed radiation, forcing 160,000 residents to flee, many of whom have not returned to this once-fertile coast. Though called an ice wall, Tepco has attempted to create something more like a frozen soil barrier. Using 34.5 billion yen ($324 million) in public funds, Tepco sunk about 1,500 tubes filled with brine to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) in a 1.5-kilometre (1-mile) perimeter around four of the plant’s reactors. It then cools the brine to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit). The aim is to freeze the soil into a solid mass that blocks groundwater flowing from the hills west of the plant to the coast. However, the continuing seepage has created vast amounts of toxic water that Tepco must pump out, decontaminate and store in tanks at Fukushima that now number 1,000, holding 1 million tonnes. It says it will run out of space by early 2021. “I believe the ice wall was ‘oversold’ in that it would solve all the release and storage concerns,” said Dale Klein, the former chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the head of an external committee advising Tepco on safety issues. “The hydrology of the Fukushima site is very complicated and thus the exact water flow is hard to predict,” he said, “especially during heavy rains.” (For a graphic on 'Water Seepage Flows at Fukushima' click reut.rs/2FseHpb ) TYPHOON The water inflows often fluctuate with rainfall. The dry month of January averaged 83 tons a day, Tepco data showed. But when a typhoon struck during the last week of October, 866 tons a day poured into the reactors. Overall, Tepco says a combination of drains, pumps and the ice wall has cut water flows by three-quarters, from 490 tons a day during the December 2015 to February 2016 period to an average of 110 tons a day for December 2017 to February 2018. It is hard to measure exactly how much the ice wall is contributing, Tepco officials say, but based on computer analysis the utility estimates the barrier is reducing water flows by about 95 tonnes a day compared to two years ago, before the barrier was operating. “Our assessment is that the ice wall has been effective,” said Naohiro Masuda, Tepco’s chief decommissioning officer, adding that rain falling within the ice wall perimeter contributed to surging volumes. “We now believe we have a system in place to manage the water level.” However, a government-commissioned panel on Wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the ice wall, saying it was partially effective but more steps were needed. Controlling the groundwater seepage using the ice wall has been central to Japan’s program to show it had the Fukushima decommissioning in hand. The barrier was announced just days before Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared that Fukushima was “under control” in his final pitch to the International Olympic Committee. In addition to the building costs, the ice wall needs an estimated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year to run, enough to power about 15,000 typical Japanese homes. (For a graphic on Fukushima's ""ice wall"" click tmsnrt.rs/2tqxK1k ) NO MORE SPACE Meanwhile, Tepco must decide how to cope with the growing volume of water stored on site. The purification process removes 62 radioactive elements from the contaminated water but it leaves tritium, a mildly radioactive element that is difficult to separate from water. Not considered harmful in low doses, tritium is released into oceans and rivers by nuclear plants around the world at various national standard levels. But local residents, particularly fishermen, oppose ocean releases because they fear it will keep consumers from buying Fukushima products. Many countries, including South Korea and China, still have restrictions on produce from Fukushima and neighboring areas. A government-commissioned task force is examining five options for disposing of the tritium-laced water, including ocean releases, though no decision has been made. Ken Buesseler, a radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States, suggests that Tepco should open the tanks to external inspections to see if the water is safe. “From the public’s viewpoint, I think they’d want a bit of independent confirmation,” Buesseler said. “It’s no harder and a lot cheaper than building an ice wall.” Reporting by Malcolm Foster and Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Christian Schmollinger","OKUMA, Japan (Reuters) - A costly ""ice wall"" is failing to keep groundwater from seeping into the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, data from operator Tokyo Electric Power Co shows, preventing it from removing radioactive melted fuel at the site seve…",2018-03-08T07:43:24Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Tepco's 'ice wall' fails to freeze Fukushima's toxic water buildup,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-disaster-nuclear-icewall/tepcos-ice-wall-fails-to-freeze-fukushimas-toxic-water-buildup-idUSKCN1GK0SY,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180308&t=2&i=1238682490&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE270HZ,reuters,Reuters,1

Walter O’Malley, his name remains in infamy,” he said of the owner of the Dodgers at the time. Some have tried to shift blame from O’Malley because of his battle with New York over a new stadium. But in 1986, the White Sox threatened to leave Chicago for the same reason. “Frankly,” Mr. Reinsdorf said then, acknowledging the parallel, “I don’t know if I have the heart to do it.” He didn’t have to find out.

Quentyn Kennemer,"Shonen Jump, one of the most iconic manga publications out there, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and Bandai Namco was tasked with making the ultimate game to celebrate. That game is Jump Force, an anime mashup featuring characters from all your favorite Weekly Shonen Jump series.
It seems easy. Some of the most iconic manga of all time —Naruto, Dragon Ball, One Piece, My Hero Academia, Hunter x Hunter, Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu Yu Hakusho, and more — are all represented here. The source material is big and showy, so the game has to be big and showy. These are fighting characters, so the fighting gameplay is practically built in. With so many great characters and fanservice, all we needed was a decent game.
Jump Force is some of those things. Unfortunately, there's a lot to take issue with when you really start to dig in and fans should be disappointed.
Insultingly Bad
$60
Bottom line: Everything about Jump Force screams shameless cash grab, and that's a shame because it easily could have been a game changer.
Pros:
Fluid, exciting gameplay that's inviting for all players
Beautiful fighting environments
Cons:
Terrible story mode features lifeless characters and text dialog.
Weak roster
Too many loading screens
Lack of substance in online capabilities
This is one sad celebration
Jump Force merely had to be competent, if nothing else. No one was ever expecting it to take EVO by storm or turn the world of fighting games on its head. We just wanted a good fighting game with all our favorite anime characters. How could it possibly go wrong?
I'll tell you how: because this game isn't the celebration that Shonen Jump deserves. It's more a shameless cash grab by Bandai Namco, who took what should have been a momentous occasion and decided to perverse it. It had the opportunity to create the last anime game we'd probably ever want to play, but instead took a ton of shortcuts to rush something out of the door.
The entire point of Jump Force is to get closer to the characters you love. It's hard to do that when they're presented in such a putrid light.
This neglect is apparent all throughout the game, but it's most noticeable in Jump Force's easily forgettable story mode. The plot is actually not half bad for a fighting game (it's not the main focus, after all), but the execution is doing it no favors. While there are moments of cheeky references strewn throughout as characters from entirely different worlds interact, they don't happen frequently enough for my liking. To make matters worse, most of the cutscenes are driven by text; the game doesn't offer fully voiced lines, so a majority of these interactions don't even come through in a natural way.
I was disappointed by the contents of the story in general. It begins with you choosing to join one of three teams, one each for the Naruto, Dragon Ball, and One Piece universes. These teams work together to stop common villainous enemies, all of it culminating in an epic final showdown. It's not the most terrible excuse to set up glorified exhibition matches, but no one is going to be talking about how masterful Jump Force's story is years from now.
Even a weak story can work with the right cast and characters, but I feel the ball was dropped here too. Jump Force gets all the obvious names in, but other questionable choices make its 40-count roster feel less exciting than it should be. We needed either more character slots (they wasted two slots on original characters that were made specifically for story mode) or better character choices.
While strong, Naruto's Kaguya is one of the least relevant characters in her series. That slot could have easily been awarded to someone like Jiraiya or Tsunade, or perhaps a villain like Orochimaru. In the realm of Dragon Ball, Cell could have been sacrificed for a more exciting option like Android 17. Also, if Light Yagami and Ryuk of Death Note fame are eligible for this supposed celebration, why didn't we get any characters from Death Note — one of the best and most popular titles in anime — in playable form? And why couldn't we get more cameos from others who were snubbed?
You can argue against a bigger roster size as it allowed Bandai to craft each character with more care (which comes through in the gameplay department, more on that later), and that's a fine tradeoff. However, there's no inherent excuse for overall poor character choices. The result is a top-heavy list of names that just tumbles off a cliff.
And that's not considering the myriad technical issues I encountered. The dialog is carried out in cutscenes where characters are so stiff that they sometimes seem devoid of life. Rarely do they move, and if they do, it can look robotic.
Facial animations are largely stone cold. They bring back horrid memories of pre-patched Mass Effect Andromeda with awkward expressions that don't fit the context of the situations. Characters sound far more passionate than they appear, a nice point for the excellent Japanese voice actors who lent their talent for the game, but not conducive to the end goal of providing content that's actually enjoyable to play (speaking of which, there was no English localization for voiced lines whatsoever, so if you can't understand Japanese then expect to do a lot of reading).
Here is where I would normally forgive Jump Force's story mode for being a tacked-on afterthought that wasn't really expected to deliver something breathtaking in the first place (especially since many games in this genre don't even opt for full character models in cutscenes), but that's a stance I'm not willing to take.
The entire point of Jump Force is to get closer to all the characters you know and love, and it's kind of hard to do that when they're presented in such a putrid light. I'm also of the general opinion that if it's in the game, it should feel complete, and this isn't that.
Jump Force is much better when it's time to fight
Things aren't as bad when you're not forcing yourself to slog through a weak campaign. Jump Force is a much more respectable game if all you're interested in is the core fighting.
What we have here is an arena-style combat experience on a 3D plane featuring strict teams of three. You can tag them in and out at will, or they can simply help you pull off bigger combos before heading back to the sidelines. Your teammates share all resource meters, so the game becomes less about shuffling and juggling and more about dodging incoming damage.
As with many of Bandai's mainstream anime titles these days, Jump Force features a simplistic fighting engine with only a handful of button combinations used to pull off all your moves, and the control scheme is the same for each and every character in the game.
This can be good and bad. It makes it easy for new or lesser players to pick up and play, and it even gives them hope that they can beat some of the tougher fighters. On the flip side, more experienced fighting game players may eventually master the fighters too soon as if you've played them once, you've kind of played them all.
That said, there is gameplay nuance that'll satisfy more serious players. There are stamina and energy bars to maintain, both of which dictate the stuff you can do in battle. You can't charge at your opponent without stamina and you can't pull off crazy looking combos without a lot of energy. Well-timed tag team attacks hit harder and keep your opponent guessing. An embarrassment of movement capabilities let you chase opponents down or seek safety from devastating attacks. Counter attacks give you a clean way to open your enemy up to damage while stopping the barrage of their own.
I also like how the teambuilding aspect of Jump Force works and I feel this will be one of the deepest areas for hardcore players to key in on. You can only cycle through your teammates in a specific order (that the player sets before each match), so you can set your team up so that the next fighter in line will synergize better with whoever is currently in the fight. This edge isn't overwhelmingly potent, so it's perfectly fine for the more casual players to build their teams based on personal taste.
I also like that the characters maintain their own experience level, have unique strengths and resistances, and even offer different attack damage and health stats. This adds incentive to really get to know your preferred teammates, as the more you play with them the more capable they are. They can also be propped up with temporary power-up consumables and permanent upgrades on an individual basis.
It's not perfect, but Jump Force feels very good to play.
Characters have slightly different fighting styles, with the range being one of the most prevalent differentiators. I found it helpful to use balance when making my teams, with a typical trio of melee offense, ranged offense, and utility helping you cover your weaknesses while amplifying your strengths. The classic fighting game trope of quick moves hitting softer than slower ones is alive and well in Jump Force, so the game rewards you for trying all the different characters and finding the perfect one for you.
If you're not happy with some of the characters available to you, Jump Force gives you the option of creating your own. Customization options felt a bit limited for anatomy options, and clothing wasn't much better, but you can buy more items from the in-game shops. Thankfully, there are some diverse hair and facial options available, so you may be able to create some of those characters you wish were in the game. I've already seen a Saitama (One Punch Man) and Sakura (Naruto) running around the shared online hub.
The game is more rigid when it comes to fighting style options for your custom characters. You get three basic styles, and while you can customize all four of your special abilities, you can only use abilities that the characters in the game are already hogging. It's better than nothing, but there's definite room for improvement here.
Jump Force also rewards you by being a beautiful game in general. Story mode grievances aside, the presentation in-fight is very slick. Characters are presented with a 3D art style that uses strong contrast and shadows to make them stand out. I was a bit skeptical about the developer's ability to settle on a style that makes each fighter look natural, especially since drawing and animation styles can differ wildly from one anime to the next.
I'm glad to say those fears are unwarranted. No one, in particular, stands out like a sore thumb, and that's more important than staying true to original depictions. My only complaint is that we didn't even get any alternate costumes for the anime characters, something I find to be unforgivable in a game like this.
More than just the character models, the animations and special effects you see when attacks and special moves are performed clearly got most of the development effort. There's nothing quite like seeing Naruto's massive demon form when he hits his Ultimate Awakening, and a well-placed Kamehameha always jerks that bit of nostalgia out of me. These are the things you play this kind of game for, and they nailed it.
The stages you fight in are characters all on their own. Jump Force is pretty. Environments are lush and rich in detail; water reflections look really refreshing; smoke and debris float across the screen to add depth and substance to the urban scenes. Just when you thought you had enough sightseeing, you can break the stages with certain moves to go to an entirely new area. Anime and huge set-piece battles go together like cheese on popcorn, and that's one thing Jump Force does absolutely right.
There are a couple of issues worth pointing out. You'll often go for a grab only for your fighter to completely whiff despite seemingly connecting with your opponent. More rarely, some special moves seem to connect even when the point of attack misses a fighter's hitbox, though this doesn't happen nearly as often as the failed grabs. Clipping and hitbox issues aren't uncommon in video games, but they're only acceptable when they don't screw up major mechanics or offer unfair advantages.
Lastly, matches seem to take ages to complete. There were too many instances where the match was decided by the 99-second time limit instead of a knockout. We either needed custom timers or weaker health bars. Hopefully, these issues will be ironed out in a future update.
Jump Force is a one trick pony
Like many other developers, Bandai Namco has become fond of these shared world hubs that get you to and from the game's various activities. It's a place where you can walk around with your avatar and see people going about their business as they prepare for the day's games. I've never been a big fan of these worlds as I feel they pad your gaming sessions with unnecessary navigation time. Sometimes, I just want to load the game up and jump right into a match using regular old menus.
The layout of the world is at least sensible in Jump Force. One central kiosk for online and offline battles means you'll never have to walk very far to get into your matches. The various stores and information desks are more scattered, but you can navigate to any station you want by bringing up the minimap. This is a nice compromise for gamers like me who can't care to pretend they're immersed in these staging areas.
Fighting games have spent this generation exploring new gameplay models and experimenting with additional ones to try and draw more interest from the casual public. Jump Force is not that game. It sticks to its guns as a pure fighter, so if you were hoping for some fun little side modes or a completely fresh take on the genre, look elsewhere.
This wouldn't be an automatic negative for Jump Force if other areas of the game showed a higher level of polish from extra development time and focus, but that's not the case. The game is frustratingly bare in your options for online play. You can play ranked or unranked head-to-head matches and, well, that's literally it.
Glaring issues and omissions make it hard to enjoy Jump Force's excellent gameplay.
I can't say I wasn't disappointed at the lack of a lobby system where you and all your friends can join in and take turns fighting while spectators wait their turn. There's not even a rematch button, with each player having to suffer through even more of those loading screens to get in and out of battles.
Events are another piece of the Jump Force online puzzle. The entire structure of the game revolves around this team concept where you're doing your part for your team — Alpha, Beta, and Gamma for Dragon Ball, One Piece, and Naruto, respectively — to try and fight back against evildoers.
Events are supposed to promote team pride, with those belonging to the most active team being entitled to rewards at the end of short seasonal periods. You're alerted every moment that you earn points toward this objective, but we don't know what the objective is, how long it lasts, or how much of a lead your team has over others. It's kind of just… there, and not interesting at all. Heading to the events counter prompts a message letting you know which team is winning, and that's all you get. It's designed to light a fire, inspire pride, or make me jealous, but it fails at all of those things and I find myself not caring.
Jump Force Bottom line
Jump Force is disappointing. The core gameplay is there, but almost everything else about this game is shamefully shallow. I would have forgiven it as the celebratory anniversary present that Bandai Namco advertised it to be, but it doesn't even manage to do that correctly.
The story mode is awful, online is frustrating, and the roster could be much better. It looks stunning visually, but worlds are supposed to be colliding and the characters don't always play up those circumstances in any meaningful way. And even the most impressive part of Jump Force — gameplay — is currently in need of fixes for some glaring issues that somehow made their way past the quality assurance department.
None of these issues are enough to bring a fighting game down on their own, but together they make for an excruciating exercise in patience, and I might have been able to find that patience if the game at large had more to offer. Its hyper-focus on gameplay does it no favors in that regard. Wait for a sharp discount if you must have it.

Eillie Anzilotti,"The logic for winter vacations goes something like this: Book a flight to somewhere were the temperatures average in the 80s, pack a swimsuit and SPF 50, and prepare to relax. When I left New York City for a week in early February of this year, though, I only followed half of those rules. I flew to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands not to chill on a beach, but to work. The 32-square mile island, home to just over 50,000 people, was decimated by the back-to-back hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017. A popular tourist and cruise-ship destination, the island’s beaches, are, by now, in good shape; crowds of vacationers have returned to the sand and turquoise waters to tan and venture out on snorkeling trips. [Photo: courtesy of the author] But if you leave the shores and head up into the island’s steep hills, you’ll see a different picture: houses with their roofs blown clear off; churches with no facades, shops boarded up. From overhead, blue tarps are as common as corrugated metal roofs. The governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, a territory that comprises St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix, estimates they need $7.5 billion in assistance from the federal government to rebuild the approximately 18,500 homes and businesses destroyed in the storms. But aid, from agencies like FEMA, has been slow to reach the islands, and is unlikely to cover the full costs of recovery. To fill the gap, volunteer groups have stepped in. All Hands And Hearts, the group I volunteered with for the week I was there, set up on St. Thomas in October 2017. The organization–the result of a recent merger between All Hands Volunteers, which coordinates groups of people to do disaster relief work like debris removal, and the Happy Hearts Fund, which finances school rebuilds in disaster-stricken communities–has, to date, completed over 500 projects on St. Thomas, ranging from removing trees from properties, to sanitizing homes after clearing them out. [Photo: courtesy of the author] While I was there, I worked on just one property. It was a six-unit apartment complex just west of the capital city of Charlotte Amalie, owned by a landlord who, once the storms hit, abandoned his tenants and the island. It is property owners, not tenants, who are able to file for FEMA assistance, and because this landlord refused to do so on behalf of his tenants, they were left with no aid. When All Hands And Hearts first assessed the site, they determined it was one of the most severely damaged properties they’d seen to date: Debris was piled around seven feet high in the driveway, and the upstairs was caked in around a foot of shattered drywall amid an obstacle course of dislodged beams and appliances. Barring some wood shop classes and “helping” my dad on construction around the house (but really just watching), I’ve never wielded any power tools. I’ve never used a crowbar. It didn’t matter. As part of a team of 10 people, I helped to clear the driveway and two of the units on the top floor of the apartment. It took an entire week, but those units are now ready to be rebuilt, and it’s estimated that our work as a volunteer team saved the tenant around $80,000 in debris removal costs. I surprised myself with how much I was capable of as an individual (I never thought, for instance, that I would ever dismantle an entire wall and hurl it off a second-floor balcony into a growing pile of cleared-out debris), but that paled in comparison to how blown away I was by how much we could accomplish as a group. [Photo: courtesy of the author] But the experience was not for the faint of heart: The All Hands And Hearts volunteers, who ranged in age from 20 to mid-70s, stayed in a 70-bunk room in a church on the eastern side of the island, where we woke up at 6:30 am, were on the road by 8 a.m., and back to bed, exhausted, by 9 p.m. It was not a glamorous trip. While my team made it to the beach twice after wrapping for the day, we were there to work, and most of our time was spend sweating under the 85-degree humidity in a hard hat. But I don’t think anyone there would’ve had it otherwise–and after this experience, I’ve begun to look at the idea of travel and vacation in a whole different way. All Hands And Hearts operates programs all around the world, from Nepal, where they’re working on earthquake recovery, to the Caribbean, where they’re beginning to expand to islands including Puerto Rico and Dominica, that were affected by Irma and Maria. Once established, the All Hand And Hearts team stays an area not for months, but years–seeing through every stage of recovery from debris removal to complete rebuilding. The only expense is the cost of getting to the site, the program provides food and lodging, and you meet and work with a group of kind, motivated people unlike any other.

CHARLES McDERMID,"Mr. Witwer was referring to what many are calling the “new normal,” a term now commonly applied to the state’s drastically worsening fire seasons as a result of cyclical drought, climate change and the ceaseless drive to populate fire-prone areas. Last year was the most destructive fire season in California history: more than $10 billion in damage and 44 dead. The ominous question is what comes next. “There is a new normal in California,” Toni Atkins, the State Senate president pro tem, said by email. “Massive wildland fires are now a part of our life — and one of biggest challenges facing the Legislature and governor this year. These fires are every bit the same kind of disaster as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters that confront states across the country.” Fear has translated into policy: California will spend as much as $1 billion in the coming year to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Mr. McLean said that through Sunday, Cal Fire had this year responded to 1,200 fires that had burned 8,000 acres. Last year at this time, they’d responded to 1,049 fires that burned 2,200 acres. For some, “new normal” is already passé. Scott McLean, the deputy chief of Cal Fire, drives from Chico to Sacramento every day. He’s already watched fire conditions change this year, the grass turning from green to brown.","Wednesday: A battle for second place in the governor’s race, a death in Yosemite and Golden State comes up short.",2018-05-23T13:02:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: Experts on Fire Season 2018: Dealing With the ‘New Normal’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/california-today-fire-season-2018.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/world/12CALtoday-1/12CALtoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Richard Trenholm,"The internet is basically the world now. The way we shop, the way we watch TV, even the way we talk, it's all built on the pillars of web browsing, social networking and streaming video. Yup, we spend all our time on Netscape, TheGlobe.com and Pixelon.
Except we don't, obviously.
New TV show Valley of the Boom is the real-life story of the companies that came before Google, Facebook and Netflix, the companies and the people that laid the foundations of the internet -- and were buried there.
The six-part series started on National Geographic on Sunday. It's an intriguingly unusual show, telling this true story in a form that owes a lot to the disjointed way we consume information and entertainment online. Like Nat Geo's other big show Mars, Valley of the Boom is half drama and half documentary -- actors act out scenes, interspersed with interviews in which the actual players from the time explain what's going on, what they were thinking and why we should care.
Think of it like The Big Short, with the actual people chiming in.
Lamorne Morris is our guide through the Valley of the Boom, exposing the 1990s tech boom and bust in Silicon Valley.
Ed Araquel
The show focuses on Netscape, the browser company that launched a Silicon Valley gold rush in 1995 with a massive IPO. A ""bland strip mall"" in California became the wild west as everybody raced to get rich from this new World Wide Web thing -- even if they didn't have the first clue what it was.
Like Facebook movie The Social Network -- which gets a call-out here, natch -- Valley of the Boom gets a few laughs out of how wrong, wrong, wrong many of these people were. In the show's second strand, focusing on early social network and Facebook precursor The Globe, we see visionary geeks stymied by clueless suits who can't figure out how to make money from this thing.
And in the third strand, we meet the guys who took advantage of this cluelessness. As Silicon Valley's sports car dealerships found themselves flogging Ferraris faster than they could get 'em on the lot, the sharks circled. One such shark was Michael Fenne, a colorful huckster and criminal who made astronomical promises in the early days of video streaming.
It's easy to see why Valley of the Boom focuses on Fenne, as he brings a touch of madness the drier storylines can't match. Steve Zahn does a lot of heavy lifting in bringing Valley of the Boom to life with the antics of a paunchy, bottle-blonde huckster who was somehow irresistible to investors.

Bettina Strauss
The other standout is John Karna, playing Netscape's ""messiah of technology"" Marc Andreesen. He's the Zuckerberg-style nerd who's depicted as something between a bit anti-social and a total sociopath.
So those are the actors playing the characters. Then in between each scene we see talking heads like Arianna Huffington, a co-producer of the show, explaining what's going on. That's the documentary bit. 
On the plus side, Valley of the Boom is slightly different from Mars, which puts documentary interviews awkwardly next to scenes of outright fantasy. On the other hand, Valley of the Boom goes further in blurring the line between fact and fantasy. So when the real Marc Andreesson refuses to appear in the show, the actor playing him simply turns to the camera and starts doing a documentary talking head as well as acting in the dramatic scenes.
The fourth wall gets completely demolished by Lamorne Morris from New Girl. He's a fictional investment banker compositing all the chequebook-wielding suits that descended on Silicon Valley, but he's also our narrator for increasingly wild sequences like an interpretative dance, a rap battle and a Bit Gates puppet that dramatise various real events.
If you buy into it, this outrageous blending of fact and fantasy is pretty fun. It's like The Big Short's fourth wall-breaking asides gone nuts. And it actually suits the subject matter: This is storytelling shaped by the information age. It's like pausing a movie to Google whether what you just saw actually happened. It's like an online article peppered with YouTube videos. It's TV with hyperlinks.
Goofy fun as it is, the blurring of drama and documentary does go a bit far. The fantasy sequences, like a spate of violent assassinations representing Microsoft targeting Netscape, feel like they're trying too hard. But the bigger problem is keeping track of it all. The real Marc Andreeson isn't there, so you only have to remember the actor guy's face. But the real James Barksdale -- Netscape's CEO -- is on the show, which means you have to remember he's the guy who matches with Bradley Whitford, the actor playing a fictionalised version of him. Then Whitford turns to the camera and breaks the fourth wall, which means you have the real Barksdale talking to us and the fake Barksdale.
This happens with a few of the characters, which means that for each of the many, many white guys -- and it is mostly white guys --  you have to remember two faces instead of one.
Still, it has to be said, this is no harder to follow than heavyweight business-focused dramas like The Social Network, Billions or Succession. There are times I'd beg for one of those show's cast to turn to the camera and explain what the heck's going on.
You'll probably know pretty quickly whether you like Valley of the Boom's storytelling style. It's certainly a novel way to add spark to a potentially dry story, using the multilayered multimedia hyperactivity of online storytelling to delve into the history of the connected world we take for granted.
And if you don't like it, you can just go back to Facebook or Netflix.

SHERI FINK,"Gary Watts, the coroner of Richland County, S.C., said it was his impression that the state wants it to be directly related, like someone gets hit by a fallen tree and someones vehicle runs off the road and they drown. And so he did not relate Hurricane Florence to several deaths of evacuees from hospices or hospitals where, he said, it was just a matter of the stress, I believe, the added stress probably hastening the deaths. In North Carolina, Dr. Carl Barr, the longtime medical examiner of Sampson County, had a similar understanding of the kinds of deaths his state wanted on the official list. When Dr. Barr discussed several deaths, including a suicide, with an associate chief medical examiner, he came away believing that by the C.D.C. definition these were hurricane-related, but by our own state medical examiner definition, they were not related to the hurricane. The state official, Dr. Craig Nelson, said that was incorrect. He said North Carolina was attempting to apply the C.D.C. guidance, particularly by considering a wider range of indirect deaths, like the worsening of a chronic illness, in the official count. Now the C.D.C. guidelines say those deaths should be considered disaster-related, Dr. Nelson said, adding that the Florence count was still ongoing. There is always potential for additional information to come in. But only on Tuesday, after being contacted by a reporter, did Dr. Nelson send the C.D.C. guide to the states medical examiners, part of a note urging them to report deaths that might result from Hurricane Michael. These notifications are critical in tracking storm-related deaths, and no statewide system exists to track them otherwise, he wrote. A spreadsheet of Hurricane Florence-related deaths provided by North Carolinas health department listed only one of 41 deaths from that storm as indirect. In an interview on Tuesday, Dr. Nelson was unaware that a crucial aspect of the C.D.C. guidance is to make note of the storm on the death certificate, even if it is only a contributor to a natural death. That has not been something we have done for the death certificates, Dr. Nelson said. He added that it was unnecessary, because even if death certificates did not mention the disaster, the deaths could still be included in the official state count. It has been better to try and maintain a central database of deaths related to the storm rather than rely on individual reporting on death certificates, he said.","Rainfall from Hurricane Florence flooded neighborhoods in Burgaw, N.C.

INYOUNG KANG,"Jerry Reinsdorf, a Brooklyn native who owns the Chicago White Sox, said that losing the Dodgers broke his heart. “I’m still ticked,” Mr. Reinsdorf said recently. “There’s no way that an iconic franchise should have been allowed to move.” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont also invoked a similar pain recently, saying fans had no concept that the team did not belong to Brooklyn. “It was a disaster. Walter O’Malley, his name remains in infamy,” he said of the owner of the Dodgers at the time. Some have tried to shift blame from O’Malley because of his battle with New York over a new stadium.

"Ben Geman, Axios","""The slowdown in China and turmoil in stock and currency markets appears to be making investors nervous, including in oil markets,"" Reuters notes. 
Where it stands: China is the world's largest oil importer, and this report comes on the heels of data showing a slowdown in manufacturing. 
But, but, but: Prices are rising this morning after declining in the pre-dawn hours. WTI crude is trading at around $47.33 and Brent moved up to $56 as we sent this newsletter. 
The big question: One thing to watch is whether the OPEC efforts can overcome worries about the global economy. 
 ""We really do need a sustained effort from some of the OPEC producers to take supply out of the market in order for prices to recover,"" Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel tells Bloomberg. ""Now we're starting to see that."" 
Threat level: Another factor that could influence oil markets are signs that President Trump is picking up where he left off last year — pressuring OPEC to keep prices low, even though Saudi Arabia and other petro-states want higher returns. 
 During yesterday's cabinet meeting, Trump claimed credit for the steep decline in prices since early October. 
 ""I called up certain people and I said, let that damn oil and gasoline, you let it flow — the oil,"" Trump said (h/t to Vox's Aaron Rupar and Bloomberg's Javier Blas for flagging). 
Side note: Trump is still inaccurately conflating Brent and WTI prices, noting prices went from over $80 a few months ago to the mid-$40s now, but the former is Brent and the latter is WTI. 
Be smart: A note from the Rapidan Energy Group flags Trump's penchant for verbal and Twitter remarks toward OPEC as something to watch in oil markets, alongside the possibility that he could back ""NOPEC"" legislation to go after the cartel using U.S. antitrust laws. The note states: 
 Trump's shift in policy and rhetoric, from preventing oil price spikes to pursuing low pump prices (which he views as an extra 'tax cut'), constitutes an important and related development that will induce OPEC+ producers to accept lower prices than they would otherwise prefer — closer to $60 average Brent than $70 or higher. 
What's next: The Energy Information Administration will release its latest data on domestic oil stockpiles late this morning.","Apple's surprise sales warning is being driven by forces that could end up hurting the oil market.

Heather R. Morgan,"""It's the most improbable upside-down Hollywood success story."" So says actor and author Greg Sestero about making 2003's The Room and the events that followed the film's release. To recap the basics, Sestero starred in The Room alongside the film's director and producer, Tommy Wiseau. The film was initially panned by critics, who labeled it one of the worst movies of all time, but went on to gain true cult status. Sestero, meanwhile, went on to write The Disaster Artist, a non-fiction book that chronicled the bizarre and often challenging experience of making of The Room. A film version was made in 2017, which was directed by James Franco and produced by Franco and Seth Rogen, amongst others. And it seems that, in terms of lessons on life and work, this upside-down success story is the gift that keeps giving. Sestero's entire experience--from the early days of writing the script for The Room all the way up to working on The Disaster Artist film with Franco and Rogen--has informed quite a lot on his overall outlook. That includes not just his profession, but also his approach to collaboration and even his view of the original 2003 film. I had the chance to talk with him recently and took away a few lessons of my own. Here are three of my favorite things we can all learn about work (and life) from Sestero: 1. Be willing to change your views about a product or person. ""There's actually some very serious, genuine inspiration that went into the movie,"" Sestero says of The Room and Wiseau. But he didn't always think so. In fact, it's well documented that Sestero assumed the film would go straight to video, and during our conversation, he even admitted he ""did not see it as a good film."" Obviously, that view didn't stick, or he would have never gone on to write The Disaster Artist. ""At the end of the day, a lot of people laughed at the movie. [I started] to see there was something there. I just needed time to grow up and understand."" Not everyone can or will admit as much; there are people who go their entire lives without ever being able to admit when they've been mistaken. Don't become one of those people. If Sestero's story is an example, unexpected and amazing things can happen once you become willing to change your view about a situation, person, or even a product. That applies to software companies as much as it does to films. 2. Understand and practice true collaboration. ""Collaboration"" is a word that's thrown around a lot these days, but many view it as either a piece of software or the chance to tell everyone else on the team what to do. When Sestero and I spoke, he was quick to praise the film set for Disaster Artist as a place where collaboration was prized and the spirit of ""give and take"" was strong. ""The film set was run so well. Everyone was having a great time, but they were working really hard and contributing,"" Sestero notes, adding that Franco, Rogen, and the other producers ""gave everyone a chance to say their piece and try something."" Whether you're in the office, online, or even on the road, that approach to working with others almost always produces productive environments and superior results. Consider whether you currently let others on your team ""say their piece,"" and if your answer ends up being ""not enough,"" make it a goal to practice that more. 3. Don't be afraid to consult the past. Unless you're a history professor, you've probably been told multiple times over your career to keep your eyes on the future and forget the past. But had Sestero done that with The Room --and no one would have blamed him for doing so--he would have never been compelled to show the world a different side of the story through his book, which in turn would never have been made into the critically acclaimed film. ""It was not an easy story to tell,"" Sestero told me. ""For me, [ The Disaster Artist ] was a chance to take that [story] in my hands and try to turn it into something that was redeeming and something that was really great."" How might that apply in a business or sales settings? We're all too familiar with products that flop, deals that don't go through, and even emails that wind up getting ridiculed on Twitter. For most of us, the gut reaction is to move on and put up a big mental block between you and the so-called failure. Resist that urge by taking a cue from Sestero: mine your past mistakes, because there will always be lessons to uncover and redeeming details to focus on. And you never know where those might lead. These days, Sestero is busy getting ready for the release of his new film, Best Friends. In addition to writing and producing the film, he also stars in it alongside Wiseau. For him, the film is partially about being able to give his friend and colleague a chance to branch out from playing a caricature of himself and play a role he truly fits. Sestero's other inspiration these days is simply work itself, and bringing stories about people to life. He sums it up in a way that could be relevant to just about anyone, and is one more lesson for life and career: ""It's about just getting centered and grounded, and going back to what initially inspired you in the first place. It's to just work."" Best Friends is out at on March 30th in select theaters and then more widely released at the beginning of April. Have your own lessons about life, work, or both? I'd love to hear about them in the comments!","Every bad experience holds several redeeming moments, according to the man behind  The Disaster Artist",2018-03-27T09:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","What the ""Worst Movie Ever"" Can Teach Us About Life, Work, and Business, According to Greg Sestero",https://www.inc.com/heather-r-morgan/what-worst-movie-ever-can-teach-us-about-life-work-business-according-to-greg-sestero.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_926799410_2000133320009280135_350850.jpg,,Inc.com,1
Stansberry Churchouse Research,"A man walks outside a property agency featuring posters of the latest high-rise apartment buildings in Hong Kong February 13, 2015. Tyrone Siu/Reuters The world's biggest real estate market is slowing down. And it's not because of failing subprime mortgages or an economic crisis. China's property market - worth seven times that of the U.S., based on total value of new homes sold - is weakening… again. China's new home sales hit US$1.69 trillion last year, as an estimated 22 million Chinese moved from rural areas into cities (that's like the entire populations of the U.S. states of Kentucky, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina and Kansas moving to the city). A total of 1.44 billion square meters of apartments and condominiums were sold - the equivalent of 5.76 million new homes, assuming the size of an average American suburban house (last year, 614,000 new homes were sold in the U.S.). But a couple of years of breakneck growth has caused the average price of developed property (i.e., condominiums and residential apartments) in China to jump 18 percent since July 2015. In the biggest cities of Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai, prices increased more than 50 percent. Stansberry Chruchouse Adding fuel to soaring real estate prices are Chinese investors speculating for short-term gain, considering property prices in most cities are rising at least twice as fast as the 5.5 percent average mortgage rate. Buyers now need to show a pile of cash upfront To curb speculation, the government started raising the requirements to purchase property in March 2017. It increased the minimum down payment on second home purchases in second- and third-tier cities from 20 percent to 30 percent. That compares to a typical second-home buyer in the U.S., who is required to put up between 10 percent and 20 percent as down payment. What's more, the Chinese government also ordered state-owned banks to raise the minimum down payment for privately-developed residential projects in first-tier cities from 70 percent to 80 percent. That essentially locked out all smaller buyers in many cities, including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing. The next stage of tightening happened in September 2017, when local governments in a number of cities, including Shenzhen, banned investors from selling newly purchased homes for up to five years. Other local governments barred investors from buying a second home for up to three years. So after growing by 16.1 percent in the first half of 2017, home sales growth in China slowed to just 3.3 percent in the first half of 2018. The Chinese government's year-long crusade to deflate the property market finally filtered through to developers' sales. As a result, the shares of listed Chinese real estate developers have fallen. The MSCI China Real Estate Index, which captures the performance of large and mid-cap segments of the China real estate market declined by 14 percent between May 1 and July 31. That compares with a 5.8 percent decline in the MSCI China Index and a 2.7 percent gain in the MSCI All Country World Index. But is this a precursor to a Chinese real estate market collapse? History shows us that it's likely not. We've seen this same knee-jerk reaction in Chinese real estate company stock prices in the face of Beijing's previous efforts to deflate the hot property market. China's history can be a roadmap to profits In September 2010, for instance, Beijing enacted measures to curb speculation in real estate after prices jumped 32 percent in just two years (2008 to 2010) to 4,725 yuan per square meter. Stansberry Churchouse That eventually led to a 30 percent decline in the MSCI China Real Estate Index by the following year, as curbs filtered through to developers' bottom lines. (That also opened up a terrific buying opportunity in shares of Country Garden Holdings (Exchange: New York; ticker: CTRYF; Exchange: Hong Kong; ticker: 2007), one of China's biggest and most established real estate developers, which I recommended to my readers in February 2011. It went on to nearly double their money (95 percent), as government curbs were eventually lifted and eager buyers returned to the market.) Then, in March 2013, after average property prices rose 17 percent to 5,850 yuan per square meter in a just a couple of years, Beijing stepped in again, slapping a 20 percent tax on selling a home (vs. existing 1 percent to 3 percent capital gains taxes). Beijing also increased the required minimum down payment from 60 percent to 70 percent for second homes. That resulted in a 20 percent correction in the MSCI China Real Estate Index over the next 12 months, and caused total property sales to fall nearly 3 percent between 2013 and 2015. With average real estate prices in China again up 18 percent in just the last couple of years, Beijing's recent determined moves to rein in the property market shouldn't come as a surprise. We actually welcome it. Will the Chinese real estate selloff continue? For the short-term, the outlook is going to be weak. The government has not given any indication that it's willing to ease restrictions on new home purchases, and will likely add more restrictions in the coming weeks and months. But I've been covering the Chinese real estate market since 2003, and the volatility we're seeing today is nothing new. With 600 million Chinese (40 percent of the country's population) still living in rural areas, and 22 million of them moving into cities each year, the property market in China is still far from reaching a point of peak demand. Down the road, I expect there will be a slew of profitable, well-managed and under-leveraged Chinese property developers that will once again offer up enticing value.","Tyrone Siu/Reuters The real estate market in China, which is the largest in the world, is slowing down.

Reuters,"ABUJA (Reuters) - One hundred and ten girls are missing after an attack on a school in northeast Nigeria by suspected Boko Haram insurgents, the information ministry said on Sunday, in what may be one of the largest abductions since the Chibok kidnappings of 2014. The Islamist militant group attained international notoriety after abducting more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok. That case drew global attention to the insurgency and spawned high profile social media campaign Bring Back Our Girls. Boko Haram, whose name translates as “Western education is forbidden” in the Hausa language widely spoken in northern Nigeria, has killed more than 20,000 people and forced two million to flee their homes in a violent insurgency that began in 2009. President Muhammadu Buhari, the 75-year-old former military ruler elected in 2015 after vowing to crush Boko Haram, has described the disappearance of the girls after Monday’s attack in the town of Dapchi, Yobe state, as a “national disaster”. The insurgents drove into the town of Dapchi on Monday and attacked the girls’ school, sending hundreds of students fleeing. Some of the attackers were camouflaged, with witnesses stating that a number of students thought they were soldiers. “The federal government has confirmed that 110 students of the Government Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State, are so far unaccounted for, after insurgents believed to be from a faction of Boko Haram invaded their school on Monday,” the information ministry said in a statement. There had been confusion over the number of those missing, with estimates ranging from about 50 to more than 100. State police, Yobe government and others had given different figures while a parent representing families of girls who disappeared on Friday told Reuters 105 were missing. Yobe state government added to the confusion when it said on Wednesday that dozens of the girls had been rescued, only to issue a statement the next day saying the schoolgirls were mostly still unaccounted for, sparking anger among locals. The Nigerian Air Force on Sunday said the chief of air staff had “directed the immediate deployment of additional air assets and Nigerian Air Force personnel to the northeast with the sole mission of conducting day and night searches for the missing girls”. “The renewed efforts at locating the girls are being conducted in close liaison with other surface security forces.” Information Minister Lai Mohammed, who was part of a delegation of ministers who met parents and teachers in Dapchi and announced the number of missing girls, also said police and security officials had been deployed to schools in the state.

Leo Lei,"Denqul is a minimalist emergency mobile battery designed by Tokyo-based studio Nendo for Sugita Ace. The battery was designed specifically for disaster-use, and can be charged via a manual hand generator built directly into the device. The designers wanted to create a powerbank that could be used both at home and on-the-go. In especially difficult situations, securing power for a smartphone could mean having access to basics such as communication, news, and lighting. The unit also comes with a container that allows for storage of basic everyday items such as glasses and stationary. To activate the hand generator, the stick can be pulled out to double its size and bend to an L shape. The user can then swing the device with one hand to generate power using centrifugal force.

Associated Press,"(MANILA, Philippines) — The Philippines’ most active volcano spewed fountains of lava and massive ash plumes overnight and Tuesday morning after authorities warned a violent eruption may be imminent. Lava fountains reached up to 700 meters (2,300 feet) above Mount Mayon’s crater and ash plumes rose up to 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) during the night and before daybreak, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. An explosive eruption Monday was the most powerful since the volcano started acting up more than a week ago. Disaster officials in Albay province, where Mayon lies, say more than 30,000 people are staying in evacuation centers. Officials raised Mayon’s alert level to four on a scale of five, meaning a violent eruption is possible within hours or days. The danger zone expanded to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater, affecting thousands more residents. The eruptions have shrouded nearby villages in darkness and sent lava, rocks and debris cascading down Mayon’s slopes toward the no-entry danger zone. There have no reports of deaths and injuries. Airplanes have been ordered to stay away from the crater and ash-laden winds and several flights have been canceled. Volcanic ash fell in about a dozen towns in coconut-growing Albay province and nearby Camarines Sur province, with visibility being heavily obscured in a few towns because of the thick gray ash fall, Jukes Nunez, an Albay provincial disaster response officer, said by telephone. “It was like night time at noon, there was zero visibility in some areas because the ash fall was so thick,” Nunez said. More than 30,000 ash masks and about 5,000 sacks of rice, along with medicine, water and other supplies, were being sent to evacuation centers, Office of Civil Defense regional director Claudio Yucot said. Mayon lies about 340 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Manila. With its near-perfect cone, it is popular with climbers and tourists but has erupted about 50 times in the last 500 years, sometimes violently. In 2013, an ash eruption killed five climbers who had ventured near the summit despite warnings. Its most destructive eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and buried the town of Cagsawa in volcanic mud. The belfry of Cagsawa’s stone church still juts from the ground in an eerie reminder of Mayon’s fury. The Philippines lies in the “Ring of Fire,” a line of seismic faults surrounding the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing about 800 people.","Disaster officials in Albay province, where Mayon lies, say more than 30,000 people are staying in evacuation centers",2018-01-23T02:24:06Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The Philippines’ Most Active Volcano Is Spewing Fountains of Lava and Massive Ash Plumes,http://time.com/5113723/philippines-mount-mayon-volcano-erupts/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/philippines-volcano_wong.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Andrew O'Reilly,"President Trump on Thursday continued his attack on Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, calling the court in California a “total disaster” with a “horrible reputation.” “Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster,” Trump tweeted. “It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, &amp; is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security...” While Trump was correct that 79 percent of the Ninth Circuit Court’s ruling that the Supreme Court heard were overturned – at least between 2010 and 2015 – its reversal rate is not the absolute highest in the country. That title would go to Sixth Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010 and 2015. The president’s tweet on Thanksgiving morning is just the latest in a series of social media postings slamming the Ninth Circuit Court after U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar issued a temporary restraining order late Monday against Trump's plan to refuse asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally if they do not arrive at a port of entry. Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Trump called the court a ""disgrace"" and referred to Tigar as an “Obama judge,” which lead Chief Justice Roberts to issue a strong, and rare, rebuke of the president. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” Roberts said in a Wednesday statement provided to Fox News. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."" Roberts added: “That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.” Roberts, along with several other justices, have publicly promoted the idea of an independent judiciary—free from partisan political attacks—in speeches and remarks since the Kavanaugh confirmation. Roberts himself reiterated the idea in a speech in Minnesota last month, saying the court preserves its independence “to the best of our abilities, whether times are calm or contentious.” In a 2014 speech, he noted that ""partisan rancor"" in Congress ""impedes their ability to carry out their functions."" ""I don't want this to spill over and affect us,"" he added. ""That's not the way we do business."" Roberts’ statement on Wednesday led to an almost immediate response from Trump over social media. “Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have ‘Obama judges,’ and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,” Trump tweeted. “It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an ‘independent judiciary,’ but if it is why are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned,” Trump continued in another tweet. “Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!” Fox News Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Fox News Trump continues war of words with Chief Justice Roberts; calls 9th Circuit Court a 'total disaster' Fox News President Trump on Thursday continued his attack on Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, calling …",2018-11-22T14:53:32Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Trump continues war of words with Chief Justice Roberts; calls 9th Circuit Court a 'total disaster' - Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-continues-war-of-words-with-chief-justice-roberts-calls-9th-circuit-court-a-total-disaster,https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/11/22/694940094001_5970420716001_5970416001001-vs.jpg,fox-news,Fox News,1

ANDREW TAYLOR / AP,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s opposition to further disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico hardened on Tuesday as he told GOP allies at a Capitol Hill meeting that the U.S. island territory has gotten too much rebuilding money compared with mainland states like Florida and Texas.
Trump’s ardent opposition to additional Puerto Rico funding sets up a showdown with House Democrats, who insist that a $13 billion to $14 billion disaster aid package that’s a top priority for southern Republicans won’t advance without further aid for the island.
Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said Trump told Republicans at a closed-door luncheon on Tuesday that aid for Puerto Rico “is way out of proportion to what Texas and Florida and others have gotten.”
Trump does support $600 million to deal with a food stamp shortfall in Puerto Rico that has already meant slashed benefits, Rubio said, but opposes more generous terms for delivery of disaster aid dollars and funding to rebuild antiquated water systems and make them more resilient to future storms.
The disaster aid package cleared a procedural hurdle by a 90-10 vote and is expected to pass the Senate as early as late this week, which would set up talks with the Democratic-controlled House. House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said the House will insist on further aid for Puerto Rico or the disaster aid measure won’t clear Congress.
“Nearly 3,000 American lives were lost in the historic storms that devastated Puerto Rico and destroyed its infrastructure, and the island is still struggling to recover,” Lowey said in a joint statement with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
The measure has wide support from both Democrats and Republicans and is ardently backed by Trump loyalists such as David Perdue, R-Ga., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., whose states were slammed by hurricanes last fall. The measure has been expanded so that Midwestern states such as Iowa and Nebraska that are currently suffering from flooding are eligible for disaster help.
“Just at the time when harvesting was starting, Hurricane Michael hit and crops were completely destroyed across most of our state,” Perdue said.
The House passed a companion $14.2 billion version of the legislation in January, but it got tangled up in the politics of the partial government shutdown and Trump’s demands for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The measure is especially sought by lawmakers from Southern states like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, which were hit by hurricanes Michael and Florence last year. There’s money to respond to an earthquake in Alaska, wildfires in California and floods in South Carolina and for the ongoing recovery effort in Puerto Rico, which was devastated by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.
The Trump administration has been slow to deliver the aid to Puerto Rico that Congress has already approved for the island.
“The lack of leadership and coordination, combined with delays in meeting the basic needs of the island, more than eighteen months after receiving a presidential disaster declaration, has left far too many children and elderly citizens in unhealthy and unsafe conditions, families in severely damaged homes, and communities without adequate infrastructure to sustain a decent quality of life,” Leahy and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a letter to the White House on Tuesday.

Reuters,"Journalists and National Guard soldiers watch as lava erupts in Leilani Estates during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., June 9, 2018. REUTERS/Terray Sylvester HONOLULU (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday approved federal emergency housing aid and other relief for victims of the six-week-old Kilauea Volcano eruption on Hawaii's Big Island, where hundreds of homes have been destroyed, state officials said. The approval came a day after Governor David Ige formally requested assistance for an estimated 2,800 residents who have lost their homes to lava flows or were forced from their dwellings under evacuation orders since Kilauea rumbled back to life on May 3. Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim has said that rivers of molten rock spewed from volcanic fissures at the foot of Kilauea have engulfed roughly 600 homes. The governor's office put the number of residences destroyed at 455. Either tally marks the greatest number of homes claimed over such a short period by Kilauea - or by any other volcano in Hawaii's modern history - far surpassing the 215 structures consumed by lava in an earlier eruption cycle that began in 1983 and continued nearly nonstop for three decades, experts say. The latest volcanic eruption also stands as the most destructive in the United States since at least the cataclysmic 1980 explosion of Mount St. Helens in Washington state that reduced hundreds of square miles to wasteland. The geographical footprint of Kilauea's current upheaval is much smaller, covering nearly 6,000 acres, or just over 9 square miles (2,400 hectares) of the Big Island in lava, an area roughly seven times Central Park in Manhattan. No specific sum of money was sought by the governor for federal disaster aid, and no dollar figure was attached to the package Trump approved under the Individuals and Households Program, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper reported this week that eligible homeowners and renters could get up to $34,000 each. The program provides grants to displaced residents to secure temporary housing while their homes are repaired or rebuilt. Assistance can also be obtained for repair and replacement costs. In addition to housing assistance, Trump approved relief from several other FEMA programs, including crisis counseling, unemployment benefits and legal aid. Trump previously issued a major disaster declaration weeks ago authorizing money from FEMA public assistance grants for the county of Hawaii, the island's local governing authority. His expansion of FEMA assistance came as the Kilauea eruption entered its 43rd day on Thursday. In addition to lava and toxic sulfur dioxide gas spewing from about two-dozen fissures on the eastern flank of the volcano, daily periodic explosions of ash from the crater at Kilauea's summit have created a nuisance and health hazard to communities downwind. Volcanic smog, or vog, carried aloft by the winds has hampered air quality for parts of the island and been detected as far away as the western Pacific island of Guam. The volcanic activity at Kilauea's summit has also triggered thousands of mostly small-scale earthquakes that have added to the jitters of residents living nearby and damaged facilities at the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the island's biggest attraction. Most of the park remains closed. A report from the governor accompanying his request for federal aid documented the larger toll taken on residents of the island's volcano-stricken Puna district, including disruption of power, communications and drinking water infrastructure. It cited an uptick in reports of residents ""experiencing acute mental health effects of fear, anxiety and stress"" as the crisis drags on with no end in sight. With about one-fifth of Puna's population displaced by the eruption, the disaster has created a ""housing crisis in a rental market that was already severely constrained,"" the report said. In other economic impacts, the report cited losses of nearly $37 million in vacation rentals and $14 million from agriculture, including half of the state's entire cut-flower industry and 80 percent of its papaya crop.",REUTERS/Terray Sylvester U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday approved federal emergency housing aid and other relief for victims of the six-week-old Kilauea Volcano eruption on Hawaii's Big Island.

Marcus Gilmer,"At 2:18 pm ET on Wednesday, cell phones across the country buzzed with a Presidential Alert emergency test from President Donald Trump. It was part of the first-ever national test of the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system, part of a pair of tests delivered by FEMA, that's been buzzing phones on a regional basis for years, alerting customers mostly to severe weather and Amber alerts. News of the test, which hit back in September, got some folks a little riled up because these alerts allow direct communication between the president and the nation in case of an emergency, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack. SEE ALSO: FEMA to test a new system that allows the president to send an alert to your phone While the alert was widely publicized, including by Trump himself, it still caught some by surprise, some were disappointed, and others weren't too thrilled. Whether it's to avoid giving Trump another megaphone or because, as one lawsuit claims, it's government over-reach in a post-Snowden world, there was plenty of skepticism over the alert. Results of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System year were mixed. Several of us with AT&amp;T either didnt get the alerts or got them much later.

Johnny LaDeadnik (@jlazebnik) October 3, 2018 But for all the hand-wringing about whether President Trump would abuse the system a la his hyper-active Twitter account, it seems there's actually very little to worry about here. Hi there, this alert is not a text message. It will look like messages you get for AMBER alerts &amp; weather. The Presidential Alert will only be used for national emergencies. The test is intended to assess the readiness of our nationwide alert systems. FEMA (@fema) October 1, 2018 For starters, there's also a law in place, The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015, that expressly forbids POTUS to use the system ""to transmit a message that does not relate to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety."" It's also highly unlikely that Trump won't be the one issuing the alert. FEMA notes these alerts are issued ""at the president's direction"" and will have to clear layers of protocol to be sent. Trump, after all, is infamous for his lack of computer use and there will be a far more complicated process for sending these alerts so as to avoid a repeat of the missile scare that hit Hawaii in January. It's also worth noting that these alert system pre-dates Trump: besides the aforementioned act being implemented under President Obama, the law that forbids customers from opting-out of Presidential alerts dates back to 2006 during the George W. Bush administration. Still, it's one more way for Trump to invade our lives (for now) and you'd be forgiven for heaving a big sigh at the thought.","At 2:18 pm ET on Wednesday, cell phones across the country buzzed with a Presidential Alert emergency test from President Donald Trump.

Evan Vucci/AP President Donald Trump's fight with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau not only threatens to unravel the US's relationship with one of its oldest international partners, but also could significantly damage the US economy. Following the G7 summit in Quebec, Canada, Trump and Trudeau engaged in a war of words over Trump's decision to hit Canadian steel and aluminum imports with sizeable tariffs. After Trudeau promised to hit back with retaliatory measures, Trump called Trudeau ""meek and mild,"" and one of Trump's top advisers said there is a ""special place in hell"" for Trudeau. The back-and-forth may represent mostly political posturing by the two leaders, but there could be very real economic consequences. The likelihood of a trade war between the US and Canada appears to be on the rise, and both sides are mulling more trade barriers. Canada is the US's largest trade partner, with $673.9 billion worth of goods and services going between the two countries in 2017. Also, contrary to Trump's attacks, the US maintained a $8.4 billion trade surplus with Canada last year, mostly due to a large advantage in services. According to US Census Bureau data, Canada was the top export destination for 32 states in 2016, by far the most of any country. So far in 2018, Canada is also the top export destination for US goods, with over $98 billion worth of goods going over the border.

Rick Callahan / AP,"(INDIANAPOLIS) — Fifty-three members of an Indiana family who lost nine relatives when a duck boat sank in Missouri described their pain and unfathomable loss Tuesday while calling for a ban on the amphibious tourist boats that their attorney likened to “coffins and death traps.” Each member of the extended Coleman family, including in-laws, introduced themselves and described who they had lost during a tear-filled news conference hours after their attorneys filed a second federal lawsuit against the owners and operators of the duck boat that capsized and sank during a storm July 19. The disaster on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri, killed 17 people, including nine of 11 Coleman family members who boarded the boat during a vacation trip. The other people killed were from Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri. The second suit was filed on behalf of the estates of Angela Coleman, 45, and Belinda Coleman, 69. The complaint, which seeks unspecified damages, echoes arguments made in a lawsuit filed Sunday seeking $100 million on behalf of the estates of 76-year-old Ervin Coleman and 2-year-old Maxwell Ly. Belinda Coleman’s sister, Lisa D. Berry, tearfully recalled each of the lost members of her family, saying that “everyone who lost their lives, they do have a face.” She said the family is united in their belief that duck boats are dangerous and that they should be banned so that no other family endures the grief she and her relatives now face. “The duck boat industry doesn’t seem to consider that lives are at stake, and it’s more than a ticket,” she said. “It’s people’s children, their moms, their dads, their grandparents and we just want them to be held accountable.” Both lawsuits name Ripley Entertainment Inc., Ride the Ducks International, Ride the Ducks of Branson, the Herschend Family Entertainment Corp., and Amphibious Vehicle Manufacturing. They allege that the owners and operators of the Ride the Ducks boat put profits over people’s safety when they decided to put the boat on a lake despite severe weather warnings and design problems. Ripley spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala-Potts said Tuesday that the company remains “deeply saddened” by the accident. She said the company would not comment further because a National Transportation Safety Board investigation is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney for the Indianapolis-area family, said additional lawsuits are expected on behalf of other members of the Coleman and Rose families who died. He said duck boats’ canopies trap people when the boats sink and the duck boat industry was warned about that hazard more than a decade and a half ago. “They are coffins and death traps and rather than doing anything about it they continued to just sell more tickets,” Mongeluzzi said. “And this family has paid for that ticket with precious life and blood, and enough is enough.” Mongeluzzi said that despite their call for a ban, the family supports legislation introduced Tuesday by Missouri U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill that would require that duck boats be better equipped to stay afloat or that canopies are removed to allow passengers to escape. McCaskill’s legislation would enshrine recommendations made by federal regulators after another duck boat sank in Arkansas in 1999, killing 13 people. The Indiana family’s suits allege that the companies ignored warnings from the National Transportation Safety Board in 2000 that the vehicles, which are designed to operate on land and water, should be upgraded to ensure they remain upright and floating in bad weather. The federal agency’s recommendation was issued after an Arkansas duck boat sank in 1999, killing 13 people. The two federal suits say that 42 deaths have been associated with duck boats since 1999. Kyrie Rose, a 41-year-old Coleman cousin, described during Tuesday’s news conference the fear, uncertainty and ultimate horror after she received a telephone call alerting her that the duck boat her relatives were on sank during a storm. “There’s nothing like getting a call that you wouldn’t expect to hear that there’s been an accident, and hoping and praying all day that somebody, anybody’s going to be OK,” she said.","The disaster on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri, killed 17 people",2018-08-01T02:30:39Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘Coffins and Death Traps.’ Relatives of Duck Boat Tragedy Victims Call for a Ban,http://time.com/5354727/duck-boat-family-lawsuit/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/800-15.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New tariffs that the United States is threatening to impose on nearly half the goods imported from China would have a small impact on the Asian nation’s economy and not lead to disaster, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday, as U.S. financial markets were set to open lower on the trade standoff. “It’s not something that’s going to be cataclysmic,” he said in an interview with Fox Business News, explaining that a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion of goods would only amount to $50 billion a year, equal to less than 1 percent of China’s economy. Ross said President Donald Trump “now feels that it’s potentially time to put more pressure on” China to “modify their behavior.” Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday that Trump directed the increase from a previously proposed 10 percent duty because China had refused to meet U.S. demands and had imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump’s threats of higher tariffs also weighed on China’s financial markets. But Wang Yi, the Chinese government’s top diplomat, said U.S. efforts to pressure China would be in vain, urging its trade policymakers to “calm down.” Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Bernadette Baum","New tariffs that the United States is threatening to impose on nearly half the goods imported from China would have a small impact on the Asian nation's economy and not lead to disaster, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday, as U.S. financial marke…",2018-08-02T12:43:57Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Possible new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods not 'cataclysmic': Commerce Secretary,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-commerce/possible-new-u-s-tariffs-on-chinese-goods-not-cataclysmic-commerce-secretary-idUSKBN1KN1RQ,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180802&t=2&i=1289462160&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE71119,reuters,Reuters,1

Adventure playgrounds arrived in Japan in the 1970s as a way of advocating for greater risk and free-play in the over-scheduled and regulation-restricted lives of urban children, according to Japans Metropolis Magazine. Setagaya Play Park was created by playwork volunteers after the Kobe earthquake in 1995. That was a bleak time for Japansome adults fought against the park and criticized the fact that kids were playing earthquake on the playground so soon after the disaster. But experts began to realize that pretend play was good for kids, especially after tragedy. Pediatric doctors began advocating play to help kids release stress and prevent PTSD. Today, there are several adventure playgrounds all over the countrycommunity members are invited to donate tools and scrap materials to the park so kids can create fortresses, pirate ships or whatever else they can imagine.
There are a growing number of adventure playgrounds in the U.S., too, from Berkeley to New York to Nebraska. Check one out if you can.

Serhii Plokhy,"In terms of direct deaths attributable to the accident, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster turned out to be anything but a highly destructive force. Whereas the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki claimed close to 200,000 immediate victims — more than 100,000 killed and the rest injured — the Chernobyl explosion caused 2 immediate deaths and 29 deaths from acute radiation sickness in the course of the next three months. Altogether, 237 people were airlifted from Chernobyl to Moscow and treated in the special clinic there. Out of these, 134 showed symptoms of acute radiation syndrome. It has been claimed that a total of 50 people died of acute radiation syndrome, and that 4,000 may die in the future of radiation-related causes. But the ultimate Chernobyl mortality toll, though difficult to estimate, may yet turn out to be significantly higher. Current estimates place it between the 4,000 deaths estimated by United Nations agencies in 2005 and the 90,000 suggested by Greenpeace International. In Ukraine, in the first five years after the disaster, cases of cancer among children increased by more than 90 percent. During the first twenty years after the accident, approximately 5,000 cases of thyroid cancer were registered in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus among those who were younger than eighteen at the time of the explosion. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 5,000 cancer deaths were related to the Chernobyl accident, but this figure is often challenged by independent experts. In Ukraine in 2005, 19,000 families were receiving government assistance owing to the loss of a breadwinner whose death was deemed to be related to the Chernobyl accident. Other consequences include genetic damage to people born after the disaster. Scientists are particularly concerned about cases of microsatellite instability (MSI), a condition that affects the ability of DNA to replicate and repair itself, which has been detected in children whose fathers were exposed to radiation after the accident. Similar changes were found earlier among children of Soviet soldiers who absorbed radiation during nuclear tests. The cost of the disaster was enormous, and all three East Slavic countries had to deal with it in one way or another. They adopted largely similar formulas, defining the most contaminated areas whose inhabitants were in need of resettlement or assistance and then establishing categories of citizens who were considered to have been most severely affected, making them eligible for financial compensation and privileged access to medical facilities. Altogether close to 7 million people would receive some form of compensation for the effects of the Chernobyl fallout. But the size of the groups eligible for subsidies and the amount of financial compensation differed in the three states, depending on the interplay of politics and economic circumstances. Russia’s oil and gas riches helped it deal with the post-Chernobyl crisis, while resource-poor Ukraine and Belarus had nothing comparable. Those two countries introduced a special Chernobyl tax in the early 1990s, amounting in Belarus to 18 percent of all wages paid in the nonagricultural sector. In general, however, the Belarusian government dealt with the enormous challenge by continuing the Soviet tradition of suppressing investigations of major disasters. Although Belarus was the post-Soviet country most affected by Chernobyl fall-out, its antinuclear movement never attained the proportions of its Ukrainian counterpart. Nor did the Belarusian Popular Front exercise influence comparable to that of the Ukrainian Rukh. The Belarusian parliament and government lacked the political will and, more importantly, the resources to admit the full scope of the disaster and deal effectively with its consequences. In 1993, the Belarusian parliament adopted laws reducing the levels of soil contamination considered dangerous for human habitation. Even then, with significantly less territory and population covered by social welfare laws, the government only managed to allocate less than 60 percent of the funds approved by legislators for Chernobyl-related programs. When it comes to Western assistance, Ukraine got most of the attention and resources, largely because it inherited the Chernobyl nuclear plant and its devastated Unit 4. The first priority identified by Ukraine as requiring Western help after the closure of the Chernobyl plant was the construction of a new shelter over the sarcophagus that had been hastily built to cover the damaged fourth reactor in the first months after the explosion. The Ukrainian government announced an international competition for the construction of the new shelter in 1992. In June 1997, the G-7 countries pledged $300 million toward the realization of the project, whose total cost was then estimated at $760 million. A special Chernobyl Shelter Fund was created at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to collect the rest of the funds. That turned out to be a major challenge. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter Originally, it was expected that the new shelter would be built by 2005. But it was not until 2007 that the French Novarka consortium, which included Vinci Construction Grands Projets and Bouygues Construction, won the contract to erect a 30,000-ton sliding steel arch, 110 meters in height and 165 meters in length, with a span of 257 meters, over the old sarcophagus. Construction of the arch, which had to endure for the next one hundred years, began in 2010; the deadline for completion, originally scheduled for 2005, was later postponed to 2012, and then to 2013, 2015, 2017, and, finally, 2018. Its cost has been estimated at 1.5 billion euros, with the total cost of the New Safe Confinement Project exceeding 3 billion euros. It took nine years after the fall of the USSR to close the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station and more than a quarter century to build a new shelter over the damaged reactor. The international community emerged victorious in the contest of security priorities. Relations between the two main actors in the post-Chernobyl drama, the Western funding agencies and the Ukrainian government, were not unlike those in a family with a teenager who promises not to behave dangerously if given an ever larger allowance. Some scholars referred to it as environmental blackmail. But the closure of the Chernobyl power plant and the construction of the new shelter is more than just a story of nuclear extortion of funds by a poor country from rich ones. More than anything else, it is a story of the clash between the demands of individual nations for economic development and the security of the world, as well as of the threat posed to the latter by the political and economic decline of the nuclear powers and the uncertain future of the post-imperial states. Moscow, the former capital of the empire responsible for the design and operation of the damaged reactor, all but retreated behind the borders of the Russian Federation, leaving it to Ukraine and the international community to clean up the mess. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 brought the fighting within 322 kilometers of the city of Enerhodar, the site of the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, which operates six reactors. The war also interrupted the nuclear cycle whereby Ukraine received its nuclear fuel from Russia and sent its spent fuel back there. In 2016, Ukraine began the construction of its own spent-fuel facility and declared plans to reduce its almost total dependence on Russian fuel by covering 40 percent of its needs with purchases from the U. S.-based Westinghouse Electric Company. While the war and the disruption of the traditional nuclear cycle brought new challenges to the struggling Ukrainian economy, the nuclear industry of the land of Chernobyl took another important step away from its Soviet legacy. What remained unchanged and impervious to remedy by any amount of internal mobilization or outside assistance were the long-term consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. While the actual impact of radiation exposure on the health of the population is still debated, there can be little doubt that the society as a whole was left traumatized for decades to come. Every sixth Ukrainian adult reports being in poor health, a significantly higher percentage than in neighboring countries, and those affected by the Chernobyl radiation have lower levels of employment and fewer working hours than the rest of Ukraine’s population. And then there is the environment. The new shelter over the damaged reactor No. 4 notwithstanding, the area around the nuclear plant will not be safe for human habitation for at least another 20,000 years. In April 2016, when the world marked the thirtieth anniversary of the disaster, there was a temptation to breathe a sigh of relief. The half-life of cesium-137, one of the most harmful nuclides released during the accident, is approximately thirty years. It is the longest “living” isotope of cesium that can affect the human body through external exposure and ingestion. Other deadly isotopes present in the disaster have long passed their half-life stages: iodine-131 after eight days, and cesium-134 after two years. Cesium-137 is the last of that deadly trio of isotopes. But the harmful impact of the accident is still far from over. With tests revealing that the cesium-137 around Chernobyl is not decaying as quickly as predicted, scholars believe that the isotope will continue to harm the environment for at least 180 years—the time required for half the cesium to be eliminated from the affected areas by weathering and migration. Other radionuclides will perhaps remain in the region forever. The half-life of plutonium-239, traces of which were found as far away as Sweden, is 24,000 years. The world has already been overwhelmed by one Chernobyl and one exclusion zone. It cannot afford any more. It must learn its lessons from what happened in and around Chernobyl on April 26, 1986.

Associated Press,"(GUATEMALA CITY) — Authorities on Wednesday raised by more than 130 the number of people officially missing from last month’s deadly eruption of the Volcano of Fire. Guatemala’s disaster agency, known as Conred, said the new figure of 332, up from 197 previously, came following a review of nearly 200,000 records and verifying lists of people living in shelters. The disaster agency has confirmed at least 113 deaths from the June 3 eruption, which sent superheated flows raging through small villages. Eighty-five of those bodies have been identified. But an independent group known as Antigua to the Rescue, after the nearby city of the same name, said at a news conference that the death toll could be high as 2,900. Antigua to the Rescue said its figure was compiled through its own investigations and interviews with people in shelters, especially the inhabitants of the devastated village of San Miguel Los Lotes. Conred spokesman David de Leon said the agency was respectful of others’ comments about the disaster’s toll, but stood by its official count. “It is important to know the base or sources that served to determine the figure that was made public,” he said. More than 3,600 people remain in shelters run by local authorities and charities. Last week, Conred declared almost 200 communities surrounding the Volcano of Fire as uninhabitable or at high risk due to the threat of another eruption.

Associated Press,"(NAIROBI, Kenya) — Eight critically endangered black rhinos are dead in Kenya following an attempt to move them from the capital to a national park hundreds of kilometers away, the government said Friday, calling the toll “unprecedented” in more than a decade of such transfers. Preliminary investigations point to salt poisoning as the rhinos tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home, the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement. It suspended the ongoing move of other rhinos and said the surviving ones were being closely monitored. Losing the rhinos is “a complete disaster,” said prominent Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu of WildlifeDirect. Conservationists in Africa have been working hard to protect the black rhino sub-species from poachers targeting them for their horns to supply an illegal Asian market. In moving a group of 11 rhinos to the newly created Tsavo East National Park from Nairobi last month, the Kenya Wildlife Service said it hoped to boost the population there. The government agency has not said how the rhinos died. Fourteen of the animals were to be moved in all. “Disciplinary action will definitely be taken” if an investigation into the deaths indicates negligence by agency staff, the wildlife ministry said. Kenya is home to 80 percent of the black rhinos’ remaining global population, Kahumbu said. “Moving rhinos is complicated, akin to moving gold bullion, it requires extremely careful planning and security due to the value of these rare animals,” she said in a statement. “Rhino translocations also have major welfare considerations and I dread to think of the suffering that these poor animals endured before they died.” Transporting wildlife is a strategy used by conservationists to help build up, or even bring back, animal populations. In May, six black rhinos were moved from South Africa to Chad, restoring the species to the country in north-central Africa nearly half a century after it was wiped out there. Kenya transported 149 rhinos between 2005 and 2017 with eight deaths, the wildlife ministry said. According to WWF, black rhino populations declined dramatically in the 20th century, mostly at the hands of European hunters and settlers. Between 1960 and 1995 numbers dropped by 98 percent, to fewer than 2,500. Since then the species has rebounded, although it remains extremely threatened. In addition to poaching the animals also face habitat loss. African Parks, a Johannesburg-based conservation group, said earlier this year that there are fewer than 25,000 rhinos in the African wild, of which about 20 percent are black rhinos and the rest white rhinos. In another major setback for conservation, the last remaining male northern white rhino on the planet died in March in Kenya, leaving conservationists struggling to save that sub-species using in vitro fertilization.","Losing the rhinos is ""a complete disaster,"" said one prominent Kenyan conservationist",2018-07-13T14:10:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",8 Endangered Black Rhinos Just Died After a Botched Relocation Effort,http://time.com/5338114/black-rhinos-kenya/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/black-rhino-kenya.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Reuters Editorial,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - More than 100 bodies have been retrieved after a ferry sank on Lake Victoria, Tanzanian state radio reported on Friday, and hundreds more were still feared missing as rescuers searched for survivors from daybreak on the morning after the disaster. Radio TBC Taifa reported the latest toll from the sinking of the ferry MV Nyerere, which capsized on Thursday afternoon just a few meters from the dock on Ukerewe, the lake’s biggest island, which is part of Tanzania. Initial estimates suggested that the ferry was carrying more than 300 people. Thirty-seven people had been rescued from the sea, Jonathan Shana, the regional police commander for the port of Mwanza on the south coast of the lake told Reuters by phone on Friday. Shana said more rescuers had joined the operation when it resumed at daylight on Friday. He did not give exact numbers. The precise number of those aboard the ferry when it capsized was hard to establish since crew and equipment had been lost, officials said on Thursday. Tanzania has been hit by several major ferry disasters over the years. At least 500 people were killed when a ferry capsized in Lake Victoria in 1996.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp. The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off. The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. President Joko Widodo told reporters getting those people out was a priority. “The evacuation is not finished yet. There are many places where the evacuation couldn’t be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive,” Widodo said. “We’ll send as much food supplies as possible today with Hercules planes, directly from Jakarta,” he said, referring to C-130 military transport aircraft. The disaster agency said later more heavy equipment and personnel were needed to recover bodies. MASS GRAVE One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said. “We don’t know how many victims could be buried there, it’s estimated hundreds,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where workers were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified. However, nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. “It’s devastating,” she told Reuters by text. Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said a church in an area of Sigi district, south of Palu, had been engulfed in mud and debris. Officials said the area suffered liquefaction, when the shock of the quake temporarily destabilizes the soil. “My volunteers found 34 bodies... children who had been doing a bible camp,” Arriani said. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region. Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. THREATS OF VIOLENCE A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while residents streamed out. One aid worker spoke of threats of violence among survivors seeking fuel. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery. Military aircraft were taking people out of Palu and hundreds of people thronged its small airport as officers struggled to keep order. “I’d get a plane anywhere. I’ve been waiting for two days. Haven’t eaten, barely had a drink of water,” said 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid. Indonesia, which is on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday, and why more people in coastal areas had not moved to higher ground after a big quake, even in the absence of an official warning. Disaster agency spokesman Nugroho told reporters on Sunday none of Indonesia’s tsunami buoys, one device used to detect waves, had been operating since 2012. He blamed a lack of funds. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. However, officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. Indonesia had assured the International Monetary Fund and World Bank is could host their meeting on Bali island this month, government minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said in a statement. “We are always ready. We have showed them that Indonesia is able to deal with even the most difficult circumstances.” Additional reporting by Reuters stringer in PALU, Fergus Jensen, Fanny Potkin, Tabita Diela, Agustinus Beo Da Costa, Gayatri Suroyo and Fransiska Nangoy in JAKARTA; Writing by Robert Birsel; Editing by Paul Tait and Nick Macfie","Indonesian authorities scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp.",2018-10-01T09:30:05Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Indonesian survivors desperate to flee disaster zone as death toll climbs,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-quake/indonesian-survivors-desperate-to-flee-disaster-zone-as-death-toll-climbs-idUSKCN1MB12Z,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181001&t=2&i=1310030972&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE901K7,reuters,Reuters,1
Liz Weston,"Mother Nature could be excused if she wondered, ""How much more prompting do you people need?"" This year delivered epic wildfires, devastating hurricanes, massive floods and some pretty horrific earthquakes. Yet many people still haven't taken a few critical steps to protect their financial lives from such disasters. Consider setting aside a few hours this week to take care of these four essential tasks: REVIEW (AND BOOST) YOUR INSURANCE Most renters don't have renters insurance, but they need it since their landlord's policy won't cover their stuff. The vast majority of homeowners do have homeowners insurance, but often not enough -- especially if their policies haven't been updated regularly to reflect rising construction costs or improvements. Ask your insurer to rerun the numbers to ensure you have enough coverage to rebuild your home completely. United Policyholders, an advocacy group for insurance customers, recommends adding as much ""extended replacement cost"" coverage as you can afford. This add-on boosts the policy's coverage limits by 20 percent to 100 percent if costs run unexpectedly high, as often happens in disaster zones when rebuilding costs soar. Another smart addition: ""building code upgrade"" or ""ordinance coverage"" to pay the higher costs of rebuilding to current standards. Other key points: --Homeowners insurance typically doesn't cover floods or earthquakes, so consider buying those policies if your home may be at risk. --You want "" replacement cost "" coverage for your home's contents, not ""actual cash value,"" which will pay only pennies on the dollar to replace your stuff. --You may need extra coverage if you have certain valuables, such as jewelry, collectibles, guns or computers and other home office equipment. Policies typically limit coverage to $1,500 to $2,500 for each of these categories. --Opt for generous ""loss of use"" or ""additional living expenses"" coverage, since that will pay your rent and other costs while your home is uninhabitable. United Policyholders recommends having at least two years' worth of additional living expense coverage. If you're concerned your coverage limits are too low and your insurer won't let you upgrade, shop around for a better provider. SCAN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS INTO THE CLOUD You may be away from home or not have time to grab your bug-out bag in your scramble out the door. Keeping documents or copies off site is one solution, but anything in your safe deposit box or lawyer's office could be compromised by the same disaster that wrecks your home, says financial planner Leonard Wright, who evacuated his family from their San Diego-area home during the 2007 wildfires. ""You want it out of the area,"" says Wright, a certified public accountant and personal financial specialist who contributed to a detailed disaster guide that the American Institute of CPAs created with the American Red Cross and National Endowment for Financial Education. Wright uses DropBox, a file sharing and storage site, for family pictures and Box, a similar site known for its security features, for financial documents. Other cloud services include Microsoft's OneDrive, Apple's iCloud and Google Drive. Documents can be scanned with mobile apps or desktop scanners, which typically cost $200 to $400. Disaster survivors say the following documents can be particularly important, according to United Policyholders: --Insurance policies --Passports and birth certificates --Family photos --Tax and loan documents --Stocks and bonds --Wills and trusts --Home blueprints or surveys, if you have them DO A QUICK HOME INVENTORY This can be as simple as walking around your home, inside and out, recording your stuff with your smartphone's video camera and storing that video in the cloud. Or you can use an app, such as Sortly, MyStuff2 or United Policyholders' UPHelp Home Inventory to photograph and itemize your possessions. ADD EMERGENCY ACCESS TO YOUR PASSWORDS Security experts recommend using a password manager to securely store unique, hard-to-remember logins for each account while only having to remember one master password. Password managers also can help a trusted person to take over for you if you die or become incapacitated -- but that person needs access to the account. Some password managers let you offer emergency access to others. Another option is to keep copies of your passwords, or your master password, with your estate planning documents. Services such as Everplans and Fidelity Investments' FidSafe offer online storage with secure sharing options. Finally, make a note on your calendar to do all this again next year so all your important documents are kept up to date. Investing a few hours each year can pay off in an easier recovery if disaster ever strikes, and peace of mind even if it doesn't. _______ This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.",Be prepared before a natural disaster strikes.,2017-11-10T22:23:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",4 Steps to 'Disaster-Proof' Your Business (and Finances),https://www.inc.com/associated-press/nerdwallet-how-to-disaster-proof-your-business.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_841052402_330140.jpg,,Inc.com,1
Tom McKay,"In mid-January, the Hawaiian state Emergency Management Agency sent out an erroneous text to all cell phones in the state warning of a “BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII,” sending many residents into an hour-long panic as they ran for cover from what they feared was a North Korean nuclear bomb. Though it first appeared that bad design in the EMA computer system which sent out the alert was to blame, federal investigators later said the alert was intentionally sent by a now-fired employee who mistook an ongoing drill for a real attack. The incident did massive damage to the credibility of the emergency alert system, and risked Hawaiians ignoring any potential future alarms sent out if North Korea or anyone else actually does launch a missile at the Aloha State. The EMA’s director has since resigned. So it’s perhaps not surprising that some legislators want to take the responsibility out of the hands of state governments entirely. Sens. Brian Schatz, Kamala Harris, and Cory Gardner have introduced bipartisan legislation titled the Authenticating Local Emergencies and Real Threats, which is intended to make the federal government the sole authority on the matter. Per a press release from Schatz’s office, the ALERT Act would “restrict the authority to alert the public of a missile threat to the federal government,” with only the Federal Emergency Management Agency allowed to send such alerts via its Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. The legislation also would “require FEMA to establish a process to promptly notify state authorities when a missile alert is issued so they can activate their own protective action plans to ensure public safety.” “States are laboratories of democracy,” Schatz quipped in the statement. “They should not be the laboratories of missile alerts. The people who know first should be the people who tell the rest of us. This legislation makes clear that the authority to send missile alerts rests with the federal government.” According to Hawaii Now, Schatz says U.S. Pacific Command currently has to liaise with the state government to send out an alert, while the legislation would allow it to send alerts directly through the Department of Defense. The interim director of the EMA, Brig. Gen. Moses Kaoiwi Jr., told Hawaii Now that he was open to considering the proposal. However, Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim told the station he was wary the federal government lacks “site specific information” necessary to coordinate a response to any potential disaster and that he hopes local governments would be allowed to send follow-up messages. FEMA has a mixed track record, however. It faced massive criticism for the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and most recently, the agency stands accused of bungling millions of dollars in contracts for disaster relief in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - The extent of the devastation caused by an earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi should become clearer on Tuesday, as rescuers push into remote areas that have been out of contact for more than three days. Officials fear the death toll will rise into the thousands. Indonesia has said it would accept offers of international aid, having shunned outside help earlier this year when an earthquake struck the island of Lombok. The number of confirmed deaths stood at 844 on Tuesday, most of them in Palu, the main city in the disaster zone, where rescuers were hunting for victims in the ruins. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of on rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed seven-storey Hotel Roa Roa. About 50 people were believed to have been trapped when the hotel was brought down by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as six metres (20 feet) that smashed into the city’s beachfront, about 2 km from the hotel. About 12 people have been recovered from the ruins of the hotel, three of them alive. Haryono pored over the hotel’s blueprints and building plans, searching for possible pockets and a way through to them. A faint smell of decomposition hung in the air. “We have to be very careful so we don’t risk hurting any survivors when we move the debris,” he said. Power has yet to be restored in the area and access by land to outlying villages has been disrupted by broken roads, landslides and downed bridges. Aftershocks have rattled jangled nerves. A 5.9 magnitude quake struck earlier on Tuesday near the southern island of Flores, hundreds of kilometres from Sulawesi, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There no immediate reports of casualties or damage. ‘DOUBLE DISASTER’ A particular horror in several areas in and around Palu was liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid. About 1,700 houses in one Palu neighbourhood were swallowed up, with hundreds of people believed buried, the national disaster agency said. There was also mounting concern over Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicentre, and two other districts - with a combined population of about 1.4 million. Initial reports from Red Cross rescuers who had reached the outskirts of Donggala district were chilling. “The situation in the affected areas is nightmarish,” Jan Gelfand, head of an the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) office in Jakarta said in a statement. “The city of Palu has been devastated and first reports out of Donggala indicate that it has also been hit extremely hard by the double disaster,” Gelfand said. Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of the stricken areas. Chief security minister Wiranto said on Monday the government was trying to meet survivors’ immediate needs and would accept offers of international help. “Right now, we need emergency aid,” Wiranto said, referring to the foreign aid that would be airlifted to Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s quake-damaged airport, but military aircraft took survivors out on Monday. About 3,000 people thronged the airport hoping to get on any flight and officers struggled to keep order. Wiranto said a navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time would also be deployed to help with the evacuation. He said the power utility was also working to restore electricity: “Without energy, everything is crippled.” Anger and desperation among traumatized residents of Palu appeared to be simmering, with some outbreaks of looting. “Stop hiding Mr Mayor,” was daubed on a wall in one part of Palu. Mayor Hidayat was unavailable for comment.

Reuters Editorial,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least 136 bodies have been retrieved after a ferry sank on Lake Victoria, Tanzania’s top police official Simon Sirro said on Friday, and scores more were still feared missing as rescuers searched for survivors on the morning after the disaster. The ferry MV Nyerere capsized on Thursday afternoon just a few meters from the dock on Ukerewe, the lake’s biggest island, which is part of Tanzania. Initial estimates suggested that the ferry was carrying more than 300 people. Thirty-seven people had been rescued from the sea, Jonathan Shana, the regional police commander for the port of Mwanza on the south coast of the lake told Reuters by phone on Friday. Shana said more rescuers had joined the operation when it resumed at daylight on Friday. He did not give exact numbers. The precise number of those aboard the ferry when it capsized was hard to establish since crew and equipment had been lost, officials said on Thursday. Tanzania has been hit by several major ferry disasters over the years. At least 500 people were killed when a ferry capsized in Lake Victoria in 1996. In 2012, 145 people died when a ferry sank off the shore of Tanzania’s Indian Ocean archipelago of Zanzibar.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered more rescuers to hunt for victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, saying on Tuesday everyone had to be found, as the scale of destruction became clearer. Some remote areas have been out of contact for more than three days and officials fear the confirmed death toll of 844 could soar into the thousands when losses in those areas are revealed. “The are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who’ve not yet been found,” Widodo told a government meeting to coordinate disaster recovery efforts. He said he had ordered the national search and rescue agency to send more police and soldiers into the affected districts, some cut off since Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami waves destroyed roads, triggered landslides and downed bridges. The Red Cross said the situation was “nightmarish” and reports from its workers venturing into one cut-off area, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter, indicated it had been hit “extremely hard”. Four badly hit districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. Most of the confirmed dead have been in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) that smashed into the city’s beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins and some neighborhoods were swallowed up by ground liquefaction. Among those killed in the area were 34 children at a Christian bible study camp, a Red Cross official said. More than 50 of the dead were taken to a mass grave on the outskirts of Palu on Tuesday, while rescuers held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed seven-storey Hotel Roa Roa. About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About 12 people have been recovered from the ruins, with one more body on Tuesday.

About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up, with hundreds of people believed buried, the national disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures show a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction. Elsewhere on the outskirts of Palu, trucks brought 54 bodies to a mass grave dug in sandy soil. Most of the bodies had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives turned up to pay respects to loved ones at the 50 meter (165 feet) trench, where the smell of decomposition was overpowering. “It’s OK if he’s buried in the mass grave, it’s better to have him buried fast,” said Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, whose husband was among those placed in the grave, before heading off to look for her missing daughter. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s quake-damaged airport but military aircraft took some survivors out on Monday, while about 3,000 people thronged the airport hoping for any flight out. A navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time was due to be deployed to help with the evacuation. The power company was working to restore electricity while the state oil firm had sent in fuel, officials said.

BRET STEPHENS,"“In best-selling books and powerful speeches, Vogt argued that affluence is not our greatest achievement but our biggest problem,” Mann writes. “Our prosperity is temporary, he said, because it is based on taking more from than earth than it can give. If we continue, the unavoidable result will be devastation on a global scale, perhaps including our extinction.” In our own day, people like Bill McKibben and Naomi Klein have made careers saying more or less the same thing. This is a world where the clock is permanently set at two minutes to midnight, and where only a radical transformation of modern society (usually combining dramatic changes in personal behavior along with a heavy dose of state intervention) can save us. Above all, the Vogtians say, we need less : less consumption, less stuff, fewer people, and so on. Borlaug and the Borlaugians take a different view. It’s not that they see environmental threats as bogus: The world really would have suffered catastrophic famines if Borlaug hadn’t developed high-yield, disease-resistant varieties of wheat. Oil is a finite resource, but whether reserves last 50 or 500 years will probably depend less on overall supply than on technologies to extract and use those reserves more efficiently. The same goes for climate change, which will not be helped by some centrally planned, Chinese-style “ Green Leap Forward,” but by a multitude of technological advances that in turn require a thriving capitalist economy to fund, develop, commercialize and make affordable. The foolish idea that capitalism is the enemy of the environment misses the point that environmentalism is itself a luxury that few poor countries can adequately afford. If you doubt this, contrast the air and water quality in New York City with that of any similar-sized city in the developing world. I fall in the Borlaugian camp. That’s worth noting because one of the more tedious criticisms by the environmental left is that people like me “don’t care about the environment.” But imputing bad faith, stupidity or greed is always a lousy argument. Even conservatives want their children to breathe. It also misses the point. As Mann notes, Borlaugians are environmentalists, too. They simply think the road to salvation lies not through making do with less, but rather through innovation and the conditions in which innovation tends to flourish, greater affluence and individual freedom most of all. There’s also this: So far, the Borlaugians have mostly been right. To the extent that starvation is a phenomenon of recent decades — as in places like North Korea and Venezuela — it is mainly the result of gross political mismanagement, not ecological disaster. Peak oil keeps being defeated by frackers and deepwater explorers. As my colleague Nick Kristof recently pointed out, by most metrics of human welfare, the world keeps getting better with every passing year. If environmental alarmists ever wonder why more people haven’t come around to their way of thinking, it isn’t because people like me occasionally voice doubts in newspaper op-eds. It’s because too many past predictions of imminent disaster didn’t come to pass. That isn’t because every alarm is false — many are all too real — but because our Promethean species has shown the will and the wizardry to master it, at least when it’s been given the means to do so.

Seth Godin,"Car factories are a bit of a miracle. They make a complex, expensive device, and they do it close to perfectly. People love their cars, and regularly buy new ones long before they need to. It’s a largely solved engineering problem. On the other hand, car dealerships are a disaster. No one likes them. They’re scammy, stressful and unpredictable. The difference comes down to management vs. leadership. Car factories are measured and managed. For a hundred years, stopwatches and spreadsheets have turned the process of making a car into a predictable, improvable system. Management is an act of authority and compliance, and in the controlled setting of a factory, it works. Car dealers might try to measure the easy metrics of output (how many sold) but they’ve consistently failed at managing the improvised human interactions that car salespeople engage in. It turns out that the few great car dealers are great because of leadership, not management. Leadership is engaged with voluntarily, an enrolled engagement around meaning and manners, not process and motion. Most of don’t work in a factory. Most of us aren’t trying to solve an engineering problem. On our best days, we are leaders, or we are led by humans worthy of our best selves. Leadership is difficult work, as far from a solvable engineering problem as we’ll encounter. It’s easier, though, if we realize that that’s what we’re doing. When you run your dealership like a factory, you’re not going to succeed, nor are you going to please your staff. This is what creates senseless and humanity-starved bureaucracies. The alternative: Hire the right people, walk away from those that aren’t on the journey. Gain enrollment. Model behaviors. Celebrate the right contributions. Develop a culture, a language, a way of being on the path. Commit to the journey. People like us do things like this. Raise the standards, repeat the process.","Car factories are a bit of a miracle.

Jesus Diaz,"A team of Harvard University researchers recently achieved a major breakthrough in robotics, engineering a tiny spider robot using tech that could one day work inside your body to repair tissues or destroy tumors. Their work could not only change medicine–by eliminating invasive surgeries–but could also impact everything from how industrial machines are maintained to how disaster victims are rescued. Until now, most advanced, small-scale robots followed a certain mold: They tend to be built at the centimeter scale and only have one degree of freedom, which means they can only perform one movement. Not so with this new ‘bot, developed by scientists at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Boston University. It’s built at the millimeter scale, and because it’s made out of flexible materials–easily moved by pneumatic and hydraulic power–the critter has an unprecedented 18 degrees of freedom. It’s smaller and more dexterous than any of its tiny robotic peers–a significant step towards robots can perform tasks inside the human body. [Photo: Wyss Institute at Harvard University] The engineers call the new technology MORPH, an acronym for Microfluidic Origami for Reconfigurable Pneumatic/Hydraulic, and using it to create a spider–or any other robotic critter–involves three different fabrication techniques. First, micro-lasers cut out 12 layers of material, which are glued together to create the body and arms of the spider. Second, soft lithography draws a complex network of microscopic channels inside those layers–these little “veins” move the spider as fluid or air are pumped through them. Finally, some parts of the ‘bot are hardened to make its basic shape permanent. According to Sheila Russo, co-author of the study, their little monster can alter its structure, move, and even change colors. It seemed appropriate to test it by creating a replica of the colorful, millimeter-sized Australian peacock spider. While the promise of their spider is huge, Boston University assistant professor and co-author Tommaso Ranzani says its current form isn’t designed for medical applications. It’s more of a way to showcase its abilities. “However, we believe soft robotic technologies have a great potential in overcoming current challenges in minimally invasive surgery,” he says over email. One day, they could be ideal candidates to “manipulate and interact with the most delicate tissues in the body,” such as veins, arteries, and even nerves, after being deployed from a conventional surgical tool. They could also administer drugs or do biopsies, as well. But Ranzani also believes similar microbots could be helpful in environmental settings, and could maintain industrial facilities and even assist in space exploration. “[The spider] robot is a first demonstration of the manufacturing capabilities that this process enables,” he says. “And we believe it will pave the way to a new generation of soft micro-robots that can exploit their small scale, and deformable and resilient bodies, to explore highly unstructured and complex environments for applications ranging from safe and delicate manipulation of tissues inside the human body to search and rescue.” Imagine a legion of robots cleaning a rocket engine and fixing micro-factures or looking for survivors inside a building destroyed by an earthquake and providing first aid–or even just doing a clean sweep to clear clogged arteries inside a human body.

Associated Press,"A volcano has erupted on the same central Indonesian island as the devastating earthquake last week. Mount Soputan in North Sulawesi province spewed ash 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) into the sky Wednesday morning. No evacuations were immediately ordered.

The volcanologist, Kasbani, told online news portal Tempo that a direct correlation has yet to be seen, however. Kasbani, who uses one name, also said Soputan had been increasing in activity since August.

JESSE GREEN,"Around that true story, Mr. Rosenfeld has woven the fictional parable of a heroin-addicted white mother ( Chloë Sevigny ) trying to keep her son and his best friend, who is black, from ending up on opposite sides of the violence. Or does she have other motives in mind? Scott Elliott directs for the New Group. Tickets: thenewgroup.org Video Once on This Island Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, the songwriting team behind monster hits like “Ragtime” and “Anastasia,” began their Broadway career together quite differently, with this delicate fable about love and prejudice in the Caribbean. Now, 27 years after “Once on This Island” opened in 1990, the show returns to Broadway in a joyfully diverse production by the director Michael Arden, who led a spectacular reimagining of “Spring Awakening” for Deaf West Theater in 2015. Newcomers Hailey Kilgore and Isaac Powell star as the doomed couple from different social classes, and a gender-fluid ensemble of gods and locals, including Alex Newell ( who played Unique Adams on “Glee”), helps tell the story. But the second look wouldn’t be worth it if the fundamentals weren’t sound; this is a lovely show with a score so touching that even its cut numbers (like “Come Down From the Tree” ) are standards.

His latest, at the Atlantic Theater Company, looks to be just as ambitious, even if it doesn’t have a place name in its title. “Describe the Night” is set in Russia and Eastern Europe over the course of 90 years, telling three stories of persecution, espionage and disaster. How the stories interlock across time and intersect with the love story at its heart is the challenge Mr. Joseph has set for himself. Also accepting this challenge, under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, are the exceptional cast members, including Danny Burstein, Tina Benko, Zach Grenier and Rebecca Naomi Jones.

Vanessa Romo,"President Donald Trump, pictured at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Thursday, continued to rail against the 9th Circuit Court Appeals. Susan Walsh/AP As of Thursday morning, President Trump was still ruminating on a rare upbraiding from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, continuing attacks against the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and calling it ""a complete &amp; total disaster."" ""It is out of control, has a horrible reputation,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. He insisted judges ""know nothing"" about security and safety issues along the border and alleged they are ""making our Country unsafe."" He also said ""there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death"" unless law enforcement can ""DO THEIR JOB."" Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, &amp; is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018....and Safety at the Border, or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe. Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB! If not there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death. We want the Constitution as written! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018 A few hours later during a televised teleconference with members of the military, Trump again bashed the San Francisco-based court. ""We get a lot of bad court decisions from the Ninth Circuit, which has become a big thorn in our side,"" he said. ""It's a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services, when they tell you how to protect your border. It's a disgrace."" Moments later he told reporters he has ""a lot of respect"" for the chief justice but added people interpreting the laws ""always give us a bad interpretation."" The Twitter missives and subsequent televised remarks picked up a thread that began on Wednesday following a ruling by U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar, who issued a temporary restraining order against Trump's asylum policy earlier this week saying the administration must consider all asylum claims regardless of where migrants enter the country. Tigar is not a judge on the 9th Circuit. He is a district court judge who sits in San Francisco. And as NPR reported: ""... the Ninth Circuit, which encompasses much of the western United States, has not yet been asked to rule on [Tigar's] decision. Tigar's decision is also temporary, lasting only until Dec. 19 when the judge is scheduled to hear arguments about whether the order should remain permanent. Displeased by the decision, the president called it a ""disgrace"" in an off-the-cuff news conference, adding, ""this was an Obama judge and I'll tell you what, it's not going to happen like this anymore."" That's when Roberts entered the fray. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,"" the chief justice said in a statement. ""What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."" The public chiding triggered a spate of tweets from Trump in which he addressed Roberts directly. """"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,"" he wrote. This is not the first time Roberts has commented on criticism from a sitting president but his statement on Wednesday is the most pointed response he has issued, Amy Howe, founder of the Supreme Court blog Howe on the Court, told NPR's Morning Edition. In this case, Roberts chose to tangle with Trump on the idea of partisan judges ""because he's frustrated and he was trying to send a message to the president that the judiciary is not your punching bag,"" Howe said. ""He's been trying to promote the idea that the judiciary, no matter what the president says, is an independent branch of the government."" she added. As for Roberts, despite an invitation from Trump to ""say what he wants"" on the subject, the chief justice refrained from re-engaging in the dispute thus far.","The president entered day two of a dispute with Chief Justice John Roberts and called the San Francisco-based court of appeals ""out of control"" and said it ""has a horrible reputation.""",2018-11-22T17:30:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Trump Resumes Spat With Roberts, Calls 9th Circuit 'A Complete & Total Disaster'",https://www.npr.org/2018/11/22/670248789/trump-resumes-spat-with-roberts-calls-9th-circuit-a-complete-total-disaster,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/11/22/ap_18326569521253_wide-a47898c1dd76e20d6e06141faa84d1fb180d31d1.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,1
THOMAS KAPLAN,"“All things that have bipartisan support in the Congress,” Ms. Pelosi said. Government funding is set to expire at the end of Friday, and the stopgap measure would provide more time for negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on overall spending levels for the 2018 fiscal year. After a deal is reached, the two parties can negotiate a long-term spending package. “The reality is that we’re running into a deadline this week, and this resolution is our best and only option at this time,” said Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. A government shutdown this weekend would be a potential disaster for Republicans as they race forward with their sweeping tax overhaul, which they hope to complete by Christmas. “This bill kicks the can down the road for two weeks just so Republicans can continue focusing on the greatest tax scam in history,” said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California. Given the calendar and the amount of time needed to finalize a broad spending package, another stopgap spending measure will be needed just before Christmas. Democrats made clear their unhappiness. “I’d really like to know what you expect to accomplish in the next two weeks when we haven’t been able to accomplish anything in the last two months,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.

The company introduced the Crisis Response Center a couple of months ago to provide useful information for victims – as well as help their friends and family check in on them. The donate button is the latest step towards providing relief for victims. The social media company will partner the nonprofit organization GlobalGiving, which works with partner organizations to find the best ways to distribute funds. This way, concerned Facebook users can throw money at a crisis page without having to choose a specific organization. Asha Sharma, Facebook’s Social Good Product Manager, said the company hopes this tool will connect enthusiastic donors with areas of greatest need: Following a disaster, people in the affected area often have tremendous needs to help them recover and rebuild, while others who aren’t affected want to help communities in any way they can. Our goal at Facebook is to create tools that make it easier for people to help their community and the communities they care about recover from a crisis. Facebook also pledges to waive all fees on donations made through the Crisis donate button – a welcome gesture.

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Photo With fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, California officials on Wednesday night sent out an alert to seven counties and at least eight million cellphones. Credit Kyle Grillot/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For the latest news on the wildfires, read our Thursday live updates here. From the desert along the Mexican border to the central California coast, a distance of more than 300 miles, cellphones squawked and shook all at once on Wednesday night, and displayed a simple, serious message. “Strong winds overnight creating extreme fire danger,” it said. “Stay alert. Listen to authorities.” The alert went to most smartphones across seven counties that are home to more than 22 million people — by far California’s largest use of a disaster warning system created by Congress and activated in 2012. “It is, for us, an unprecedented move,” said Kelly B. Huston, the deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services. The same alert system was not used in October, when fires swept through Napa and Sonoma Counties near San Francisco, destroying thousands of homes and killing dozens of people. Many survivors of those fires complained that they had little or no warning of the disaster. That experience was uppermost in the minds of state officials who decided to send the message at 8 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, Mr. Huston said, though he would not second-guess the decisions made two months earlier. Photo Smoke from the wine country fires hung in the air over Sonoma, Calif., in October. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times “We looked at the conditions that were present” in Southern California, he said, “and saw that they were eerily similar to the conditions just before the fires really blew up in Sonoma County. We had extraordinarily high winds, we had fire, and it was nighttime.” For generations, emergency alerts have been sent over television and radio broadcasts, but anyone who was not watching or listening at that time was left out. Many cities and counties now have systems that can ring every landline telephone with a recorded message, but people who are away from the phone may not hear the message right away, and landline use is declining. Local governments also send alerts through text messages or email — and they have made aggressive use of the systems during this year’s fire season — but they are sent only to people who sign up for the notices. The kind of warning that California officials sent on Wednesday, called a wireless emergency alert, is like a text message but uses a different system. The alert makes the phone vibrate with much more force than it ordinarily would, and makes it squawk loudly, alerting the user that the message is no ordinary one. All smartphones are automatically set by default to receive the messages, which are limited to 90 characters, though a user can alter the phone’s settings to turn them off. The alerts are most commonly used to send Amber Alerts about child abductions, but they are also sent to warn of disasters. Usually, the emergency alerts are sent by counties or cities, and Ventura County used the system this week before the state did. But the Office of Emergency Services, in consultation with Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, and the National Weather Service, decided that with fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, a consistent message was needed across a much wider region. The alert went to smartphones in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. Mr. Huston estimated that it was received on at least eight million phones. “I don’t think it’s possible to over-alert people,” under such serious conditions, he said. “It’s really simply ringing the bell to get people’s attention.” Continue reading the main story","With fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, California officials on Wednesday night sent out an alert to seven counties and at least eight million cellphones.",2017-12-07T22:16:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fire Alert Sent to Millions of Cellphones Was California’s Largest Warning Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/cellphone-alerts-california-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/08/us/08ALERTS/08ALERTS-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

George Dvorsky,"The cloud of radiation that swept through Europe in recent weeks originated at a nuclear facility in either Russia or Kazakhstan, according to a report put out France’s nuclear safety institute. The levels of radiation were never dangerous—at least for Europeans living outside of the immediate area affected—but the exact cause of the incident is still unknown. The report, issued Thursday by the IRSN (Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety), ruled out an accident at a nuclear reactor, saying the release of radioactive Ruthenium-106 likely originated from a nuclear fuel treatment site or a center for radioactive medicine. Ruthenium-106 is a radioactive nuclide that is a byproduct of splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor, and does not occur naturally. The accidental release of radiation happened during the last week of September, reports the French institute. The IRSN, along with several other European nuclear safety institutes, had been tracking the radioactive cloud over the past few weeks. Most European countries were affected, with radiation levels measured between 100 and 300 teraBecquerels (where one becquerel is the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second). By comparison, the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster produced a total of about 5.2 million teraBecquerels, and the 2011 Fukushima disaster churned out an estimated 900,000 teraBecquerels. “The concentration levels of Ruthenium-106 in the air that have been recorded in Europe and especially in France are of no consequence for human health and for the environment,” noted the IRSN in its report. That said, if the incident happened in France, authorities would have had to evacuate or shelter people from “a radius of the order of a few kilometres around the location of the release,” according to the IRSN. Based on weather patterns, the IRSN says the radiation originated south of the Ural mountains between the Urals and the Volga river. So it likely happened in either Russia or Kazakhstan. IRSN director Jean-Marc Peres told Reuters that “Russian authorities have said they are not aware of an accident on their territory,” adding that a spokesperson for the Russian emergencies ministry was not able to comment, and that the French institute hadn’t been able to reach authorities in Kazakhstan. In terms of a cause, Peres suspects an accident at a nuclear fuel treatment site (radiation can be released when nuclear fuel is reprocessed) or at a center for radioactive medicine (Ruthenium-106 has a short half-life of about a year, so it’s suitable for use in cancer therapy). The IRSN ruled out an accident at a nuclear reactor, saying it would have resulted in contamination with other detectable airborne substances. The crash of a ruthenium-powered satellite was also ruled out, as no satellite fell to Earth during this time. The IRSN said agricultural products in the regions around the point of radioactive release would likely have been affected by the incident, but that French citizens have nothing to worry about. “The possibility of exceeding maximum permitted levels near the accident site led IRSN to study the scenario of importing foodstuffs from this area,” it writes in its report. “From this analysis, IRSN considers, on the one hand, that the probability of a scenario that would see the importation into France of foodstuffs (especially mushrooms) contaminated by Ruthenium-106 near the source of the release is extremely low and, on the other hand, the potential health risk associated with this scenario is also very low. It does not therefore appear necessary to introduce systematic controls on the contamination of imported foods.” As to what happens next, the IRSN says it’s now up to Russian and Khazak authorities to figure it out. “We have come up with a plausible zone of where it could have come from; we can’t do any more,” Jean-Christophe Gariel, director for health at the IRSN, told The Guardian. “Russia is a vast country and we’re not aware of all the installations on its territory. The ball is now in the other camp.” Though on a vastly smaller scale, this incident is eerily reminiscent of the Chernobyl disaster, when Soviet authorities deliberately failed to acknowledge the meltdown to the world for two entire days. In terms of what’s happening here, it’s either a coverup by the facility responsible (or by government officials), or the offending party is completely oblivious to what has happened, the latter of which seems highly unlikely.

Bob Van Voris / Bloomberg,"Boeing Co. has been sued in what may be the first U.S. claim tied to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, which dove into the Java Sea after taking off from Jakarta Oct. 29. H. Irianto, the father of Dr. Rio Nanda Pratama, an Indonesian man who was among 189 killed in the disaster, sued Boeing on Wednesday in state court in Chicago, where the airline manufacturer is headquartered. Irianto claims a new flight-control system incorporated in the Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliner caused the crash. He’s seeking unspecified damages. Investigators believe an erroneous sensor prompted a computerized safety system to aggressively push the jet into a dive as pilots were trying to deal with multiple malfunctions. Boeing and U.S. aviation regulators are considering whether to add a software fix to the 737 Max. Three U.S. pilots’ unions have raised concern about what they say is a lack of information provided by Boeing on the safety system. Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers declined to comment on the lawsuit or the crash investigation, but reiterated an earlier statement that the company is “taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this incident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved.” He added, “We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX.” Southwest Airlines Co., the biggest operator of the 737 Max 8, replaced two malfunctioning flight-control sensors of the same type during the three weeks before the Lion Air craft, Wall Street Journal said, citing a summary of the U.S. carrier’s maintenance record it reviewed. Southwest pilots reported that they couldn’t engage throttle settings, it said. Southwest didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comments on the Journal report. Boeing said it provided two updates to operators around the world, re-emphasizing existing procedures for these situations. Safety remains its top priority, it said. The case is Irianto v.

TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Experts also worry that not enough attention is given to all the ways people have made the problem of wildfires worse. Population growth in California means there are more people on the roads — cars are a prime culprit in wildfires — and more homes built in wilderness areas. “It would be easy to throw our hands in the air and say it’s just climate change, and we can’t do anything about it,” said Jennifer K. Balch, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder and an expert on wildfires. “But actually we are starting the majority of wildfires, and we can do something about it.” Another factor, many experts say, are policies in California that protect forests from timber harvesting and a reluctance to set off controlled fires to burn vegetation. William Stewart, an expert on forestry at the University of California at Berkeley, said that part of the California dream was keeping “nature as it is,” with minimal management of forests.

Lion Air flight JT610, an almost new Boeing 737 MAX 8, was en route from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang, center of the Bangka-Belitung tin-mining region, on Monday when it crashed into the sea soon after take-off. “Bangka-Belitung has never suffered from a crash like this before,” said Krisna Wiryawan, head of the city’s tax office. Seven of his 92 employees were on the doomed flight. “We’re feeling deeply hurt,” said Wiryawan, speaking at his desk at the slightly shabby, red-tiled tax building, with rows of flowers carrying condolence messages lined up outside. Indonesian flags on government offices in Pangkal Pinang were at half-mast this week to honor the victims. The tax office suffered disproportionate losses since many of its workers commute from Jakarta, and Wiryawan himself said he often took that flight. Staff regularly used Lion or other budget airlines, rather than the national carrier, Garuda, for cost reasons, particularly if using personal expenses, said Wiryawan. According to data compiled by state insurer Jasa Raharja, out of 189 people on board flight JT610, at least 45 were residents of these islands of 1.4 million inhabitants that rely on mining, agriculture, fishing and a small tourism sector. Indonesia is the world’s biggest tin exporter thanks to the rich seams of ore in the Bangka-Belitung islands, though this has come at a price with unregulated mining scarring parts of the islands with a lunar landscape of craters. Still, the industry is a major employer and has drawn in workers from across Indonesia to the islands, off the east coast of Sumatra island, about half way between Jakarta and Singapore. Four employees of state tin miner PT Timah and three employees of a Timah subsidiary, were on the plane. LAST MESSAGE Company secretary Amin Haris Sugiarto said Timah had been hoping for a miracle and their employees could be found. Timah has sent an emergency response team, including a doctor and paramedics, to Jakarta to help the families of their staff. Lion Air has flown about 100 family members of the missing to Jakarta and the airport in Pangkal Pinang is preparing for the remains of victims to be flown back. Search and rescue teams have only found body parts from the missing plane. In the town of Sungai Liat, about 40 km (25 miles) from Pangkal Pinang, relatives of a couple who were on board the plane with their 15-month-old daughter sought comfort by reciting verses from the Koran in a tent set up outside the family home. Wita Seriani, a dentist, and her husband Rizal Gilang Perkasa Sanusi Putra, who worked at the state power company, had just celebrated their second wedding anniversary. Family members had gone to Jakarta to give DNA samples to help with identification, but Seriani’s mother, Susmawati, had remained behind. “It’s all fate,” she said, speaking softly. Susmawati said her daughter had sent her a message 20 minutes before the flight took off from Jakarta, so that her father could pick them up at the airport. “Mom, tell dad we’re on board the plane,” the message read.

Chaim Gartenberg,"Netflix has bought the film rights to comic creator Rob Liefeld’s Extreme Universe comics in a massive, seven-figure deal according to a report from Deadline. The deal gives Netflix movie rights to six of Liefeld’s titles: Brigade, Bloodstrike, Cybrid, Re-Gex, Bloodwulf, and Kaboom. Liefeld is best known as the original co-creator of the character Deadpool alongside Fabian Nicieza, but after a falling out with Marvel, Liefeld left the company to co-found Image Comics, where he would go on to write a variety of series featuring new, original characters including Kaboom, the undead assassination team Bloodstrike, and Battlestone under his Extreme Studios branding. Netflix will draw on that franchise for its movies, although some of the other more popular Extreme books, including Youngblood, Supreme, Glory, and Prophet aren’t mentioned as being part of Netflix’s buy, making it unclear if the streaming service will be able to adapt those characters as well. The latest superhero acquisition for the streaming company Netflix buying the rights to the Extreme Universe comics is the latest superhero acquisition for the streaming company, which also bought Mark Millar’s comic book publishing house Millarworld last year as a source of new adaptation material. It’s a move that makes sense — even if Disney isn’t said to be moving its Marvel series over from Netflix to its own streaming service when it launches next year, it’s logical that Netflix is looking to build up its own stable of superheroes that aren’t under Disney’s thumb. The films will be overseen by Akiva Goldsman, who’ll be setting up and running a writers room to adapt the comics, similar to what he’s done in the past for the Transformers franchise, the Hasbro cinematic universe, and the Ologies series of YA books. Goldsman also infamously wrote Batman &amp; Robin, co-wrote Batman Forever, and made his directorial debut with The Winter’s Tale, which he also wrote and produced. Goldsman is also currently working on another collaboration with Liefeld to adapt the Avengelyne comics at Paramount, which Goldsman may direct. (In Goldsman’s defense, he also has an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for A Beautiful Mind.) The partnership of Liefeld — with his stuck-in-the-90s mentality and polarizing work — with Goldsman (the mind who brought us the Transformers movies and Mr. Freeze’s terrible Batman &amp; Robin puns ) could be a recipe for disaster, although things are still pretty early on in the process still. This actually marks the second time someone is trying to turn the Extreme Universe comics into a series of movies — last year, Liefeld and Goldsman were set to work with producer Graham King and Fundamental Films to bring the comics to the big screen, but the deal didn’t pan out.",The streaming company is setting up a writers room with cinematic universe aspirations run by Akiva Goldsman,2018-03-08T23:11:16Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Netflix has bought the rights to Rob Liefeld’s Extreme Universe comics,https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17097726/netflix-rob-liefeld-extreme-universe-comics-akiva-goldsman-movies-adapations,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WQARWmr8RjWlhToKczjJJG009o=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3446756/netflix-stock-1110.0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,1
Steve Dent,"Boeing's 737 Max-8 aircraft was involved in both the Lion Air crash and recent Ethiopian Air disaster, in which 157 people lost their lives. However, Boeing's software update will apparently be issued for all 737 Max aircraft. Southwest Airlines flies 34 737 Max-8 planes, American Airlines operates 24, and United Airlines has 14 Max-9s in its fleet.
Both investigations are still in the early stages, but experts are concerned about the similarities in the accidents. ""It's highly suspicious,"" aviation analyst Mary Schiavo told CNN. ""Here we have a brand-new aircraft that's gone down twice in a year. That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that just doesn't happen. The similarities with Lion Air are too great not to be concerned.""
In the Lion Air crash, pilots reportedly had trouble with a new safety feature called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). It may have engaged erroneously, pushing the nose down and causing the plane to go into a dive. The pilots apparently fought the controls, but were unable to counter the problem.
FAA should ground Boeing 737 Max-8 worldwide says former FAA Chief of Staff Michael Goldfarb after Ethiopia Airlines crash. #beyond100days@kattykaybbc@ChristianFraserpic.twitter.com/izdRNjDsED

Boeing, in a very unusual procedure, issued an emergency bulletin ordering airlines to train pilots on how to shut off the automatic system. In today's news release, it said that it's always been possible to override it. ""The pilot will always be able to override the flight control law using electric trim or manual trim,"" it said. ""In addition, it can be controlled through the use of the existing runaway stabilizer procedure as reinforced in the Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) issued on Nov. 6, 2018.""
Boeing insists that ""the 737 Max is a safe airplane,"" however, China's civil aviation administration has grounded all 737 Max-8 models in the nation, citing ""zero tolerance"" for safety issues. Other nations, including Australia and Singapore, have also halted 737 Max-8 flights. The FAA has yet to act, but some experts disagree with its actions.

FRANCES ROBLES,"Prepa still needs to complete repairs to five critical transmission lines, 12 damaged substations and three transmission centers that are needed for grid stability and redundancy, said Gil Quiniones, the chief executive of the New York Power Authority, which has helped in Puerto Rico’s recovery. “The No. 1 goal was to get electricity back as quickly as possible,” Mr. Quiniones said. “On the one hand, there’s lots of new stuff. On the other hand, the crews and other contractors really rushed the work to put it back together.” Michael Byrne, the federal disaster recovery coordinator for Puerto Rico, said the utility’s task now is to design and build a resilient distribution and transmission system that can better withstand problems large and small. “We’ve been flying helicopters all over this island for 11 months now, stringing new lines and putting new towers in,” Mr. Byrne said. “So the level of effort has been historic. But that was just to patch back together what was there.” Just after the governor of Puerto Rico announced in November that the power authority had gotten back to 50 percent of its former electricity generation, the island suddenly went dark, in one of what would be a series of wide blackouts in the months following the Sept. 20 storm. Just last week, the power went out again in large swaths of San Juan. Asked to describe the island’s power grid, Mr. Byrne said, “It’s stable, but fragile.”","Jazmín Méndez’s home in Ponce, P.R.

GAIL COLLINS,"Watch Giuliani on TV and you see a man being devoured by egomania. Lawyers are supposed to serve as a screen between their clients and the outside world. If said client is being accused of a crime, their mission is to make the whole matter sound as boring as humanly possible.
Its no problem for us that Trump picked an attorney whos so wildly hungry for attention that he cant follow the rules. Really, its great that were getting to hear so much unfiltered information. The depressing part is that this is just one more piece of evidence that Donald Trump surrounds himself with people who have both terrible judgment and terrible aptitude for the jobs theyre supposed to be doing.
Whatever shred of credibility Giuliani still retains is connected to his role as mayor on Sept. 11, when the whole world saw him walking through the dust of the World Trade Center collapse. He needed to get uptown since the citys emergency management center had been destroyed by the blast. Thats because Giuliani had it located in the W.T.C. a place that had been targeted for bombing by terrorists in the past despite vigorous objections from his security advisers. He just sort of wanted it close to City Hall.
Later, the mayor would take dignitaries to the disaster site, sometimes shielded from the deadly asbestos floating through the air by a face mask. And, it appeared, totally ignoring the fact that most of the workmen had no protection whatsoever.
Giuliani had already begun to evolve from competent city official to hapless big-time political candidate before the bombing occurred. He tried to run for Senate against Hillary Clinton in what was undoubtedly one of the most disaster-ridden campaigns in history. That was the time he held a press conference to announce he was leaving his wife, without mentioning the matter to the spouse in question.
His unharnessed libido has been part of his story ever since. Last summer, after Giuliani bragged to a reporter about his new girlfriend, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was forced to declare that she was not today or tomorrow or at any point ever going to comment on Rudy Giulianis love life.
And the beat goes on. During his parade of super-strange comments over the last week, he volunteered that hes afraid it will be on my gravestone: Rudy Giuliani: He lied for Trump.","Rudy Giuliani, a little off balance, at the White House in May.",2019-01-23T22:23:13Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Trump Still Likes Rudy,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/opinion/rudy-giuliani-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/opinion/23collinsWeb/23collinsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Keith Wagstaff,"Elon Musk's SpaceX just got permission to operate 4,425 satellites that could one day provide internet service from space. That would vastly increase access to the internet — especially in rural areas — and possibly create a ton of space junk. SEE ALSO: A SpaceX rocket launch blew a temporary hole in Earth's upper atmosphere Not that SpaceX is anywhere near ready to flip the switch on a new internet service. So far, it's only launched two demo satellites. But this is a big step forward. In a statement released Thursday, the FCC said it was the first approval of ""a U.S.-licensed satellite constellation to provide broadband services using a new generation of low-Earth orbit satellite technologies."" Yes, satellite internet does exist — but it involves satellites orbiting very high above the Earth, around 22,000 miles. That's why it's so laggy and slow. Musk wants to solve that problem by launching satellites into low-Earth orbit, lower than 1,000 miles up. But those satellites can't provide enough coverage, which is why SpaceX wants to launch thousands of them. That's good news for people in remote areas. Instead of having to build expensive broadband cables to serve only a few people, internet service providers could build towers that receive signals from SpaceX's satellites, and then beam those signals to customers. The downside is that Earth's orbit could get crowded fast, with collisions causing collisions in a cascading disaster. Let's just hope Elon knows what he's doing.","Elon Musk's SpaceX just got permission to operate 4,425 satellites that could one day provide internet service from space.

Sofia Grant,"School tragedies have become agonizingly commonplace, but the school disaster that claimed the most lives in American history has been widely forgotten. On a sunny Friday afternoon in March of 1937, the students at the recently completed New London School in East Texas waited impatiently to be dismissed. Fifty PTA mothers watched a dance program put on by the younger children; older students were giving reports, taking tests or talking excitedly about the sports competition taking place over the weekend. The New London School had cost a million dollars to build, financed by oil money in one of the wealthiest school districts in the country. It featured the finest materials and equipment money could buy, including a state-of-the-art shop in the basement. But no one knew that a leak had allowed natural gas to slowly accumulate in the basement. When a shop teacher turned on a sander at 3:17 pm, a spark ignited the gas and caused an explosion that destroyed most of the school, lifting the roof off the building and causing brick and glass and wood beams to fly through the air as the walls came down. People from all over the town and the neighboring fields heard and felt the explosion and came running. Oil workers left their rigs, motorists got out of their cars, shopkeepers left their tills untended. Within moments, volunteers were searching frantically through the smoking rubble looking for survivors. Some rushed the injured to hospitals in nearby towns, while still others created a makeshift morgue where small bodies were draped with sheets. Reporters who started flooding in were put to work helping with the search, and grief-maddened parents searched mangled bodies for anything that might identify a child — a birthmark, a shoe, a necklace, a slingshot in a jeans pocket. Some families lost one child, some several; some held on desperately even after there was no hope, while a few lucky ones assumed their children were dead, only to discover that they’d been misidentified or rushed off-site to receive care. The children of Mexican immigrants who’d come to work in the oil fields — only grudgingly allowed to enroll in the school — simply disappeared: their grieving families loaded up their belongings and headed back home to mourn. Reporters came from all over the world and mingled with volunteer nurses and undertakers; the remains of the school were dismantled and cleared as quickly as possible. The townspeople served coffee and sandwiches — and searched for bits of bodies torn apart in the blast, which they collected in peach baskets. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter In the weeks to come, the residents of New London attended one funeral after another, and soon an entire section of the nearby Pleasant Hill cemetery had been given over to the lost children. I wandered through this cemetery when I went to New London to do research for a novel, and as I stood in that empty cemetery on a warm summer afternoon almost 80 years later, I tried to imagine what the residents of this small town went through in the days and months following the tragedy. My research taught me that today’s tragedies are experienced differently by members of the communities in which they take place. When something terrible happens in a contemporary American town, first responders immediately seal a scene and the public is barred from view while reporters clamor for access. Their interviews with the tend to be voyeuristic but arms-length. The information they offer is limited, and often relies on set narratives about tragedy. Shooters are angry loners, bus drivers are careless or drunk, first responders are heroes, victims are all good kids, the town will never forget. Eighty years ago, tragedies’ aftermaths differed in two key ways: because forces could not be mobilized with the speed they are today, many more volunteers pitched in to help; and because the news cycle was much longer, the story’s evolution lagged behind and echoed the experiences of the people who were there. The horrifying detail that had to be told over and over for its witness to get any peace became woven into the enduring history. In my research, I found that the keenest details came from the humblest sources: the rig worker who came running with his tools so he could help dig, the driver of the bread truck whose goods littered the schoolyard after he cleared the back to transport bodies, the strangers who helped mothers search the remains for something, anything to identify their children. These were people like you and me, as the saying goes. Which is not to say that the modern response to disasters — the lack of a visceral connection to victims — is something to be regretted. Trauma experienced by bystanders is real and potentially devastating. And yet in shielding ourselves from the horror by sending our proxies to confront and report back, we can sometimes lose something important. It took 40 years for the people of New London to be able to bear to revisit the tragedy, when the town began holding annual reunions for its survivors. In those four decades, though, the memories never stopped burning in the minds of all who were there that day. Perhaps people were kinder to each other afterward; perhaps they held tighter to their dear ones. As tragedy comes to seem commonplace and even routine in our culture, it becomes all too easy to turn away, the unintended consequence of our best efforts. We get distracted by something else and, ultimately, forget. It’s hard to look at the victims and survivors closely — but to remember them better, we must.

The plan, which is set to be launched next Friday (June 8), will be a ""roadmap to stopping Brexit"" including a case for ""why a soft Brexit is a disaster,"" a senior group insider has told Business Insider. Soros, a global investor and philanthropist, said in a speech in Paris on Monday that the campaign for a second referendum would begin ""in the next few days"" and that there was time left for Britain to ""rescind"" Brexit. ""Best for Britain fought for, and helped to win, a meaningful parliamentary vote which includes the option of not leaving at all. This would be good for Britain but would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget,"" Soros told the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank. ""But the British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe. That's what Best for Britain is aiming for by engaging the electorate. It will publish its manifesto in the next few days."" Soros did not reveal an exact launch date for the plan, or what it would include. However, BI understands that it will be published on June 8. This is exactly one year one from the date of the 2017 general election in which Theresa May lost her majority and arguably her mandate for a hard Brexit. The ""roadmap"" is to explain there can be another referendum on Brexit within the next twelve months which the Remain campaign can with a ""convincing margin"" in order to keep Britain in the EU. It will also lay out a case against the softer form of Brexit currently being pushed by Remain-backing MPs in the House of Commons. MPs in the Conservatives, Labour and other opposition parties are planning to vote for amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill which seek to keep Britain in a customs union with EU and inside the single market. However, Best For Britain will use its ""manifesto"" to distance itself from the soft-Brexit movement, amid increasing tension between a number of pro-EU MPs and campaign groups who call for Brexit to be cancelled altogether, including Best For Britain and the Chuka Umunna-backed Open Britain. A number of Labour MPs told the Huff Post that MPs who support the aforementioned groups have failed to take their campaigns to Leave-supporting areas amid rising tensions about the direction of the pro-EU movement in the UK. Speaking about Open Britain's campaign to persuade MPs to back a Norway-style Brexit, one shadow frontbencher told BI: ""They can't say they want to stop Brexit and then also say what sort of Brexit we should have."" Soros has already donated at least £700,00 to Best For Britain, which was first set up last year by Gina Miller, the banker turned political activist who in 2016 successfully took the government to court over Brexit.","The anti-Brexit group backed by George Soros is set to publish its ""manifesto"" for keeping Britain in the EU on June 8 — exactly one year on from the last general election.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Michelle Mark), Michelle Mark","An electronic sign reads ""There is no threat"" in Oahu, Hawaii, U.S. Thomson Reuters The Hawaii employee responsible for transmitting an emergency alert falsely warning of a ballistic missile earlier in January has been fired. The employee believed the threat was real, and had made the same mistake twice before, state officials said Tuesday. The head of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency has also resigned over the incident. A Hawaii employee has been fired after sending an emergency alert earlier in January that falsely warned the entire state of an inbound ballistic missile, triggering 38 minutes of panic and chaos before a correction was sent, state officials said Tuesday. The leader of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA), Vern Miyagi, also resigned over the incident on Tuesday, and another agency worker was suspended without pay. The employee who sent the alert had believed the threat was real, federal investigators said in a preliminary report released Tuesday. That employee had also made the same mistake at least two times before, confusing a real event with a drill in a fire incident and a tsunami incident, state officials said. The employee's previous job performance had also concerned his colleagues and supervisors for years, retired Brig. Gen. Bruce Oliveira told reporters at a press conference. But the employee was ""counseled"" and given on-the-spot corrections by supervisors. The employee has also refused to cooperate with the federal or state investigations, providing only a written statement. The Federal Communications Commission said in a preliminary report released Tuesday that a shift supervisor at the emergency management agency played a recording over the phone to officers during what was meant to be a drill, but erroneously included the language ""THIS IS NOT A DRILL."" The FCC's report contradicts the explanation given immediately after the incident by Hawaii Gov. David Ige, who said the employee had ""pushed the wrong button"" by accident during a shift changeover. Here's the minute-by-minute breakdown of what happened, according to the FCC (all times local): 8:05 a.m.: The midnight shift supervisor at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency began a surprise ballistic missile defense drill at a shift change. The supervisor pretended to be US Pacific Command, alerting the day shift warning officers of a threat by playing a recording over the phone. The recording began with the words ""EXERCISE, EXERCISE, EXERCISE,"" as was the proper procedure, but the supervisor also erroneously included the words ""THIS IS NOT A DRILL,"" causing the warning officer to believe it was a real emergency. 8:07 a.m.: The officer selected the template for a live alert from a drop-down menu, clicking ""yes"" in response to a prompt that said, ""Are you sure that you want to send this Alert?"" 8:08 a.m.: Another day shift warning officer received the false alert on a mobile device. 8:09 a.m.: HI-EMA notified the governor of the false alert, followed by the US Pacific Command and the Honolulu Police Department. 8:20 a.m.: HI-EMA posted the message ""NO missile threat to Hawaii"" on Facebook and Twitter. 8:24 a.m.: Hawaii's governor retweeted that notice. 8:31 a.m.: The supervisor at HI-EMA logged into the alert system and began creating a correction for the false alert. 8:45 a.m.: A correction alert was sent clarifying that there was no missile threat. Between 8:07 a.m. and 8:45 a.m., however, people in Hawaii feared for their lives. They sought out shelter, sped down roads and highways to reach their families, searched the internet for missile survival advice, and contacted their loved ones to say goodbye. The FCC said the incident was a result of ""a combination of human error and inadequate safeguards,"" and the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency's lack of preparedness led to the 38-minute lapse before correcting the alert. HI-EMA has halted ballistic missile defense drills temporarily and has already begun implementing new procedures to avoid a false alert situation, the FCC said. The agency is increasing the amount of supervision required for drills and alert transmissions, and has created a template to use for future corrections.","Thomson Reuters The Hawaii employee responsible for transmitting an emergency alert falsely warning of a ballistic missile earlier in January has been fired.

An eight-storey apartment block has collapsed in the Turkish city of Istanbul, killing one person, while other people were injured or are trapped beneath rubble. 
Video from a residential area in the city's Kartal district shows rescuers at work around a mound of debris.
Reports suggest at least four people may be missing, and a number of cars were also buried in rubble.
The cause of the disaster on Wednesday afternoon was not immediately known.
A textile workshop on the building's lower floor was empty at the time, local official Zeki Dag told local media. 
According to CNN Turk, the building collapsed at about 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT).

Finding trees to sell is a bit of a scramble, though, and has been for years. History: The shortage has its roots in the 2008 economic crash. Because so many people lost their jobs, Mr. Gatanas said, he figured hed have fewer customers. He bought fewer trees, and tree sellers nationwide did likewise. Growers responded by planting fewer trees. Rinse and repeat a few times, and here we are. It wasnt an environmental disaster, he said. It was man-made. Economics: Mr. Gatanas has been keeping prices steady, though. As he has for years, he sells a three-foot Charlie Brown tree for $39.99.

Associated Press,"Rescue teams search through the wreckage site of a Boeing 737 that plummeted into a cassava field with more than 100 passengers on board, in Havana, Cuba, Friday, May 18, 2018. Associated Press/Ramon Espinosa HAVANA (AP) — The only three survivors of a plane crash in Cuba remained in grave condition Saturday as investigators tried to determine why an aging Boeing 737 carrying 110 people went down and erupted in flames shortly after takeoff in Havana. It was Cuba's worst aviation disaster in three decades and its third major air accident since 2010. Skies were overcast and rainy at the airport at the time of Friday's disaster and Cuban state television said the 39-year-old jet veered sharply to the right after departing on a domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin. ""The only thing we heard, when we were checking in, an explosion, the lights went out in the airport and we looked out and saw black smoke rising and they told us a plane had crashed,"" Argentine tourist Brian Horanbuena told The Associated Press at the airport. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said a special commission had been formed to find the cause of the crash. The plane had 104 mainly Cuban passengers and six crew members. ""Things have been organized, the fire has been put out, and the remains are being identified,"" he said. State airline Cubana, which operated the flight, has had a generally good safety record but is notorious for delays and cancellations and has taken many of its planes out of service because of maintenance problems in recent months, prompting it to hire charter aircraft from other companies. Mexican officials said the Boeing 737-201 was built in 1979 and rented by Cubana from Aerolineas Damojh, a small charter company that also goes by the name Global Air. Cubana Flight 972 went down just after noon a short distance from the end of the runway at Jose Marti International Airport. Firefighters rushed to extinguish the flames that engulfed the debris left where the jet hit the ground in a cassava field. The few surviving passengers of an airliner that crashed arrive at the Calixto Garcia General Hospital in Havana, Cuba, Friday, May 18, 2018. ACN/Marcelino Vazquez Hernandez via Associated Press Four crash survivors were taken to a Havana hospital, and three remained alive as of late Friday. State media reports stopped short of openly declaring that the rest on board were dead, but there was no word of other survivors by Friday night. Relatives of those aboard were ushered into a private area at the terminal to await word on their loved ones. ""My daughter is 24, my God, she's only 24!"" cried Beatriz Pantoja, whose daughter Leticia was on the plane. A statement from Mexico's Transportation Department identified the pilot and co-pilot as Capt. Jorge Luis Nunez Santos and first officer Miguel Angel Arreola Ramirez. It said the flight attendants were Maria Daniela Rios, Abigail Hernandez Garcia and Beatriz Limon. Global Air said maintenance worker Marco Antonio Lopez Perez was also aboard. Outside the company's Mexico City offices, former Global Air flight attendant Ana Marlen Covarrubias said she had worked for the company for over seven years and knows nearly all the crew members. ""I don't have the words. I'm very sad. We're in mourning,"" she said in tears. ""It was something really, really, really terrible; a tragedy for us."" In addition to the Mexican crew, Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma reported that the passengers were mostly Cubans plus five foreigners from countries it did not identify. Argentina's Foreign Ministry said two of its citizens had died in the crash. In November 2010 a Global Air flight originating in Mexico City made an emergency landing in Puerto Vallarta because its front landing gear did not deploy. The fire was quickly extinguished, and none of the 104 people aboard were injured. That plane was a 737 first put into service in 1975. Mexican aviation authorities said a team of experts would fly to Cuba on Saturday to take part in the investigation. First Vice President Salvador Valdes Mesa had met with Cubana officials on Thursday to discuss improvements to its service. The airline blames its spotty record on a lack of parts and airplanes because of the U.S. trade embargo against the communist-run country. Last year a Cuban military plane crashed into a hillside in the western province of Artemisa, killing eight soldiers. In 2010, an AeroCaribbean flight from Santiago to Havana went down in bad weather, killing all 68 people on board, including 28 foreigners, in what was the country's worst air disaster in more than two decades. The last deadly accident involving a Cubana-operated plane was in 1989, when a charter flight from Havana to Milan, Italy, crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 126 people on board and at least two dozen on the ground. ___ Associated Press writer Amy Guthrie contributed to this report from Mexico City.","Associated Press/Ramon Espinosa Three survivors are in grave condition after a Boeing 737 went down in Havana, Cuba, on Friday.

EMILY COCHRANE,"Yet it was unclear what solutions remained in the final hours for a disgruntled, tired legislative body that has repeatedly failed over the last two years to reach a lasting compromise over funding for Mr. Trumps signature campaign promise.
Even before the House passed its own measure on Thursday, which includes close to $8 billion in disaster relief funding for natural disaster recovery, the two Democratic leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, warned that they would not cave on supplying wall funding.
It is a shame that this president, who is plunging the nation into chaos, is throwing another temper tantrum and going to hurt lots of innocent people, Mr. Schumer said. The Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown, it will not get him his wall.
With funding set to expire at midnight on Friday, the nine federal departments and several other agencies were beginning to ready themselves for a lapse in funding. While it was expected in some agencies that there would be money to carry them into the new year, it is expected that thousands of government workers would be furloughed or be required to work through the holidays without pay.
Its actually part of what you do when you sign up for any public service position, Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Thursday. Its not lost on me in terms of the potential hardship.
Several House lawmakers blamed Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer for the impending shutdown, arguing that they were unwilling to compromise on border security. But with Democrats set to reclaim the House majority in two weeks, there is little motivation for Ms. Pelosi to acquiesce to the presidents demands.
In the aftermath of Mr. Trumps insistence that he would own a government shutdown, House Democratic aides had already begun crafting legislation that would reopen the government come Jan. 3 and the swearing in of new members.
The Senate bill, Democrats argue, is a bipartisan effort that includes money for border security but with a prohibition on any funds being used for a wall.",President Trump sought to blame the Democrats for a potential funding lapse that he said last week he would proudly own.,2018-12-21T13:01:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Threatens a Shutdown That Will ‘Last for a Very Long Time’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-shutdown-border-wall.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/22/us/politics/22dc-cong1/22dc-cong1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Tyler Lauletta,"The Washington Nationals were heavy favorites to win the NL East heading into the 2018 season, but now find themselves on the outside looking in of the postseason picture. Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images The Washington Nationals are falling apart at the seams. With just 43 games remaining in their season, the Nationals have lost five of their last seven games including back-to-back walk-off losses and now find themselves trailing in the NL East by seven games, behind both the Atlanta Braves and the Philadelphia Phillies in the division they've won two straight years. As things stand, FiveThirtyEight gives the Nationals just a 17% chance to make the playoffs — a dramatic and disappointing drop from the 83% shot at the postseason they were given at the start of the season. The Nationals decline feels almost illogical. They sport a starting rotation that includes ace Max Scherzer, their lineup is anchored by the reliable power of Bryce Harper, and 19-year-old Juan Soto is tearing through the majors with a remarkable rookie campaign. But despite the strength of the team on paper, something has simply not been clicking for the team this year. They have a +69 run differential but have lost a whopping 21 one-run games, and after Sunday and Monday's back-to-back walk-off losses, it's hard to look anywhere but the bullpen when assigning blame for the Nationals' woes. The heartbreak started Sunday when the Nationals took a 3-0 lead into the bottom of the ninth against the Chicago Cubs. Closer Ryan Madson came in to finish out the game but instead set up the scenario little league players around the world imagine while they practice in batting cages — two outs, bases loaded, bottom of the ninth, one home run to win the game, and the home team down to its last strike. Cubs rookie David Bote wrote a pitch-perfect ending to the script — smacking a home run to centerfield to send the crowd home happy and leave the Nationals to regroup and wonder what had just happened. The next night the Nationals were in St. Louis and looked in position to bounce back against the Cardinals, taking a 4-2 lead into the eighth inning. Then, relievers Justin Miller and Sammy Solis combined to give up four runs to swing the lead away from Washington. The Nationals would tie the game with two runs in the ninth before reliever Koda Glover gave up yet another heartbreaking walk-off. For a team that has been attempting to fight its way back into the postseason hunt, the back-to-back walk-offs are about as demoralizing as a stretch can get. There's still a chance for the Nationals to get hot and make a run at the playoffs, but it's now looking like an extremely uphill battle. Washington has nine games left against the Phillies, but just three remaining against the Braves, meaning the Nationals will likely need some help from Atlanta if they're to make a run at the division. Most importantly, the Nationals need to figure out a way to right their bullpen's current tailspin. After years of disappointing playoff finishes, Washington now is fighting just to make it back to October.","The Washington Nationals are in a tailspin, having lost five of their last seven games including back-to-back walk-offs in the midst of a crucial stretch.

Adrian Florido,"Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced a deal that would allow billions of dollars in federal disaster recovery loans to start flowing to the hurricane-devastated island. La Fortaleza For months, Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rossello has been struggling to get the U.S. Treasury to release $4.7 billion in disaster recovery loans that the U.S. Congress approved in October, weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the island commonwealth. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had delayed releasing the loans because of disagreement over the terms of repayment. On Thursday, the two men said they'd reached a deal to allow the funds to start flowing. ""We've reached an agreement that is beneficial both for the taxpayer and for the people of Puerto Rico,"" Rossello said shortly after meeting with Mnuchin in Puerto Rico's capital. The tentative agreement would allow the island's government to start accessing those funds once the cash balance in its treasury falls below $1.1 billion. Mnuchin had earlier wanted to set that number at $800 million. As of March 9, the island had about $1.45 billion in cash. The agreement ended six months of tense negotiations during which Puerto Rico's governor loudly criticized Mnuchin for what he characterized as overly harsh conditions that the U.S. Treasury sought to impose before disbursing the loans. According to a letter Rossello wrote to Congress last month, the Treasury was demanding that repayment of those loans be given the highest priority, even over the funding of essential services on the island. The governor said the Treasury also wanted to rule out the possibility of future loan forgiveness, a common practice for disaster recovery loans. The agreement they reached Thursday, the governor and Treasury secretary said, would grant high priority to repayment of the federal loans — not above the funding of essential services, but presumably above the more than $70 billion the island owes bondholders. They also agreed to postpone conversations about loan forgiveness. ""We want to make sure that the taxpayers are protected,"" Mnuchin said about possible loan forgiveness.

Reuters,"MATARAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rescue workers found chaos and destruction across the Indonesian resort island of Lombok on Monday after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed at least 91 people and prompted an exodus of tourists rattled by the second powerful quake in a week. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise as information came in from areas where thousands of buildings collapsed or were badly damaged, especially in the north, the quake’s epicenter.

The Indonesian Red Cross said in a Tweet that it helped a woman give birth after the quake at a health post in the north. One of the names she gave the baby boy was ‘Gempa,’ which means earthquake. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening’s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. There were no foreigners among the dead and the number of injured stood at 209, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. Indonesia sits on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. “THIS IS IT FOR ME IN INDONESIA” Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok’s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights, while Indonesian budget carriers Lion Air and Citilink said there had been a jump in demand for outbound flights from Lombok and Bali. “I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,” said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children, at the Lombok airport. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. “This is it for me in Indonesia,” she said. “Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.” Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east. “All the activities are shut down. We can’t dive, we can’t do anything so we will go to another island,” he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. “We are cutting short our holiday because I can’t walk and we’re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,” said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged. “We are just thankful to God and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.” About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Nugroho said via Twitter. He posted a video showing a crowd of hundreds of people crammed on a beach at one of the Gilis, apparently waiting to be ferried back to the main island. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. “It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,” he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel at the time of the quake. “We were knocked certainly to the floor,” he told Australian radio. “We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone’s a bit shaken but all well.” #UPDATE #lombokearthquake death toll rises to 91 and could rise further as rescuers still haven't reached some of the worst affected areas, says Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency pic.twitter.com/0ZaGAZ7n6K — CGTN (@CGTNOfficial) August 6, 2018",The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said the death toll is expected to rise.,2018-08-06T05:32:03Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Death Toll From Indonesia Earthquake Climbs To 91,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesia-earthquake_us_5b67da01e4b0fd5c73db210a,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b67db932000004300349a51.jpeg?cache=vtsqyusl3w&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,1
Andrew Freedman,"Tornadoes are such a rare weather phenomena that they attract hundreds, if not thousands, of storm chasers to the Great Plains each spring and early summer, in the hope of glimpsing one of these beasts. Tornadoes, which are not their own cloud type, protrude from another rare, rotating cloud, known as a wall cloud. In fact, some tornadoes are not completely visible from the ground to the base of the parent thunderstorm, due to a lack of moisture. Tornadoes, too, come in all shapes and sizes. There are stovepipe funnels, rope tornadoes and the dreaded wedge, to name a few. All of these are bad news. The U.S. was spared a major tornado disaster in 2016, but was not so lucky in previous years, particularly in 2011, when 1,691 tornadoes touched down, killing 550 people. Yet for all the advances in tornado prediction, we still don't know the exact, micro-scale sequence of events that gives rise to such calamities. The allure of the unknown is what drives many storm chasers to the Plains each spring and summer. Some are scientists gathering data to try to save lives. Others are thrill-seekers through and through. Many chasers come face-to-face with the damage these storms can cause.","To many, clouds are merely part of the backdrop in a typical day.

The UN report, which is based on more than 6,000 scientific references from 91 authors across 40 countries, outlines the impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Scott Davis,"For the second time this decade, LeBron James has left the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the team has seemingly collapsed in on itself. James' departure for the Miami Heat in 2010, of course, left the team in dire straights as they toiled in the NBA's abyss, collecting lottery picks and racking up 20-win seasons until James returned in 2014. From the looks of things, James' latest departure isn't any different. Through nine games, the Cavs are an NBA-worst 1-8, with the worst point differential in the league. As The Athletic's Joe Vardon revealed in a damning report, there are systemic issues on the team that paint an even uglier picture of the post-LeBron landscape. At the heart of the issue, according to Vardon, seems to be organizational disagreement about the direction of the team. According to Vardon, when James left, some of the veteran Cavs players were under the impression they would be moved to different teams so the Cavs could start a rebuild. However, despite James moving, the team decided they wanted to stay competitive and fight for the playoffs. Vardon reported that veteran wing Kyle Korver signed with the Cavs under the premise that if James left, he would be moved elsewhere. From Vardon: ""The first player Altman ever signed to a contract as GM was Kyle Korver. It was a three-year, $22 million deal inked in July of 2017, but it came with an understanding: If LeBron were to leave, the Cavs would either trade Korver or buy him out of the deal so he could move his family to his next team during the summer. So when LeBron left July 1 for the Lakers, Korver asked for the Cavs to move him. They refused because, they told him, they wanted him to play and for the team to try and win."" The decision to compete for the playoffs, sans LeBron, seems to have created issues on the roster, namely in acquiring young players to kick-start a rebuild around the team's veterans. The Cavs used the eighth pick in the draft to take 19-year-old point guard Collin Sexton. Their biggest free agency moves included signing young, talented players like David Nwaba and Sam Dekker in hopes of giving them chances to improve. According to Vardon, after two losses to start the season, head coach Tyronn Lue sat his veterans, who he preferred, to play younger players. But when the team still didn't win, Lue turned back to his veterans, going against the wishes of GM Koby Altman and the front office. The move still didn't result in wins, so with Lue and Altman at odds, Lue was fired. That has only opened up new cans of worms. Interim head coach Larry Drew has pushed back against the label of ""interim"" head coach, requesting more money and job security for himself and his coaching staff. Drew has made his requests public, and Vardon reported that players don't feel Drew has the proper command of the locker room because he doesn't have any long-term security. Read more : The Cavaliers are in an awkward stalemate with interim head coach Larry Drew just days after promoting him While that tug-of-war continues, Smith has publicly requested a trade, upset about him playing time. Meanwhile, Kevin Love, fresh off signing a four-year, $120 million extension, had to undergo foot surgery that could keep him out for over a month. There's more! According to Vardon, Cavs players have also become disenchanted with Sexton, one of the young players the front office wants to devote more playing time. According to Vardon, some players increasingly believe he can't play, questioning his ability to run an offense, score efficiently, set up teammates, then play defense on the other end. Vardon reported that the issues don't have much to do with Sexton as a person, and his teammates understand he's only 19, but that his performances have not won many people over. Increasingly, it looks like the Cavs' best path is to blow it up — exactly what they decided not to do when James left. There are real benefits to that plan. The Cavs owe their 2019 first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks unless it lands in the top-10. Currently, the Cavs are on pace to keep that pick, but it wouldn't hurt to trade off some of their veteran players. ESPN's Zach Lowe has reported that the Cavs signed Love to such a big extension to make it easier to trade him — the contract security that comes with an extension is more enticing than trading for Love before he hits free agency. It's unclear what the Cavs could get in return for Love now, but perhaps they could land another asset or young player to continue their rebuild. Issues within the organization were only thinly veiled in recent years, even with James on the roster. The Cavs went all-in to build around him, and the aftermath was always going to be ugly. But at least in recent years, the winning masked some issues. Now the team appears to be heading back toward the NBA's doldrums, and it's hard to imagine the present situation continuing. The Cavs thought they could smoothly transition between eras — remaining competitive with a veteran roster built around Love while their young players slowly developed and took center stage. Instead, it appears their only path forward it to begin anew and usher in an entirely new era.","Nine games into their first season without LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers have fallen to 1-8, the worst record in the league, while internal conflicts have arisen.

The Japanese government and the electric utility that operated the plant were found negligent in not preventing the meltdowns.

Peter Kotecki,"David J. Phillip/AP From rainfall to wildfires, 2017 was a record-breaking year for natural disasters. In August and September, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria left behind a high death toll, drowned homes, and destroyed power lines. Hundreds of people died in earthquakes around the world, from Mexico to the Iran-Iraq border, and nearly 1,400 people were killed during monsoon rains in South Asia. Fires devastated locations around the world, perhaps most notably in California, where the government spends over 10 times as much money on fighting wildfires as it did 20 years ago. Many of these disasters were caused by elevated temperatures on land and at sea, and climate experts expect these events to keep getting worse. While people may be able to heed their city's evacuation notices or take advantage of evacuation help, some situations are unexpected and make this impossible.

ALAN BLINDER and SHERI FINK,"Juanita Edwards was evacuated on such short notice, Gloria Edwards recalled, that she only had time to pack three pairs of pants, two shirts, shoes and medication. She and her mother arrived at Dobbins Air Reserve Base near Atlanta in late September, part of an exodus that has tested both public and private resources. Photo Gloria Edwards’s bible. “She wants to go home. She wants to go home now,” Ms. Edwards said of her mother. Credit Audra Melton for The New York Times “When you’ve got a population that’s moved, it’s really a whole community effort,” Captain Weir said. “The government has a role, the private sector has a role, community-based organizations have a role in providing all of the things that people impacted by disaster need.” The dialysis patients in Atlanta, currently numbering 138, came as part of a larger federal program of medical evacuations that transported 531 patients from the Virgin Islands to the mainland for treatment, about half of them with an accompanying family member. Forty-one of the evacuated patients, many of whom arrived critically ill, have died, including 15 dialysis patients, who as a group often have other medical problems besides kidney failure. The program, known as the National Disaster Medical System, has been used for years to transport hospital patients out of disaster zones for treatment in unaffected hospitals. They are usually returned home quickly afterward. But officials said that the dialysis patients from the Virgin Islands have presented new challenges, because of their continuing requirement for outpatient treatment and because medical care is only one of their many needs. The situation is not without precedent. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the same program airlifted patients from the Navy’s hospital ship Comfort to the United States for further care. Dozens of those medical evacuees were put up in Atlanta hotel rooms, and some, including Raymond Desir, a Haitian bricklayer who underwent surgery and rehabilitation for a severe hip fracture at Southern Regional Medical Center, remain in the Atlanta area today. Many evacuees from last year’s storms have settled into an uneasy routine centered in Chamblee, a diverse city northeast of downtown Atlanta that hugs two interstate highways. Days punctuated by medical care — for Ms. Edwards, three rounds of dialysis a week, each lasting at least three hours — may offer little else but bouts of boredom, homesickness and ceaseless, and saddening questions about the future. The Edwardses share a single bed in a room that has a stove, a refrigerator and a coffee maker. They spend many hours there, eating Chinese food, watching old Westerns, action movies and cartoons, and talking about decades past on St. Croix. On the day this winter that Gloria Edwards turned 52, her mother started talking about the precise time she had given birth — 1:05 p.m. “If my mama was here by herself, she would break down more,” Ms. Edwards said. “She has me, she has God, she’s good to go.” Ms. Edwards praised the efforts of emergency workers in helping her mother. But the process of making metropolitan Atlanta an evacuation site for the medically needy was marked by substantial hurdles and occasional missteps. “They arrived in the middle of the night at the military base,” said Micheline Desse, a group facility administrator for DaVita, a dialysis company that has worked with the government. “They needed them to have dialysis the next day.” Ms. Desse was asked to arrange care for 64 of the patients. She called every dialysis facility in her region to see how many could be accommodated; in many cases the answer was none. She got better news from a clinic on Linden Avenue in Atlanta, within sight of the 55-story Bank of America Plaza that dominates the city’s skyline. The recently renovated clinic could take 40 patients. Staff members agreed to work longer hours and established an additional shift for dialysis. But there were logistical problems. Some patients were placed in hotels far from their clinic, or would not be picked up on schedule, or would get back late and miss meals at their hotels. Patients had problems filling prescriptions. Federal officials serving brief rotations on the program were turned over frequently, and important information would sometimes be lost in the transitions.

"Lorraine Allen on Offspring, shared by Lorraine Allen to Lifehacker","My son, who just celebrated his first birthday, has been a real mover-and-shaker since the second he was born. (The hospitals note beside his Apgar scores at birth literally reads: Jittery.) Diaper changes as early as his six-month checkup were such a scene with this kid that the pediatrician likened it to trying to stuff an octopus in a bag. When our precious, squirming bundle of joy almost flew off the changing table and then again off our bedwhile covered in poop and on the same dayI realized the problem was getting out of hand. I sought out solutions from experts: moms with thousands of diaper changes under their belts. Enter: The Toy of Distraction The key, I learned, in addition to speed-changing your child, which gets easier with practice, is to keep a special toy by your diaper-changing spot. You present this toy to them whenand only whenyou wipe them down, cream them up and get that clean diaper on. Its an exclusive, limited-time offer reserved for this specific activity. For a brief, precious (if unmemorable) moment, you need a toy that will keep their little hands and minds fully occupied. Most effective, in my experience, is an interactive gadget that will wow, distract and engage your wiggly one while you take care of business, big and small. Think buttons, lights or sounds. For our son, who flails around like a fish out of water the moment you lay him down, a musical stuffed octopus works wonders (and I know other parents who swear by this very same miracle mollusk). Other highly successful distractors could include a toy flashlight, a baby phone, a rattle or a small musical instrument, like a tambourine or maraca. Serve it up like a treasure: Hey, psst, kidlook at this! But hurry, because Im going to hide it as soon as were done here. For changing a baby outside your home, keep a toy whistle, a soft activity book or a teething necklace with colorful, chewable beads in your diaper bag.

Gita Jackson,"Yesterday, in BitLife, I was playing as Basil Andre, a french businessman, when disaster struck. I had been slowly climbing the corporate ladder, amassing a family, when suddenly, I got diagnosed with penis cancer.
BitLife is a mobile game that bears a lot of similarity to RealLives, a free educational game that was intended to teach young people how people live all over the world. I played the hell out of RealLives as a kid, even though theres not much to it. Youre born as a randomly generated person, then click a button to age a year. You go to school, gain siblings, friends and lovers, start a family and join the workforce, then die. Youre given some choices when it comes to things like who to marry, but otherwise, the gameplay mostly consists of clicking the button to age a year.
BitLife plays almost exactly the same way, though it gives you more options for doing stuff in your free time, like going to the movies, getting plastic surgery, or committing crimes. In RealLives, the game takes where youre born into account when it comes to what kind of education youll have or what kind of money you can make. BitLife is more concerned with being funny.
My BitLife character Basil Andre also developed an alcohol problem while suffering from penis cancer, though he would survive long enough to become CEO. He stumbled a bit in other aspects of his life; after his first stint in rehab, he was fired, though was soon employed again by a different company as Vice President. At age 72, he was cured of both his cancer and his alcoholism. Though his relationship with his wife Sofia was rocky, they stayed married for over seventy years.
Basils life wasnt the most extreme of the ones I played through, though. That award goes to Aisha Robinson, who started out as a promising artist, but after she couldnt find a job, turned to a life of crime. She was arrested at age 28 for selling cocaine, then tried twice to escape from prison. On her second attempt, she was successful, and lived on the lam for a few years, even starting a relationship with a financial analyst named Chester. She ended up back in prison a few years later, then had her prison sentence extended for another ten years because she accidentally killed another prisoner in a fight. While she was in prison, Chester cheated on her, then left her. After appealing her sentence at age 46, she managed to get out of prison, then contracted syphilis. She started dating Clifford, who she married, and they stayed together until she died. She gained work as a Cat Behavior Specialist, and after 34 years, she ended her life with a net worth of over three hundred thousand dollars and the eternal hatred of the rest of her family.
Living these imaginary lives in brief is just fascinating, and I could play BitLife all day. Though I wish it had some of the educational elements of RealLives, its also free to play, and its on my phone. In fact, during the course of writing this article, I started a new life in BitLife. Her name is Heidi Watts, from Melbourne, Australia. I wonder what shell get up to.","Yesterday, in BitLife, I was playing as Basil Andre, a french businessman, when disaster struck.

Tommy Mello,"They say, trust your employees, give them the power to make important decisions, and more importantly, never micromanage, right? Well... this sounds great on paper, but doesn't really cut it in reality. Related: You Got Promoted to Be the Boss of Your Former Team. Now What? Look, there's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to empowering employees. The above might work on some of your employees, but I can bet you a million bucks that it'll backfire with others. Not everyone has the skills to be a leader, make tough decisions or solve complex problems. And that's fine. All you need to do is to adapt your leadership style to fit the different types of employees you have. One great tool to help you do that is called The Situational Leadership Mode l. Related: 22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader With this model, you're evaluating your employees based on their competence and commitment, and using these two components to determine your leadership style. Here's how it works 1. Put your employees in these four buckets. Do a mental assessment of your employees, and group them into one of the four categories below. Depending on how big your company is, you can either do this by teams, by departments or even by individual employees. Enthusiastic Beginners: Low skilled employees who show strong commitment to their work, but needs a lot of guidance. Disillusioned Learners: Somewhat competent employees who show low commitment to their work due to challenges faced. Capable but Cautious Performers: Reasonably competent employees who show various levels of commitment to their work. Self-Reliant Achievers: Highly competent employees who show strong commitment to their work. Related: 50 Rules for Being a Great Leader Now here's how you put this into action: 2. Employ different leadership styles depending on the employees' category. Now that you've identified which categories your employees fall in, adopt the appropriate leadership style for each category. Enthusiastic Beginners: Directing leadership With this group of people, your leadership should be high on directing behaviors, and low on supporting behaviors. Tell your employees exactly what to do, and how to go about doing it. Issuing clear and non-negotiable directions is what's best for employees at this stage. The people in this category need a clear sense of direction -- this will help them complete their tasks and improve their skills. At my company we create documents with a step-by-step process that these employees can follow to get things done. But, we also make ourselves available for any questions they might have. Related: 4 Leadership Methods for Empowering Employees and Building Strong Teams Disillusioned Learners: Coaching leadership When it comes to the Disillusioned Learners, you'll need to provide leadership that is high on both directing and supporting behaviors. These guys aren't complete newbies, but they need your guidance and direction to improve further. When dealing with these employees, you're still telling them what to do. At the same time, you should also be receptive to them, and give them the support that they need to buy into the process. Setting up time to regularly talk to them is key to keep them motivated and accountable. Capable but Cautious Performers: Supporting leadership To transform this group of employees into Self-Reliant Achievers, show leadership that is low on directing behaviors and high on supporting behaviors. These employees are competent at their jobs, so you can let go of the reins and engage in shared decision-making. Make sure you validate their efforts and acknowledge their work -- this way, you'll build rapport and increase their commitment to your company. I do that by spending at least two minutes of my daily team meeting celebrating our wins and pointing out how these employees had a key role in it. Related: Do We Prefer Leaders Who Are More Like Dictators? Self-Reliant Achievers: Delegating leadership With this group of employees, your leadership style should be low on both directing and supporting behaviors. These guys are your A-players -- so you can rely on them to work independently and take responsibility for their projects. You'll want to keep an eye on things, but don't step in unless it's needed. The key is to give them your trust and support, while not micromanaging and killing their motivation. At my company, these guys have the authority to make some high-level decisions without the need to consult me first. But, of course, they take ownership of whatever results they get. Take action. In an ideal scenario, you'll be working with an entire team of A-players who are highly competent and self-directing. But, unless you're a Fortune 500 company with a big budget, this is nearly impossible. The good news, though, is that with the right leadership style and a little patience, you can nurture your employees and lead them to become their best selves.

Associated Press,"(BERLIN) — German insurance company Munich Re says the Northern California wildfire that killed dozens of people and burned down the town of Paradise was the world’s costliest single natural disaster in 2018.
The reinsurance giant said on Tuesday that the November fire caused overall losses of $16.5 billion. The company said some $12.5 billion in losses were insured.
The firestorm destroyed thousands of homes and other structures.
Munich Re said losses from all natural disasters reached $160 billion last year, above the inflation-adjusted average of $140 billion for the last 30 years but below 2017’s hurricane-driven high of $350 billion.
Board member Torsten Jeworrek said increasing wildfires in California appear linked to climate change.
He was quoted saying that “action is urgently needed on building codes and land use to help prevent losses.

Luis Congdon,"March 30, 2018 5 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. It seems like every day some new influencer is posting about the death of email. Fancy cars, cool videos and hordes of fans have them convinced email is useless. Not only that, they want you to follow the hype and buy their new strategy for Instagram, Snapchat or whatever else is trending. Related: How to Write Emails People Will Actually Open As your trusted digital marketing consultant, I'm here to tell you: Don't trust the hype. Email is alive and stronger than ever. It may not be sexy, might not allow you to showboat your success, but if you take a look under the hood, you'll find email is still the champion for online sales. In fact, here is a comprehensive list of 70 incredible email statistics to make any business owner salivate and start typing up those unsexy emails to make more profits. From the list of those salacious email statistics, one of the most notable metrics for entrepreneurs is this one from the Direct Marketing Association: For every dollar spent, email marketing generates $38 in ROI. I love that little piece of data, and from my own experience, in many months my return on investment has been over 1000 percent. Since I've made a great deal of income with social media, I can't argue with the fact that it helps to create revenue, but when it comes to the hierarchy of importance, email comes first. This one tragic event of internet celebrity Felix Baum losing millions of fans because Facebook deleted his account paints a clear picture as to why building social media leaves you vulnerable. Since he didn't own the information of his fans, there was nothing he could do. In contrast, if Baum owned the list of his fans, if his provider shut him down for some reason, he could just migrate his list of subscribers to another hosting service -- and he'd still be able to communicate with them. The panacea to being so susceptible on social media hosting sites is simple -- build your email list. Related: The Best Days and Times to Send Your Email (Infographic) How to capitalize on email By now, I hope we're on the same page -- email isn't sexy, but it's worth it. To capitalize on email, you'll need to start collecting emails from your web visitors. Doing this isn't hard; it'll take just a bit of time, thought and elbow grease. First, you'll need to place email capture boxes strategically. The first place your website should do this is in the upper middle half of your site's homepage (right above the scroll). To see an example, here's my website. On average, we currently collect upwards of 50 emails a day. If your email box is large, easy to spot and catches your visitors' eyes -- they're more likely to give you their information. Oh, and did I mention that those opt-in boxes help us generate upwards of 50 new leads on a daily basis? Imagine that, having a website that collects prospects for you -- while you work, eat, sleep and take care of the kids. The next place to have an email capture box is at the bottom of your website, across all pages. Some examples of major brands that do this are Victoria's Secret, Eddie Baur, Ralph Lauren and O'Reilly Autoparts, just to name a few. Another way to capture emails is through a pop-up on your website. Yes, I said it, install one of those annoying pop-ups on your site. I know that as a user you hate them, but the data is clear -- pop-up email opt-in boxes work. It's for this reason that companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Virgin use pop-ups. Related: 24 Email Marketing Stats Every Business Owner Should Know (Infographic) What to offer so web visitors give you their email address When it comes to creating eye-catching and compelling email opt-in boxes, I advise you to focus on building highly targeted offers that your visitors would want. A straightforward offer you can make is a discount. In fact, according to data collected in the National Email Client Report (in conjunction with eBay Enterprise Marketing Solutions and others large corporations), 38 percent of users give their emails in return for a discount. If you're a business, the lowest hanging fruit to collect your visitors' email is by offering a discount code that requires users to give you their email. If you don't want to offer a discount or it's not something you believe is right for your industry, there are other options. In my case, since I work in the world of consulting and information-based products, I offer free trainings instead. Similarly, you could offer your visitors a guide and video series that helps with the problems you solve. The goal is simple: Offer visitors a good reason to give you their email and later follow up with an offer for them to make a purchase -- but before you can send them inbox offers, you'll need their email. If McDonald's, O'Reilly Auto, Virgin, Polo Sports and just about every other multibillion-dollar company is using email to increase business, isn't it time you did, too?

"Story by John D. Sutter, CNN Investigates
Video by Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris, CNN
Additional reporting by Cristian Arroyo for CNN
Photographs by Jayme Gershen for CNN","For more on this story, watch ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on CNN Friday at 8 p.m. ET. Kissimmee, Florida (CNN) With no running water, no power and no school for her kids, Carmen ""Millie"" Santiago fled Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean last fall. Like thousands of evacuees, she landed here in central Florida. And, like hundreds, she's still stuck in a motel. Seven months after the storm, the quick-witted 50-year-old with chestnut hair and a warm smile has become the de facto mayor of ""El Super Ocho,"" or Super 8, the beige motel in the shadow of Disney World where she lives with her husband and two children. She keeps business cards of apartment managers, case workers and potential employers spread out on a table by the motel room door -- anything that might help her neighbors figure out how to survive the complex and increasingly eternal limbo they find themselves in. This week, hundreds of evacuees were told they would be booted from the motels where they've lived rent-free on assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. On Friday at 1 p.m., after mounting pressure from members of Congress, Puerto Rico's governor and evacuees like Millie, as well as multiple inquiries from CNN, FEMA announced it would extend the motel assistance for Maria survivors until May 14. Millie and others didn't know where they would have gone without the extension. And after what one advocate described as a week of panic, they still don't know what will happen next month. She does know what happens to evacuees who lose the motel vouchers, though: There's the mother of two who says she slept several nights in a car after FEMA's motel-room assistance ran out in March. There's the family of eight -- four children, their parents and grandparents -- who slept together in a motel room with only two beds. In that room on a recent day, a 7-year-old girl ate spaghetti for lunch using the end of a plastic coat hanger as a utensil. Some families say they've relocated four, five and six times to avoid sleeping on the streets. Meanwhile, shelters near Kissimmee, the southern suburb of Orlando that's come to be known as ""Puerto Rico north,"" are full. Low-income housing is unavailable. Rents are out of reach. Non-profits have been sapped of resources. And federal aid for the evacuees either is running out or was never offered. At issue are two FEMA housing programs. One, called the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, pays motel bills for people whose homes were damaged in Puerto Rico, even if the disaster victims left the island. That program, according to FEMA documents, was designed to be used for about two weeks. It has been extended repeatedly. More than 1,200 cases in the 50 states had been determined by FEMA to be ineligible for continued assistance after this week, according to documents provided to CNN, with about half of those cases in Florida. In a letter to FEMA on Wednesday, Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, requested an ""unconditional extension"" of the motel program. ""It is vital that FEMA approve this request immediately so that countless Puerto Rican families, who have lost everything as a result of this catastrophic disaster, are not once again uprooted in a chaotic fashion,"" he wrote. ""If FEMA does not approve the (Puerto Rico) government's request, students currently finishing the school year in the mainland will be deprived of their education, as well as their housing."" It's not clear whether FEMA will decide to extend the program beyond May 14. The federal agency contests the assertion that it would put people out on the street by ending their assistance. The Transition Shelter Assistance program is meant to provide emergency housing in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. It is ""tragic"" so many families have had to continue to live in motels for months without other viable housing options, said Mike Byrne, FEMA's federal coordinating officer for Puerto Rico, in an interview with CNN last week. ""There comes a point when these problems are no longer really disaster problems but are social problems,"" Byrne said. ""The idea that we're throwing people on the street -- there's no accuracy, there's no truth to that type of thing. ""We are doing everything we can to help these people,"" Byrne said, ""but if their home is fixed, or they have the ability to stay with family or friends... and they choose that they don't want to go back (to Puerto Rico), then, quite frankly, they fall out of this program"" offering motel rental assistance. ""They've made a decision not to use the assistance that we've provided,"" he said. ""That's their decision. And this is a free country."" Applicants can lose the FEMA motel vouchers if their homes in Puerto Rico are found to be livable, after inspection; or if FEMA finds they have other viable housing options, such as friends they could live with, among other requirements, said Byrne. Those restrictions were at least temporarily lifted to allow disaster victims to keep getting assistance until next month. Evacuees should contact FEMA if they believe their case was handled unfairly, Byrne said, and individual aid may be extended beyond May 14 if warranted. Transitional Shelter Assistance isn't the only FEMA program stirring controversy, however. Another FEMA program, called Direct Lease, could pay for longer-term rentals, which advocates say would be more humane and prevent homelessness among evacuees. That FEMA housing program, however, has not been made available to Hurricane Maria evacuees living in Florida or other US states. FEMA is offering that assistance only to evacuees who return to Puerto Rico, or to people who never left the island. FEMA will go so far as to pay for a person's flight back to the Caribbean island, Byrne said. No one has taken the agency up on that offer yet, he said. Asked why the Direct Lease program is not offered in Florida, Byrne at first said that he believed Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló had not requested it. CNN, however, obtained a January 31 letter to FEMA from a member of the Rosselló administration requesting Direct Lease assistance for ""eligible evacuees from Puerto Rico not only here on the island, but also for those located across the United States."" In response, Byrne said it would not be prudent to provide long-term lease payments for people living in Florida rather than in the territory directly hit by the disaster. In his lengthy career, which has included working on the response to Superstorm Sandy and other emergencies, FEMA had never provided long-term housing in that way, he said. ""The reason they are eligible (for FEMA assistance) is because they had a home in Puerto Rico. And so we're going to provide the option of a home in Puerto Rico,"" he said. In the void, at least in part, there's Millie. She receives many of the evacuees' tearful phone calls. They knock on her motel door late at night. She tries to counsel her neighbors and new friends as they are evicted and struggle to find affordable housing -- a process some evacuees described as so stressful it had induced panic attacks. And she coordinates with community advocates and aid organizations. In short: She's trying to help others before herself. ""The captain is always the last to leave the ship,"" she said. Researchers fear an 'exodus' from Puerto Rico Central Florida long has been a destination for Puerto Ricans. The island is a US commonwealth home to 3.3 million American citizens, and residents can move freely to the 50 states without visas or other documentation. New York once was seen as the mecca for Puerto Rico outmigration. It's been eclipsed more recently by Florida, in part because of the warm climate that's more similar to Puerto Rico and also because of what community advocates call the ""Disney Dream"" -- a fairy-tale vision of Orlando and its theme parks. Puerto Rico was suffering a massive and unprecedented population loss before Hurricane Maria hit, largely because of a debt crisis that bankrupted the island's government and crippled the economy. After Maria, some demographers told CNN they feared an ""exodus"" lasting many years, with repercussions for Puerto Rico and for host communities on the mainland. As CNN reported in February, Florida -- particularly the Orlando-Kissimmee area -- appears to be the top destination for Maria evacuees. That assessment is based on a review of FEMA disaster assistance data and US Postal Service change-of-address requests from Puerto Rico. While it's impossible to say exactly how many people fled the island after the storm, estimates range from thousands to more than 100,000. In Florida alone, the state's department of education told CNN this week that nearly 12,000 new students from Puerto Rico have enrolled in public schools in the months since Hurricane Maria. The two top school districts for enrollees in Florida were Orange County, which includes Orlando, and Osceola County, which is home to Kissimmee. Evacuees are arriving to find that Orlando and Kissimmee offer anything but the ""Disney Dream"" they imagined -- or that they saw on vacations and heard about from relatives. Like many cities in the United States, Orlando and Kissimmee suffer from a crippling affordable-housing shortage, making it difficult if not impossible for evacuees to find stable housing outside of motels. A March report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition named Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford the third-worst large metro area in the nation in terms of affordable housing availability. For every 100 renters needing low-income housing, the report said, only 17 units are available. Government housing programs are not meeting needs, either. The Orlando Housing Authority told CNN it had 18 units -- total -- available when the storm hit. Neither that housing authority nor Osceola County, which includes Kissimmee, had any new and available Section 8 vouchers that could be used by evacuees. Those vouchers let recipients search for subsidized housing. Only evacuees who brought Section 8 vouchers from Puerto Rico could qualify to transfer those vouchers, according to Vivian Bryant, president and CEO of the Orlando Housing Authority. ""We haven't received a new allocation of Section 8 vouchers,"" Bryant said. ""We are 101% leased up. We don't even have anything we can offer anybody."" Non-profits and churches are strained, too. There are currently no open shelter beds for homeless people in the Orlando metro area, said Martha Are, executive director of the Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. Additionally, the one shelter that serves homeless people in Osceola County, where many evacuees live along US Highway 192, takes only domestic-violence victims, she said. So if evacuees came to a shelter after getting kicked off the FEMA motel program, would they be turned away? CNN asked. ""That's right,"" she said. With federal help lacking, the financial burden of helping Maria evacuees in Florida is falling -- and falling hard -- on churches and non-profits, said Rev. Jose Rodriguez, from Iglesia Episcopal Jesús de Nazaret in Orlando. His congregation had been helping pay the rent of some Puerto Rico evacuees who lost or were not granted FEMA motel assistance, he said. But in mid-April the church had run out of grant money and donations, he said, and would have to stop assisting evacuees at least temporarily. In his view, FEMA is leaning too much on goodwill. ""They're homeless. They're couch surfing,"" he said of evacuees. Programs that should be helping them transition to a stable life in Florida are ""failing them,"" he said. Sociologists have documented what they call ""disaster fatigue"" that sets in months after an event like Hurricane Maria. People who may have been inclined to donate to Puerto Rico immediately after the September storm may not realize, or care, that needs continue so many months later, both on and off the island. Advocates in Florida worry that this fatigue may be without remedy. Meanwhile, the influx of Puerto Rican evacuees is expected to continue. Thousands of homes on the island have not had power in seven months. Just this week, the entire island was temporarily without electricity in a major blackout. Eight people, two beds, one motel room At dawn, the kids walk out of motels to bus stops on a highway. Some are the children of Maria. Their homes were damaged or destroyed when the September hurricane smashed into Puerto Rico; they were left without power or running water, often both, for months; their parents were left jobless, or without clear job prospects on the island; and many of their schools were closed. In short: They fled for a safer, better life. Florida said they were welcome. ""As Puerto Rico rebuilds, Florida remains committed to doing everything we can to help the families impacted by Hurricane Maria and aid in the recovery process,"" Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement issued October 2, the same day Florida declared a state of emergency in reference to the arrival of Puerto Rican migrants. Millie, the ""mayor"" of the Super 8 in Kissimmee, said she heard via social media that Florida planned to welcome evacuees and help them enroll in schools. She ran a day care -- named ""El Palacio de los Niños,"" or The Children's Palace -- in Carolina, a town not far from San Juan. She needed to find a personal generator to keep it operational. She came to Florida, she said, to enroll her kids in school and to sort out how to reopen her business. Later, however, inspectors closed the daycare because of her absence and because the facility lacked power and running water, she said. That's when she decided to stay here. Perhaps it's her experience with that daycare -- the parents of her students still send her photos from Puerto Rico; she misses the kids dearly -- that prepared her for the role of caring for evacuees. With so many people in need, she felt like she had to help. She does so joyfully, laughing as often as she cries. Asked if there were some evacuees she hadn't been able to help adequately, she responded: CNN interviewed more than a dozen evacuees in the Orlando and Tampa metro areas. Few expressed any desire to return to Puerto Rico. And despite the difficulties they've had adjusting to motel life, many were grateful to FEMA, charitable organizations and family members who had given them places to stay. Dacny L. Quintero Segarra talked about the situation on the walkway outside her motel room in the Baymont Inn and Suites on US Highway 192 in Kissimmee -- a stretch of road, also known as Vine Street, that's home to at least 10 motels listed by FEMA as accepting motel vouchers. She had a Walmart bag tied over her hair. Beneath it, she had applied an ointment, she said, to stop the rest of her hair from falling out. She attributes the problem to stress. ""I feel like this is Narnia,"" she said -- like everything is turned around. ""The housing situation is very, very, very bad,"" she said. ""Everything is a 'no.' They say they're going to help you but we've only helped each other -- Puerto Ricans banding together. I'm not interested in material things. All I want is shelter for my kids."" Quintero told CNN that FEMA offered her a free flight back to Puerto Rico. ""If I tell them I want to go back to Puerto Rico, they would say, 'Here's the money, buy your tickets.' But it's not just that. I want to live here,"" she said, primarily because there are jobs and schools. Downstairs, her parents, Alfredo Quintero and Dacny Segarra, who goes by the same name as her daughter, live in a room with wide doors to accommodate Alfredo's wheelchair. The elder Dacny said she had stopped taking medicine she needs to prevent blood clots because she has no health insurance in Florida and can't afford the pills without it. She said she was hospitalized in Florida because of blood clots in her legs. The older couple was told this week that they would lose FEMA assistance after April 20. That was before FEMA announced the extension into May -- an announcement that came the day before their scheduled eviction. Carlos Lara Santos, who is raising a baby girl, Valentina, born on April 2, already knew he'd get to stay until May 14, he told CNN. The family is living in the Super 8 with seven children, including the newborn. ""If you have a home, it's comfortable, the conditions are better,"" he said. ""If you have to raise a child in a hotel room, it's not the same."" Without FEMA assistance, some families end up in a cycle of motel eviction and debt. Liza Hernandez had been living in a two-bedroom unit at the Super 8 in Kissimmee with seven of her relatives. Initially, the family got help with hotel fees from FEMA, she said, but that ran out. They were able to start paying for the Super 8 on their own because three of the eight family members work. Then the hotel rate went up to $113.40 per night. The family fled to the Unno Boutique Hotel -- $50.22 per night. There, all eight were crammed into one room with two beds. They haven't been able to find an apartment, she said. At the other end of the highway, near a gift shop shaped like a massive orange -- ""Welcome to Florida: Take Some Home"" -- and another shop shaped like a wizard, Yamil Rodriguez was staying in a Holiday Inn. He said he had been putting the room on a credit card, and the hotel staff had been nice enough not to run the charge. He knew it wouldn't last, though. ""I'm waiting for a miracle,"" he said. On April 9, he sent a panicked message to a reporter. ""I'm on the street right now."" Rodriguez landed in another motel later that night. He and several other evacuees expressed gratitude toward the hotels that have housed them these past months. Many know the names of their housekeepers and greet them with hugs. Rodriguez said the Holiday Inn was kind to let the family stay as long as it did. Some Maria migrants know friends or family members in Florida and stay with them -- at least for a time. ""There's a saying in Spanish: 'After three days, the dead start to smell,"" said Julio, 53, who had been living, along with his wife and five of his six children, with a niece near Tampa. ""The house is getting small."" The landlord threatened to evict all of them on April 15, including the niece, if Julio and his family didn't move elsewhere, he said. By April 19, he'd moved to Jacksonville to live with his adult son and to look for work. The place is too small for all of them, he said, so his wife and five kids are still living with the niece in secret. ""It's like they're hiding out,"" he said. (CNN is not using Julio's last name in order to protect the family.) Julio expected to start work through a job placement service later this week. He hopes to save up enough money so they might get their own place -- eventually. ""Thank God we're alive, you know, so we can continue on this journey,"" Julio said. Still, this sort of uncertainty can be exhausting -- and potentially dangerous. Melissa, a young mother of three, said her home in Puerto Rico was so damaged that she initially slept on the floor of her mother-in-law's house on the island. That situation became untenable so she decided to come to Florida. She didn't know anyone here well enough to ask for a place to stay, she said, so she slept in the airport in Orlando. ( The Florida governor ordered welcome centers be established in major airports in the state; Melissa, whose full name CNN is withholding to protect the privacy of her children, said she did not see the welcome center in Orlando). In total, her family has lived in six locations since Hurricane Maria, she said. In March, when she lost FEMA motel assistance, she and her husband slept in their cars with their children, ages 4 and 9, for three nights. ""FEMA just told me, 'Call the Red Cross or look for a shelter,'"" she said. FEMA declined to comment on individual circumstances, citing privacy laws. Melissa posted a praying-hands emoji and a cryptic plea for help on her Facebook page. A friend responded with a temporary place to stay. She wore out her welcome before ending up back in motels. Now the family is paying $500 per month, she said, to rent a single bedroom in a house. She's not sure how long that will last, but it's better than paying weekly motel fees. ""I'm really thankful for the help we've gotten,"" said Melissa. ""They gave me jackets and blankets and supplies. The school treated us well. ""But FEMA? When there are children, you can't let people sleep on the street. It's not the same for an adult to be on the street as for kids to be."" 'This could have been done far more humanely' Disaster experts, community advocates and Democratic politicians are similarly critical. The longer children live in motels the more likely they are to be exposed to ""toxic stress"" that can contribute to long-term problems in school and mental health issues, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York. ""It is an extremely urgent matter to get these families with their children into a stable situation that is predictable and reestablish a sense of routine,"" he said. Redlener said motels don't do that. ""It's an extremely makeshift, temporary answer to a very complex problem,"" he said. ""It doesn't work for long, living in a motel, especially a crowded motel. It is a terrible situation for a young child."" People who flee disasters often think they will be able to escape trauma by relocating, he said, but that rarely proves to be the case. The hurricane follows them. The best way to help disaster survivors recover, he said, is to provide longer-term apartment housing. FEMA does offer a ""Rental Assistance"" program for hurricane victims, both in Puerto Rico and in the 50 states. The agency has allocated $121 million to that effort, but officials told CNN they were unable to say how many recipients of that assistance were living in the states versus Puerto Rico. The program provides disaster survivors with a monthly rental payment for up to 18 months, depending on eligibility. That payment, however, according to a FEMA spokesperson, is based on the rental market in the community where the person lived at the time of the disaster, not where they are currently living. That means a person who fled Puerto Rico for Florida would get paid a rental stipend based on the rental market in Puerto Rico, the spokesperson said, not that of Florida, which is far more expensive. The fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is $530 per month, according to a US Department of Housing and Urban Development index. In Osceola County, Florida, it's $1,096 -- more than double. Those amounts can be adjusted depending on family circumstances and other factors. As for the Transitional Shelter Assistance program, more than 7,000 applicants have gotten motel vouchers as part of the Hurricane Maria recovery, according to FEMA. About 2,700 applicants still were staying in motels as of mid-April, nearly seven months later, according to Byrne, the FEMA official in Puerto Rico. Nearly 40% of those current residents are in Florida. In all, FEMA has spent $64.4 million on the motel program for Maria victims. ""Just like a shelter is not intended to be a long-term solution for somebody, a hotel room... was never intended to be a long-term solution,"" said Byrne, the FEMA official. ""What we work hard at is to provide overarching case management to these families... to help them find a way back into their home (in Puerto Rico)."" He added, ""I don't think anybody wants to stay in a hotel.... It gets old fast. Imagine if you had your whole family with you in a one-room hotel. We want to try to find another solution for those people (who are still living in hotels) as quickly as possible."" Without more transitional help, however, hurricane victims ""fall off a cliff"" when they're booted from motels, said Rodriguez, the Episcopal priest in Orlando. ""Stop kicking this can down the road and just give them permanent housing,"" he said. ""There needs to be a game plan. It's a waste of taxpayer money to be dumping money into hotel stays."" The whiplash of the threatened voucher cutoffs and last-minute extensions causes unnecessary turmoil for disaster survivors, he said. ""We have three weeks for people to find homes,"" he said, referring to the May 14 FEMA cutoff. ""They lost a week in panic, now we have three weeks to find them homes. How are we going to house over 1,000 people?"" ""We still have these families who are going to have to vacate before the end of the school year,"" he added. The fact that the Direct Lease program -- which can provide housing for 18 months or sometimes longer -- is offered in Puerto Rico, but not in Florida, has been criticized by US Rep. Darren Soto, a Democrat who represents Kissimmee and central Florida. ""This could have been done far more humanely if the Trump administration would have approved long-term lease vouchers,"" Soto told CNN. ""It would have allowed these people to save up enough money for a deposit and live in a far more humane environment. ""It's not a priority for the White House to have these (longer-term housing programs) approved,"" Soto said. ""Otherwise it easily would have been done."" FEMA officials have said repeatedly that they're handling Hurricane Maria's recovery as they would any other storm of this magnitude, regardless of the fact that Puerto Rico is not a US state, does not have voting members in the US Congress -- and that its residents can't vote for president. Chris Currie, director of emergency management issues at the US Government Accountability Office, said there are no rules barring FEMA from offering longer-term Direct Lease assistance in Florida. ""I don't see anything in the guidance or statutes that restricts where they could purchase or lease units for direct housing assistance,"" Currie said. ""There is nothing that would just absolutely bar them from that. ""Whether they decide to use it -- or it makes sense -- is a whole other story."" On a recent afternoon, Millie and a friend visited evacuee motels up and down US Highway 192 in Kissimmee. They wanted to raise awareness about a job fair and rally hosted by the group Vamos4PR, which, like the Hispanic Federation, Latino Leadership, Inc., and others, has been trying to help Puerto Rican evacuees in central Florida. On one of the stops, she pulled into the Radisson parking lot and hollered out the window of her blue minivan: ""Hola! Tú eres Boricua?"" she asked. Are you Puerto Rican? Yes, a young mother, Raysha Vargas, answered. Her daughter, age 2, walked across a yellow speedbump in the hotel parking lot. The girl extended her arms to the left and right, like a gymnast teetering on a balance beam. Are you on FEMA assistance? Yes, the woman said. For now.","With no running water, no power and no school for her kids, Carmen ""Millie"" Santiago fled Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean last fall.

Fortnite Live, held February 16-17 in the English city of Norwich, billed itself as the ultimate Fortnite Battle Royale!, which would feature stuff like dance battles, activities like archery and rock-climbing, big-screen broadcasts of YouTubers and banks of PCs available to play Fortnite on.
Tickets cost between £12-20 (USD$15-25), and just under 3000 kids showed up for the party. Entry for anyone not in possession of an early bird pass was massively delayedorganisers blamed staff shortagesbut once inside things didnt improve.
The Guardian reports that despite the attendance figures There was...only space for four children to practice archery at the same time and just one climbing wall tower with room for three climbers.
Attendees reported that the PC section cost money to play, despite Fortnite being a free-to-play title that kids could have been playing for nothing at home. Disappointed parents have been leaving messages on the shows Facebook page like:
It was terrible, what an absolute disaster.... not like advertised!! We went for the early bird but some stuff wasnt even set up!! The best thing about the event was the burger I had!! My son wanted to leave!! And As for the organiser saying it went well, what an absolute joke.
I have got tickets for tomorrow not taking my son to get upset want a refund like everybody else does
Its awful. I have a very disappointed 9-year old. They should be ashamed.

David Choi,"President Donald Trump was reportedly briefed on a proposal that would divert $13.9 billion from civil-works projects, including reconstruction efforts in Puerto Rico, to build a barrier on the US-Mexico border, according to multiple news reports published Thursday. 
 The funds from the Army Corps of Engineers had not yet been distributed, but with a national emergency declaration, Trump would be able to procure the barrier funding that Democrats have adamantly opposed, officials told CNN and NBC News. 
 The plan would reportedly allow Trump to utilize the $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion set aside for civil projects ranging from flood prevention in California, to reconstruction efforts in the hurricane-affected US territory of Puerto Rico. 
 An independent study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government estimated roughly 2,975 people died in the wake of Hurricane Maria. While many of the victims were believed to have died in the aftermath of the storm, such as floods and flying debris, other people were reportedly affected by the lack of local infrastructure, including electricity, clean water, and medical services.

Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a barrier on the border has been rejected by Democrats, blocking the passage of an appropriations bill that would reopen the ongoing partial government shutdown. Democrats have asserted they would pass a bill that includes funding for additional border security measures, but not the money Trump wants build a border wall. 
 Trump was reportedly briefed that the Army Corps of Engineers could build 315 miles of the border wall in around 18 months, which is more than the 234 miles he initially requested. Democrats may still have an option to oppose the move, a source explained to NBC News, by blocking the reallocation through legislation. 
 After weeks of the shutdown, Trump appears likelier to invoke executive authority to declare a national emergency, a move Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham supported. 
 ""Time for President [Donald Trump] to use emergency powers to build Wall/Barrier,"" Graham tweeted on Thursday. ""I hope it works."" 
 Trump and other White House officials have teased the option numerous times in recent days, saying the president would make the declaration if Congress does not give in to his wall funding. 
 ""Well, I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days, they should do it immediately,"" Trump said on Thursday. ""Look, we're not going anywhere. We're not changing our minds. Because there's nothing to change your mind about.""","President Donald Trump was reportedly briefed on a proposal that would divert $13.9 billion from civil works projects, including reconstruction efforts in Puerto Rico, to build a barrier on the US-Mexico border.

Rachel Premack,"The vast majority of Americans are unprepared or underprepared for a natural disaster. At least that's what they said in a recent poll from Business Insider partner MSN found. MSN surveyed Americans on their emergency preparedness. It then used machine learning and big data, such as the census, to model how a representative sample of the US would have responded. It's as accurate as a traditional scientific survey, MSN said. According to the poll, only three in ten Americans say they have an emergency preparedness kit, 42% of Americans say they're not at all prepared for a disaster, and 46% say they're only prepared a little. What's perhaps more troubling, some parts of America are even less prepared than this. In 16 states, 25% or fewer residents said they have an emergency preparedness kit. In those same states, almost half of the population said they're not at all prepared for disaster, while more than 40% said they're a little prepared. States prone to disasters tend to be more concerned about disasters. The majority of South Carolinians, for example, say they understand the need to prepare for hurricanes. Unsurprisingly, South Carolina is also one of the most prepared states. But this isn't always the case. Families in Washington, DC — which is considered a high-risk area for natural disasters — are the least likely to have an emergency kit or to report being prepared for a disaster. While flooding, hurricanes, and other disasters are less likely in certain areas, scientists say that climate change will destabilize the weather patterns we've come to expect. A climate change report by scientists from 13 federal agencies concluded that the hurricanes will increase in the Atlantic, Pacific, and eastern North Pacific. A hotter, drier climate is also starting to exacerbate wildfires, like the destructive ones in California last year. The costliest year on record for natural disasters was 2017, with $306 billion spent nationwide to provide aid and relief and recuperate weather-related damage And rising sea levels could flood Facebook's headquarters, Harvard Business School, New Orleans, and other major US cities and institutions.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Wednesday afternoon, the Florida panhandle was hit with Hurricane Michael. It began as a Category 4 hurricane, and was placed in Category 3 by the time it reached Georgiaunprecedented for the area. Powerful winds and rains are expected throughout Thursday and Friday through North Carolina. One thing you can do to help in the long term is vote out climate change deniers this November. But for immediate aid, here are some places you can donate who are supporting people on the ground. GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots that work to restore areas hit by disasters, and their Hurricane Michael Relief Fund can be found here. They have a current goal of two million dollars, some of which will be directed toward immediate needs, and they also direct money to rebuilding efforts. World Vision works with local groups as well, though many of them seem to be churches in the area. This might be an effective strategy, as houses of worship often serve as shelters during storms. World Vision is putting together food, clean water, personal hygiene items, flood cleanup kits and more for families. They are not based in Florida, but seem to run programs worldwide. You can donate here. Volunteer Florida is urging people to register as volunteers in Florida with them to support Hurricane Michael victims, and suggesting the Disaster Fund as a place to donate money. The Fund is Floridas official private fund for helping communities recover from disasters. Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. They already have a number of members in North Carolina who are still helping with recovery efforts after Hurricane Florence. You can help them out here. Recommended by Charity Navigator, this group is a network of non-denominational evangelical Christian churches that has a long history of responding to disasters. They have equipment stationed and ready to move in along the Gulf Coast and in Albany, GA, according to their website. Direct Relief is also noted on Charity Navigator for their commitment to financial transparency. They are also firmly unaffiliated with any religion or political group and say they provide aid to anyone in need without regard to politics, religion, ethnic identities or ability to pay. They support in part almost 200 health facilities in Michaels path, and have outfitted ten of them with emergency medical packs in anticipation of the storm. You can donate here. Americares is a health-focused humanitarian organization. They announced on Twitter that they have deployed an emergency response to team to Florida.

Scott Davis,"The Cleveland Cavaliers season is all but finished, as they trail 3-0 to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals — a lead that has never been overcome in NBA history. The Cavs are now on the clock for what could be a franchise-altering summer, as LeBron James hits free agency and could leave Cleveland for the second time in his career. The Cavs have known James leaving again was a possibility all along, so they tried to build the best team around him for the past four years. It's tough to build a team ready to win now but also prepared for the future, and James has caused some of this problem. James has continually taken one-year deals, both as a means to maximize his earnings and keep the pressure on the team to keep them from getting content. But if James leaves this summer, the situation is particularly bleak for Cleveland because of the way they built the team around James. With a few high-salary stars — James, Kevin Love, and previously Kyrie Irving — teams like the Cavs have little choice but to re-sign valuable role players because they have few methods of replacing them. In the case of the Cavs, that meant handing out large contracts to players who played important complementary roles to their stars. Four years, $82 million to Tristan Thompson. Four years, $57 million to J.R. Smith. They had previously re-signed Iman Shumpert to a $40 million contract, though he was traded to the Sacramento Kings this season. The Cavs' trade-deadline-blowup brought back several high-salary players as well. George Hill signed a three-year, $57 million contract last summer. Jordan Clarkson signed a four-year, $50 million contract in 2016. The Cavs have swallowed the tax penalties for carrying such salaries because James has proven to be a walking Finals appearance. But what happens if the league's most dominant player walks away? The Cavs will be left with a stack of salaries, a middling team, and few ways out of the mess other than just waiting. If James departs this offseason, the Cavs may look to trade Love. Love is due another $50 million over the next two years and may not be a good enough individual talent to bring the Cavs much more than a low playoff seed. Love is perhaps the only player on the roster for which the Cavs could receive value in a trade. Likewise, the Cavs would have an incentive to be bad if James leaves. Their 2019 draft pick is top-10 protected but goes to the Atlanta Hawks if it falls outside of the top 10. If James goes to another team, the Cavs will want that pick to land in the top 10 to kickstart a rebuild. Ridding themselves of James and Love's salaries would clear up nearly $60 million for this offseason (though it would depend on who the Cavs got in return in a Love trade), but the Cavs wouldn't be in any position to be much of a free agent market. It would be difficult to trade the contracts of Hill, Thompson, and Smith without giving up something like a future pick, a move no team facing a rebuild should ever do. In the end, the Cavs will have almost no choice but to be patient and wait out some of these contracts. Salary-cap relief could finally come in 2020, but that would essentially be the start of the rebuild — the point at which the Cavs can rid themselves of some of those deals, and build around players they've drafted while making free-agent signings. It's a harsh reality for a team that has ruled a conference for four years, but few perennial championship contenders have ever had a smooth fall from grace.","LeBron James could leave the Cleveland Cavaliers in free agency this summer.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption More than 350,000 people have been killed in Syria's seven-year war Members of the UN have expressed dismay over Syria becoming president of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva. The move comes just weeks after the latest reported chemical weapons attack, in which the Syrian authorities are widely believed to have used chemical agents against civilians. ""The UK deplores the fact that Syria will assume the presidency of the Conference on Disarmament, given the regime's consistent and flagrant disregard of international non-proliferation and disarmament norms and agreements,"" said a statement by British diplomats. Meanwhile, Robert Wood, Washington's ambassador in Geneva, tweeted: ""Monday, May 28 will be one of the darkest days in the history of the Conference on Disarmament with Syria beginning its four-week presidency. The Damascus regime has neither the credibility nor moral authority to preside over the CD. The international community must not be silent."" In an earlier tweet, he called on Russia to ask Syria to step aside. That appeal appears to have met with no response. PR disaster? So is this is a public relations disaster for the United Nations? A sign the body is dysfunctional? UN officials have been wearily pointing out that the rotating presidency system was devised by member states, primarily to prevent more powerful countries constantly jockeying for position. Syria takes over from Switzerland simply because it follows Switzerland in the alphabetical list of member states. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The US ambassador called it one of the conference's ""darkest days"" And the Conference on Disarmament is not even a UN body, but holds its meetings at the UN in Geneva. ""Even the secretary general himself cannot change the system,"" said one UN official. ""It has to be changed by member states."" Nevertheless it was the CD which painstakingly negotiated the convention banning chemical weapons, which was signed by Syria. The prospect of Syria sitting in the president's chair, when there is widespread evidence that it has used nerve gas against its own people, is to many people shocking. Under watch So is there a way to prevent Syria taking up the presidency? Not easily, as the UK acknowledges later on in its statement, pointing out that it would ""require consensus amongst all CD members, Syria included, for Syria not to take on the presidency, so we cannot stop that happening. ""What we will do is ensure the Syrian presidency cannot inflict damage on the work of the Conference of Disarmament and its subsidiary bodies."" Quite what action the UK, the US, or other member states are planning to take remains unclear, though it is expected that further expressions of concern will be voiced during the conference session on Tuesday. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Syria is suspected of carrying out chemical attacks, something it strongly denies Ensuring the Syrian presidency ""cannot inflict damage"" on CD work will not be too difficult. The CD has been stalled on all major issues for many years now, something UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres lamented just last week, pointing out that it had ""produced very little"" for decades, and calling for it be ""reinvigorated"". But one thing the CD did produce is that convention on chemical weapons, and out of that convention came the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The OPCW is investigating Syria on numerous counts, and believes that chemical weapons were used, or were more than likely to have been used, in 14 cases so far. Every single use is a crime under international law. Widespread use, of which there is evidence in Syria, is likely a crime against humanity. So Syria may sit in the ceremonial president's chair for four weeks in Geneva, presiding over a body which has no pressing business before it, but it won't, in the words of one disarmament analyst ""be let off the hook"".","The country, which is accused of chemical attacks, takes the helm of global forum on arms control.",2018-05-28T10:05:29Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Anger as Syria heads global disarmament body,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44279149,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/27D5/production/_101779101_mediaitem101779099.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1

Matt Simon,"Even in retirement, Chimp the robot’s still got it. The giant red humanoid crouches down like a Transformer to roll on all fours, then stands up and slowly approaches a door. It sees its world by coating it in lasers, allowing Chimp to reach for the handle, delicately turn it, and roll through the entry. Two and a half years after Chimp competed in the Darpa Robotics Challenge, it remains one of the weirdest humanoid robots on Earth. But that weirdness is Chimp’s strength. It’s a glimpse into a future that’s teeming with machines you’d never expect. And really, to a large degree those machines have already begun to arrive. Chimp was born at the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon, the product of just 13 months’ work by a team of 30 humans. They pieced it together specifically for the Robotics Challenge which … challenged roboticists to construct humanoids that could tackle a disaster situation. They'd have to navigate an environment built for humans, turning valves and climbing ladders and even driving a cart. But Chimp didn’t look like its peers—hulking machines that walked, usually poorly, like humans. “We didn't really feel that walking was strictly necessary,” says Mike Vandeweghe, lead robotics engineer at CMU. “So we sought to design something that would be more stable over rough terrain."" Specifically, something that could roll around, then stand up to free its upper limbs to manipulate objects. Such are the liberties of biomimicry. You’re more than welcome to replicate how a human looks and moves as closely as possible. But maybe that’s not the best way to go about things. Balancing on two legs is both technically difficult and energy intensive. So Chimp just avoids the problem entirely, transforming itself into a quadruped to roll around on super-stable tank treads. Which is not to say that a robot walking on two legs won’t have a place in this world. For instance, Boston Dynamics’ Atlas humanoid—which was also developed for the Darpa Challenge—has literally grown in leaps and bounds over the last two and a half years. It can now jump from box to box, then do a backflip off a ledge. Not that that would do it any good in a rescue situation, necessarily. But dexterous bipeds will certainly serve some purpose. And really, they’re closer than you might think. A bipedal robot called Cassie is for the time being just a pair of legs, but its creators hope the robot will be a workhorse that schleps goods where wheeled robots can’t. Up stairs and across uneven terrain, for instance. Cassie the robot may look like a disembodied pair of birds legs, but that's just coincidence. Like Chimp, Cassie is interesting because its designers didn’t set out to explicitly mimic something in nature: Its creators only set out to mathematically model the most stable and efficient form they could manage. What they ended up with just so happened to look a lot like a disembodied pair of ostrich legs. So, there are lots of ways for a humanoid robot to get around. And if Cassie's ostrich legs or Chimp's treads leave them lacking some core capabilities, well, it'll be OK. Because roboticists are embracing an idea called multiplicity, in which robots work closely with humans. That’s in contrast to the singularity, in which hyper-advanced AI take over the world and mistreat humanity. Chimp is what you might call a semi-autonomous machine. It sees its world with stereo cameras and builds a map by coating its surroundings in lasers, so during the Darpa Challenge it could do things like cut a hole in a wall on its own. “But for other higher-level things, for driving the vehicle, for navigating through the course, we left that up to the human,” says Vandeweghe. “Chimp's operation really is a partnership between the robot and some limited autonomy and then a human in the loop making the higher-level decisions.” That partnership is key, because for the moment, and for a long while to come, robots are going to need our help. Security robots and robot nurses are already joining the ranks of human employees—but that doesn’t mean they’re ready to take care of themselves. There are even call centers now where humans answer distress calls from trapped robots, taking command of their systems and guiding them out of trouble. Will a humanoid one day explore disaster zones like melted-down nuclear reactors? Perhaps. But good luck convincing Chimp to come out of retirement for that.","Two and a half years after Chimp competed in the Darpa Robotics Challenge, it remains one of the weirdest humanoid robots on Earth.",2018-01-29T17:29:54Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","The Legend of Chimp, the Vaguely Humanoid Robot",https://www.wired.com/story/the-legend-of-chimp-the-vaguely-humanoid-robot/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a6a87152c3a6112ee631cbe/191:100/pass/STILL-02.jpg,wired,Wired,1

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Is failure a near-certainty in your business? That seems to be the case for software projects, at least, because a surprising number of them don't work.
In fact, companies are learning to expect a dismal outcome: In a study, Geneca found that 75 percent of business and IT executives surveyed admitted that their projects were either ""always"" or ""usually “doomed"" right from the start.”
Related: 2018 Software Development Trends That You Can Count on Continuing Into 2019
But if software is an integral part of your business, failure is the last thing you need. Maybe you’re developing a software as a service (SaaS) app. Or a bespoke customer relationship management (CRM) tool tailored to your company’s needs. So if that's the case and your objective is to serve customers, proficiency during the development phase is key. In that regard, how do you avoid disaster?
Answer: You avoid the following traps:
Insufficient time to complete the project
It’s not uncommon for companies to set unrealistic and arbitrary deadlines for their software projects without adequate data or reason to back up the decisions. Further, estimates are sometimes made hastily without consulation with the programmers to determine how much time they require for the project.
In short, companies are often in too much of a rush to get their software projects completed. And that's a problem because allowing insufficient time means sacrificing design and usability for the sake of completion. A broken or difficult-to-use software module often proves unusable.
Fortunately, this problem is easily solved by allowing time for planning before anyone writes a single line of code. If the developers are aware of the scope and parameters of the project and have had enough time to plan, they’ll be better able to meet the deadlines you set.
Inadequate planning
In 2016, Innotas found that 55 percent of IT professionals surveyed indicated they'd had a project fail due to lack of time, staff, resources and budget. The overall success rate has improved somewhat since then, but only marginally.
Myriad things, of course, can go wrong when it comes to planning and ensuring the right resources are in place to guarantee project completion. Many companies simply don’t realize how long a project will take or how much it will cost, and that often leads to unrealistic expectations.
One of the best ways to cut down on required planning is to ensure the active involvement of senior management from start to finish. The project requirements and scope often change midway through a project, so whoever will ultimately sign off should be actively involved in planning and execution.
Related: Why Tech Companies Need a Code of Ethics for Software Development
Unclear project requirements
Project specifications should be laid out at the early stages of planning. Unfortunately, it’s possible that managers and executives weren’t clear on the scope of the project to begin with, thereby leaving developers unsure of what features would be needed.
For instance, if the project is being built by developers who don’t understand how the software will need to scale, they’ll be unsure as to how to cater to your company’s increasing demands.
Working with a professional team with a proven track record of scaling software can make a difference -- Tivix is a good example. After all, you don’t want to just build your software and hope that it will stand up to the test of time. You want to make sure that it does.
Too many people assigned to the project
To cope with a lagging schedule, project managers frequently add more team members to work on a project. Logically speaking, this should speed up the project to meet deadlines. But just as having too few people on the project is problematic, too many people can result in failure, too.
First, adding more people to the project is costly. Second, it can result in compromised quality, because with more people come more opportunities for misunderstandings and unclear communication. In addition, issues sometimes arise when companies integrate different sections of code written by project members who joined the project at different times.
If a project is already late, adding more people probably won’t do anything to rectify that problem, especially if the new staff need to be brought up to speed. Instead, the best way of handling this situation is to determine up-front the correct number of people who should work on the project.
Lack of testing
A lack of proper planning and insufficient time for it usually lead to little or no testing. But if you know anything about software, you know that it should be tested for bugs. When there’s a lot of pressure to deliver on a project at a certain time, testing is typically the first thing to be abandoned.
If the software doesn’t function properly, and anticipated features are broken or crash unexpectedly, your customers are going to be unimpressed -- or worse.
Sometimes, companies choose to test their software in its own production environment. Unfortunately, this can lead to security breaches. All testing should be completed in an environment that’s separate from production.
Testing should also be carried out throughout the entire development lifecycle, with each component tested as it is completed. Naturally, you will also need to allot adequate time.
Failure to find a good project manager
A lack of time and planning, an absence of resources and an insufficient budget are all common reasons for failures with software. But the lack of a competent project manager is a particularly key, and recurring, problem.
Communication is a must for completing a project on time, so, without a project manager, a project will likely become disjointed and ambiguous. If no one on your team has the skills required to push through a development project, you may want to look into hiring outside consultants who can deliver the results you’re looking for.

"Special to USA TODAY, Christopher Elliott, Special to USA TODAY","Last Slide Next Slide Many vacation rentals look more appealing on their listings than in person. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) To say that Alan Muskat's accommodations in Costa Rica were a vacation rental disaster would be an understatement. ""It was horrid,"" Muskat says. Mosquitoes buzzed through gaping holes in the screens. Termites infested the kitchen. The roof leaked. ""Worst of all, it had fleas,"" he remembers. Muskat rented the house through Airbnb and paid just $1,200 for the entire month, which seemed almost too good to be true. Turns out, it was. Vacation rental stays don't always go as planned. Sometimes, properties don't match their description. Sometimes, owners neglect to clean — or fumigate — the home. And sometimes, your money's gone. But that doesn't have to happen to you. A little pre-trip research and quick action when something goes wrong can help you avoid a replay of Muskat's vacation rental disaster. Also, don't believe everything you read. How to handle a vacation rental disaster You can avoid a vacation rental disaster by doing your homework, experts say. ""So many horror stories begin with properties that oversell themselves,"" says Jessica Vozel, who co-founded a company called Guest Hook that helps write property descriptions. ""Guests arrive to a reality that's completely different than they imagined, and the letdown from their daydreams is nearly as crushing as the rental's actual problems."" I know what that's like. I recently rented properties in Salt Lake City and Colorado Springs from Airbnb. They were substandard, at best. In Salt Lake City, the century-old home lacked basic facilities such as a washer and dryer, a reliable Internet connection and essential kitchen utensils. It looked like a college dorm room — not at all what the description promised. In Colorado Springs, when I checked in, the owner met me in person and insisted that I feed her cat every day, noting that I had ""evicted"" her from her own home by renting it. The heat worked intermittently, and the Internet connection faded in and out. Vacation rental disaster 101: Say something now! Muskat tried negotiating with the owner for several weeks before notifying Airbnb. A site such as Airbnb only allows a limited time to leave a review or file a complaint. ""By then I couldn’t even write a bad review,"" he says. ""The moral of the story is to do like Airbnb says and involve them immediately."" That's a good lesson for anyone with a vacation rental problem. Don't wait until the end of your stay to say something — or worse, until you're home. The owner, rental manager or company through which you booked your rental will have limited options for addressing your concerns by then. In the end, Airbnb offered Muskat a $522 credit for a future stay. Here's what you need to do to fix a bad rental experience: Let the the property owner know the place isn't acceptable. A phone call or text message to the owner or manager is a necessary first step. A direct, written appeal to the management company or third-party site such as Airbnb can also help. The sooner you say something, the better. Can you trust guest reviews? In both of my vacation rental disaster cases, I relied on someone else to research the properties. My mistake. I should have taken the time to review each property listing myself. I should also have consulted a site such as Google Maps to view the actual property online, instead of relying on rosy photos submitted by the property owner. What about guest reviews? You can't always trust them. To leave a review, you have to stay in the property. For many of the worst experiences, travelers turn around at the front door, which means they can't rate the property. Sites such as Airbnb also allow property owners to review guests, so there's an implied threat that if you don't leave a positive review, the owner will retaliate with a negative guest review, which will affect your ability to rent from the site in the future. Result: Many of the user-generated reviews hosted by vacation rental sites are unhelpful. In fact, my Colorado Springs host, anticipating my displeasure, launched a pre-emptive strike and left a negative review about me. Then, Airbnb sent a warning that ""Guests who receive multiple negative reviews may not be able to book a future stay on Airbnb."" Since then, I've decided to deal only with professional vacation rental managers or real estate agents. A site such as Turnkey, Vacasa or Wyndham Vacation Rentals offers higher standards and better accountability when something goes wrong. I also deleted my Airbnb account. About those vacation rental guarantees Who has them? Some third-party sites offer guarantees designed to increase your confidence in your rental. For example, Airbnb has a page explaining why you can ""trust"" its product. HomeAway has a ""book with confidence"" guarantee and FlipKey has a ""payment protection"" plan. Do these guarantees work? Sometimes. For major problems, they can be useful. But mind the fine print. Consider FlipKey's protection plan, which offers ""extra peace of mind."" But the small print reveals that you can only invoke it if you’re prevented or denied access to your rental when you check in or the property is ""misrepresented."" By that, it means ""differing substantially to what was advertised."" It doesn't apply to the cleanliness of the rental, minor differences in the location of the rental, the availability of local attractions or maintenance issues with amenities or services. How do you get a vacation rental site to help? Most successful vacation rental cases use a combination of the vaguely worded guarantee and pressure applied to the owner or manager. While imprecise guarantees may allow vacation rental managers to squirm out of some situations, a direct appeal to address a problem ""in the interests of good customer service"" can lead to a speedy resolution.

JEFFERY C. MAYS,"After Hurricane Maria, Mr. Bonilla, who lived in Toa Baja, P.R., began having trouble breathing. He was taken to a hospital, which ran out of oxygen. At another hospital, the generator providing electricity for his ventilator would shut off occasionally. The official cause of death on his death certificate was sepsis. “In reality, his death was indirectly caused by the hurricane,” Ms. Bonilla said. “The hospitals were not running as usual. These stories cannot be forgotten.” Having an accurate death toll after a natural diaster helps determine the scope of the recovery effort, encouraging new resiliency efforts, while providing families closure and qualifying them for assistance, the Harvard researchers said in explaining their efforts. Jordan Sanchez, who works with the disaster relief agency SBP, said he was worried about the future because Puerto Rico is still struggling with basic tasks at the start of hurricane season, which began on Friday. Mr. Sanchez, who is Puerto Rican and has family members on the island, recently returned from his second trip there since the storm. He said families, especially in more rural areas, are still struggling to obtain power, healthy food and medical care. Normally, the aid relief effort would have already moved to the recovery and rebuilding phase. “Even a strong storm could be devastating,” Mr. Sanchez said. “But we are a resilient people, so I have to remain optimistic.”","Demonstrators at a rally outside the United Nations in Manhattan on Saturday.

Reuters,"An Algerian military plane is seen after crashing near an airport outside the capital Algiers, Algeria on April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ramzi Boudina More than 250 people were killed when a military plane crashed in a field outside Algeria's capital. It's the country's worst air disaster. Television footage showed crowds and emergency vehicles massing around the smoking and flaming wreckage. ALGIERS (Reuters) - More than 250 people were killed when a military plane crashed in a field outside Algeria's capital on Wednesday, state media said, in the country's worst air disaster. Television footage showed crowds and emergency vehicles massing around the smoking and flaming wreckage near Boufarik airport southwest of Algiers. A line of white body bags could be seen on the ground next to what media said was a Russian Ilyushin transport plane. A total of 257 people were killed, most of them military, the defence ministry said. Ten crew and other people described as family members also died, and a number of survivors were being treated at an army hospital, the ministry added. A member of Algeria's ruling FLN party told the private Ennahar TV station the dead included 26 members of Polisario, an Algerian-backed group fighting for the independence of neighboring Western Sahara - a territory also claimed by Morocco in a long-running dispute. The plane was heading to Tindouf, an area on Algeria's border with Western Sahara, but crashed on the airport's perimeter, Algeria's defence ministry said. Tindouf is home to thousands of refugees from the Western Sahara standoff, many of them Polisario supporters. U.N. attempts to broker a settlement have failed for years in the vast desert area, which has contested since 1975 when Spanish colonial powers left. Morocco claimed the territory while Polisario established its self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic there. Algeria's defence ministry issued a statement expressing condolences to families of the victims. An Air Algerie flight crashed in northern Mali carrying 116 passengers and crew, nearly half of them French, en route from Burkina Faso to Algeria in July 2014. In February that year, an Algerian Air Force Lockheed C-130 Hercules crashed in a mountainous area in eastern Algeria killing 77 passengers and leaving one survivor.

Sarah Perez,"Twitter today announced a new collaboration with Google that will see it moving a portion of infrastructure to Google’s Cloud Platform. The move is another high-profile win for Google in the cloud computing market, following its recent deal with Fitbit. Specifically, Twitter says it’s moving its cold data storage and its flexible compute Hadoop clusters – something it believes it needs to do in order to keep scaling its business. Currently, Twitter’s Hadoop clusters are housed in its own physical data centers, the company told TechCrunch. This is a relatively small percentage of its total infrastructure, however – the bulk of its infrastructure will still remain in Twitter’s own data centers, we understand. Twitter declined to share the impact of the move, in terms of cost savings or financial impacts. The company publicly announced the news in a blog post this afternoon, where it noted it’s been assessing its platform and infrastructure needs over the past few years. It said it needs to be well-positioned to keep up with its growth. Even though Twitter’s user growth has been flat, it sees hundreds of millions of tweets sent every day. “The Hadoop compute system is the core of our data platform, and Twitter runs multiple large Hadoop clusters that are among the biggest in the world,” explained Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal, in the announcement. “In fact, our Hadoop file systems host more than 300PB of data across tens of thousands of servers,” he said. Agrawal said that when the migration is complete, it will enable “faster capacity provisioning; increased flexibility; access to a broader ecosystem of tools and services; improvements to security; and enhanced disaster recovery capabilities.” “Architecturally, we will also be able to separate compute and storage for this class of Hadoop workloads, which has a number of long-term scaling and operational benefits,” he added. Twitter isn’t saying how long the migration will take. The move to Google Cloud comes at a time when there’s heavy competition among cloud service providers – and Amazon is leading in terms of revenue. Grabbing a portion of Twitter’s business, then, is another big name win for Google, following its collaboration with Fitbit, announced just days ago. “There is strong alignment with Twitter’s engineering strategy to meet the demands of its platform and the services Google Cloud offers at a global scale,” said Brian Stevens, Google Cloud CTO, in a statement. “Google Cloud Platform’s data solutions and trusted infrastructure will provide Twitter with the technical flexibility and consistency that its platform requires, and we look forward to an ongoing technical collaboration with their team.”","Twitter today announced a new collaboration with Google that will see it moving a portion of infrastructure to Google’s Cloud Platform.

Adam Rosenberg,"The Netflix remake of Lost in Space is set to arrive on April 13 and here's your first look, in the form of a trailer. Much like the original, the Netflix series tells the story of the Robinson family, one of many selected to fly off and colonize a new world in Earth's future. Disaster strikes when their ship is thrown off course, leaving the Robinsons – along with fellow crew members Don West (Ignacio Serricchio) and Dr. Smith (Parker Posey!) – stranded on the surface of a dangerous alien planet. This trailer offers a look at the Lost in Space crew and sets up the premise, but that's as far as it goes. Assuming the new series sticks to the basic formula as the original, each episode will follow the Robinsons and their friends as they deal with the assorted threats and challenges of surviving in a hostile alien environment. There's reason to be hopeful. Posey is perfectly cast as Dr. Smith, the scheming scientist memorably played by Jonathan Harris in the original. There's also that one line of dialogue at the end of the trailer: ""Danger, Will Robinson!"" That's a nod to the most junior Robinson's robot friend; in the original series, the pair's adventures were the focus of many episodes. Then there's the music. A slight piano tease at the end of the trailer nods back to the original show's memorable theme. Hopefully all of these little pieces point to good things ahead for this remake.","The Netflix remake of Lost in Space is set to arrive on April 13 and here's your first look, in the form of a trailer.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Such goals seem farther away than ever. Neither Mr. Netanyahu nor Mr. Trump has shown serious interest in a two-state solution that would give Palestinians their own country and resolve central questions about land, refugees, borders and security, even though Mr. Trump says a peace deal is a priority. Under Mr. Netanyahu, Israel has expanded its claims to land that Palestinians seek for their own state. Instead of easing tensions and resolving the political questions at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Trump has exacerbated the situation, most recently by unilaterally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in exchange for nothing, and declaring his intention to move the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. For decades, the international community, including the United States, has said Jerusalem’s fate should be decided in Israeli-Palestinians negotiations. Palestinian leaders have also failed their people. Hamas leaders who run Gaza have waged war against Israel, exploiting their people in the process. Their rival, the Palestinian Authority, has been feckless at pursuing peace with Israel and last year imposed its own punitive measures on Gaza, including cutting salaries, in a bid to end Hamas’s control. On May 15, Palestinians in Gaza plan to observe the 70th anniversary of what they call the “ nakba, ” or “catastrophe,” when 750,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel, by breaking through the border fence and marching toward their former villages. The demonstration will come the day after Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and the United States formally opens its embassy in Jerusalem. Unless someone steps up to end Gaza’s humanitarian disaster, ensure Israel and the Palestinians act with restraint during the protests and set a credible peace process in motion, both sides could face a new catastrophe.","Israel must temper its lethal response to protests in the Gaza tinder box, or risk an escalation neither it nor the Palestinian leadership can contain.",2018-04-02T20:02:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Editorial: Israel Courts Catastrophe in Gaza Protests,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/opinion/gaza-protests-israel-hamas.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/opinion/03Tue2/03Tue2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Matt Novak,"A Southwest Airlines flight traveling from Chicago to Newark, New Jersey, was forced to make an emergency landing in Cleveland today. The cause was reportedly a cracked window, an eerie reminder of the emergency landing last month when a Southwest engine exploded, breaking a window and killing a passenger. Photos posted to social media show the cracked window from Southwest flight 957. The plane was able to land safely in Cleveland, and there are no reports of injuries. In a statement to WGN in Chicago, Southwest said, “the aircraft maintained pressurization as there are multiple layers of panes in each window. No emergency landing was requested and the flight landed uneventfully with no reported injuries.” Last month, Southwest Airlines flight 1380 lost pressure, which is what pushed passenger Jennifer Riordan, a 41-year-old Wells Fargo bank executive from Albuquerque, New Mexico, nearly out of the plane. She later died of her injuries. After flight 957 landed, all passengers were told to board another plane at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport so that everyone could make their way to the intended destination, Newark, New Jersey. Passengers were thankful that it was “ only ” a crack to the outside window, faint praise for the US airline industry. Coincidentally, President Trump hosted some of the people from last month’s Southwest Airlines disaster at the White House today. Below Trump is seen shaking hands in the Oval Office with pilot Tammie Jo Shults who has been hailed as a hero for getting her plane safely on the ground. And in yet another case of The Onion being ahead of the news, here’s a story from April 19th, 2018: Southwest Airlines received a $1.4 billion benefit from the Republican tax cut.

Joseph Hincks,"Hawaii is reportedly reinstating a Cold War-era siren that warns residents of an imminent nuclear strike on the island chain. On the first business day of each month Hawaii drills its “attention alert,” a 50-second steady-tone siren that if heard outside of testing hours signals a hurricane, tsunami or earthquake is on its way, Hawaii’s Star Advertiser reports. But on Dec. 1, that regular siren will be followed by a second wavering alarm. This “attack warning” siren is being added to the test schedule against the backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. While the attack warning tone will be new to many on Hawaii, it is likely to evoke worrying memories among some middle-aged residents. According to the Washington Post, the siren was last drilled around 1980, as U.S.-Russia tension spiked during the Cold War. This time around, the threat is from North Korea, which this year has twice test-fired intercontinental missiles, twice launched missiles over Japan, threatened to surround the U.S. territory of Guam with “enveloping fire,” and in September detonated a device it says was a hydrogen bomb. Read more: Guam Before the Storm: Life on the Island Caught Between Trump and Kim Hawaii is not alone in preparing for a possible nuclear strike. In August, authorities in Guam distributed a fact sheet among the U.S. territory’s 163,000 residents, advising them of action they should take in the event of a nuclear attack. Among the advice is for residents to avoid using conditioner “because it will bind radioactive material to your hair.” Schools in Japan have also begun missile defense training alongside regular safety drills, while fishing authorities are preparing alerts for those who may be at sea during a launch.","The ""attack warning"" siren will be added to a monthly drill used to alert residents of natural disaster",2017-11-28T03:25:01Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hawaii Is Bringing Back a Cold War-Era Missile Siren Amid Fears of a North Korean Nuclear Attack,http://time.com/5038765/hawaii-north-korea-nuclear-signal/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-649080078.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Matthew Baker,"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. “Fail fast” is a well-known phrase in the start-up scene. The spirit of failing fast is getting to market with a minimum viable product and then rapidly iterating toward success. Failing fast acknowledges that entrepreneurs are unlikely to design a successful end-state solution before testing it with real customers and real consequences. This is the “ready, fire, aim” approach. Or, if the blowback is big enough, it’s the “ready, fire, pivot” approach. Consider this quote from Reid Hoffman, CEO of LinkedIn: “If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” Related: Ready or Not, It's Time to Embrace AI The opposite of failing fast is a “waterfall” approach to software development where a significant amount of time is invested upfront -- requirements analysis, design and scenario planning -- before the software is ever tested with real customers. When it comes to the emerging potential of artificial intelligence, I believe failing fast is a recipe for disaster. Artificial intelligence is here to stay. Many different types of artificially intelligent software surround us. Most AI has minimal authority today. For instance, Amazon’s software recommends things you might like to buy but it doesn’t actually purchase those things on your behalf -- yet. Spotify’s software makes a decision to create a playlist for you but if a song doesn’t suit your tastes, the consequences are benign. Google’s software decides which websites are most relevant for your search terms but doesn’t decide which website you will visit. In all of these cases, failing fast is okay. Usage leads to more data, which leads to improvements in the algorithms. But, intelligence software is beginning to make independent decisions that represent much higher risk. The risk of failure is too great to take lightly because the consequences can be irreversible or ubiquitous. We wouldn’t want NASA to fail fast. A single Space Shuttle launch costs $450 million and places human lives in jeopardy. The risks of AI are increasing. Imagine this: What if we exposed 100+ million people to intelligent software that decided which news they read, and we later discovered the news may have been misleading or even fake and resulted in influencing the election for the President of the United States of America? Who would be held responsible? Related: 5 Ways in Which Digital and Artificial Intelligence are Changing Work Dynamics It sounds far-fetched, but media reports indicate Russian influence reached 126 million people through Facebook alone. The stakes are getting higher, and we don’t know whom to hold accountable. I am fearful the companies spearheading advancements in AI aren’t cognizant of the responsibility. Failing fast shouldn’t be an acceptable excuse for unintended outcomes. If you’re not convinced, imagine these scenarios as a by-product of a fail fast mindset: What if your entire retirement savings evaporated overnight due to artificial intelligence? Here’s how it could happen. In the near future, millions of Americans will use intelligent software to invest billions of dollars in retirement savings. The software will decide where to invest the money. When the market experiences a massive correction, as it does occasionally, the software will need to react quickly to re-distribute your money. This could lead to an investment that bottoms-out in minutes and your funds disappear. Is anyone responsible? What if your friend were killed in an automobile accident due to artificial intelligence? Here’s how it could happen. In the near future, millions of Americans will purchase driverless automobiles controlled by intelligent software. The software will decide the fate of many Americans. Will the artificial intelligence choose to hit a pedestrian that accidentally steps into the street or steer the vehicle off the road? These are split-second decisions with real-world consequences. If the decision is fatal, is anyone responsible? What if your daughter or son suffered from depression due to artificial intelligence? Here’s how it could happen. In the near future, millions of kids will have an artificial best friend. It will be sort of like an invisible friend. It will be a companion named Siri or Alexa or something else that talks and behaves like a confidant. We’ll introduce this friend to our children because it will be friendly, smart, and caring. It might even replace a babysitter. However, if your daughter or son spends all their discretionary time with this artificial friend and years later can’t sustain meaningful relationships in the real world, is anyone responsible? In some cases, the consequences can’t be undone. Responsible approach to AI. The counter-argument is that humans already cause these tragedies. Humans spread fake news. Humans lose money in the stock market. Humans kill one another with automobiles. Humans get depressed. Related: Life Coaching Guru Tony Robbins Tells Us Why He;s Investing in an AI Company The difference is that humans are individual cases. The risk with AI that replaces or competes with human intelligence is that it can be applied at scale simultaneously. The scope and reach of AI is both massive and instantaneous. It’s fundamentally introducing higher risk. While one driver who makes an error is truly unfortunate, one driver that makes the same error for millions of people should be unacceptable. A more responsible approach to AI is needed. Our mindset should shift toward risk prevention, security planning and simulation testing. While this defies the modern ethos of the tech industry, we have a responsibility to prevent the majority of unlikely and unwanted outcomes before they occur. The good news is that with the right mindset, we can prevent the scenarios above from becoming true.",For typical products going to market quickly and seeing what happens is fine. The implications of AI merit a much more considered approach.,2018-03-02T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",Why 'Fail Fast' Is a Disaster When It Comes to Artificial Intelligence,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/308925,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180226205042-GettyImages-871148930-crop.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,1
Michelangelo Signorile,"To mark the end of 2018, we asked writers to revisit some of the years most noteworthy (for good or evil) events, people and ideas. See the other entries here between now and the new year.
In 2015, the year of the Obergefell marriage equality ruling, I published a book, Its Not Over, warning against the temptation of victory blindness and anticipating, among other potential dangers, that the fortunes of LGBTQ people and other threatened minorities could turn rapidly if a right-wing Republican candidate won the presidency in 2016 and took aim at the Supreme Court.
In 2018, with the retirement of one justice Anthony Kennedy that threat came to pass, and the fate and futures of millions rest in the balance.
From the day after the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was the source of many Americans worst fears about a vast array of important issues. President Donald Trump was already set to fill the seat Senate Republicans had stolen from President Barack Obama, which he did in short order, choosing conservative ideologue Neil Gorsuch to take the late Justice Antonin Scalias seat.
Yet even as Gorsuch revealed that he viewed marriage equality as much less than the absolutely settled law he claimed in his confirmation hearings, many of us hoped that the courts four liberal-leaning justices and the swing vote, Justice Kennedy, would hang on. Surely, many believed, in this precarious time in America, the only thing that might cause any of them to leave was illness or perhaps death. Thats why the moment Kennedy announced his retirement was like a dagger in the heart to so many. 
How could someone like Kennedy, who provided the pivotal vote and wrote so eloquently in support of the most important LGBTQ rights decisions, trust those rights to Trump? What value was there in that legacy of support for equality if he was willing to see it erased so easily by an obvious authoritarian?
Kennedys announcement was a learning experience that revealed many progressives naivete or outright denial. Thered been a seductive narrative floating out there that Kennedy was part of some benevolent group of conservatives who understood Trump was a mortal threat to the republic and whod quietly try to help control things and get us through this terrible time. (There was a similar bit of wishful thinking about John Kelly, the retired general who became Trumps homeland security chief and then his chief of staff, but who turned out in the end to be an enabler of Trumps worst racist instincts.)
Instead, Kennedy proved that he is the sum total of all his rulings most of which, on critical issues, were in line with the courts far right, from allowing limitless dark money to rule our political process to eviscerating public sector unions. In retrospect, it was somewhat delusional to think that the questions of a womans right to choose or equality for LGBTQ people would dominate Kennedys own thinking on his legacy.
Kennedys announcement was a learning experience that revealed many progressives naivete or outright denial.
The search for Kennedys successor was even more anxiety-provoking, as all of Trumps possible choices had histories that showed incredible hostility to LGBTQ rights. Brett Kavanaugh, who came out of the same Federalist Society incubator as Gorsuch and whom Trump chose in the end, had worked in the White House of George W. Bush while they crafted and promoted a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. His history on abortion rights appeared just as bad.
Then came the stomach-churning roller coaster of Kavanaughs confirmation, beginning with Senate Republicans suppressing millions of documents from his time in the Bush administration and culminating with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford bravely sharing her story of sexual assault, alleging Kavanaugh attempted to rape her in high school.
At various points, there was hope that Kavanaugh could yet be stopped. As with other horrendous actions in the Trump era like the zero-tolerance border policy that separated hundreds of immigrant children from their parents or the travel ban against some Muslim-majority countries slowing down the process, buying another month, or even a week, felt like a victory.
But stopping Kavanaugh for good wasnt to be, as the Senate GOP shunted aside the highly credible Dr. Ford whom most Americans believed confirming Kavanaugh on a largely party-line vote after a theatrical tirade from Kavanaugh and a sham FBI investigation gave them cover.
We now look at the future and imagine what will happen. Within days of Kavanaughs confirmation, as if they were lying in wait, conservative anti-LGBTQ activists filed a case in federal court in Texas that could throw out hundreds of anti-discrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people. Gorsuch, having already stoked the idea of challenging marriage equality in a dissenting opinion he wrote, now has company on the court that could welcome a case challenging marriage equality or offering religious exemptions to it. Transgender people, whose rights have already been under especially brutal assault everywhere from high schools to the U.S. military because of Trump administration directives, now face the threat of having their very humanity denied by the law.
One possible silver lining of Kennedys retirement was that it resulted in further organizing by progressives, who helped Democrats win back the House of Representatives in a blue wave that also drove many anti-LGBTQ Republicans from office.
Activists and progressive voters alike are also now more awake to the fact that the court is so consequential, something conservatives had long focused on. Thats a good thing. 
Theres no question though, when we think of 2018, we will remember that day in late June when Justice Kennedy announced his retirement, forcing us all at once to confront the monumental threats to our lives and to those of generations to come.

Yemeni troops backed by a Saudi-led coalition began the operation early on Wednesday, Al-Arabiya reported. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if the city is attacked, with up to a quarter of a million casualties possible. The port is the main entry point for humanitarian aid into Yemen. More than seven million people in the war-torn country are dependent on food aid. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), part of the coalition, had earlier given rebels a final ultimatum to withdraw or face imminent attack. UAE Junior Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash told the BBC that the coalition had run out of patience with diplomatic efforts after a previous 48-hour deadline expired. He said the coalition wanted the UN to take control of the port but it was prepared to take military action if the Houthis refused to withdraw.

Alex Cranz,"There are few gambles in the tech world as big spending billions to build a new computer processor from scratch. Former AMD board member Robert Palmer supposedly compared it to Russian roulette: “You put a gun to your head, pull the trigger, and find out four years later if you blew your brains out.” Six years ago AMD loaded the gun and pulled the trigger, dramatically restructuring itself internally in a mad bid to escape a disaster of its own making. Now we’ve seen the results and instead of dying, AMD has a savvy new CPU microarchitecture, Zen, that’s the foundation of the shockingly good new series of Ryzen processors. They’re so good, in fact, that they could pose a real challenge to Intel’s incumbent dominance and change what the computer market looks for the next few years. “I think Intel kind of woke up and said ‘hey you know we’re in a battle all of a sudden,’” Linley Gwenapp, an analyst, and editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry magazine, told Gizmodo. “So they’re not going to just stand by and let AMD storm into the market.” But Intel has its work cut out for it. In January at CES in Las Vegas, I met with both companies and the mood could not have been more different. Intel seemed to spend the entire consumer electronics show apologizing for Spectre and Meltdown, a series of catastrophic security vulnerabilities that affected every one of the company’s CPUs. It seemed to barely have time to tease all the cool stuff it had coming out in the next few months. AMD, meanwhile, was a peacock—fluttering its feathers and bragging about its plans to continue one of the most aggressive launches in CPU history. The fact that it was vulnerable to Meltdown was almost an aside. AMD was way too busy being thrilled to be back, doing something very cool, and not being the one with all the bad press for once. “I think it’s been very successful when you look at where they were a year ago,” Gwenapp said of AMD. Because even just a year ago Intel was in rough shape. According to Gwenapp, AMD had a little as 1.5 percent of the server market share last year. Intel had the other 98.5 percent. Sure it was making the chips that power every single Xbox One and PS4, and yes it’s the exclusive provider of GPUs for Apple machines, but to anyone who was paying attention, it sure seemed like AMD was a shadow of its former self. After all, the company was once considered Intel’s only serious rival in the CPU space, and until Zen was announced, AMD had been virtually silent on that front, effectively capitulating the multi-billion market for the chips that serve as the brains for everything from your computer to the servers powering your favorite websites. Photo: Gizmodo AMD’s last big push in the CPU space came with a microarchitecture called Bulldozer back in 2011. In the tech world that’s an eternity. To put it in perspective, the same year AMD was last seriously attempting to compete with Intel, Apple launched the iPhone 4s, and Intel launched the second generation of its Core architecture. Intel is now on generation eight and expected to launch its ninth by the end of the year. It’s been eons since Intel and AMD were serious competitors. One of the biggest reasons it’s taken so long for AMD to compete again is because that last big CPU launch was disastrous. Bulldozer obviously wasn’t intended to be awful. “It wasn’t as if somebody architected something that people thought wouldn’t be successful,” Patrick Morehead, Founder and Prinicipal Anaylyst at Morehead Strategy, told Gizmodo. Before becoming an analyst Morehead was a VP at AMD for nearly ten years and departed at the same time Bulldozer came to market. According to Morehead, Bulldozer was always intended to be a high octane kind of CPU that blazed past its Intel competitors thanks to its high clock rate (or clockspeed). The higher the clockspeed the more cycles of processing a CPU can potentially undergo in a second, and according to Morehead, AMD had planned a clock rate of 5GHz, which is over five billion processes every second. Intel’s competitor at the time shipped CPUs with a much lower clockrate—only a handful could hit 4GHz. “That’s why when people say ‘oh we didn’t get out of Bulldozer what we would have wanted’ it’s because that was supposed to be a very high frequency part,” Morehead said. In fact no CPU in general production from AMD or Intel has ever hit a clockrate of 5Ghz or higher. The only CPU to ever go into production with such a high clockrate is the IBM zEC12 released in 2012 and intended solely for IBM mainframes. “It was never really competitive.” When Bulldozer went into production it had a base clockrate of just 4.2GHz with a turbo clock rate (which is enabled when the processor needs to crank through a little data very quickly) of 4.5GHz. And the respectable clock rate couldn’t compete with Intel’s offerings in the same space. The reaction from reviewers was brutal. Anandtech’s Anand Lal Shimpi wrote that he was “not sure it’s quite ready for prime time” and that “Bulldozer simply does not perform.” Tom’s Hardware noted that it was often “embarrassingly bested by its predecessor” while Tweaktown lamented that “you can’t help but almost feel disappointed with what’s going on here today.” When CNET did a round up of the geekier reviews of Bulldozer it reported that “Bulldozer does not appear to offer AMD a competitive resurgence.” But it was at least a little hopeful AMD could stick around in the CPU space, if for no other reason than “to keep Intel honest.” Yet that didn’t happen. AMD had come out of the gate with a troubled architecture and the gap between it and Intel only grew wider over each successive annual iteration. The company tried “to start with something that doesn’t work well and then kludge it up to make it better,” Gwenapp told Gizmodo. But with each new iteration based on the already underperforming Bulldozer architecture it couldn’t keep up. “It never really was competitive.” It takes guts And a CPU absolutely must be competitive—either cheaper, faster, or more power efficient. It is the core brain that powers every computer you use—from your phone to your laptop to your TV. A CPU defined by its microprocessor—which is in many cases a synonym for CPU. It’s a wafer of silicon that then has billions of microcircuits etched to its surface and connected to one another via ions of copper. The specific way a CPU’s silicon microcircuits—or transistors—are arranged and connected via copper is called its “architecture.” The very first microprocessor, the Intel 4004 released in 1971, was built on a die, or foundation, that was just 10,000nm. That is as thick as a very thin strand of human hair. The Ryzen CPU is just 14nm. A small process means it can move energy across those copper ions faster—effectively meaning that the smaller a CPU gets the faster it can be. But the smaller a CPU the more delicate it becomes. So in the bid to make the fastest and most powerful processors, CPU designers must also make them smaller and more intricate. And that means always optimizing and seeking better efficiencies. Consequently each CPU is designed for a specific “instruction set.” That is the most basic code that works between a CPU and a devices software. Common CPU instruction sets you’ve heard of are ARM and x86. ARM CPUs are usually found in phones and tablets—the CPUs that power you Samsung GalaxyS9 and your iPhone X are ARM - based processors. x86 CPUs are usually reserved for computing devices that need a lot more power and a little less battery life. Intel and AMD’s CPUs for laptops, desktops, and servers are x86, and unless specifically specified, as are AMD’s competitors, including its new batch of Ryzen processors. Beyond the instruction set CPUs, are actually pretty simple and just made up of a few key components: cores, CPU caches, and the system bus. The cores are the engine of the CPU, they’re the things doing all the actual processing and when you talk about the clockrate of a CPU you’re talking about how fast those cores are operating. The cores do all the actual processing required by the CPU, but they’re very busy processing all that data you feed them, so they need to cache bits of it away for super quick references. This is where CPU caches come in. They are the memory. When you glance at the specs for a computer you’re planning to buy you might see a mention of these caches, usually labelled L1, L2, and L3. They’re important because they’re what the cores actually read and write data to while processing. That data, after being processed on the CPU caches, is then sent back out to the general memory (also known as RAM) for the computer, and then possibly onto the storage drive, and it all gets to your eyeballs because it goes through the graphics processing unit. The CPU caches and the cores communicate to one another via the system bus. It’s called a bus because it’s essentially busing information from one part of the CPU to another. And sometimes it’s not just moving data between the cores and the CPU caches. A system bus will also move data to and from a graphics processor if its squeezed onto the same chip too. At its most rudimentary, consider a system bus to be like that little green board you used to snap all the Lego bricks onto. There are a lot of different kinds of system buses, and every major CPU maker has their own system bus architecture. So Intel has what it calls Front Side Bus, and until Zen, AMD used tech called HyperTransport. Now, focusing on any one of these components can improve the speed of a CPU,. When AMD created Bulldozer it put all its effort into the clockrate of the cores of the CPU. The clockrate is the frequency at which a computer processing unit can actually process cycles of data. More processes means a faster CPU and for a very long time improving the clockrate of a CPU was the primary goal of designers. But in the early 2000s, Intel brought a CPU to market with a clockrate of 3GHz, and since then nearly all CPUs have hovered around that clockrate. One of the reasons for that stall in clockrate increases is because the higher the clockrate the more heat the CPU produces. Getting rid of all that heat can be costly—especially if you’re trying to pack that CPU into something super slim and fanless like a Surface Pro. So in recent years, CPU designers have turned other parts of the CPU to improve speed, and when AMD made the decision to essentially scrap Bulldozer and put most of its resources into what would be come Zen, one particular component of the CPU would get a brunt of the focus: A new system bus architecture called Infinity Fabric. But before AMD settled on Infinity Fabric, before it even settled on creating a new CPU and acknowledging Bulldozer’s failure, the company needed a new CPU design team. Photo: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo) Their powers combined Enter Mark Papermaster, current Chief Technology Officer for AMD. He joined the company in late 2011, just after Bulldozer’s launch, and according to him “it was not a coincidence.” Papermaster had been brought in to help save a company that saw its stock prices plummet more than 60-percent in a year thanks in part to Bulldozer’s poor performance. Before joining AMD Papermaster was primarily noteworthy for two things. In 2008 he was the subject of a highly publicized lawsuit with IBM, where he’d worked since 1982. IBM was concerned that Papermaster, then a recent hire at Apple, would potentially carry trade secrets with him from IBM to Apple. The case settled out of court. Then Papermaster made headlines again in 2010, when he reportedly left Apple after just 15 months due to disagreements with then CEO Steve Jobs. Papermaster entered AMD in October 2011 and the company seemed to be in a state of free fall, with major rivals like Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung snapping up dissatisfied employees. The flight of employees struck a nerve with some. “That just breaks my heart,” former AMD founder Jerry Sanders told Forbes in February 2012. The company was in disarray and Papermaster was himself contributing to it. Not because of his previous reputation, but because one of his first orders of business was to dramatically restructure the CPU design team. He’d seen how bad Bulldozer was doing and it was clear to him it wasn’t the processor AMD needed to succeed. “I saw the market going to high performance,” he told Gizmodo. “To do that we needed a new CPU.” Instead of something that could just handle your web browsing, Papermaster was certain the market needed something that could handle gaming, or processing huge 3D files, or rendering big 4K videos. And for Papermaster, a new CPU meant a major restructuring of AMD’s design group. Traditionally the CPU design group was was broken up into two basic teams. “Prior to the Zen architecture they really had two kind of parallel design tracks,” Natalie Jerger, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, told Gizmodo. One processor was intended for low powered laptops and desktops—the cheapest of the cheap. The other was intended for servers and high end desktops. The server class processors were Bulldozer, and the low power CPUs were what was called the Bobcat family. “And so what [Papermaster] did was he merged these two teams together,” Joe Macri, Corporate Vice President and Product CTO at AMD, told Gizmodo. Macri was one of the leaders of that new, larger team. To hear him tell it, the merging of the two teams (and the removal of anyone made redundant) seemed like a necessity for the task Papermaster assigned to the larger group. “We didn’t need to start from scratch,” Macri said. “So that was really more of a merge than taking an existing team, rip it apart, and put it back together. But in the process we got a lot of efficiencies. We were able to apply more people to a single function and get much more design bandwidth.” Bandwidth that would be necessary to accomplish Papermaster’s goal of building a CPU that was in every way better than that rubbish it had just released. Papermaster was soon aided by another new exec at AMD: Lisa Su, who joined as Senior Vice President and General Manager in January 2012. Su had come from Freescale, another CPU maker that has since merged with NXP Semiconductors. Her first focus was on AMD’s graphic s and gaming markets—where the company was actually having some successes. Su and then CEO Rory Read, secured deals with both Sony and Microsoft to create the chips at the heart of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One. Those deals were enormous, and many sources cite AMD’s work on custom chips for Sony and Microsoft as one of the reasons the company both survived the CPU drought and actually managed to produce such an effective CPU with its current architecture, Zen. Su’s work earned her quick notice and by October of 2014, a little more than two years after she’d joined AMD, she was elevated to CEO. Su and Papermaster then proceeded to pour resources into the development of Zen. According to Macri it was over two million man hours spread over four years. For Papermaster, putting all those resources into a new CPU design, and having that team effectively ignore Bulldozer and its successive iterations, was absolutely vital. He needed a team that would have the breathing room “to get those bright ideas that they had.” He felt that some of AMD’s coolest ideas for new CPUs “had been on the shelf because there had been such a demanding schedule of new revision after new revision.” “You know sometimes you can get a ‘let’s do a from scratch design and throw everything out.’ The team didn’t do that.” Instead the team pulled from AMD’s extensive back catalog to use ideas that hadn’t been given a lot of focus over the years. One such idea was improving on the system bus architecture HyperTransport and creating a new one: Infinity Fabric. Mark Papermaster told Gizmodo AMD called it “the hidden gem,” while Jim Anderson told Gizmodo it was the “secret sauce.” Mr. Infinity This is where a talented engineer named Jim Keller comes in. He’s a mythical sort of figure within AMD. Nearly every person I spoke to cited Keller as one of the primary people behind the success of Zen’s design, and importantly behind the design of Infinity Fabric. Papermaster hired Keller in 2012 and put him in charge of the processor group. Keller was no stranger to AMD. He’d worked there previously in the ‘90s and his short tenure had achieved legendary status in the geeky processor community online where he is credited as the principal figure behind AMD’s K8 microarchitecture which allowed the company to be viciously competitive with Intel in the late ‘90s and early 2000s. Keller and Papermaster had worked at Apple together, where Keller is credited with designing the first CPUs Apple built itself for its iPhones and iPads. When he came to AMD, both he and his new employer agreed to come under a limited time contract. He would work at AMD for three years, and at the end of that contract he would depart, which he did in 2015. He now designs chips for the autopilot feature in Tesla’s cars, and declined to comment for this story. Keller, and in particular his work on mobile CPUs and previous work on HyperTransport, were key. Without Keller to speak for himself we’re left with glowing praise from AMD execs like Mark Papermaster and Jim Anderson, and from analysts like Linley Gwenapp who said “I think Jim and his team really has turned around the company from a technology standpoint.” In a rare public interview in 2014 with Papermaster, you start to get a sense of Keller’s enthusiasm and motivation. “I joined AMD because I love processor design and I love complicated systems design and AMD was looking at taking a big swing on the next generation,” Keller said. Keller seems calm and polished up on the little stage, but he tends to ramp up in response to geekier questions—growing sharper and more and more animated as he talks about architectures and pipelines and cores and the other supremely technical stuff that most of us would yawn at. The interview is a great look at where Zen was in 2014—three years before its launch. At the time it was only approximately two years into its development, and still being designed alongside K12—AMD’s planned next generation ARM CPU. In the interview, Keller actually cites that co-development as an asset to Zen and specifically to the cores at the heart of each Zen CPU. However Keller doesn’t hint at the most important component until near the end of the 15 minute session when he mentions a next generation “fabric” that would be found in every CPU from mobile devices up to servers and that would allow AMD to scale performance at an enviable rate. That fabric would be known, by 2017, as Infinity Fabric. “AMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too.” He explains that the fabric would allow AMD to employ a “chiplet” approach to design. Instead of building one processor on a single die AMD could package a series of processors together—connecting them via the Infinity Fabric system bus. This would make the CPUs way cheaper to produce and ideally as fast as a CPU, like AMD’s previous CPUs and most of the ones from Intel, that included all the cores on a one die. “Historically,” analyst Patrick Morehead told Gizmodo, “when you put things in packages it slows down the process. But AMD has found a way to have their cake and eat it too by coming up with this packaging that sets very high performance.” And this packaging also meant AMD was designing a very different kind of CPU from its competitor, with a different, and according to AMD, much more efficient methodology. “We came up with a very regular structure for it,” Joe Macri told Gizmodo. “We basically had a data point and a control point and everybody that bolted into [Infinity Fabric] bolted into it the same way.” Macri claims Infinity Fabric actually sped up design of the processors across the board. The modular design it gave the Zen architecture meant AMD didn’t need to reinvent the wheel for every kind of CPU. “One of the biggest challenges in designing a core is actually validating it,” Macri said. And thanks to Infinity Fabric AMD could quickly validate, or confirm the operation of, a whole slew of slightly varied designs ranging across their entire offering of Zen processors. Think of Infinity Fabric as the little snaps in Lego blocks and all the components of a CPU as the blocks themselves. AMD could take a few blocks to build a desktop CPU, or tack on more to create a big multi-core server processor, or snap on a GPU to make a wicked fast chip intended for laptops. Or, as happened in 2016—an entirely new type of CPU for AMD. Image: Gizmodo The breakthrough Released in 2017, Threadripper—AMD’s perhaps most eye catching CPU launched on Zen—was never on any of Papermaster’s aggressive roadmaps. Instead it was a passion project by a very small group of engineers—like maybe four. A “very, very small group,” Robert Hallock, AMD Evangelist for APUs and CPUs said. He shared the same row of cubicles with them. The company had wanted to do a really big and powerful desktop CPU for a while, but it had never been feasible technologically or financially speaking. Yet this tiny group of engineers realized that they could potentially take advantage of the chiplet design made possible by Infinity Fabric to build an incredibly powerful desktop CPU to rival Intel’s popular top-end Xeon CPUs. Yet instead of the 8 cores found on the Xeon processors used in beefy workstations, the Threadripper would have a whopping 16 cores—the most ever put in a mass-produced desktop CPU. Such a CPU should take years to design, test, and push into the market place right? According to Jim Anderson the tiny team didn’t even approach him about it until January 2016, when they pulled him aside during CES in Las Vegas. He said he immediately recognized the sheer cool factor of these chips and insisted on putting the project on a fast track, taking it from their concept to production in just a little over a year. The project was steeped in secrecy, referred to only as Summit P3—which many assumed was a minor offshoot of Ryzen—then call Summit Ridge, and according to Hallock “you were not even allowed to send emails” about the project. Everything, from the look to the speed results were closely guarded until launch and even the teams trying to convince PC makers like Dell to adopt the CPU had almost no details on the product itself. Yet when Threadripper did finally launch in the summer of 2017, it shocked critics and consumers alike, and was quickly adopted by some of the largest PC makers in the world, including Alienware’s top-of-the-line gaming desktops. But it wasn’t just the audacity of Threadripper’s design that intrigued people. Yes 16 cores running 32 threads in a desktop PC anyone can build is impressive, but Intel announced an 18-core i9 processor just two weeks after Threadripper was announced. What was surprising was that it was cheap—$1,000 to the $2,000 for Intel’s 18-core processor—and the damn thing was actually as fast. Photo: Gizmodo More than anything else, this is what has surprised observers about AMD’s latest CPU architecture: The chips are cheaper and usually faster than their Intel competition. You can look at our own reviews of AMD processors over the last year as proof ( here, here, and here ). Yet AMD isn’t just producing fast, cheap processors processors, it’s also releasing them all of a sudden at a surprisingly fast clip. In 2017 AMD released four categories of CPUs based on Zen: Ryzen desktop CPUs, Threadripper, Epyc CPUs intended for servers, and Ryzen APUs for laptops (APU is the AMD term for a CPU with integrated graphics). We’re only four months into 2018 and AMD has already released incredibly fast and cheap APUs for the desktop, additional mobile APUs for laptops, and even a second generation of Ryzen CPUs for desktops. Jim Anderson told Gizmodo he anticipates over 60 new laptops and desktops with Ryzen inside by the end of the year, with most of those systems being laptops, and most of those laptops coming in the next few months. “This will be the widest range of premium notebook systems that you’ve ever seen from AMD in the company’s history.” How good those laptops are remains to be seen. So far there are only a handful of AMD-based laptops actually in the marketplace, and we still don’t have a good sense of how well a mobile Zen processor handles power compared to its Intel rival. But if it’s not quite as good at power management, it’s still okay. Because Intel has clearly noticed AMD’s strides into the CPU space and has responded accordingly. Last year Intel’s top of the line desktop CPU maxed out at 4 cores, but after AMD released a 6-core processor Intel quickly responded with its own 6-core device. And when AMD surprised us with the 16-core Threadripper, Intel raced to get the 18-core i9 into the marketplace. A rivalry between the two companies can only ever be good for all of us hunting for our next computer. “You know,” Natalie Jerger told Gizmodo, “the the world is much more exciting if we have multiple people trying to innovate in this space.”","There are few gambles in the tech world as big spending billions to build a new computer processor from scratch. Former AMD board member Robert Palmer supposedly compared it to Russian roulette: “You put a gun to your head, pull the trigger, and find out four…",2018-04-26T16:50:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Inside AMD's Quest to Build Chips That Can Beat Intel,https://gizmodo.com/inside-amds-quest-to-build-chips-that-can-beat-intel-1824064984,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--YYWPn14r--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/ywpc8qj0yvjvvsfxx3fp.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,1

Ingrid Lunden,"Airbnb — the travel startup that lets individuals rent out private homes or rooms in private homes to people as an alternative to hotels — has racked up more than 17,000 nights in its Open Homes program, a voluntary effort where Airbnb hosts can offer their houses and rooms free of charge to people in cities going through an emergency such as a hurricane or flood or other critical incident, either because those people have been displaced from their homes or because they have come to an area to help family go are going through a crisis. Now, the company is piloting a new version of the program to make it even more ubiquitous: Airbnb hosts, and anyone who might be willing to put up people in emergencies, can now register so that they will be available on “standby” lists. The first city that will pilot the new system starting this summer is San Jose, California, and the plan is to roll it out to more cities during the rest of the year, and eventually globally. The idea to expand Open Homes came out of Airbnb thinking about how to make its program more effective and responsive to crises. The company has in total hosted people in nearly 9,000 homes over 90 disasters, but it found that there was a gap in time between when something happened, and the days it would take to recruit volunteers to provide homes. Given the time sensitivity of the need, the company thought it could do something to be more prepared. On the part of the city of San Jose, it became the first city to pilot the program for two reasons. It relied on Airbnb in 2017 to provide homes to people displaced during major flooding, where the city needed to evacuate and find accommodation for 14,000 families, so it understood the benefit of the program. And it generally has a larger impetus to get involved in more tech-led initiatives that better leveraged its own place in the heart of Silicon Valley. “As you might expect, as the biggest city in Silicon Valley, we believe in working in collaboration with tech,” San Jose’s mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview. “Tech has impacted and changed our economy, but we also know that there is an extraordinary opportunity in having a collaborative approach.” San Jose and Airbnb have worked together before: the city worked with Airbnb on crafting a scheme for taxing hosts to collect visitors’ taxes that were on par with what visitors paid when staying in hotels, and Liccardo noted that this became a template for how Airbnb worked out similar taxes in other cities. While flooding was the reason Airbnb provided Open Homes in San Jose, Liccardo said that earthquakes are by far the more worrisome natural disaster that San Jose wants to be prepared for down the line. Kellie Bentz, Airbnb’s Head of Disaster Response and Relief, says that the company has been working with relief organizations up to now to help coordinate housing options. This new phase of Open Homes will bring it into closer contact with city governments to develop programs. While exact details will be worked out, Airbnb and cities will work together to get the message out to people, since the idea is to appeal to people beyond Airbnb’s own network of hosts. This will include public service announcements and in-person sessions where people can come and learn more about hosting during critical incidents, where they may not get paid, but Airbnb might provide some degree of cost covering for the efforts. Setting up networks of potential hosts ahead of time will allow Airbnb to have more comprehensive data on individual hosts and what their particular offerings and restrictions might be. Bentz is very quick to say that the purpose behind this program is not to cosy up to city governments, or to simply expand its network of regular hosts. But I’d point out that both do happen to be potential (if unintended) side effects. City governments have not always been in harmony with Airbnb, which has run afoul of some local regulations that have been built for hotels and in some cases are only now being modified to account for Airbnb’s brand of travel accommodation. This gives Airbnb a place as not a disruptive aggressor, but a help. In the case of hosts, there have been plenty who have stayed at Airbnb’s but are reluctant to open up their own homes, and this gives the company a way of introducing the concept in a less all-in way. (Although, to be very clear, the company says it is not expanding this program for either of these reasons. “If we weren’t doing this with integrity, I would not be here,” Bentz said.) While the idea is to bring in more than just Airbnb hosts as emergency accommodation volunteers, so far Airbnb hasn’t worked with any other networks that provide a platform to home owners to rent out their places, such as HomeAway. “We would be open to those conversations,” said Bentz. “But so far we have not had interest from them.”","Airbnb — the travel startup that lets individuals rent out private homes or rooms in private homes to people as an alternative to hotels — has racked up more than 17,000 nights in its Open Homes program, a voluntary effort where Airbnb hosts can offer their h…",2018-06-09T18:40:22Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Airbnb will now let people register as Open Homes emergency volunteers before a crisis hits,http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/09/airbnb-will-now-let-people-register-as-open-homes-emergency-volunteers-before-a-crisis-hits/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-90137012.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,1

Well, that’s what Yura Min was frighteningly close to experiencing. In real life. On world-wide television. In her Olympic debut. Min, an American citizen who trains at Novi Ice Arena, had a wardrobe malfunction on Sunday while competing in the figure skating team event for South Korea. “Five seconds into the routine, my hook came undone,” Min said. Not just any hook. It was the hook in the back of her costume that basically holds the whole thing together. “I was like, ‘Oh no!’ ” she said. “If that comes undone, the whole thing could just pop off. I was terrified the entire program.” But what did she do? Stop and fix it? “I didn’t stop,” she said. “I went from the beginning to the end. I didn’t stop because you get a deduction if you stop in the middle of a program. In my head, I was thinking, ‘Is it better to stop and fix it and get the deduction or keep going?’ ” There was a #KOR wardrobe malfunction during ice dancing #Pyeongchang2018 pic.twitter.com/cRd6QKQdXF — Rob Williams (@RobTheHockeyGuy) February 11, 2018 More: ► Winter Olympics 2018: What to watch on Day 3 She ad-libbed the entire routine, forcing herself to keep her arms back, trying to keep her costume from coming undone. If she would have followed her routine precisely and brought her arms together at different times, her top would have slipped down. “This is my first Olympics, our first program and if my top were to come down, that would have been a disaster” she said. “I was very nervous that the entire thing was going to come off.” She gutted her way through the program with her partner Alexander Gamelin, keeping everything in place. “The fans kept cheering,” she said. “Obviously, this is my first Olympics. I don’t want to let loose. I was terrified. I tried my best to keep it together.” During her twizzle routine, her costume dropped dangerously low. “Anytime she brought her shoulders in, it came down,” Gamelin said. “I only noticed it halfway through. During our twizzle, it came off her shoulder, all of the way. She had to stop and pull it back up and that cost us a bunch of points. It wasn’t because we were skating poorly.” Min and Gamelin received 51.97 points and placed ninth out of 10 teams. Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir earned the highest score with 80.51 points, and Maia Shibutani and her brother Alex, who train in Canton, were second with 75.46 points for Team USA. “Obviously, there were some things she couldn’t do because her costume came undone,” Gamelin said. “She had to fix it a couple of times. I think the skating was good.” Read more of Jeff Seidel's coverage from Pyeongchang: ►Seidel's Winter Olympic postcard: Wine, whining and a nasty Norovirus ► Maia and Alex Shibutani searching for podium 'Paradise' at Winter Olympics After finishing their routine, a large group of Korean journalists were waiting to talk to Min and Gamelin. Because they are such an interesting story. Min’s parents emigrated from South Korea before she was born in Torrance, Calif. And Gamelin became a naturalized South Korean citizen in July, making him eligible to compete in the Olympics. They walked in the Opening Ceremony with the unified Korean team. “It was crazy,” Min said. “The second we went out, the roar of the crowd was amazing. I almost felt like I was in outer space. I was so out of it. Everybody was cheering. There was so much happening.” AFP_ZE0BY.jpg South Korea's Yura Min and South Korea's Alexander Gamelin compete in the figure skating team event ice dance short dance during the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at the Gangneung Ice Arena in Gangneung on February 11, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Mladen ANTONOVMLADEN ANTONOV/AFP/Getty Images (Photo: MLADEN ANTONOV, AFP/Getty Images) And they could feel the gravity of this historic moment. “I’m loving this whole theme of peace,” Gamelin said. They were able to spend some time with the North Korean pairs team. “We have seen them at a lot of competitions,” Min said. “The fact that we were able to see each other. Hug. And take pictures, as one country, was absolutely amazing.” In retrospect, Min and Gamelin are glad the costume malfunction happened in the team event. They now can turn their focus to the individual pairs competition, which begins Feb.18. “If this was our only shot, I’d be devastated,” Min said. As far as that individual competition, Min plans to wear the same costume. But they won’t take any chances. They won’t just fix the hook. They plan to sew that costume together.

MARGARET LYONS,"No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions from our TV critic on what to watch. This Weekend I Have … 15 Minutes, and I’m Peculiar ‘Joe Pera Talks With You ’ When to watch: Sunday at Midnight, on Adult Swim. Save to Watch Like The comedian Joe Pera created and stars in this profoundly odd — and sometimes oddly profound — new series about an awkward Michigan choir teacher whose interests include iron ore and diner breakfasts. If you ever wished those “Delicious Dish” sketches didn’t turn into sexual innuendo jokes and instead stuck to slow, Midwestern chat about bread, watch this. (Episodes will debut two at a time, in half-hour blocs.) … an Hour, and I’m an Adult Save to Watch Like This is the fourth-season finale of this underappreciated political procedural, but it’s a surprisingly good first episode for the uninitiated — particularly anyone looking for a good show to catch up on over the summer. Téa Leoni stars as the wise, devoted secretary of state, but even though the plot of “Madam Secretary” is about politics, the real story of “Madam Secretary” is about decency. This episode embodies that, without being too corny or seeming naïve. Sure, there’s a looming nuclear disaster, but the heart of the episode is the characters’ sense of purpose. … 90 Minutes, and I Like Old Hollywood ‘Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story’ When to watch: Friday at 9 p.m., on PBS (check local listings). Save to Watch Like Hedy Lamarr fled the Nazis, became a Hollywood star and invented a radio frequency-hopping device that was a precursor to modern wireless technology. And like many other extraordinary women, she didn’t always get her due. This terrifically interesting and balanced documentary doesn’t just trace Lamarr’s life, it also teases out some of the societal mechanisms that valorize beauty but victimize the beautiful.","A comedy begins, a drama ends its season, and a multitalented woman gets her due.",2018-05-17T19:32:22Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/watching/what-to-watch-this-weekend.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/watching/18watching-nl-slide-GSM5/18watching-nl-slide-GSM5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
The Conversation,"A woman places one of the hundreds of shoes in memory of those killed by Hurricane Maria in front of the Puerto Rico Capitol, in San Juan. Ramon Espinosa/AP ""If you don't get away from those areas, you are going to die."" That statement concluded Puerto Rico Secretary of Public Safety Héctor Pesquera's press conference before Hurricane Maria. As of December 29, the Department of Public Safety had certified 64 deaths due to Hurricane Maria. Pesquera was one of the fiercest protectors of that official death count. However, estimates reported by CNN, The New York Times and others around the same time told a very different story. Now, a May 29 study estimates the total number of deaths at 4,645. I was part of the team of demographers that last year developed the first estimates of excess deaths, with the objective of informing the public and policymakers. Our numbers, published in November, contrasted significantly with the original official figure. The most shocking results from our study suggested that deaths in September and October were 25% above historical patterns. Determining the number of excess deaths after a natural disaster is not only a mathematical exercise. Undercounting deaths reduces the attention to the crisis Puerto Ricans live day by day. It can also delay international recovery efforts and the approval of policies to help those who need it the most. Causes of death Our study compared preliminary data from the Department of Public Safety with historical patterns for the same months in the past decade. In other words, we compared the number of deaths in September and October last year with data from the same period of time in 2010 to 2016. This is how we concluded that deaths exceeded historical ranges by at least 1,000. So why were so many deaths missing from the official count? My colleagues and I suspect it may come down to how deaths are recorded by government officials. In Puerto Rico, deaths are recorded using international classifications. This system doesn't capture all of the circumstances surrounding a death that happens following a natural disaster. The death may have been accelerated by some conditions — like difficulty communicating during the emergency. Deaths associated with a particular natural disaster can be classified as direct or indirect deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, direct deaths are those ""directly attributable to the forces of the disaster or by the direct consequences of these forces, such as structural collapse, flying debris or radiation exposure."" ""Indirect deaths"" may be associated with any unsafe or unhealthy conditions before, during and after a natural disaster. For example, Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. So, someone whose life depended on a dialysis machine would no longer be able to use one. In official certificates, their death would be classified as kidney-related and not attributed to the hurricane — even though the death was accelerated by lack of resources required by the patient to stay alive. The same would happen to someone whose life depended on respiratory aid. Their death would be classified as pulmonary-related. Or, say a person feels chest pain and suspects a heart attack. Their immediate reaction might be to call 911. A working communications structure may be used to get help in time and save a life. But in the days following Hurricane Maria, only 25% of the cellphone towers were working. Communication was virtually impossible. Under the international system, a death resulting from these circumstances would be classified as a result of a cardiovascular conditions and would not be attributed to the hurricane either. Nelida Trinidad walks around her destroyed home in Montebello, Puerto Rico, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Gerald Herbert/AP Revising the death count Given that most estimates, including the most recently published figure, point toward a serious undercount, it's imperative to address this issue once and for all. I have a few ideas of how to move forward. Most importantly, researchers must be able to access data without interventions from the political establishment. So far, no government body at the local or federal level have shared updated counts with the public, and they are actively seeking to dismantle the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics, which is the agency with the power to make them do it. In light of the evidence, Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rosselló last year ordered a review of the causes of death for those who died after Hurricane Maria. They chose George Washington University to run this project. A preliminary report was supposed to be published by the end of May, but it will more likely be published during the summer. Will the official count change? As of today it has not, but it most likely will. The government is no longer updating the official count, which stands at 64, and they are likely to accept the count produced by the George Washington University team. Following the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the CDC published guidelines that state and territorial governments should follow to determine if a death is related or not to a specific event. Following these guidelines could provide the government of Puerto Rico with a more realistic death count. It remains to be seen if the new count will follow this protocol. What deaths should be counted? An accurate death count could be used to inform policies, supplement requests for aid, and inform local governments as they prepare for future natural disasters. That's particularly important for Puerto Rico, where extreme weather events may become more likely as climate change worsens. Hurricane Maria was the first storm to destroy the power grid in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is now entering hurricane season again, and experts predict it will be an active one. Minimized figures could weaken efforts to provide relief to communities affected by the hurricane. Given that Puerto Rico does not hold political power in Congress, and that the only representative does not vote, it's crucial to convey the reality to all elected officials, so that their votes align with the necessities of those who are still in Puerto Rico.","A recent study estimates the total number of deaths due to Hurricane Maria at 4,645.

Emma Paling,"TORONTO — When Jack Denton started university, he thought he would one day work for the government or for a non-profit group. It only took about four weeks for him to change his mind.
In his first month at the University of Toronto, the political science undergrad found out there was a man filming women while they showered in his residence, Whitney Hall.
""It was a really big deal ... My female friends were using the buddy system to go to the bathroom at res.""
The school's student newspaper, The Varsity, happened to be holding an open house that week.
""I walked in and pitched a story to the news editor. The next Monday, I was on the front page and I thought, 'Well, this is easy,'"" he said in an interview at The Varsity's office on Thursday.
""Boy, was I wrong.""
With that, Denton realized he wanted to be a journalist. He moved up the ranks at The Varsity and now serves as editor-in-chief (and no longer believes that putting together a weekly newspaper is ""easy"").
Changes introduced by Ontario Premier Doug Ford's government on Thursday may mean that fewer students get the chance that Denton did in his first year. Papers like The Varsity are funded through mandatory student fees. Charges included in students' tuition go toward campus newspapers, student unions and centres that support racialized students, LGBTQ students and survivors of sexual assault.
Students will now choose which fees they want to pay, Minister Merrilee Fullerton announced Thursday. Colleges and universities will decide which services are ""essential"" and which are optional, leaving the latter without funding.
Fullerton said the change could save students up to $1,000 a year. Students shouldn't be forced to pay fees for things they don't use or support, she told reporters.
""Students are adults and we are treating them as such by giving them the freedom to clearly see where their fees are currently being allocated,"" Fullerton said. ""I believe students will make good decisions.""
The Varsity's weekly paper is the main source of news for 90,000 students, plus faculty, staff, and other community members across the University of Toronto's three campuses. It employs 26 students part-time, Denton is full-time, and dozens of others earn stipends for their work.
""Our business model ... isn't particularly flexible,"" Denton said. ""This poses a huge operational risk to us and a risk to students and institutions that rely on us to hold everyone from sports teams to university administration to student unions accountable.""
Campus media are an essential part of the student experience.Jack Denton
He pointed to The Varsity's stories about homeless students, RCMP officers dropping in on Muslim Students' Association executives, and allegations of sexual assault within the school's theatre community.
""Campus media are an essential part of the student experience. I really hope that provincially, or on a case-by-case basis, they're recognized as essential.""
Opposition MPPs said the change will result in less vibrant campus life.
""This is a slippery slope for the universities,"" said Chris Glover, the NDP's critic for post-secondary schools.
""For anybody who's attended a university or a college, you know that you benefit a lot from the programs ... If the universities and colleges aren't able to offer those, the wealth of the education, the richness of the education, will be cut.""
Liberal Mitzie Hunter, whose party brought in other education reforms that Fullerton rolled back on Thursday, said the effect on student unions will be particularly egregious.
""This is an attack on the voice of students to advocate for themselves,"" Hunter told HuffPost Canada.
Denton echoed the sentiment.
It will be ""disastrous"" if large numbers of students opt out of paying for their unions and other associations, he said. Student unions are instrumental in fighting to lower fees and make education more accessible.
""I wonder to what extent that has been a motivation of the Ford government. This could potentially debilitate student unions, which are a core element of students' organizing abilities.""

NELLIE BOWLES and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) This week, I profiled Vinod Khosla, whose nearly decade-long quest to close the road to Martin’s Beach, which he bought in 2008, has always been a mystery to me. Here, instead of buying a beach house, he bought an entire community, south of San Francisco, with about 75 little cottages on it and some decent surfing. And then he started fighting to close the gate down to the beach. At one point he hired guards, and five surfers were arrested, which shocked the community and created a public relations disaster. Mr. Khosla doesn’t even like to swim, has not built himself a house there and seems to have few plans for it. Today, his case is being considered by the Supreme Court, and if chosen, it could reshape policy around California’s 1,100 miles of coastline. Why did this internet pioneer with a background in greentech investing let himself become such a villain? I’ve asked Mr. Khosla to sit down and talk about it for years, and finally he agreed. He knew my opinion already — I grew up in California and found his quest to close off the beach foolish and vaguely offensive (those open, accessible, public beaches are the state’s great gift to its citizens and visitors).","Friday: A coastal access case being considered by the Supreme Court, the Justice Department weighs in on affirmative action, and college football makes its return.",2018-08-31T13:02:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Why One Billionaire Insists on Closing Off the Beach,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/us/california-today-martins-beach.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/business/02khosla02/merlin_142390755_37b5392b-2a75-49e2-8de6-993d17c39865-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Australia has completed the world’s longest cat-proof fence, because cats, an introduced species on the island, can be a huge freaking problem. Agence France-Presse reports : The Australian Wildlife Conservancy this month finished building and electrifying the 44-kilometre (27-mile) long fence to create a predator-free area of almost 9,400 hectares (23,200 acres) some 350 kilometres northwest of Alice Springs. This area is about three times the size of a large airport, or the size of a town. The AWC will introduce native mammals into the area and plans to expand it by ten times beginning in 2020. Before you get all sad, you should probably know that feral cats are an ecological disaster. As we’ve reported, a recent study found that cats have caused 63 bird, mammal, and reptile species to go extinct in the past 500 years. Another recent survey found that cats cover 99.8 percent of the Australian island, at an average density of one cat per two kilometer-by-two kilometer square. Australia has had some trouble fighting the cats, and does not have an effective strategy to do so, AWC chief Attius Fleming told AFP. In the past, they have baited cats with KFC. I have reached out to outside sources as to the actual effectiveness of cat-proof fences and will update this story if we hear back. Initial searches reveal that fences can work. Like many of our problems, Australia’s cat problem began with the British, who brought them over in the late 1700s. The feral population took over and began eating the native species. Other introduced species, like rabbits and foxes, have also taken part in the native species killing, reports the AFP. I, a human who has no problem eating any animal at all, suggest that perhaps Australia should adopt the feral kitty as a national cuisine. Just a suggestion.

Jake Kanter,"Duck boat survivor Tia Coleman. AP Tia Coleman, a survivor of the duck boat disaster that killed 17 in Missouri on Thursday, has given an extraordinary account of the ordeal. Nine of Coleman's relatives, including her husband and three children, died in the accident when an amphibious boat capsized on Table Rock Lake. Coleman's 13-year-old nephew, Donovan Hall, was the only other member of her family to survive. Speaking during an emotional press conference at the Cox Medical Center Branson, where Coleman has been receiving hospital treatment, she described the moment the boat sank, her swim for survival, losing her family, and returning home. The family boarded the boat after having their tickets swapped from an earlier tour. She said the 31 passengers on board were told by the captain that a storm was coming, but that life jackets were not needed. Coleman previously told local news channel KOLR that a ""really huge wave"" swept over the boat, and the last thing she heard was her sister-in-law shouting ""grab the baby."" The water filled up the boat and blinded her, she said, but she was thinking ""I got to get out, I got to get out."" Coleman hit her head, but managed to free herself from the boat, entering icy water near the bottom of the lake. ""I knew I was close to the bottom,"" she recalled. ""I just remember kicking and swimming to the top. As I was swimming up I was praying 'Lord, let me get to my babies.' The harder I fought to get to the top, I was getting pulled down. ""And I kept fighting and kept fighting, and then I said 'Lord if I can't make it, there's no use in keeping me here.' And so I just let go and I started floating and as I started floating, I felt the water temperature change and it got warmer. As it got warmer I knew I was to the top. So I stuck my hand out."" When Coleman emerged, she was eventually hauled out of the water by rescuers on a nearby riverboat. ""Somehow I managed to get to the boat and these beautiful people, angels... they pulled me up. And when they pulled me up onto the boat I didn't see any of my family,"" she said. Coleman said her family could have been saved by life jackets. ""The biggest thing that stood out to me is I felt like if I was able to get a life jacket I could have saved my babies because they could have at least floated up to the top and somebody would have grabbed them,"" she explained.

Scott Davis,"The new NFL helmet rule is sure to cause plenty of disagreement. Harry How/Getty Just one game into the season, the NFL world is up in arms over the new helmet rule. The rule, introduced in the offseason, states that players can't lower their helmet to initiate contact or lead with their helmet against an opponent. Penalties can range from a 15-yard penalty to a fine or ejection. Less than five minutes into the Baltimore Ravens-Chicago Bears Hall of Fame game on Thursday, referees threw a flag for the new helmet rule, assessing a 15-yard penalty on Ravens linebacker Patrick Onwuasor for illegal use of his helmet after a tackle. Here was the play: The rule was called three times on Thursday, with all three penalties going against the Ravens. Ravens coach John Harbaugh said he doesn't know enough about the new helmet rule to judge it. Andy Lyons/Getty People from around the NFL world, from players, coaches, to former referees, have noted the confusion the rule is likely to cause. Mike Pereira, the NFL's former VP of officiating and now an analyst for Fox, said the rule would be ""impossible to officiate."" After one preseason game, it's clear few people have any idea what to expect. ""I'll wait to see the TV copies and see what [the penalties] look like,"" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after the game on Thursday. ""So I really don't know. If I knew, I would give you an opinion on it. I don't know enough about the rule to understand it right now."" Making Harbaugh's comments even more eyebrow-raising, NFL reporter Jim Trotter reported that Harbaugh told him before the game that he wasn't concerned with the rule because the Ravens teach players proper tackling form. Evidently not, in the eyes of the referees. Last week, Philadelphia Eagles players reportedly grew frustrated in a meeting with referees over the rules. The Eagles said the referees could not agree whether a tackle from last season violated the new rule. ""[The refs] were kind of like, 'Hey, we didn't make the rules.' Because I think guys were kind of frustrated,"" running back Wendell Smallwood told ESPN's Tim McManus. ""Most of the defense was like, 'Man, how are we supposed to tackle?' They were frustrated."" ""You can't slow yourself down thinking about rules in a split second,"" Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said. ""The game happens really, really fast, faster than the rules, I think, take account for, but I won't let it affect the way I play."" Bears cornerback Prince Amukamara expressed a similar sentiment to Business Insider. After first asking for a reminder of the rule, Amukamara said players can't afford to slow down and think before plays. ""It is gonna be tough because this is a sport where you gotta make a decision in less than a second,"" he said, adding: ""If you hesitate in this [sport], you'll end up getting hurt and stuff like that. It's gonna be tough."" Amukamara pointed to other potential repercussions. He noted that in the Minnesota Vikings-New Orleans Saints playoff game last year, when Stefon Diggs scored a game-winning 61-yard touchdown, Saints safety Marcus Williams slowed down, appearing to be afraid to crash into Diggs midair. He ended up misplaying the ball, and Diggs broke free for the touchdown. Amukamara also said he expects players will appeal ejections and fines if they disagree with rulings by the officials and league. He said at the moment, it hasn't been a hot topic with the Bears and other players, but he expects it may be later on. The new helmet rule is ostensibly a good one meant to make the game safer. If there's an upside to the confusion following Thursday's game, it's that referees may be trying to set an example in preseason to get players and teams used to the new rule. Perhaps after enough time, things will smooth out. Ravens linebacker Bennett Jackson, who was called for a penalty for violating the helmet rule on Thursday, said he thinks officials are trying to set an example early in the preseason. ""I feel like they're trying to harp on it a lot more in preseason, so they're going to throw flags even on times when it's not necessarily head to head, just to make people aware of it,"" Jackson said. ""I spoke to the ref. He even said, 'Hey, it's preseason, we got to throw the flag.'"" In the meantime, there appears to be a steep learning curve that promises more flags, penalties, reviews, fines, appeals, and debates.","After one preseason game, it's clear the NFL's new helmet rule is going to cause some problems this season.

JONATHAN MARTIN and ALEXANDER BURNS,"But the most closely watched race — and, for Republicans, the most anxiety-inducing one — was in West Virginia, where Mr. Blankenship threatened to again torpedo the party’s chances for success in a red-state Senate seat. President Trump had remained quiet about the primary race even as Mr. Blankenship began attacking Republican leaders, such as referring to the family of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Mr. McConnell’s wife, as the majority leader’s “China family” and calling Mr. McConnell himself “Cocaine Mitch.” But after a telephone call Sunday with Mr. McConnell, and on the advice of his own aides, Mr. Trump finally waded into the race with a Tweet Monday morning aimed at West Virginians. “Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State…No way!” Mr. Trump wrote, before encouraging voters to support either of Mr. Blankenship’s opponents, Representative Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Mr. Trump also invoked the last time Republicans gave away a Senate seat by nominating a flawed candidate, an event that he suggested would live in political infamy. “Remember Alabama,” he wrote, alluding to the party’s nomination of former state judge Roy S. Moore, who lost a special election after a series of women emerged to accuse him of making sexual advances on them when they were teenagers. Mr. Moore, though, had not served a prison sentence. Mr. McConnell on Tuesday would not discuss the attacks against he and his family, allowing that he would “have more to say on that tomorrow” should Mr. Blankenship win. The former chief executive of Massey Energy, Mr. Blankenship spent a year in federal prison after being convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety rules in connection with the Upper Big Branch mining disaster.","The victory by Mr. Cordray, who was endorsed by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, came as a relief to many Democrats who saw Mr. Kucinich as unelectable.",2018-05-09T00:50:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Richard Cordray Defeats Dennis Kucinich in Ohio Democratic Primary,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/richard-cordray-ohio-primary-governor.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/us/09primaries-hfo-02/09primaries-hfo-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
The Conversation,"Some companies and community groups didn't wait for Hurricane Florence to make landfall before organizing donation drives. But as a researcher with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, an interdisciplinary center at Harvard University dedicated to relieving human suffering in wartime and disasters by analyzing and improving the way professionals and communities respond to emergencies, I wish they would have. I've studied dozens of disasters, from Hurricane Maria and Superstorm Sandy to the South Asian tsunami and one thing is clear: In-kind donations of items such as food, clothing, toiletries, and diapers are often the last thing that is needed in disaster-affected areas. Delivering things that people on the ground need simply doesn't help disaster-struck communities as much as giving them — and relief organizations — money to buy what they need. What's more, truckloads of blue jeans and cases of Lunchables can actually interfere with official relief efforts. If you want to do the greatest good, send money. What's wrong with in-kind donations As humanitarian workers and volunteers have witnessed after disasters like Haiti's 2010 earthquake and Southeast Asia's Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, disaster relief efforts repeatedly provide lessons in good intentions gone wrong. At best, in-kind donations augment official efforts and provide the locals with some additional comfort, especially when those donations come from nearby. When various levels of government failed to meet the needs of Hurricane Katrina victims, for example, community, faith-based and private sector organizations stepped in to fill many of the gaps. Delivering things that people on the ground need simply doesn't help disaster-struck communities as much as giving them — and relief organizations — money to buy what they need. Joe Raedle/Getty Images How can in-kind donations cause more harm than good? Donated goods raise the cost of the response cycle: from collecting, sorting, packaging and shipping bulky items across long distances to, upon arrival, reception, sorting, warehousing, and distribution. Delivering this aid is tough in disaster areas since transportation infrastructure, such as airports, seaports, roads, and bridges, are likely to be, if not damaged or incapacitated by the initial disaster, already clogged by the surge of incoming first responders, relief shipments, and equipment. This is especially the case in places like the Outer Banks, a string of barrier islands off North Carolina's coast, where the challenges of bringing relief goods in, and distributing them to people who need supplies, are heightened by geography. Dumping grounds At worst, disaster zones become dumping grounds for inappropriate goods that delay actual relief efforts and harm local economies. After the 2004 South Asian tsunami, shipping containers full of ill-suited items such as used high-heeled shoes, ski gear, and expired medications poured into the affected countries. This junk clogged ports and roads, polluting already ravaged areas and diverting personnel, trucks, and storage facilities from actual relief efforts. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, many untrained and uninvited American volunteers bringing unnecessary goods ended up needing assistance themselves. In-kind donations often not only fail to help those in actual need but cause congestion, tie up resources and further hurt local economies when dumped on the market, as research from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies determined. Research confirms that a significant portion of aid dispatched to disaster areas is "" non-priority,"" inappropriate or useless. One study led by José Holguín-Veras, a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute expert on humanitarian logistics, found that 50% to 70% of the goods that arrive during these emergencies should never have been sent and interfere with recovery efforts. After the 2011 Joplin, Missouri, tornado and the Tōhoku, Japan, earthquake, for example, excessive donations of clothing and blankets tied up relief personnel. Relief workers consider these well-meaning but inconvenient donations as a "" second-tier disaster "" due to the disruption they cause. What else can you do? Instead of shipping your hand-me-downs, donate money to trusted and established organizations with extensive experience and expertise — and local ties. Give to groups that make it clear where the money will go. Choose relief efforts that will procure supplies near the disaster area, which will help the local economy recover. You can also consult organizations like Charity Navigator that evaluate charities' financial performance. Department of Homeland Security personnel deliver supplies to Santa Ana community residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Guayama, Puerto Rico. Associated Press/Carlos Giusti Many humanitarian aid organizations themselves have increasingly adopted cash-based approaches in recent years, though money remains a small share of overall humanitarian aid worldwide. Evaluations of the effectiveness of such programs vary and are context-dependent. Nonetheless, emerging evidence suggests that disbursing cash is often the best way to help people in disaster zones get the food and shelter they need. What's more, the World Food Program and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees say that people affected by disasters tend to prefer cash over in-kind aid due to the dignity, control, and flexibility it gives them. Some exceptions There are a few notable exceptions to this advice on avoiding in-kind donations. If you live in or near the affected area, it is helpful to consider dropping the specific items victims are requesting at local food banks, shelters, and other community organizations. Just make sure that the items won't perish by the time they can be distributed. For areas in Hurricane Florence's path, for instance, the Red Cross has requested blood donations. Charity is a virtue. Particularly when disaster strikes, the urge to help is admirable. Yet this impulse should be channeled to do the greatest good. So please, if you would like to help from afar, let the professionals procure goods and services. Instead, donate money and listen to what people on the ground say they need. And don't stop giving after the disaster stops making headlines. A full recovery will take time and support long after the emergency responders and camera crews have moved on. This is an updated version of an article originally published on Sept. 4, 2017.","Carlo Allegri/Reuters In-kind donations of items such as food, clothing, and toiletries are often the last thing that is needed after disasters.

Wanda Thibodeaux,"Exceptional customer service is critical to keeping your business humming. Getting there can involve all kinds of strategies, but the real key is to grasp that most difficult customer service experiences involve reactance theory. Wrap your head around this one psychological principle and you might see your customers start singing your praises. The basic idea Reactance theory is a psychological concept developed by American psychologist Jack Brehm way back in 1966. The basic idea is that when you make people feel restricted in some way, they want to rebel against that restriction because they feel like you're threatening their freedom and autonomy. It connects to reverse psychology in that, if you tell someone they can't or shouldn't do something, they'll feel compelled to try to do it. Connecting reactance theory and service When a company representative responds by telling a customer what they can't or have to do--for example, you can't send your order back or you have to call 1-800-BAD-HELP--reactance theory kicks in and makes the customer automatically defensive. They feel like you're trying to make yourself into the big person on the top of the hill, and they're threatened by the possibility they don't have any power or authority. The more you try to lay down the law by stating policies or procedures, the worse their offense and fear becomes and the more they want to challenge you. So why do so many companies fall into bad service? Rules and processes give companies a way to script responses and standardize service. That scripting holds the promise of clarity and efficiency. Companies desperately want those elements because in the busy, tech-centric world, customers want fast responses and solutions. If a business can offer that, they can save money and win loyalty in one swoop. What you can do Understanding that customers want equality and to be heard as much as they want fast service, here's how you can avoid triggering the negative ramifications of reactance theory when responding to customer complaints or requests. 1. Treat the customer like they're an expert. The customer is the one who knows what's wrong, what goal they're after and the details you need to find a solution. So right from the start, ask for information in a way that makes them feel empowered. For example, instead of saying, ""What can I help you with today?"", try ""What issue would you like to resolve today?"" 2. Be patient and take the time to empathize. Remember, people just want to be acknowledged. They're less likely to feel threatened by any can'ts or have-tos if you show you get what they're feeling. So for example, if they say they're frustrated, you could say something like, ""I'd feel exactly the same way. Let's see if we can..."", ""Yep, I hear you--it reminds me of when I..."" or ""Yeah, this kind of stuff is always such a pain for me, too."" Even if they don't explicitly state their feelings, you can say something such as ""I can see how that would be really frustrating [disappointing, annoying, etc.]."" 3. Eliminate the ""but"". In an effort to focus on the positive, companies often tell their representatives to say something like ""I can't x, but I can..."" But this format puts what the customer won't get first, which actually can make it harder for the customer not to focus on the restriction or perceived loss. So skip the preface! Just start with ""I'd love to x for you... so you can [customer goal]"" or ""We can..."" 4. Offer options. People feel more in control when they have a choice and get to make a decision. So let's say they can't buy what they're looking for in their local store. Don't just say, ""I'm sorry, we don't have that in stock."" That's a dead end. Say something like, ""Would you like me to help you find it on our website or send you an email alert when our inventory changes?"" 5. Stop talking about how committed you are. Even if you really want to bend over backwards for your customer, if you mix statements about commitment with statements that say what the customer's not allowed to do, the customer is going to see your ""commitment"" as a farce, corporate jargon, just a way to save face or all talk and no action. They think, ""If you were really committed, I'd be able to/you'd..."" Instead, focus on what the customer is asking for and ask them if you can give their feedback to your managers. Be upfront about where you are, including difficulties, and communicate your immediate operational plans. Customer service is challenging enough from the logistics standpoint. There's no need to make it harder by ignoring the fact that people will guard the freedom they feel entitled to. No two customers or situations are exactly the same, too, so you have to be willing to talk on the fly. Just imagine what you'd want if you were on the other side of the call or counter and let honesty replace your canned response as much as you can.","People want to protect the freedom they feel entitled to, and it creates a recipe for customer service disaster.",2018-01-25T12:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",The Single Worst Way to Respond to Customer Complaint (and Why Everyone Does It),https://www.inc.com/wanda-thibodeaux/the-single-worst-way-to-respond-to-customer-complaint-and-why-everyone-does-it.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_146801869_341758.jpg,,Inc.com,1
"Juliette Kayyem, CNN National Security Analyst","CNN analyst Juliette Kayyem is the author of the best-seller "" Security Mom: My Life Protecting the Home and Homeland. "" She is a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and CEO of Zemcar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) Do you know where the children are? For the United States, the answer to that question is still a remarkable ""no."" The Trump administration is in the middle of a humanitarian crisis that it created. And it has exacerbated the tragedy by failing to implement, with urgency, well understood crisis management skills to solve the problem. There is no reason that the reunification of children who were separated by US authorities from their parents should be so chaotic. Just a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar confidently notified the public that the administration would satisfy a court's order to reunite all children younger than 5 by a July 10 deadline, the government reversed course and asked the court for an extension. Sarah Fabian, an attorney for the Justice Department, admitted that the administration still does not know where the parents of nearly 20% of the children are because those parents were released from ICE custody. In other words, the administration would not be able to satisfy the judicial order. These numbers do not include reunification of ""older"" (older than 5) children, which is set for July 26. The lack of any paperwork or accounting means the government is resorting to DNA testing to be able to match these families. And the numbers are all over the place: The government still does not have an exact number of parents or children who remain separated. It has estimated that number to be about 3,000. There are no excuses. Even assuming that the removal policy was sound public policy -- and it was not -- it simply defies logic that our own government would separate children from their families with no serious effort at an accounting and tracking system to be able to reunite them at some stage. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised. After all, the Trump administration, through Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, originally denied even doing it, then balked at the notion that they could stop it. Donald Trump eventually caved to public pressure with an executive order that was so weak it took a court to step in to demand reunification. Was the thought that if the policy wasn't acknowledged these kids would simply -- what, exactly? Go away? Even worse, the reunification process has lacked the urgency and organization that is required of any crisis. Family reunification is a well understood consequence of any disaster; governments spend considerable effort in training and planning procedures (such as organizing non-governmental agencies, churches and schools to assist, creating databases, and picture galleries) in focusing on how to bring children and families back together should they be separated by an event. Family unification is always a priority. After all, disasters happen all the time, and while this one was planned and executed by the government, our efforts would have been better served by implementing disaster management lessons to try to bring them together. What would that take? Well, let's start with the obvious. This is the United States. Unlike Haiti after an earthquake, or Thailand after a tsunami, the basic infrastructure here works: phones, electricity, cameras and computers. The pool of children separated is relatively small compared to many other disasters, such as the Haiti earthquake or Thailand's tsunami; the number of facilities holding these children should be known with some certitude. What's lacking then, is a focus by the very White House that got us to this moment. As reported, the reunification has been stymied by the number of agencies and state and local stakeholders involved in the effort. HHS has borne the brunt of the reunification demands since the children are in their custody. But, multiple players also have strong equities and insights. DHS, whose agencies forcibly removed these children, has been accused of destroying some of the data that links parents to their children, though DHS has denied this claim. There is also the Department of Justice, which oversees the immigration courts; the Department of Defense, which has been preparing to hold families; the State Department, which is getting queries from nations where the children came from; state and local governments where the facilities reside; and private sector contractors who own and manage where these kids are held. What we are missing here is leadership. A point person, an incident commander, a czar, someone in the White House who can manage these various entities and claims and force movement and solution. The White House has remained relatively quiet on this front; the President's homeland security adviser has been notably absent when it comes down to the reunification effort. And so the consequence, outside the mere fact that these children are waiting in limbo, has been a second kind of disaster. It means that what should have been a process to reunite these kids has been too slow; data and numbers have been all over the place, and therefore unreliable; and courts have had to get involved to force the government to do what it could have done on its own. It is clear now that the Trump administration never processed the consequences of its policy and then never processed the urgency of finding a solution. The reason? Others can fill in the blanks: cruelty as a public policy, racism, ignorance, chaos as a means of management, or simply bad execution. Tuesday, the Trump administration is supposed to reunite children younger than 5 with their parents. It will miss that deadline for some of these kids. That we are at this stage defies any appropriate adjectives.

Kate Samuelson,"Historians have resolved a 70-year-old mystery surrounding USS Indianapolis and the number of World War II troops who survived when the Navy cruiser was torpedoed by the Japanese on July 30, 1945. The sinking of the ship, which went down in under an hour, has been called the U.S. Navy’s worst-ever disaster at sea. Out about 1,200 crewmen aboard, it was long believed that 880 sailors and Marines lost their lives during the attack itself or in the water following the ship’s sinking, due to extreme conditions including shark attacks, dehydration and saltwater poisoning. However, thanks to new research by the Naval History and Heritage Command Communication and Outreach Division, officials have since confirmed that 879 people died following the attack on USS Indianapolis. In addition, the number of people who survived is 316, as the Navy has long said, and not 317 as some have posited over the years. The problem was always a matter of math. Now, the reason the number of survivors was revised downward by one is that the total number of people on board was revised too, from 1,196 to 1,195. A search of available public records found that Clarence William Donnor (pictured below), a Navy radio technician believed to have been among the Indianapolis crew, had continued to serve until he was discharged in 1946. But he wasn’t a 317th survivor. In fact, he had not been on the ship in the first place. Even though Donnor’s parents informed that Navy that their son was still alive, the initial clerical error remained in the historic Navy lists with no explanation, according to new a paper produced by historians Richard Hulver and Sara Vladic. This recent review of the number of people who perished following the disaster was ordered by the director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, following the discovery of the USS Indianapolis wreck last summer. A research vessel owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen discovered the wreck in the Philippine Sea, 5,500 meters below the surface on Aug. 19. The ship, which remains the property of the U.S. Navy, was left undisturbed by Allen’s team following the discovery.",New research has led historians to revise downward the count of those killed in the U.S. Navy's worst-ever disaster at sea,2018-03-23T16:38:10Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The Navy Has Finally Solved the Mystery of the Missing Man From the Sinking of a WWII Cruiser,http://time.com/5212544/navy-uss-indianapolis-mystery/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ship.jpeg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Krishnadev Calamur,"The assault on Al Hodeidah was a long time coming. The Emirati-led attack, which began at midnight Wednesday after the Iran-backed Houthis ignored a deadline from the United Arab Emirates to withdraw from the city and its adjoining port, have so far been restricted to a Houthi stronghold south of the city. The airstrikes came despite warnings from aid groups of a humanitarian disaster, and after the U.S. declined to explicitly oppose the operation. Hodeidah, a port city of some 600,000 perched on the Red Sea, is the entrepot for most of the foreign humanitarian aid that enters Yemen. The Houthis have controlled Hodeidah for about two years; with that authority comes access to the revenue from the customs duty that is earned at the port along with, say Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Iranian weapons. T he fight for Hodeidah highlights not only intra-Yemen rivalries, but the thorny regional dynamics involving the Saudis and Emiratis on one side and Iran on the other. It also showcases the tension between the U.S. desire to minimize civilian casualties and its goal of limiting what it views as Iran’s malign regional influence. The extent of Iran’s actual influence in Yemen, however, is unclear. Gerald Feierstein, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Yemen from 2010-2013, said while Tehran has tried to use the situation in Yemen to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, its control over the Houthis is limited. “Does Iran have some influence on the Houthis? Probably. Does it provide training and assistance to the Houthi forces? Absolutely,” Feierstein, who is now the director for Gulf affairs and government relations at the Middle East Institute, told me. “ Does it have relations with the senior Houthi leadership? Of course. But the Houthis don’t necessarily respond” to Iran. Although it is easy to describe the fight in Yemen as a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia or a sectarian fight involving Sunnis and Shia, it’s not quite that simple. “It’s a very complicated war with a lot of different sides and a lot of alliances that form and disintegrate and then re-form in different iterations over time,” Gregory D. Johnsen, a resident scholar at the Arabia Foundation who is an expert on Yemen, told me. The fight for Hodeidah is reflective of the larger battle over Yemen that began in September 2014 when t he Houthis took control of parts of Sanaa, the capital. Less than six months later, the rebels dissolved Parliament and seized the country, forcing President Abd Rabbu-Mansour Hadi to flee. Soon, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and their Arab allies stepped in to back Hadi’s government, with Iran supporting the Houthis, its Shia brethren. Ali Abdullah Saleh, Hadi’s predecessor who was ousted in 2012 amid the Arab Spring protests, and his supporters, also entered the conflict on the side of the Houthis. The resulting fighting claimed the lives of at least 10,000 people, displaced some 3 million others, and destroyed Yemen’s infrastructure. The UN says the violence has spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. By 2016, the conflict was at an apparent stalemate. The Houthis and their allies proved more formidable than either the Saudis or the Emiratis anticipated. Iran, whose involvement in Yemen is not as explicit as it is in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere, is content to keep the Saudi-led coalition mired in a seemingly endless conflict. Yemen’s conflict was allowed to fester until last December, when Saleh and his fighters broke with the Houthis and allied with the Saudis. In the ensuing fighting, the Houthis killed Saleh. The UAE calculated that the loss of Saleh’s fighters had weakened the Houthis, and expected the fight for Hodeidah to be relatively easy. But that may be wishful thinking. An International Crisis Group report said the most likely outcome in Hodeidah was “prolonged and destructive fighting … followed by a period of maximalist demands from all sides” along with a worsening humanitarian crisis. An assault on the city could imperil the lives of more than 250,000 people, according to the UN. Some aid groups withdrew their staff from the city ahead of the attack. On top of all this, the Emiratis support secessionist fighters who seek to restore the pre-1990 division of Yemen. Former president Hadi, meanwhile, has fallen out of favor with the UAE, and now backs the Islah party, which is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood. The U.S. position on the actions of the Saudi-led coalition has evolved. Just last week, it appeared as if the U.S. was warning the UAE not to attack the city. But on Monday, Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, said in a statement that he had “ spoken with Emirati leaders and made clear our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and life-saving commercial imports.” But the Trump administration is likely aware of the growing congressional opposition to the Emirati-led assault on the port, and is likely to support the action of its ally without endorsing it explicitly. “The U.S. has not given a green light for this, but a flashing yellow light,” Joost Hiltermann, the program director for Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group, told me. The U.S. is saying, “‘You’re on your own. We understand you considerations. We thinks militarily this is very difficult to pull off. We continue to support you in the way we’ve been with intelligence sharing and inflight refueling. But that’s it. Just make sure you take care of the humanitarian fallout—and go back to the political negotiations.’” Feierstein told me that the U.S. policy fundamentally hasn’t changed since March of 2015. “ Our position is that the issues in Yemen need to be resolved through political negotiation. There needs to be an agreement.” There are already international efforts in place to resolve the conflict. The UN has tried to mediate. The Houthis approved a peace agreement in 2014, but never abided by it. There is also an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council. The U.S. position, which is that negotiations must be based on these existing initiatives, is complicated by the fact that while it wants to avoid humanitarian disaster in Hodeidah, it also wants to contain Iran. The Saudis, Emirartis, and Israelis welcomed the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran, a move that all but ensures that the agreement is dead; this decision may also have factored into the timing of the Emiratis decision to launch its assault on Hodeidah. Efforts to mediate a compromise agreement by Martin Griffiths, the U.K. diplomat who is the UN special envoy for Yemen, failed, but are ongoing.“I don’t think Martin Griffiths will stop simply because the offensive has started,” Hiltermann told me. “Because in the end the question is what is the real objective? Do the Emiratis think they can defeat the Houthis in Yemen?... Do they think they can defeat the Houthis in the Hodeidah Province, including the city and the port? They seem to think so, but it may be a bridge too far.... You need to go back to the negotiating table.” At the moment, though, that seems a distant prospect. No matter what happens in Hodeidah, there are larger questions about whether a political settlement can be reached with the Houthis across Yemen, and later with the now emboldened secessionist groups in southern Yemen. Johnsen said he was pessimistic about Yemen’s future even if the current impasse were to resolve diplomatically. “ So we look on the map, and Yemen has clearly defined borders, and it’s all one color, and it looks like one country,” he said. “But when you get on the ground, there are many different Yemens... and I’m increasingly pessimistic that anybody will be able to put it back together again.”","Despite calls to stop the assault on Hodeidah, both the Emiratis and the Houthi rebels are digging in.",2018-06-13T19:39:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",The Next Disaster in Yemen,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/the-next-looming-disaster-in-yemen/562658/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/06/RTX68T0Z/facebook.jpg?1528907958,,Theatlantic.com,1
Sarah Wells,"As a race, human beings have a lot of shortcomings. We’re not very fast, not all that strong and while we have been able to create technology that helps us overcome our environments, we’re not very good at adapting to them. Animals, on the other hand, have been successfully adapting and evolving to meet the world’s challenges long before we were stumbling around. While it might be too late for us to learn these lessons ourselves from our animal counterparts, it’s not too late to pass them on to our inventions. And biomimetic and bio-inspired labs across the world are doing just that. “If you think about mobility technology in the engineering world, we have airplanes in the air, ships in the water, but none of these technologies are available without our artificial modification of the environment,” Dr. Sangbae Kim, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and director of the university’s Biomimetic Robotics Laboratory, told TechCrunch. “Animals have evolved to be the best at mobility, because, for most of them, it’s critical for survival.” Crafting technology to mimic nature is nothing new, Kim says. From developing aerodynamic technology to small conveniences like Velcro, humans have been taking a cue from the natural world for as long as we’ve been inventing. The field of engineering, says Kim, has this kind of inspiration as an intrinsic feature and it will be crucial to solving problems such as disaster reconnaissance, labor and even elderly care. “This is technology we must have,” says Kim. “Not just something cool to have.” With new technological developments, this kind of inspired design has gone far beyond Velcro in recent years. Cheetah 3 A prodigy of Kim’s lab, the Cheetah 3 is a 90 pound rescue robot designed to traverse terrain that is dangerous or inaccessible to humans (e.g. power plant inspection of natural disaster reconnaissance) with cat-like reflexes and motion. Its predecessors have been able to make autonomous running leaps over obstacles in their path (granted, at a considerably slower speed than its namesake) and Cheetah 3 has the added functionality to complete all these tasks while blind. By not relying on its sensors and cameras, Cheetah 3 is designed to have a better intuitive knowledge of its environment and perform in scenarios that are either too dark or “noisy” (too visually stimulating.) Sharklet Natural inspiration is not only found in robotics, but in material engineering as well. In 2002, Dr. Anthony Brennan, a material science and engineering professor at the University of Florida, was participating in Naval research to design strategies to keep vessels from growing algae and barnacles on their sides. While exploring the question, Brennan discovered that sharks — who spend their lives slowly moving through water — had answered it long ago. Examining the patterns in a shark’s scales, Brennan discovered that the unique ribbed, diamond structure of the shark’s scales discouraged microorganisms from settling on the surface. Taking this discovery beyond naval ships, Brennan founded the company Sharklet in 2007 to design medical instruments built with this topology and create a non-toxic antibiotic alternative to harsh chemical cleaners. Biomimetic Worm Bot Out of Case Western Reserve University’s Biologically Inspired Robotics lab, this creepy-crawly bot is helping both roboticists and neuroscientists better understand a type of motion called peristalsis — or movement through contracting and expanding of muscle. While this kind of movement is not unique to earth-worms (humans, in fact, do it when swallowing), the ability to propel and maneuver their bodies through tight spaces with it is. To study this motion, the lab created the CMMWorm (Compliant Modular Mesh Worm) — a soft robot with a Lego-like capability to have segments detached and rearranged. Researchers told Gizmodo that they hope this kind of soft robot could be useful in situations as small as medical endoscopies and as large as investigating blocked pipes. SpotMini And who could forget, man’s best friend, Boston Dynamic’s SpotMini. This electric robot weighs about 66 pounds, stands at just under three feet tall and can last for 90 minutes on just one charge. At TC Sessions: Robotics held at UC Berkeley this summer Boston Dynamics announced its plans to move SpotMini into pre-production and begin selling the bot in 2019 — marking the first move toward commercialization for the company. Boston Dynamics says that SpotMini would fit well into a home or office space, but doing what exactly is still a little unclear. If you’re just looking for some canine-like companionship, you might be better off cozying up to Sony’s pricey Aibo instead.","As a race, human beings have a lot of shortcomings.

Sarah Perez,"The Google Play Store is receiving an update today that will allow customers to make charitable donations to nonprofits from their Android device. While it may seem odd to to be rallying for support for charities within the same marketplace where users download apps and games, it’s not uncommon. Apple for years has collected donations for the American Red Cross in the wake of natural disaster like the California wildfires hurricanes, for example. Google’s implementation, however, isn’t a launch tied to a single event. And it’s rolling out support for several charities, not just the Red Cross. Users in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Taiwan and Indonesia will soon see the option to make a donation to a number of organizations, including also charity:water, Doctors Without Borders USA, Girls Who code, International Rescue Committee, Room to Red, Save the Children, UNICEF, World Food Program USA, and World Wildlife Fund US, in addition to the American Red Cross. To access the feature Android users canb head to play.google.com/donate to read about the organizations or to make a donation using the payment card they have on file for the Play Store. To be clear, this is about the Play Store itself collecting charitable donations, not allowing Android app developers to do so. Google Play is covering all the transaction and disbursement costs, so the organizations receive 100 percent of the user’s donation. The feature’s launch has been timed with the holiday season, which often inspires charitable giving. It’s also a sort of belated nod to Giving Week 2018, the movement which encourages people to volunteer, fundraise and donate to worthy causes. (Giving Week this year wrapped on December 5). The donations feature may offer a different selection of nonprofits in the future, we understand, though Google is not announcing any planned additions at this time.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport Two days of national mourning have begun in Cuba after a Boeing 737 airliner crashed near the main airport in Havana, killing more than 100 people. The plane, which was nearly 40 years old, was carrying 105 passengers and six crew members. Three women were pulled alive from the wreckage, but they are said to be in a critical condition. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said an investigation was under way. The crash is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades. What do we know about the dead? Most of the passengers killed are believed to be Cubans, though reports say five foreigners and a six-strong Mexican crew were also on board. Argentina's government said two of its nationals - tourists Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties - were among the dead. Relatives of the victims have started arriving in Havana to help identify the deceased. Those coming from Holguín - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of the island made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses. Cuba's National Revolutionary Police escorted them to speed their way, EFE news agency reports. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The first secretary of Communist Party in Holguín comforts relatives of the crash victims Cuban authorities do not plan to release the full list of the 108 dead until all victims' families have been informed. How did the plane come down? The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguín. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Wreckage was spread over a large area ""I saw it taking off,"" supermarket worker Jose Luis told the AFP news agency. ""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. What about the survivors? Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being transported to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39.

Analysis: Grieving public demand answers By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board. The country's new president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Flags are flying at half-mast in Cuba as the island grieves the disaster It emerged that the previous president, Raúl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families. The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. What do we know about the plane? The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de Aviación by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation.

According to industry research, last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travel with no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.","Two days of national mourning are declared, after the crash near Havana killed more than 100 people.",2018-05-19T16:47:19Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Cuba plane crash: Island starts two days of national mourning,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-44184751,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p067n05q.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1

SALEH MWANAMILONGO / AP,"(KINSHASA, Congo) — Congo’s leader is blaming a deadly Ebola virus outbreak for the last-minute decision to keep an estimated 1 million voters from the polls in Sunday’s long-delayed presidential election, claiming it would be a “disaster” if someone infects scores or hundreds of others. Protests exploded for a second day on Friday in response as health workers suspended efforts and warned that new cases could rise.
In an interview with The Associated Press, President Joseph Kabila contradicted his own health officials and experts with the World Health Organization, who have said precautions were taken in collaboration with electoral authorities so people could vote. Those include tons of hand sanitizer — Ebola is spread via infected bodily fluids — and the screening of all voters entering polling stations.
Kabila in his comments Thursday evening claimed that Ebola could spread as people use voting machines, which require tapping on a touchscreen to select candidates. A polling station could have 500 to 600 voters and “this assumes that a lot of people will be contaminated,” he said. Health officials have said voters would sanitize their hands before and after voting.
Until this week, the Ebola outbreak declared on Aug. 1 had been a challenge but not a barrier to the election. Voting is now delayed in the cities of Beni and Butembo — but not in other communities with confirmed Ebola cases — until March, long after the inauguration of Kabila’s successor in January. Residents had largely supported Kabila in past elections but sentiment has turned in recent years amid persistent insecurity.
This latest delay in an election meant to occur in late 2016 has angered both residents and the opposition, which accuses the government of trying to ensure that Kabila’s preferred successor is elected. Many Congolese believe Kabila will continue to wield power behind the scenes and protect his assets in a country with vast mineral wealth.
Protests broke out in Beni again on Friday, with hundreds of people demanding the right to vote on Sunday with the rest of the country. Police and the army used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the marchers who barricaded streets.
Some protesters carried crosses displaying “RIP Kabila” and saying his preferred successor, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, “will never be our president.” Beni’s civil society urged residents to turn out en masse on Sunday.
“We don’t fear Ebola,” one of the marchers, Claude Vianney, told the AP.
On Thursday, some protesters attacked an Ebola response center and sent 21 patients fleeing. While the health ministry said most had tested negative for the virus and 11 people had already returned, the vandalism was the latest setback in efforts to contain the second deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. Nearly 600 cases have been reported, with more than 350 confirmed deaths.
The uproar over the voting delay has “badly disturbed” Ebola response work in Beni and Butembo, Congo’s health ministry said. Health teams could barely deploy on Thursday and no Ebola vaccinations could be carried out, it said.
The Oxfam aid organization said it was forced to suspend its Ebola response work. Acting country director Raphael Mbuyi called the situation “extremely worrying” because previous suspensions have led to a spike in new cases.
Mbuyi added, however, “it’s not surprising that people who have had their votes taken away at the last minute are frustrated and going to the streets. These people deserve to have their say as well.”
Protesters said life has continued in the outbreak zone, with schools open, people going to church and candidates holding campaign rallies. Congo’s president responded by saying such activities don’t involve voting machines.
There is “no further reason” to prevent Sunday’s election, Kabila told the AP, adding: “Rest assured, there will be peace.” Police will be there to secure the population, he said.
He dismissed opposition allegations that campaigns had faced restrictions, including blocked flights and assaults on supporters, in recent weeks.
Opposition candidate Martin Fayulu told the AP that up to 5 million of Congo’s 40 million voters might not be able to cast ballots on Sunday, claiming that voting machines had yet to be delivered to some areas.
His opposition coalition called for a nationwide “ghost town” strike on Friday but urged people to remain calm.
Congo’s president also sounded defiant in the face of international pressure. Kabila’s foreign minister on Thursday ordered the European Union ambassador to leave the country within 48 hours, citing EU sanctions on Kabila’s preferred successor, Shadary.
The former interior minister is under an EU asset freeze and travel ban for obstructing Congo’s electoral process and for a crackdown against protesters angry over the delayed vote. The EU prolonged the sanctions this month.
An EU spokesperson called Congo’s order “completely unjustified” and counterproductive “on the eve of very challenging elections.”
Kabila, when asked what advice he had for his successor, replied: “The biggest recommendation is that he listen to the voice of the Congolese and not follow that of the United States, Europe or elsewhere.”
Congo has resisted what it considers international meddling, vowing to fund the election itself. Western observer groups are notably absent.
“I have already said that Congo is not a beggar country,” Kabila said.

Adam Robinson,"It was early on a Monday morning when I received the call. It was Marcy, one of our consultants, and she sounded a bit concerned. ""Adam, I didn't get paid today."" I told her that I'd investigate and get right back to her. When the customer service rep from my payroll provider told me that the bank declined our payroll debit, a lump formed in my throat. Frantic, I logged in to view the company's bank account. The balance: $0.00 On Friday, there had been over $120,000 of cash in that account. Monday morning, the account was empty. I was stunned. What in the world just happened? I was a first-time entrepreneur, and had I been asking myself the tough questions about our business along the way, I would have seen quite clearly that a freight train was bearing down on us. Here are the six questions I should have asked: 1. Do I have the right relationship with my bank? When the 2009 recession hit, our customers were impacted just like everyone else. At one point, every one of my outstanding invoices was over ninety days aged. As a result, I maxed our million-dollar line in three months. The bank didn't call me. They just shut down the line. I realized that banking relationships--even simple ones like lines of credit--are critical assets when things get tough. I hasn't put in the time to make sure my banker understood our business. I could have told them sooner, presented a workout plan, and asked for help. Lesson : Once the stuff hits the fan, it's too late to make friends with your banker. 2. How many days can I run this business without new cash flow? With a bounced payroll to remedy, I took my entire personal savings and put it into the company. We had 20 days of cash left before I was out of business. The next payroll would wipe me out. Game over. My customers owed me over a million dollars, and the key to the company's survival was my ability to get our customers--themselves struggling in tough economy--to pay me what was owed, and fast. Every check meant another week of survival. Lesson : My weak collections process created major cash flow problems. 3. Do I have a customer concentration issue? While dialing our customers and begging for payments, I realized that two customers accounted for forty percent of our revenue. The concept of customer concentration risk became very real for me. Large, profitable accounts made life easy for us. We did great work for them, and we grew the business. But it was a house of cards. Having two accounts representing nearly half our revenue base was a massive risk to the business, no matter how secure I considered these accounts. Lesson : I hadn't built a predictable model for landing new business. 4. Do I have the right business model? We delivered service for the customer, then sent the invoice. Sixty days later (theoretically!) we received a check. The business model I had created required me to finance sixty days of working capital. When we received payment, almost all of it went to pay expenses that had already been accrued, leaving only a few points of profit margin. Lesson : Running a high-growth, receivables-based business with low profit margins is a recipe for disaster. 5. Is everyone on our payroll delivering tangible value? I'm a loyal person. When the economy started to turn south, I knew I was carrying people we no longer needed, but I held on to them out of a sense of obligation as well as hope that we'd land that next account in time. It was a jobs program that I couldn't afford to operate. Lesson : Had I rightsized my organization sooner, I would have had sufficient cash to cushion the impact of a slowing economy. 6. Do I really need to be spending money on that? When forced to examine every expenditure down to the penny, I stared to wonder about all of the technology tools subscriptions and the other little things that bleed off cash flow. I was running a business with a net profit margin of about five percent. Said differently, for every one hundred dollars I spent on something, I needed to produce two thousand dollars of revenue to afford it. Looking at my expenses through this sense made decision-making a lot easier. Lesson : Little expenses add up to a big cash drain. Fast forward to 2010: With the help and support of a few extremely loyal individuals, we stabilized the business and I managed get out from under a debt load that almost certainly would have pushed me into personal bankruptcy. What did I learn from not making payroll? I learned what it takes to truly run a business.",Most business failures are completely avoidable.

BeauHD,"For some reason I got to talking with some of my co-workers on the nuclear emergency evacuation plans that get printed in phone books and such. We live near an operating nuclear power plant so I guess plans like this are legally required or something. The area around the reactor was separated into evacuation zones, each zone is supposed to head out away from the power plant to a specified neighboring city. One of my co-workers mentioned that where we worked was in one zone and where his children went to school was in a different zone. He said they can take their plan and shove it, he's got his own plan. I suspect that he's not unique. If someone were to actually order an evacuation then we'd have chaos as everyone does their own thing. I suspect that the police and National Guard would be called out to maintain some semblance of order but that's just wishful thinking. We've had evacuations because of floods before and I saw some of the mayhem from a fairly local, and visible, threat. You take an invisible and widespread threat (and quite likely theoretical threat) like a radiation release then all plans will go out the window. You'll have panicked parents punching out police officers at roadblocks so they can get to their children before the school buses them off to somewhere a county away from where the parents are supposed be. That's assuming the police even show up. But we can't have nuclear power because we have what has been proven to be a non-issue while we keep burning coal, which also creates a much more certain (and again still theoretical) threat to the safety of children. Oh, and the lack of new nuclear power means we keep operating current nuclear power plants decades beyond their designed lifespan. Fukushima Daiichi would likely have been shutdown 20 years ago if Japan had not stopped building new nuclear power plants. So, we can do an orderly shutdown of these old nuclear power reactors or wait until we have to do a very disorderly shutdown. We'll have people claim we can replace these nuclear power reactors with wind and solar but how much will that cost? Wind might look cheap until we figure out that all installed capacity is not equal. A nuclear power plant can have a capacity factor of 90% and wind a capacity factor of 30%. You shutdown a one gigawatt nuclear power plant then you'll need three gigawatts of wind capacity and a Tesla PowerWall big enough to run a small city for hours.

Arianna O'Dell,"""My company did four million in revenue last year,"" the man at a networking event boasted as he sipped his cocktail. ""Cool,"" I replied and turned to roll my eyes. While the man could have been telling the truth, I've learned over time how to tell when someone's success is legitimate or a figment of their own imagination. During the course of running my business, I've been scammed, deceived, and played enough to now know every red flag in the book. Here are three warning signs you can look out for that can save you from the unnecessary headache of a business ""player"" who's all talk and no action. 1. They're talking numbers five minutes after meeting you. Whether it's at a party or business event, anytime I've encountered someone throwing around grandiose numbers about how much they pay for rent, how much they make, or how much their business is doing in revenue, I've often learned afterward that they are are only full of shi-- shiny invented numbers. It can be important to talk figures, but in due time. Anyone who runs out of the gate screaming, ""My apartment costs five thousand per month!"" or ""My business did seven figures last year,"" is not someone you should trust or want to do business with. When someone starts talking numbers five minutes into a conversation, you can be certain that you're dealing with inflated numbers and likely an inflated ego. In my experience, it's often the most humble entrepreneurs who are the most successful. As you're doing business, learn to trust your gut. If a deal seems to good to be true, it almost always is. 2. They constantly build themselves up and won't stop bragging. Anyone who constantly compliments themselves during the conversation and brags about their accomplishments is likely embellishing--or has very low self-esteem. In both cases, this type of person is probably not someone you're going to want to work with. With technology at your fingertips, it can be easy to detect a fraud simply by looking them up online. By perusing LinkedIn, doing a quick Google search, and scrolling a bit through their social media profiles, you can often see if someone's accomplishments match what they are saying. Name dropping is a big red flag. Sometimes, I'll meet someone new and within the first 20 minutes of conversation they are already dropping names about the famous people they know and the ""huge companies"" they've worked with. I've learned not to take these people seriously as they are usually lying or tend to have an ego the size of Texas. Anyone who is trying to hard to prove they are a success usually is overcompensating for the fact that they aren't. 3. They go from zero to one hundred too fast. ""We should start a business together or partner on a project,"" is something I've heard dozen of times, only to quickly learn that this person has zero follow-through. It's important to take all business talk with a grain of salt until you can be certain that a person will actually act on their words. Similar to an overzealous lover who confesses his love to you after one date, a business prospect who wants to partner up and take over the world together too fast is probably someone you shouldn't take seriously. When you're evaluating a potential business partner, it's important to take time to get to know them, how they work, and learn more about their background. Though their ""talk"" might sound good - it's important to also learn if they can also walk the walk. In the business world, you'll encounter many individuals who resemble a cubic zirconia. Hold out for the diamonds, and you'll be glad you did.",The business world is full of fakes and scams--watch for these three red flags to prevent a disaster.,2018-02-15T00:17:29Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Easily Spot a Business Fony by Looking for These 3 Critical Red Flags And Scams,https://www.inc.com/arianna-odell/easily-spot-a-business-scam-by-looking-for-these-3-critical-red-flags.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_492385076_345138.jpg,,Inc.com,1
Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. It's not been a good week for United Airlines. A dog died after a Flight Attendant put it in an overhead bin. Another ended up in Japan, rather than Kansas. Although if I had the choice between Japan and Kansas, I have a feeling the latter might be edged out. Typically at such times of painful public relations, I hear from United employees. They tell me of the state of their psyche. They show me some of the other reactions from inside the airline. I listen, as all decent shrinks should. They're in pain. What, though, do they see as the main problems with the airline? ""Could this get any worse?"" one Flight Attendant told me. Of the dead dog incident, one Flight Attendant told me it had made her weep. Another said: ""I think everyone is just shocked and saddened by the incident. Pets don't belong in overhead bins and we all know that. I can't comment on the specifics because I wasn't there, but this should not have happened. We know better."" That's the problem, though, isn't it? Sometimes we know what the right thing to do is and we still don't do it. ""Morale isn't good,"" one United employee told me. ""There's so much bad blood after the lottery bonus scandal. Everyone is wondering how they could even suggest something like that. And we still don't know whether they're going to take our bonuses away anyway."" Some specifically point to pressure that's being placed by the airline on getting passengers boarded as quickly as possible. ""We are held accountable for on-time departures,"" said one Flight Attendant. ""If there's a delay in boarding, we usually have to explain why to supervisors."" But wait, the airline instituted its new policy of compassion after the terrible incident with Dr. David Dao being dragged down an aisle, his face all bloodied? This, I'm told, clashes with the new policy to get the plane out on time, or else. ""We're dealing with a lot of quick turns lately,"" a Flight Attendant told me. ""That's when a plane arrives at a gate and has to go back out in less than an hour. So that means cleaners are scrambling before boarding and so are flight attendants during boarding."" It's possible that when you're scrambling, your mind scrambles ""There's a dog in that carrier. Please don't put it in the overhead bin."" This is what the airline claims happened in the dead dog affair, that the Flight Attendant didn't hear or misunderstood what was in the carrier. I contacted United for its view, but the airline didn't respond. In an online forum, a Flight Attendant described the boarding process as ""the craziest part of a Flight Attendant's day."" Not dealing with the woman who's put both her feet up on the tray table ? The Flight Attendant explained: ""FA's don't get paid until the aircraft pushes back from the gate."" Then, they said, there's the problem with what Flight Attendants view as deliberate understaffing. ""There is only one FA in coach during boarding. FA is responsible for FAR's [Federal Aviation Regulations], security, bags, seat dupes, unams [unaccompanied minors], exit row criteria, checking bags, looking for overserved people [drunks], scanning for people who might be a security threat, answering passengers' questions etc,"" said the Flight Attendant. Some might think that this is, well, the job. Indeed, the minimum staffing levels are set by the Federal Aviation Administration. It's not a surprise that airlines staff their planes to the minimum, is it? Some Flight Attendants, though, believe they have far too much to do in far too short a time. Pockets of the media are currently wondering whether CEO Oscar Muñoz will take the fall for the constant PR disasters. The Flight Attendants and other employees I've listened to, however, blame airline president Scott Kirby and not Muñoz for the airline's woes. When you've got senators proposing bills because you can't keep dogs alive -- if only, some might observe, senators could do that when, say, humans are killed by guns -- you have a very serious image problem. And that image problem is being reflected in reactions within the airline. It's not as if Delta, American or other airlines' Flight Attendants don't complain too. Here, though, it feels more ingrained, as if the constant bad PR is affecting everyone. And when the revised version of the bonus lottery comes out -- the airline tried to get rid of the employees' regular bonus in favor of a lottery in which only a few would win -- do you imagine things will be better or worse?",A dead dog in an overhead bin?

Farmers Insurance,"By Bronwyn Koopman, Head of Central Zone Product for Farmers Insurance ® When established brands face a reputational disaster - a product fails catastrophically, for example, or E. coli contaminates the menu -armies of specialists are brought in to help salvage customer trust and ease the business through its crisis. They marshal every resource available because they know these events can impact a company's reputation for years, causing potential immeasurable harm. The damage can be especially devastating if you're an entrepreneur struggling to build your personal brand in today's competitive market. Taking a quick step back, the term ""personal brand"" has been around since management consultant and author Tom Peters coined it in 1997 in an article entitled, "" The Brand Called You."" But the concept is as old as history. It's your reputation, your values, your capabilities - anything that separates you from your competition. So, a personal brand is what you're known for. And, if you're a budding entrepreneur, your company brand will have a lot in common with your personal brand. What if something were to happen that undermined your customers' trust and loyalty? Your resources and reputational assets are undoubtedly limited. Would your personal brand survive? What can you do to preserve its value? And, equally important, are there proactive measures you can take to position your brand for survival? Yes, there are. Here's five simple strategies to help you avoid a personal reputational fiasco and strengthening your professional brand. 1. Be Your Authentic Self Strong brands don't try to be all things to all people. For example, a national pizza chain that's built its reputation on making great pizzas wouldn't start making hamburgers one day and thus dilute their brand. They would risk losing their loyal consumer base by straying too far from their core competency. Be yourself, stick with what you know and do it better than your competitors. 2. Tell It Like It Is Related to authenticity is the need to resist overpromising. Especially when you're first starting out, it's tempting to claim more expertise than you have. So, listen to that little voice inside that sometimes makes you uncomfortable, and be transparent about your capabilities. You can always add related expertise, services, or products later, effectively expanding your brand as companies often do. The worst thing you can do is overpromise and under-deliver, especially early on in your entrepreneurial journey. 3. Communicate This means more than sending out a monthly newsletter or writing a weekly blog post. It means writing and speaking in a way that is respectful to your audience. Respectful communications will pay off if an issue ever arises. In extreme cases, companies have taken out full-page ads in national newspapers, and CEOs have gone on national television, and these measures have gone a long way toward preserving public trust. 4. When You Mess up, Admit it Everybody makes mistakes, but owning up to them is less common. So learn to admit to your customers when something goes wrong. Making excuses or blaming others will only show that you can't be trusted. Admittance is the first step, but it goes nowhere without the next step. This comes to life at home, too. I'm working hard to instill in my kids the need for honesty, transparency and authenticity. I want them to know they can tell me when they mess up, because the longer they keep the truth from me, the worse their situation becomes. It seems simple enough, but admitting there's a problem early on will get you the help and resources needed to make things right, both in business and personal relationships. 5. Make Amends Take responsibility for the consequences of your mistake, and if necessary, offer to make up for it. That shows your customers that you value their business and want to serve them. It's also evidence of humility, which is always an appealing trait. The actions you take to foster good will with the public may contain damage to the brand. Ultimately, how to develop and sustain a personal brand that endures, even after a setback, isn't a huge mystery. It's about building trust with your customers. Preserving your personal brand essentially comes down to practicing those principles most of us were taught as children. Be honest, be respectful, keep your promises, admit your mistakes, and take responsibility. You'll then have less cause to stay up nights worrying about a reputational nightmare.",Looking to avoid a personal brand reputation crisis?

Jason Feifer,"This story appears in the December 2017 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe » The holidays can be a killer. For many entrepreneurs, particularly those in retail, the stretch between Halloween and New Year’s is when teams get stressed, systems get strained and even the smallest inefficiencies can amplify into crises. If a young company builds itself well enough to survive into January, it’ll be in great fighting shape for the rest of the year. If it can’t, it won’t. And that was the crossroads Melissa Ben-Ishay found herself in back in 2009. Related: I Started Saying 'No' to These 6 Things. My Life and My Business Got a Lot Better. Her New York-based company, Baked By Melissa, sells bite-size cupcakes. It had grown fast, and she thought she was ready for the holiday crush. On one of the first days of that season, she woke up at 3 a.m. to see how things were going. Holy shit, the orders are coming, she thought, and they’re not stopping. So she ran down to her fulfillment center to help out and discovered a disaster in the making: Her back-end system was buckling under the volume of orders. The whole thing would need to be scrapped. “We were basically at square one,” Ben-Ishay recalls. It was about to be a long December. But by the time January came, she’d know what it takes to build a company into the future. Ironically, Baked By Melissa’s first big break came during a previous holiday rush. In 2008, Ben-Ishay was fired from an advertising job and began baking cupcakes to sell through catering companies. She was asked to make them for a large holiday market, so she hired an employee and they spent 15 hours a day baking for six weeks straight. Every day, they sold out. “So we knew we had this unbelievable opportunity. We had to take advantage of it,” she says. Related: 25 Common Characteristics of Successful Entrepreneurs Ben-Ishay spent the next year building her brand. The company’s many-flavored mini cupcakes hit a sweet spot in the city -- an adorable, inexpensive, gourmet snack without all the sugar of a full-size cake. She set up a retail location, increased her delivery business and built a back-end system made for fast deliveries: An order comes in and is queued up to be fulfilled and delivered. But on that early holiday morning, when Ben-Ishay discovered her system was failing, she called her first employee, and the two of them spent weeks printing out and pasting order slips by hand. Her dad and friends were conscripted to do deliveries. Deliveries were late. Her customer service department went into overdrive. Once the rush died down, Ben-Ishay and her team debriefed. They knew that, most importantly, they had to learn to anticipate. They had no way to know what people would order at any one time and, therefore, how much product to make and people to deploy. So they set up sales meetings every Monday throughout the year to review the data. Then they reimagined their back-end system with an emphasis on organization. Rather than sending individual orders out the door, the company now arranges orders by area and sends them in waves -- meaning a larger volume can move more efficiently. “Every decision we make now is a data-driven decision,” she says, “which is amazing and what’s necessary to make the company grow.” Related: 9 Steps to Increase the Value of Your Business And grow it has. Baked By Melissa has 13 retail locations in New York City and a nationwide e-commerce business. By the end of 2017, it will have sold 100 million cupcakes and it expects to sell 30 million more in 2018, with ambitious expansion plans in the offing. But Ben-Ishay continues to reflect on what she learned when times were toughest. “The lesson, and it’s something I’m always working on, is not letting myself get emotional,” she says. “Everything’s going to be OK. And really, what’s the worst thing that’s going to happen? Somebody’s gift is going to arrive the next day? That’s OK. They’re still going to get freshly baked cupcakes.”",Melisa Ben-Ishay talks about her first big mistake (during the holiday rush!) and what it taught her about prepping for sales spikes.,2017-12-07T14:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How the Founder of Baked by Melissa Recovered From Her First Holiday Sales Disaster,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/304381,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171108153737-ent-dec2017-bakedbymelissa.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,1

Yesterday, Kylie Jenner tweeted a pretty brutal takedown of Snapchat with the nonchalance that only a celebrity who has mastered social media better than most can do. sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me… ugh this is so sad. — Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) February 21, 2018 The words were significant not only because of who was saying it, but because it fits a pretty clear narrative that Snap is slowly losing its bread-and-butter users to Instagram and that its controversial redesign has alienated the core who were still holding on. Even though Snap CEO Evan Spiegel voiced that the company was anticipating some blowback from the app’s redesign, things have still been a bit of a disaster with the company being forced to respond to a Change.org petition decrying the redesign that currently has more than 1.2 million signatures. This PR nightmare has had negative impacts on the company’s business as well, Citi downgraded Snap stock Tuesday in response to some of this blowback sending the stock downwards. Snap’s stock price is down 8 percent today. Kylie Jenner is just about as influential a celebrity as they come, many of the product advances of social media companies like Snap have been bore on the backs on influencers like Jenner who have hundreds of millions of followers across these platforms that she uses to push her makeup products and lifestyle onto culture. Snapchat’s advantage has always been that it’s been a bit of a youth-centric enigma, investor have assumed that the audience of DAUs that it has in its back pocket is a the most highly valuable demographic of young, loyal users. It turns out that after a divisive redesign, people are discovering that the kids aren’t alright with change and that they are just as aware of the creeping sense of stagnation as everyone else. After sending a tweet that signified Snapchat hadn’t done anything to hold here attention, Jenner went one further basically signaling that the app was a point of nostalgia for her now.

Associated Press,"(GUATEMALA CITY) — Disaster coordination authorities have asked 10 communities in Guatemala to evacuate and go to safe areas after an increased eruption of the Volcano of Fire. The 10 communities have at least 2,000 residents, but each community will decide if they evacuate or not. Antigua al Rescate, an organization that helped communities after a devastating eruption in June, and a newspaper in the capital reported at least three communities were doing so. Images of the volcano after midnight showed glowing lava at the summit. The volcano is located among the departments of Escuintla, Chimaltenango and Sacatepéquez in the south-central part of the country. David de León, spokesman for the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction, told The Associated Press that at least eight communities should leave. De León said monitoring of the volcano’s activity during the day Sunday showed the intensity of the eruption was being maintained, so the evacuation was called for to protect people. The 3,763-meter (12,300-feet) Volcano of Fire is one of the most active in Central America. An eruption in June killed 194 people and left at least 234 missing, although organizations supporting the communities have insisted there are thousands of missing persons. It spewed more ash and lava in October, prompting warnings for the nearby communities.

JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS,"The defectors have been involved in quiet bipartisan talks to strike a compromise that could end the shutdown. Among the ideas discussed has been legislation that would pair border security money with permanent legal status for Dreamers, the undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children who stand to lose their deportation protections and work permits after Mr. Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, created by Barack Obama in 2012.
The Republican plan to be offered on Thursday follows that formula but has been dismissed as a nonstarter by Democratic leaders because it substantially narrows DACA eligibility, and extends it for only three years, while making major changes to asylum law that would make it harder for migrants fleeing violence and persecution to find refuge in the United States. It would also extend three-year reprieves for those living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status granted in times of conflict or natural disaster who stand to be removed after Mr. Trump ended their protections.
The Democratic plan would reopen the government and continue funding at current levels for two weeks, allowing time for a compromise on border security spending.
The Democratic-led House took separate action on Thursday to pass legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 28, with all but five Republicans voting no. One Democrat, freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, also voted against it because it would reopen Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which she wants closed.","The Senate will vote at 2:30 p.m. on two measures to reopen the government, and while both are expected to fail, the action is supposed to spur negotiations.",2019-01-24T17:20:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Senate Sets Test Votes to End Government Shutdown as Pressure Mounts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/us/politics/government-shutdown-senate-vote.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/us/politics/25dc-shutdown/25dc-shutdown-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
ALAN BLINDER,"The presidents trip came three days after he approved a disaster declaration for Lee County, where residents are eligible for grants for temporary housing and home repairs and loans for uninsured property. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already approved more than $42,000 in assistance in the county. The agency said five applications had been approved and that more were being processed.
FEMA and American presidents have long grappled with the aftermath of severe storms in the South, where hundreds of deaths in the last decade alone have been attributed to tornadoes. Mr. Trump is the fourth consecutive president, at least, to visit Alabama to survey tornado damage.
But as Mr. Trump and the Beauregard community mourned the dead, the state was preparing for the possibility of more severe weather. Although forecasters have gradually become more concerned about dangerous weather in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, experts said that Alabama remained in some jeopardy.
While the setup through the weekend is not as potent as what we saw last weekend, we still have to be vigilant with severe storms as we are now in our spring severe weather season in Alabama, Scott Martin, an Alabama meteorologist, wrote in an analysis on Friday.

Rosie Perper,"Officials fear at least 5,000 people may still be missing in Indonesia following a deadly earthquake and tsunami that killed 1,763 people and devastated the northern island of Sulawesi. Officials updated the number of casualties on Sunday. The country's disaster agency announced the search for survivors would end Thursday, despite fears that scores of people still remain buried under heaps of rubble and mud. Thousands of those still missing are thought to be from the towns of Baleroa and Petobo, which was swept away following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami last month, leaving mass destruction in its wake. Officials are reportedly considering declaring the area mass graves because of the widespread damage. Officials said it was still unsafe to use heavy machinery in some areas where soil had loosened and collapsed after the earthquake in a process known as liquefaction. Many of the dead were buried in mass graves because of the overwhelming amount of victims. Officials have said they worry that a delay in burying the bodies could create a new health crisis. Families have sifted through body bags searching for their loved ones. Many of the missing are believed to be dead as rescue efforts enter its second and final week. Those not found by Thursday will be presumed dead, disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. More than 30 bodies were recovered in one place on Saturday. Officials said rescue efforts will now focus on supplying aid and relief to survivors of effected areas. 62,000 people remain displaced, Nugroho said, as aid donations slowly reach those impacted by the disaster. Aid deliveries have slowly trickled in. Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images Reports indicate that the country's early detection warning systems were not working before the tsunami hit. Officials confirmed to the BBC that a network of more than 20 floating detection units connected to underwater sensors which transmit advance tsunami warnings to the Indonesian meteorology and geophysics agency had either been damaged or stolen. The system had not worked since 2012, and an apparent lack of funding hasn't helped. ""If we look at the funding, it has decreased every year,"" disaster agency spokesperson Sutopo told local media Sunday. A tsunami warning was still issued, but it appeared to significantly underestimated the scale of the impending waves. Indonesia's geophysics agency warned of a tsunami nearly 10 feet tall, but lifted the warning shortly after it was issued.","Officials fear at least 5,000 people may still be missing in Indonesia following a deadly earthquake and tsunami which killed 1,763 people and devastated the northern island of Sulawesi.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere. The storm, which struck the southeastern coast of Africa with the strength of a Category 2 hurricanelast week, almost obliterated the city of Beira in Mozambique, home to some 500,000 people.
While the countrys death toll currently stands at 84, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi is estimating that number could rise to more than 1,000, according to the Associated Press. And thats just for one country; the death tolls for other affected countries like Zimbabwe and Malawi may continue to rise as governments begin evaluating their situations. In Zimbabwe, at least 89 people are dead. In Malawi, at least 56, per Africa News.
It is a real disaster of great proportions, President Nyusi said to state Radio Mozambique, according to the AP.
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that.
CNN reports people in Mozambique are still awaiting rescue on their rooftops in places like Buzi where floodwaters remain high. At least 67 schools and 24 health units have been affected across the country according to ReliefWeb, and many areas are without power. To make matters worse, the rains are expected to continue through Thursday even though the cyclone has dissipated.
The deadliest storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere is Cyclone Leon-Eline in 2000, which killed some 800 people in this same region, as noted by Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters in a blog post. Even if the death toll doesnt increase, Cyclone Idai is already among the deadliest tropical storms this part of the world: So far, its No. 5. 
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that, Masters told Earther. Just a couple days before landfall, I was saying this is going to be a bad one because they dont have a lot of hurricane experience there preparing for big storms like this.
The people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi arent prepared because, well, storms of this strength arent all that common in this area. The last time these countries experienced a storm this intense, Masters said, was Leon-Eline in 2000. Though that storm was much strongera Category 4it didnt hit Mozambique the way Cyclone Idai did.
Idai had all the makings of a meteorological horror story. It was moving slowly, contributing to extreme rainfall conditions, including about 2 feet of rainwater in Beira. The storm also hit during high tide, which made the surge much worse than it wouldve been during low tide. On top of that, the cyclone came ashore just north of Beira where the surge could move into the Pungwe River delta, which exaggerated the flooding conditions. 
Idai was a near-textbook example of a cyclone inflicting maximum flood damage on this part of Mozambique, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, to Earther in an email.
Idai was borne from the same system that was already causing downpours in the area in the week prior, explained Masters. A tropical disturbance over land dumped one to two feet of rain over Mozambique some two weeks back, with one station recording 11 inches in just 12 hours March 7, he said. Once that disturbance moved over the water, Cyclone Idai formed.
We cant be sure how much of a role climate change played in Idai, but science is telling us that these type of extreme weather events will become more common in a warmer world with higher ocean temperatures. Even though they had little to do with causing this mess, African governments need to be better equipped if they want to safeguard their communities. Experiencing both flooding and droughts, Mozambique currently ranks third in Africa in terms of its vulnerability to these types of events.
Cyclone Idai underlines that no matter how effective early warnings are, there is still a huge demand for greater investment in resilient infrastructure in many parts of the world if we are to break the cycle of disaster-response-recovery, said United Nations Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction Mami Mizutori, in a statement.","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere.

FRANCES ROBLES,"FEMA did provide huge generators to power water-pumping stations on the island, and has been spending $20 million a month on generators for two electric power plants. In all, the report says, the agency has provided one million nights’ lodging in hotels and 130 million meals after the 2017 storms, a level of aid it considers “unprecedented.” The agency spent nearly $4 billion on aid and recovery efforts related to Puerto Rico. But many in Puerto Rico fault the agency’s efforts. “I don’t think anything provided by FEMA was a ‘meal,’” said Carlos J. Torres, 46, a resident of Guayanilla in the southern part of the island, referring to the military rations and boxes of candies and snacks that the agency often distributed. “You cannot call that food,” he said. Mr. Torres said he received a $500 emergency grant from FEMA, but has not been able to return to his apartment because the building was badly damaged and the landlord, his father, did not qualify for disaster assistance. His father was referred to the Small Business Administration to take out a low-interest loan for repairs, but “what I am expecting to see is a lot of people losing their property,” Mr. Torres said. “They are not going to be able to pay that off.” Thousands of Puerto Ricans left homeless by the storm took refuge on the mainland with FEMA’s help, but have still not been able to return home. Bethzaida Crespo, 36, moved her family to a hotel room in Orlando when her home in Dorado flooded. She received $3,000 for her losses and FEMA has paid for the hotel room. But that assistance is set to run out on July 23, and like many evacuees, she is looking to the agency for help finding a longer-term solution.","When a killer storm came to Puerto Rico, FEMA’s warehouse on the island was nearly empty, with not a single tarpaulin or cot left in stock.",2018-07-12T22:23:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","FEMA Was Sorely Unprepared for Puerto Rico Hurricane, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/us/fema-puerto-rico-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/us/13fema-01/13fema-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","More than a week has passed since Cyclone Idai tore through the coast of southeastern Africa, dealing a devastating blow to the region. The cyclone has killed more than 750 among the three countries impacted, reports the Associated Press. And its left the major city of Beira in ruins.
All this is only the beginning, however, as the affected countries of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi brace for a public health crisis that has the potential to be widespread and long-lasting, with impacts ranging from infectious disease outbreaks to psychological trauma. The 900,000 children affected by the cyclone are particularly vulnerable.
So are the 110,000 currently taking refuge in camps in Mozambique, which sound like magnets for disease and further trauma to experts. 
The close proximity of everyone to everyone else is a real problem in the spread of diseases, Irwin Redlener, the director of Columbia Universitys National Center for Disaster Preparedness whos also a clinical professor at the universitys Mailman School of Public Health, told Earther. Thats one issue, but there are many more concerns there. People are under a great deal of stress.
From a disease perspective, cholera and malaria are of primary concern because the floodwaters, which are finally dropping in Beira but continue to isolate rural areas, contribute to the growth of these diseases, which are endemic in the region. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has reported, but not confirmed, malaria infections, which are spread through infected mosquitoes that reproduce in stagnant waters (like floodwaters). The group has also reported, but not confirmed, cases of cholera, a waterborne bacterialillness that kills by dehydrating those who are ill, in Beira. The Mozambican government is reporting cases of acute watery diarrhea, a symptom of cholera, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
Both infectious diseases can be deadly if left untreatedand they can spread quickly when hitting a dense population. Like these camps. 
In disasters like this onewhere there is a lack of clean water and sanitation, and potential overcrowdingoutbreaks of waterborne diseases are common, said Jana Sweeny, a spokesperson for IFRC who is on the ground in Beira, in an email to Earther. The Red Cross is focusing on bringing in vital sanitation and clean water resources to help prevent any disease outbreak.
The organization has brought in its first sanitation Emergency Response Unit, a team supplied with special equipment that offers water purification services to up to 20,000 people every day,to Beira. Another unit is on its way to the region, with the ability to produce clean water for 15,000 people a day, Sweeny said. A field hospital arrived Monday in Beira and will be operational Tuesday. while a second field hospital is coming later in the week. Both can help doctors conduct emergency surgeries and provide medical services to at least 30,000 people.
Medical services and clean drinking water are among the most immediate concerns. But the people impacted by this disaster will need mental health services, too. Psychological impactsfrom general anxiety to post traumatic stress disorderoften result from disasters like this.For instance Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico more than a year ago, left high rates of PTSD in its wake. 
Children are most at risk for psychological trauma, explained Redlener.
Children can be protected from the stress of a major event like whats happening in Mozambique, but they need resilient, caring parents who are able to keep things under control to the extent possible and continue to reassure their children that things are going to be OK, he said.
Sadly, thats not an option for the kids who lost their parents, which Redlener described as the most significant and dangerous kind of stress to any child on the planet.The international faith-based organization ACT Alliance estimates that in the Mozambican province of Zambezia alone, some 683 orphans and vulnerable children have been affected by the disaster.
More children have been separated from their families, so the Red Cross has set up an online portal to help connect distressed parents to their kids, as well as conducting radio announcements. More than 36,000 homes were completely destroyed in Mozambique during the catastrophic eventand those floodwaters often swept people away. In a press release, OCHA describes traumatized children who reportedly witnessed the loss of their parents or siblings.
For children affected by Cyclone Idai, the road to recovery will be long, said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore, in a press release. They will need to regain access to health, education, water and sanitation. And they will need to heal from the deep trauma they have just experienced.
Disasters arent easy on anyone, and studies show that the psychological impacts can last years after. That may be especially true for Cyclone Idai, which already ranks among the three deadliest tropical cyclones ever to hit the Southern Hemisphere. A whole lot of trauma will come attached to that titleand it wont go away on its own. 
Neither will climate change, which could make these awful events all the more common for the people least responsible for causing it.","More than a week has passed since Cyclone Idai tore through the coast of southeastern Africa, dealing a devastating blow to the region.

CHRIS STANFORD,"“We know that drinking, plus driving, spell death and disaster.” At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden 34 years ago this week, President Ronald Reagan signed legislation intended to force states to raise their minimum drinking age to 21 by linking it to federal highway aid. Candy Lightner, who founded Mothers Against Drunk Driving after her daughter was killed by a drunk driver, joined President Ronald Reagan as he signed a bill to raise the legal drinking age to 21. Credit Associated Press Until 1919, there was no national drinking age in the U.S. After the end of Prohibition in 1933, most states set their drinking age at 21, where it remained until the Vietnam War. The argument that if you were old enough to be drafted for military service, you were old enough to drink led many states to drop their drinking age to 18, and drunken driving among young people rose in the early 1970s. By 1988, all states had adopted 21 as the minimum legal drinking age (although Louisiana was an outlier for a time ), and alcohol-related traffic deaths among young drivers declined, according to the National Institutes of Health. Today, the U.S. has the highest legal drinking age in the Western Hemisphere. In most of the rest of the world, it is 18. “Raising that drinking age is not a fad or an experiment,” Mr. Reagan said at the ceremony. “It’s a proven success.” Remy Tumin wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Tom McKay,"A Russian An-148 regional jet airliner carrying at least 71 people crashed after takeoff from Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, with authorities saying everyone on board was killed, the Wall Street Journal reported. Flight 703 was headed to the city of Orsk near the Russian-Kazakhstani border, but Flightradar24 data shows it “descended rapidly about five minutes into its flight after departing Moscow at 11:22 GMT,” the Journal wrote. It was plummeting at 22,000 feet a second by the time it lost contact, with state TV reporting that it left a six-foot crater upon impact with the ground. According to CNN, the cause of the crash remains unknown, and per the BBC, the pilot of the aircraft was experienced with over 5,000 hours of flight time. Authorities have recovered the plane’s black box—though the craft itself disintegrated across a huge area. “The scatter of fragments of the aircraft and bodies of dead passengers occupies a large territory; the radius is not less than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles),” Investigative Committee of Russia spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko told CNN. Russia has a mixed track record when it comes to air travel, the Journal noted: Russia’s top carriers have improved their safety record in recent years, but air-safety problems still plague the country’s second- and third-tier airlines. Sunday’s disaster is the worst in Russia since 2016, when a Defense Ministry aircraft full of soldiers, musicians and journalists crashed into the Black Sea after taking off from Sochi on its way to Syria, killing all 92 on board. A Russian Airbus A321 also blew up over Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula with the loss of all 224 passengers and crew in 2015, though authorities concluded the cause of that crash was terrorism.

The no-entry danger zone was also expanded to 8 kilometers (5 miles) around the volcano. According to reports, authorities are struggling to prevent people from sneaking back to their villages to check on homes and farms. Cutting electricity and water supply has been recommended by Cedric Daep, a disaster response official in the Albay province. ""If pyroclastic flows hit people, there is no chance for life,"" Daep said, according to AP. ""Let us not violate the natural law, avoid the prohibited zone, because if you violate, the punishment is death penalty."" Pilots have also been advised to steer clear of the volcano's summit.

Claire Lower,"They say only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun, but even mad (or sad, or glad) dogs should probably stay inside when the temperature climbs too high. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke can wreak utter havoc on your canine friend, but there are a few things you can do to keep your dog cool and safe this summer. It’s Heat Week, and we’re on fire! The heat and humidity have gone right to our heads, and all we can think about is getting into a pool and staying there until September. But because we have jobs to do, damn it, here’s the summer content you’ve been craving: from the best ice-cold cocktails to how to keep from broiling in the summer sun, we’ve got your (sweaty) back. I spoke on the phone with Dr. Darrell Phillips of Jackson, Mississippi’s Animal Emergency and Referral center—who, full disclosure, is my father—and he was nice enough to share some heat-beating tips. As with any medical emergency, prevention is a better tool than treatment. Dogs are simply not as well-equipped as humans to deal with sweltering temperatures, and taking them out on your midday run can lead to disaster. “Just because you can jog in the heat doesn’t mean your dog can,” Dr. Phillips explained, “he’s got a fur coat on, and he can’t sweat like you can. The only way [your dog] can cool down is through panting and there’s a limited window there.” This can particularly be an issue with larger breeds, who take longer to cool down. “Keep in mind that your dog starts out with a higher temperature than you, so they have a shorter way to go until they overheat. “If you’re starting to get hot, the dog is hotter.” Walking your dog either at dusk or dawn (or as close to that as possible) can help limit their exposure to the sun, which will keep them cooler and, in the case of lighter colored dogs, prevent sunburn. Always keep plenty of water available to your pets—Dr. Phillips recommends ice water if it’s really hot out—and if they have to be outside, make sure they have shade to retreat to. You can also get your pup a cooling mat ; if you need one quicker than Amazon can get it to you, lay a cool, damp towel on top of a trash bag or other piece of plastic. If you’re planning to take your pup out at all in the summer sun, you need to stay vigilant for the signs of heat distress. “Heavy panting, looking anxious, salivating, and changes in gum color can all indicate heat exhaustion or stroke,” Dr. Phillips explained, adding “once they hit 104℉, you need to do something.” Getting your pet to the vet is important, but cooling them down as quickly as possible is even more important. “Wipe the bottom of their paws with a cool wet cloth—wet with water, not rubbing alcohol, which can dry out the pads—or dip their feet into water if you can, and pour cool water on the neck, being sure you quit cooling once they reach 103℉,” then get them to the vet as soon as you can.","They say only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun, but even mad (or sad, or glad) dogs should probably stay inside when the temperature climbs too high.

Andrew Liszewski,"It doesn’t matter what ludicrous conspiracy theory is stopping you from storing your money in a bank, you’ll be happy to know that the US Department of the Treasury has an entire division dedicated to the task of trying to rebuild and recover currency should your cash-stuffed mattress get destroyed in a fire or flood. CNN’s Great Big Story paid a visit to the US Department of the Treasury’s Mutilated Currency Division, whose sole purpose is to evaluate currency that’s been damaged or destroyed to an extent that it can’t be used as legal tender. Most of the 23,000-plus cases the technicians deal with every year come from citizens who’ve lost money in a natural disaster, like floods or wildfires, but at times it’s just someone who forgot they left a stack of Benjamins in the oven for ‘safe’ keeping. The service is completely free, and there’s no surcharge on the roughly $40 million in reimbursements the Treasury issues to citizens every year. What is required, however, is at least 51 percent of a bill being still intact, which helps ensure the Mutilated Currency Division doesn’t issue two refunds for a single bank note, which could lead to potential scams. So what scenario provides the biggest challenge to the technicians who are often tasked with sifting through mountains of shredded paper? It’s not currency that’s been burned, but stacks of cash that were thoroughly soaked and then left to dry, which occasionally solidify into rock-solid bricks that have to be painstakingly peeled into individual bills.

Nash Jenkins,"The Trump Administration’s moves against legal marijuana could put the issue at the center of the next two elections. After Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he would reverse an Obama-era executive decision that effectively allowed states to legalize marijuana, the backlash was swift and strong from voters and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, especially in swing states like Colorado, where the recreational marijuana industry is booming. “Perhaps the Department of Justice didn’t think this would be a big deal,” Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado said in a fiery speech on the Senate floor on Thursday. “Thousands of jobs are at risk. Millions of dollars in revenue. And certainly the question of constitutional states’ rights. I believe what happened today was a trampling of Colorado’s rights and its voters.” Indeed, Colorado will suffer if Sessions’ Department of Justice decides to pursue the federal prosecution of marijuana laws. State taxes on the sale of retail and medical marijuana brought the state nearly $180 million in tax revenue in 2016. Marijuana sales injected more than $1 billion to the Colorado economy in 2017, according to The Cannabist. “In Colorado it is a billion dollar industry, and it probably produces half a billion dollars in taxes — taxes that are often diverted to schools, to health programs,” Floyd Ciruli, a Denver-based political analyst, tells TIME. “That part of it motivates people who might be less inclined to be supportive: the Chamber of Commerce, older individuals, business-oriented Republicans.” In a Gallup poll from October, a record 64 percent of respondents backed the legalization of marijuana, including a majority of Republicans for the first time. But though the rancor over Sessions’ decision has been bipartisan, the consequences will imperil Republicans alone. “It’s clearly going to attach itself to the Republican Party, particular for those groups that feel strongly about it,” Ciruli says. “2018 is a midterm election year with less voter turnout than a presidential election, so both parties are looking for ballot issues that will drive their base. The Democrats will certainly use it, and it could be extremely detrimental to the Republicans.” The 2018 midterms are already expected to be contentious. The party of the sitting president historically loses seats in the first midterm election after taking office — a truism likely to be made even truer by the extreme unpopularity of this Republican Congress. Sessions’ move to federally enforce marijuana laws ahead of a tough race amounts to one more risky decision in what could be described as the Trump Administration’s year of living dangerously. Colorado is a swing state, as are North Carolina and Florida — two states almost certainly affected by Trump’s unpopular decision yesterday to open all U.S. coastal waters to offshore drilling. Already Democrats are seizing on the potential talking points. The party’s lawmakers rushed on Thursday to release statements condemning Sessions’ decision. “This is the opposite of what we should be doing,” Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on Twitter. “Let’s not kid ourselves – people will be using marijuana regardless of what Attorney General Sessions says. We have an obligation to regulate it and make it as safe as possible.”","""This is the opposite of what we should be doing""",2018-01-05T21:50:40Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Here’s Why a Marijuana Crackdown Could Spell Disaster for Republicans,http://time.com/5089940/heres-why-a-marijuana-crackdown-could-spell-disaster-for-republicans/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-612287564.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Devin Coldewey,"Bird strikes on aircraft may be rare, but not so rare that airports shouldn’t take precautions against them. But keeping birds away is a difficult proposition: how do you control the behavior of flocks of dozens or hundreds of birds? Perhaps with a drone that autonomously picks the best path to do so, like this one developed by CalTech researchers. Right now airports may use manually piloted drones, which are expensive and of course limited by the number of qualified pilots, or trained falcons — which as you might guess is a similarly difficult method to scale. Soon-Jo Chung at CalTech became interested in the field after seeing the near-disaster in 2009 when US Airways 1549 nearly crashed due to a bird strike but was guided to a comparatively safe landing in the Hudson. “It made me think that next time might not have such a happy ending,” he said in a CalTech news release. “So I started looking into ways to protect airspace from birds by leveraging my research areas in autonomy and robotics.” A drone seems like an obvious solution — put it in the air and send those geese packing. But predicting and reliably influencing the behavior of a flock is no simple matter. “You have to be very careful in how you position your drone. If it’s too far away, it won’t move the flock. And if it gets too close, you risk scattering the flock and making it completely uncontrollable,” Chung said. The team studied models of how groups of animals move and affect one another, and arrived at their own that described how birds move in response to threats. From this can be derived the flight path a drone should follow that will cause the birds to swing aside in the desired direction but not panic and scatter. Armed with this new software, drones were deployed in several spaces with instructions to deter birds from entering a given protected area. As you can see below (an excerpt from this video ), it seems to have worked: More experimentation is necessary, of course, to tune the model and get the system to a state that is reliable and works with various sizes of flocks, bird airspeeds, and so on. But it’s not hard to imagine this as a standard system for locking down airspace: a dozen or so drones informed by precision radar could protect quite a large area. The team’s results are published in IEEE Transactions on Robotics.","Bird strikes on aircraft may be rare, but not so rare that airports shouldn't take precautions against them.

Emily Price,"A few years ago I drove from California to North Carolina for Christmas with my dog. I had originally planned to fly for our month-long visit, but at 22 pounds, my pooch ended up being a bit too heavy to legally fly under my seat in his carrier and I wasn’t willing to fly him as cargo. And so: #FatTucker and I went on a cross-country road trip. Flying with pets is complicated. If you have a non-tiny dog or a plus-sized feline, then you either have to agree to have him or her fly cargo (which can be dangerous and stressful for your furry friend) or have them fly as a service animal.

This time, a giant pet rabbit died on a United flight… Read more Read If you’re a pet parent looking to fly internationally with your furry friend, the group Comparethemarket recently compiled data from international airlines on their pet policies and came up with a list of the best and worst options out there. Keep in mind, you can’t just hop on a plane with your pet and fly to any country you want. Long before your travel day you’ll want to look into what the laws for that particular country might be. Some will let your furry friend in as long as he has certifications of certain vaccinations, while others might require a quarantine period or not let your animal in at all. That said, according to the report these are the airlines with the best pet policies based on cost and whether or not pets are allowed in the cabin (for safety, you want them in the cabin whenever possible): Air France British Airways Lufthansa TUI Thomas Cook Turkish Airlines Aegean Airlines Aeroflot Air Europa Vueling And these are the ones with the worst, in part because they typically don’t allow fur friends to fly: EasyJet Emirates Flybe Ryanair Balkan Holidays If you’re planning an international journey and already know your pet is legal to fly, then you might want to start your flight search with the “best” options so you know both you and your furry best friend will arrive safe and happy. Comparethemarket also has a lot more details on its site about each airline and its requirements as well as the cost involved for your pet’s ride on each. And if you do decide to book an international journey with your pet, make sure to contact the airline before your travel day, ideally when you book the flight. Even if your pet meets all the requirements, flights will often only allow a certain number of animals on the plane and only seated in certain areas (presuming your friend is flying in the cabin). You want to make sure you’re good to go as early as possible so you don’t have any unexpected surprises come vacation time.","A few years ago I drove from California to North Carolina for Christmas with my dog.

JENNI RUSSELL,"With the ruling Conservatives so divided, Mr. Corbyns Labour is in a potentially powerful position. If it threw its votes behind the Tories backing Mrs. Mays agreement, or supported a second referendum, or decided to back a softer Brexit that retained much closer links with Europe Norway Plus, as its known those proposals would likely pass. But so far, the party has refused to commit itself to any such solutions because it, too, is split between those who want to leave the European Union and those who want to remain.
So far it has suited Mr. Corbyn, a longtime Euroskeptic, to stay on the fence, loftily opposing all of the Tories proposals and declaring that if only Labour were in power, it could magically achieve a better Brexit deal. Hes reluctant to back anything that the Tories propose because he calculates that doing so will implicate him in Brexits inevitable economic damage. He doesnt want a second referendum because he doesnt know which side to back.
This comfortable evasion cannot be sustained after Mrs. Mays crushing defeat on Tuesday. Labour will have to pick sides and live with the consequences. Members of Parliament and leaders in all parties will be faced with the starkest of choices: Britains future will be decided within the next month.
Neither party has enough votes to make that choice on its own. The question now is whether the leadership on both sides has the will, imagination or character to reach out to the other and avoid a no-deal disaster. Theres nothing in their careers to suggest that is so.
After her defeat, Mrs. May announced that she wanted to talk with the opposition to discover what compromise members of Parliament were prepared to support. An enraged Mr. Corbyn retorted that over the previous two years she had closed down every attempt at dialogue, and her only priority had been the Conservative Party.
It is Britains misfortune that at this moment, when cooperation and statesmanship are needed to prevent political and economic disaster, both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition are known for being cautious, obstinate, unimaginative, tribal and charmless.
Thats why the wilder suggestion now is that moderate Labour and Tory rebels may step forward and declare themselves a new parliamentary grouping, prepared to lead the country in a government of national unity away from the cliffs edge. It feels preposterous but so does almost everything else. 
Can Mrs. May and Mr. Corbyn suspend their instinctive hostility? Can a fleet of courageous men and women in Parliament step forward if not? Britain is in desperate need of a driver who can seize control of the clattering train.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"For everyone subscribed to the philosophy of GTD, myself included, task managers are essential to managing the process digitally. Of course, they’re only useful if you actually use them, as evidenced by the trail of task managers I’ve left in my wake as I search for one with the right combination of cross-platform access, easy task management, and a little bit of sharing functionality. It would also help if it were in a place I wouldn’t forget about ( or avoid ) like my web browser. So far, Taskade has managed to keep me using a to-do list that isn’t a sheet of paper thanks to its near-constant presence. The task management app puts my to-do list front and center when I open a new tab, supports multiple devices, and has simple sharing features that make it a great addition to your daily routine. Simply having that reminder multiple times a day is enough to keep me thinking about what needs my attention and what can wait. Every New Tab Shows Your Tasks The best part of Taskade is its ease of access. You can visit the site, create an account, and start adding tasks using the web interface. Want to keep your to-do list at your fingertips? Install Taskade’s Chrome or Firefox extension, which loads your Taskade page whenever you create a new tab, an astoundingly useful feature every task manager should adopt. On the page, you’ll see your list of tasks, projects, folders, and you can use different templates for certain tasks. Create an outline, a simple checklist, or a notes field for typing whatever you want, all using Taskade’s preset options. You can also build project templates if you know you’re going to repeat a certain type of task (like a party checklist or a meeting outline). Link Sharing Makes Collaborative Editing Easy Sharing a list of tasks or chores with someone is simple enough in Taskade thanks to the two sharing options. You can either invite a Taskade user to participate in your projects and lists, or share a view-only list of your tasks. If someone decides to edit some items in your list and add what you forgot, you’ll have to refresh to see the changes, but the collaborative option gives it an edge over cordoned off task managers that only accept input from you. It’s Available Almost Everywhere If your task manager lives on your phone instead of your computer, consider using Taskade as a lightweight task capture tool you can turn to during your workday without getting lost in your morass of apps. Even better, you can pair Taskade with a site blocker to keep you on task if you find yourself wandering the web. In addition to the useful Chrome extension, Taskade is available as an app for Windows and macOS, with iOS and Android apps on the way. Its cross-platform availability and upcoming apps could make Taskade a great task manager for people looking to avoid dealing with the complexity in an app like Omnifocus, as well as those looking for a cross-platform service should they use multiple devices. It’s Quick, Cute, and Incredibly Helpful Taskade is still fairly new, and should probably serve as a place to park your less urgent to-do lists and tasks. It’s good for organizing an event with a friend or two, building a grocery list you can share with a partner, brainstorming some ideas for a project, or getting a handle on everything you need to accomplish before the day is over. If you forget everything on your plate, all you have to do is rely on your muscle memory, open a new tab, and receive a much-needed reminder that, for the last time, you need to pick up a bag of brown rice so dinner isn’t a complete disaster.","For everyone subscribed to the philosophy of GTD, myself included, task managers are essential to managing the process digitally.

ALEXANDRA YOON-HENDRICKS and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The earthquake that struck eastern Los Angeles County on Tuesday caused little damage, but it was a reminder of the seismic volatility in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Forty-seven years ago, a much more powerful earthquake struck Sylmar — about an hour’s drive from the epicenter of Tuesday’s earthquake — killing 65 people and severely damaging four hospital campuses. The consequences of that disaster are still being felt. A law passed in 1973 that ordered hospitals to strengthen their most vulnerable buildings has had unintended consequences across the state. To Nancy Skinner, a state senator in the East Bay, the seismic safety law has been used as an excuse for a vital acute-care hospital, the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, to shut down services at its Berkeley location. The hospital cites financial difficulty in funding the mandated retrofit, whose deadline has been pushed back several times and is now 2020. (There is also a 2030 deadline for buildings to be able to not only withstand an earthquake, but also remain operational.) Officials with Sutter Health, the hospital system that runs the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, has reassured locals that services will remain intact and that the center will relocate several miles south to Oakland. But Ms. Skinner said the move — which will result in some ambulances and patients having to use one of the most congested highways in America — would have an “extreme” impact on her constituency. The hospital controversy underscores a recurring problem in California: Residents want safer buildings, but they fear the more immediate consequences of costly renovations.","Thursday: The effects of a 1973 law that are still being felt, new policies on campus sexual misconduct, and a special escort to kindergarten.",2018-08-30T12:57:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Costs of Making Buildings Safer,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/california-today-earthquake-retrofit-hospitals.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/30/briefing/30calitoday-bates/30calitoday-bates-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Congress managed to pass a budget deal early Friday morning after a brief government shutdown, brought to you by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul—the second shutdown in three weeks.

The two-year deal raises spending caps on domestic and military spending by $300 billion and lifts the federal debt limit until March 2019, according to The New York Times. It keeps the federal government funded for six weeks, so we can all come back together and do this again in a little under two months. Here’s what you need to know. Why Did Rand Paul Shut Down the Government? Paul was protesting adding hundreds of billions to the federal deficit, and wanted a vote on an amendment to maintain budget caps, which leaders refused. In a wide-ranging speech on the Senate floor Thursday, Paul blasted government waste, particularly from the National Science Foundation and expenditures in Afghanistan. It’s unclear why this deficit-increasing bill angered Paul so much when he voted for the recent tax bill, which is estimated to increase the deficit by around $1.4 trillion over a decade. You’ve probably already heard that the Senate was unable to agree on a stopgap funding measure that … Read more Read What’s in the Bill? The budget is more of a rough outline, and breaks down into roughly $165 billion for the military and $131 billion for the domestic side of things: funding for abstinence-only education, $6 billion for grants for research and preventative programs to combat the opioid crisis, and more than $80 billion in disaster relief for Florida, Puerto Rico and Texas. Perhaps because lawmakers realized they shouldn’t use children’s health insurance as a bargaining tool, at least for a little while, it also extends Children’s Health Insurance Program funding for an additional four years (meaning CHIP will be funded for a decade after Congress agreed to a six-year extension at the end of January ). Lawmakers will work out more of the exact spending details (in other words, actually write the legislation), and will vote again at the end of March. The deal does not address immigration, which angered some Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who made headlines Wednesday speaking on the House floor for more than eight hours about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program, and voted against the bill. Dems wanted legislation “ensuring protections for young illegal immigrants known as Dreamers as part of any budget measure but Republicans refused,” Reuters reports. “Instead, they have pledged to hold a separate immigration debate in Senate this month.” Fiscal conservatives objected to the level of spending. “With the passage of this spending package, I fear Republicans have ceded our moral authority to lead our nation away from eventual national insolvency. I cannot in good conscience support it,” said Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling. Fortunately, the deal preserves a special tax break for race horse owners and motor sport entertainment complexes. So while young immigrants may need to continue to worry about their futures in the U.S., all the middle-class race horse owners can rest easy tonight.","Congress managed to pass a budget deal early Friday morning after a brief government shutdown, brought to you by Kentucky Sen.

Nuzulack Dausen,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least 42 people drowned when a ferry sank on Thursday in Tanzania’s Lake Victoria and government officials feared the final death toll could be more than 200, a senior local official said. Ukerewe District Commissioner Colonel Lucas Magembe told Reuters that the rescue mission to find survivors from the disaster had been halted until dawn on Friday with 42 people confirmed dead. Initial estimates showed that the MV Nyerere was carrying more than 300 people onboard. It went down in the afternoon just a few meters from the dock in Ukerewe district, according to national ferry services operator TEMESA said. But it was hard to establish the precise number of passengers on board since the person dispensing tickets had also drowned with the machine recording the data lost. TEMESA spokeswoman Theresia Mwami said the operator had carried out maintenance on the ferry in recent months, overhauling two engines. In 1996, a ferry disaster on Lake Victoria in the same region killed at least 500 people. In 2012, at least 145 people died in a ferry disaster in Tanzania’s semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean, on a vessel that was overcrowded.

HELENE COOPER and JULIAN E. BARNES,"He asked the delegations to finish their work by July 6 at 10 p.m. Brussels time. Fearful of a repeat of the G-7 disaster — in which Mr. Trump refused to sign off on the joint communiqué, escalated a trade war and publicly derided Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada — the emissaries from the NATO countries all agreed. Two senior European officials said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis were also keen to avoid another confrontation similar to the G-7, and the NATO declaration was completed days before leaders set foot in Brussels. It achieved several goals critical to NATO officials. Against Russian objections, the military alliance would formally invite Macedonia to join. It would establish an Atlantic Command post, hosted by the United States in Norfolk, Va., to coordinate a swift alliance response in the event of, for instance, a war in Europe between Russia and NATO allies. And, most important, allies pledged to build up their militaries and provide 30 mechanized battalions, 30 air squadrons and 30 combat vessels, all ready to use in 30 days or less, by 2020 — a force to quickly respond to any attack on an alliance member. Jamie Shea, a NATO deputy assistant secretary general, called the declaration “the most substantive” agreement that the alliance had put out in years. But its success, according to the American and European officials, lies in the feverish work before the summit meeting to keep it away from Mr. Trump. “When you read the communiqué, and take into account the work that took place, this is one of the meatiest NATO summits that I can recall,” said Deborah Lee James, a former secretary of the Air Force in the Obama administration. Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said in an email on Thursday that the summit meeting was “extraordinarily successful, and the outcomes are now strengthening the alliance and trans-Atlantic security.”","John R.

Kelly McLaughlin,"A former West Virginia official who lost her job after calling Michelle Obama an ""ape in heels"" has pleaded guilty to defrauding the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) out of more than $18,000. 
 Pamela Taylor, 57, last week admitted to falsely registering for more than $18,000 in FEMA disaster relief benefits after historic flooding devastated Clay County, West Virginia, in June 2016, according to a Department of Justice press release. 
 According to the Department of Justice, Taylor claimed her home was damaged by the floods and that she had to live in a rental unit. In reality, her home was undamaged and she had never moved, the Department of Justice said. 
 She pleaded guilty to embezzlement after an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the state Commission on Special Investigations revealed her home had not been damaged, the Huffington Post reported. 
 As part of a plea agreement on Tuesday, Taylor agreed to pay restitution of $18,149.04. 
 She faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of as much as $500,000 when she's sentenced in May.

 ""The flood was a natural disaster. Stealing from FEMA is a manmade disaster,"" U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart said in a statement published in the Department of Justice's press release. ""Taylor's fraud scheme diverted disaster benefits from our most desperate and vulnerable, those most in need of help."" 
 Special Agent in Charge Mark Tasky of DHS-OIG said in the Department of Justice's press release that taking advantage of funds ""misappropriates taxpayer dollars, reduces monies available to true victims, and erodes public confidence in relief programs."" 
 ""In July 2016, after the good people of West Virginia were devastated by severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides the month prior, the Defendant knowingly submitted a fraudulent application for disaster relief, in order to enrich herself and divert critical funds away from true disaster victims,"" Tasky said.

SARAH MERVOSH,"The government shutdown, which was scheduled to begin at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, stems from a showdown over funding for a wall on the southern border, which Mr. Trump promised his supporters he would deliver once he was in the Oval Office.
Mr. Trump has demanded that about $5 billion for the wall be included in a spending bill necessary to keep the government running.
The Senate passed a stopgap spending bill this week that did not include money to build the wall. The House then merged the Senates stopgap spending bill with about $5.7 billion in funding for the wall and close to $8 billion in disaster relief funding, but that plan hit a roadblock in the Senate, where Democrats and a few key Republicans were opposed.
The House and the Senate adjourned Friday without resolving the impasse, sending the government barreling toward a partial shutdown. Both chambers were scheduled to reconvene Saturday at noon.
But Mr. Trump did not wait to send a message and, Friday night, released the video on Twitter, a communication style he has taken to in recent days. He stressed the need for border security, which he described as a wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it.","The president, in an angry message urging Senate Democrats to approve money for border security, says, “We don’t want people coming in that aren’t supposed to be here.”",2018-12-22T04:40:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Trump Stokes Fears in Pre-Shutdown Video, Declaring ‘We Need a Great Barrier’",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-video-border-wall-shutdown.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/22/realestate/22trump-tweet/22trump-tweet-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
ANDREW TAYLOR / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — Senate Democrats on Monday blocked a Republican disaster aid bill, saying it doesn’t do enough to help hurricane-torn Puerto Rico. The move tossed long-sought relief for victims of hurricanes, floods and western wildfires into limbo.
The vote escalated a fight between Democrats and President Donald Trump, who opposes further rebuilding aid for the U.S. island territory, which was slammed by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.
The 44-49 vote fell short of a majority, much less the 60 votes required to overcome a Democratic filibuster. It sent GOP leaders back to the drawing board but seemed unlikely to kill disaster aid efforts outright, since there is much political support to send aid to Southern farmers, wildfire-ravaged California towns and Midwestern flood victims.
Trump allies such as Sens. David Perdue, R-Ga., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., are among the strongest backers of the legislation, which has already faced significant delays.
“We will get this done eventually,” Perdue said, promising relief to struggling farmers in his state. The path forward is not clear, but a leading option is for the Senate to pass a much more narrowly drawn bill simply to get the issue into a House-Senate conference committee. House Democrats insist the talks must produce a final measure with help for Puerto Rico.
The amount of money in dispute is relatively small, but Trump feels antipathy toward Puerto Rico’s government and Senate Republicans backed him up — for now — in denying Democratic demands for more aid to rebuild its badly damaged water systems and to ease the requirement that Puerto Rico financially match a portion of the federal government’s aid contribution.
Democrats say Trump has been slow to release already-appropriated funding for Puerto Rico and has exhibited little urgency in helping the island. Trump poor-mouthed the island’s government at a meeting with Senate Republicans last week and suggested Puerto Rico has gotten too much disaster help compared with states such as Texas, using inflated numbers to make his case.
“Just as we leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we help our fellow Americans when there’s a disaster, wherever the disaster strikes. We do not abandon them. Period,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
Trump weighed in on Twitter Monday to preemptively attack Democrats for blocking the measure.
“Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdue’s disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!” Trump tweeted.
The $13.5 billion Senate measure mostly mirrors a $14.2 billion measure passed by the House in January, combining aid to Southern farmers, California communities devastated by last summer’s wildfire, and hurricane-hit states such as Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Hurricane-damaged military bases in Florida and North Carolina would receive rebuilding funds.
Democrats want to add almost $700 million more to unlock further disaster aid for Puerto Rico and several states, including help to rebuild badly damaged water systems. Democrats are also trying to force the administration to release billions of dollars in rebuilding funds that have already been approved.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the measure is the fastest way to get aid to the hurricane-slammed South and the badly flooded Midwest, along with nutrition aid to Puerto Rico, where food stamp benefits have already been cut.
“It’s our only sure path to making a law with anywhere near the urgency these Americans deserve. It is the only bill on the table with any provision for the Midwest flooding,” McConnell said. “And it’s the only bill on the table that could earn a presidential signature in time to deliver urgent relief on the nutrition assistance in Puerto Rico.”
The political momentum for the measure — strongly backed by Trump’s allies in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina, among other states — has only been heightened by massive flooding in Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Iowa, whose nominating caucuses are the first test for Democrats hoping to challenge Trump next year. The GOP measure would make Midwestern states eligible for more aid, and by blocking the bill, Democratic presidential contenders in the Senate are likely to face criticism.
Trump has yet to veto a spending bill despite some tough talk, and he has signed off on $600 million to ease food stamp cuts in Puerto Rico.
“I have taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever. We have $91 billion going to Puerto Rico. We have $29 billion to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricane,” Trump said last week. “They have to spend the money wisely. They don’t know how to spend the money and they’re not spending it wisely.”
Trump’s $91 billion estimate, said a White House spokesman, includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements, along with $41 million that’s already been approved. Actual aid to Puerto Rico has flowed slowly from federal coffers.

HILARIE M. SHEETS,"The near disaster looked spectacular, though, and it prompted Ms. Coyne to stage a series of dance performances on swinging chandeliers with lit candles.

Associated Press,"(PALM BEACH, Fla.) — President Donald Trump is again coming to the side of GOP Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore despite calls from other Republican leaders that Moore should leave the race over accusations of decades-old sexual assault. In a pair of tweets Sunday morning, Trump said “the last thing we need” in Alabama and the Senate is a “puppet” of the Democratic congressional leadership. Trump contends Moore’s opponent, Democrat Doug Jones — a former prosecutor — is “WEAK” on crime and border security, “BAD” for the military, veterans, gun rights, and itching to raise taxes “TO THE SKY.” “Jones would be a disaster!” Trump writes in one tweet, adding in another that “Liberal Jones would be BAD!” Two women have accused the 70-year-old Moore of sexually assaulting or molesting them decades ago, when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. At least five others have said he pursued romantic relationships when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor. Moore vehemently denies the allegations. A spokesman for the Jones campaign could not immediately be reached by phone for comment. Jones is best known for leading the prosecution of two Ku Klux Klansmen who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four girls. Top Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have called for Moore to leave the race, and the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have pulled their support for his campaign. “He’s definitely trying to throw a lifeline to Roy Moore,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of Trump in an interview Sunday with CNN’s “State of the Union.” But Graham said when it comes to Moore, it’s unclear “what winning looks like.” “If he wins, we get the baggage of him winning and it becomes a story every day about whether or not you believe the women or Roy Moore, should he stay in the Senate, should he be expelled. If you lose, you give the Senate seat to a Democrat at a time we need all the votes we can get,” he said, referencing Republicans’ current 52-48 majority in the Senate. “The moral of the story is: Don’t nominate somebody like Roy Moore who could actually lose a seat that any other Republican could win,” Graham said.

Jennings Brown,"The Federal Communications Commission just made a move to make global location positioning even more global by opening the doors to Europes system. The European Union has its own brand of GPS called Galileo, which it launched in 2016 so that it could provide positioning services independently of the U.S. system (GPS), Russias GLONASS, and Chinas BeiDou. The U.S. launched GPS in 1978, and the first civilian devices that used the system were manufactured in the late 1980s. But if youve traveled to Europe recently, and you have an iPhone or Samsung released in the last year or so, your phone might have used Galileo instead of GPS. A new federal order means youll be able to use a fusion of the two here in the U.S., benefiting from both networks of satellites. The FCC announced today that it approved an order to allow non-federal devices to use specific signals from Galileo, dubbed E1 and E5, in the U.S. These signals would enhance GPS, improving speed and location accuracy, according to the FCC. This breakthrough serves the public interest across many areas of our economy, including the automotive, aviation, rail, maritime, and agriculture industries, FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement to the Verge.

Scott Davis,"After two weeks, it's clear who won the Khalil Mack trade, and it's not the Oakland Raiders. It's a move that may be discussed in the NFL world for years to come. After Mack held out of training camp to sign a new deal, the Raiders shipped him to the Chicago Bears for a 2019 and 2020 first-round pick, a 2020 third-round pick, and a 2019 sixth-round pick. The Raiders also gave up a 2020 second-round pick. Even for a considerable draft haul, one only needs to watch Mack's performance on the field with the Bears the last two weeks to know the Bears won the deal. In two games, Mack has racked up 8 tackles, 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 1 interception, and a touchdown. Pro Football Focus has him ranked as the best edge defender in the NFL so far this season, all while he's played limited snaps. In Week 1, Mack reminded the NFL what a dominant force he could be. With Aaron Rodgers sidelined, Mack got to backup quarterback DeShone Kizer and took the ball away from him easily. He made a similar play in Week 2 on Russell Wilson, bowling through Seattle's offensive line, then reaching around a defender to strip Wilson. And then there's the Raiders. The Raiders have performed reasonably well in two games. They competed with the star-studded Los Angeles Rams for the first half of Week 1 before the Rams pulled away, then had the Denver Broncos down before the Broncos put together a game-winning drive. A 0-2 start is not good, but they haven't been embarrassed. But they're also a more limited team without the pressure Mack brings. In two games, the Raiders as a team have two sacks and one forced fumble, less than Mack has done by himself. After the Broncos' Case Keenum picked the Raiders apart on the game-winning drive, Jon Gruden bemoaned the lack of a pass rush. It's unclear if he was speaking tongue-in-cheek. Furthermore, on the final drive, the effort from some Raiders players was questionable. Gruden has insisted the Raiders would have liked to have kept Mack, but it was clear they could not come to terms on a new deal. He has said the team hopes to prove they made the right choice over time. But in just two games, Mack, a former Defensive Player of the Year who's just entering his prime, has shown he's a generational talent. Having a defensive force like Mack would not only help the Raiders' defense, it helps take pressure off the Raiders offense. Unless the Raiders manage to find an equal or better talent with one of the picks they received from the Bears, the decision to let go of Mack will likely continue to hang over the franchise in the coming years.","The Oakland Raiders' decision to trade Khalil Mack already looks like a bad one.

Slate,"President Donald Trump, sitting between Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and first lady Melania Trump, sits down to a briefing on hurricane damage, at Muniz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, Puerto Rico, U.S. October 3, 2017. Jonathan Ernst When Hillary Clinton was running against Donald Trump in 2016, she boiled down concerns about his temperament to a central question: ""Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States,"" she said. The attack was centered on national security, but the argument went beyond the role of commander in chief to broader questions about Trump's ability to handle any number of potential crises. How would he react to a public health emergency? How would he deal with a natural disaster? We now have an answer to this question as the scope of devastation from Hurricane Maria becomes more clear. What we have learned is that there are life-and-death consequences to putting someone like Donald Trump in command of the federal government. The profound failure of leadership and management that Trump's critics feared has actually happened, and we are just now learning the scale of that disaster. Puerto Ricans were still recovering from Hurricane Irma when Maria made landfall last autumn. The storm devastated the island, destroying homes and crippling vital infrastructure. The crisis that ensued demanded an immediate and robust response from the federal government. But the response was sluggish, even as early reports made clear that this was a serious tragedy in the making. The White House made few preparations in the lead-up to the storm, and it was weeks before the Federal Emergency Management Agency committed its full resources to the island. During that time, clean water was scarce, food was hard to find, and hospitals struggled to care for patients, some with serious injuries and illnesses. Most of Puerto Rico lacked electricity for months, and medical supplies were few and far between. When FEMA did eventually act, it dropped the ball. To deliver 30 million meals, the agency contracted with an Atlanta-based wedding caterer with no experience in emergency management. By the time the company's contract was terminated, it had delivered just 50,000 of those meals. The impact of those missteps wasn't immediately clear. According to the government, only 64 people died in the disaster, compared to more than 1,800 who are estimated to have died in Hurricane Katrina. Trump noted that difference when he visited the island. ""Every death is a horror,"" said Trump, ""but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous—hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here, with really a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody's ever seen anything like this."" He was congratulating himself, and even took to Twitter to complain of unfair treatment from those who faulted the administration's response: ""Nobody could have done what I've done for #PuertoRico with so little appreciation. So much work!"" We now know this initial death toll was likely wrong by many orders of magnitude. Tracking deaths is always difficult in the wake of such a serious disaster, but recent research makes it clear that the federal government grossly undercounted the number of people who died due to this hurricane. After a review of mortality data, both the New York Times and the Center for Investigative Journalism estimated more than 1,000 deaths from the hurricane and its aftermath. A new Harvard study, released on Tuesday and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, estimated that at least 4,465 people died as a result of Hurricane Maria, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster to strike the United States since 1900, when a powerful hurricane devastated Galveston, Texas, and surrounding areas, killing at least 8,000 people. The researchers, who surveyed thousands of randomly selected homes in Puerto Rico, asked residents about deaths and extrapolated from the results, attributing many of the deaths to hospital disruptions and loss of basic utility services. A faster, stronger response would have prevented some of those deaths. Even if the White House was unprepared when the storm initially hit, much of the aftermath could have been averted if President Trump had focused his administration on the disaster and brought the weight of the federal government to bear on the unfolding tragedy. Instead, Trump sent every signal that he simply didn't care. He downplayed the devastation to Puerto Rico and blamed Puerto Ricans for not doing more to repair the damage. He went after the mayor of San Juan, who had criticized the government's response. He didn't use his Twitter account to publicize relief efforts or generally encourage Americans to help. What he did do during that time, however, was campaign for political allies and start a feud with black football players. Puerto Rico is part of the United States, Puerto Ricans are Americans citizens, and as president, Donald Trump had a responsibility to assist them as they battled disaster. He didn't, and the result was suffering and death on a massive scale. The extraordinary scandals of the Trump administration—including the president's public effort to shield himself and his associates from wrongdoing—are important. But they should not blind us to the very real weight of his more ordinary transgressions. Donald Trump failed Puerto Rico, and no one should forget it.","Jonathan Ernst Donald Trump congratulated himself for his response after Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria last year.

Tampa Bay Times,"HAVANA (AP)  The only three survivors of Cuba's worst aviation disaster in three decades were clinging to life Saturday, a day after their passenger jet crashed in a fireball in Havana's rural outskirts with 113 people on board. In the first official death toll provided by authorities, Transportation Minister Adel Yzquierdo Rodriguez said 110 had died including five children. He also announced that a flight recorder from the plane had been located. Carlos Alberto Martinez, director of Havana's Calixto Garcia Hospital where the survivors were being treated, said doctors are always hopeful that their patients will recover, but he acknowledged that the three Cuban women were in extremely grave condition. ""We must be conscious that they present severe injuries,"" Martinez told a small group of journalists. ""They are in a critical state."" Cuban officials identified the women as Mailen Diaz, 19, of Holguin; Grettel Landrove, 23, of Havana; and Emiley Sanchez, 39, of Holguin. Martinez said Sanchez was conscious and communicating, Diaz was conscious and sedated and Landrove was in a coma. Landrove's mother, Amparo Font, told reporters that her daughter is a flamenco dancer and engineering student on the verge of graduation. ""My daughter is an angel,"" Font said. ""They have to save her."" Meanwhile relatives of the dead gathered at a morgue in the capital, weeping and embracing each other, as investigators tried to piece together why the aging Boeing 737 went down and erupted in flames shortly after takeoff early Friday afternoon. Yzquierdo said those on board included 102 Cubans, three tourists, two foreign residents and six crew members, who were from Mexico. Maite Quesada, a member of the Cuban Council of Churches, announced that 20 pastors from an evangelical church were among the dead. They had spent several days at a meeting in the capital and were returning to their homes and places of worship in the province of Holguin. Skies were overcast and rainy at the airport at the time of Cuba's third major air accident since 2010, and state television said the 39-year-old jet veered sharply to the right after departing on a domestic flight to the eastern city of Holguin. Eyewitness and private salon owner Rocio Martinez said she heard a strange noise and looked up to see the plane with a turbine on fire. ""It had an engine on fire, in flames, it was falling toward the ground,"" Martinez said, adding that the plane veered into the field where it crashed, avoiding potential fatalities in a nearby residential area. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said a special commission had been formed to find the cause of the crash. State airline Cubana, which operated the flight, has had a generally good safety record but is notorious for delays and cancellations and has taken many of its planes out of service because of maintenance problems in recent months, prompting it to hire charter aircraft from other companies. Mexican officials said the Boeing 737-201 was built in 1979 and rented by Cubana from Aerolineas Damojh, a small charter company that also goes by the name Global Air. Aviation authorities in Guyana last year stopped the same aircraft from conducting charter flights because of serious safety concerns, including fears about excessive baggage overloading and other issues. In November 2010 a Global Air flight originating in Mexico City made an emergency landing in Puerto Vallarta because its front landing gear did not deploy. The fire was quickly extinguished, and none of the 104 people aboard were injured. That plane was a 737 first put into service in 1975. Mexican aviation authorities said a team of experts would fly to Cuba on Saturday to take part in the investigation. Argentina's Foreign Ministry said two of its citizens had died in the crash. ___ This story corrects that Cuban authorities are now spelling name Landrove.","Cuba: 110 died in plane crash, 3 survivors 'critical' Tampabay.com HAVANA (AP) — The only three survivors of Cuba's worst aviation disaster in three decades were clinging to life Saturday, a day after their passenger jet crashed in a fireball in Havana's rura…",2018-05-20T00:53:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Tampabay.com'}","Cuba: 110 died in plane crash, 3 survivors 'critical' - Tampabay.com",http://www.tampabay.com/cuba--died-in-plane-crash--survivors-critical-ap_worldd809e0e853584c07b05007d68207f880,http://www.tampabay.com/storyimage/HI/20180519/AP/305199952/AR/0/AR-305199952.jpg,,Tampabay.com,1
Eli Meixler,"Twenty-one miners were killed when the roof of a coal mine collapsed in China’s northwestern Shaanxi province over the weekend, according to state media reports.
The Jan. 12 accident is the latest to hit China’s deadly coal industry.
At the time the roof gave way, 87 people were underground in the Kijiagou mine in Shenmu city. Sixty-six miners were initially rescued, but 21 remained trapped underground, according to the Global Times, a newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party. All of the missing miners were later found dead.
Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which was the deadliest reported so far this year, according to Reuters. Mining companies in other major Chinese coal-producing regions like Shandong and Henan were instructed to suspend operations for upcoming inspections, which will reportedly last until June. High-risk mines in nearby Shanxi province will also be inspected, Reuters reports.

China’s coal and other mining industries are notorious for frequent accidents and lax enforcement of safety regulations. China reported 375 deaths from coal mine accidents in 2017, a decrease of nearly 29% from the previous year, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
Another deadly blast in Shaanxi last month killed five miners, according to Xinhua. In 2009, over 430 miners were trapped after an explosion in a mine in Shanxi province. An eight-day rescue effort ultimately saved 115 coal miners, many of whom suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. Another 74 miners died in the incident.

Allan Smith,"Allies of President Donald Trump took issue with Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor brought in by Republicans to question both professor Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh during a high-stakes Thursday hearing, as the early part of the hearing cemented Ford as a credible witness. Republicans had Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor, ask questions to Ford on their behalf. The Thursday hearing was scheduled to question both Kavanaugh and Ford, a research psychologist at Palo Alto University who recently accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during a high-school party. In the first segment, Mitchell questioned Ford in five-minute spans that were broken up by five-minute windows for the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Rachel Mitchell. Associated Press/Andrew Harnik Mitchell questioned Ford about her fear of flying, gaps in her memory not only around the time of the alleged incident, but also in more recent episodes, and about her decision to take a polygraph test. In her testimony, Ford said she was ""100%"" certain that Kavanaugh was the person who committed the early 1980s assault. Kavanaugh emphatically denied these claims following Ford's testimony. Trump's allies, however, felt that Mitchell did not press Ford hard enough, failing to poke holes in her story. A Republican strategist close to the White House told Business Insider that Ford ""undoubtedly came across as a sympathetic figure during her testimony,"" though this person said the professor ""was still unable to present any actual evidence to back up her claims."" But this person said they were sure that Republicans would've been better off having GOP senators, like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Ted Cruz of Texas, handle the questioning of Ford ""because Mitchell was an unmitigated disaster."" ""She didn't even attempt to poke holes in the many inconsistencies in Ford's story,"" this person said. On Fox News, legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, a Trump ally, echoed some of that sentiment about Mitchell, saying that Ford ""is extremely credible and Rachel Mitchell is not laying a glove on her."" ""The president cannot be happy with this,"" he added. Amid Mitchell's questioning, Steve Schmidt, an anti-Trump, former Republican operative who ran the late Sen. John McCain's 2008 president campaign, tweeted that Republican staffers wish ""they had the button to open the trap door under Rachel Mitchell's chair."" ""What a total and complete political disaster for Republicans,"" he wrote. Others on the right praised Mitchell, however, and the answers that came out of her line of questioning were central to much of the conservative pushback on Ford's credibility. The Federalist Society, as Politico reported, even distributed talking points in defense of Mitchell. On Ford's portion of the hearing, a Republican Senate aide said it didn't present any ""big surprises,"" though it provided a ""big emotional boost for Democrats."" ""But Mitchell established some key facts that undercut her credibility,"" this person said of the questioner. ""The emotion will fade and the facts will win out."" Conservatives felt inspired by Kavanaugh's opening statement. The judge opened up his testimony by emphatically denying the charges against him, alternating between raw anger and holding back tears.

Dakota Shane,"To put it lightly, 2017 has been an interesting year in a lot of ways, and that pattern certainly held true for social media disasters as well. From Dove's controversial, racially-charged hiccup to McDonald's premature Tweet, there were plenty of social media catastrophes to go around. Because of this, I thought it would be useful to run through how to avoid a social media disaster in the coming year. Here are a four rules to follow. 1. Be socially aware. It's pretty sad this still needs to be stated 17 years into the 21st century, but here we are. Please be cognizant of whether or not a piece of content you put out could potentially offend a group of individuals. We saw the repercussions of neglecting this principle with Dove's contentious advertisement. Don't be Dove, be proactive in your monitoring and filtering of your social media content. Here's a good rule of thumb: if you're unsure whether or not someone will be offended by the content, it's better not to post it. 2. Only hire top talent to manage your social media. Whether you hire a freelancer, an agency or in-house specialist, it's always better to bring top talent onboard to manage your social media presence. From a budget standpoint, cutting corners and pursuing cheaper options is totally understandable. I get it. That being said, know that hiring marketing talent is just like buying a pair of tennis shoes or jeans: you usually get what you pay for. Cheaper typically means a higher risk of making rookie mistakes. Recently, we saw the consequences of a rookie mistake with McDonald's unfinished Tweet that went out (you can read more about that here ). The internet instantly circulated it. Black Friday **** Need copy and link**** -- McDonald's (@McDonaldsCorp) November 24, 2017 Don't be McDonald's, avoid silly missteps by triple-checking your content before publishing it on social media and by hiring experienced individuals or companies. 3. Be cognizant of the content you engage with. Be sure that whoever is responsible for monitoring your social media knows your brand's parameters when it comes to taking a side on divisive issues. Remember that a Retweet, a Like, a Share or Recommend is just another way of endorsing an idea or notion. By engaging with a politically-charged or socially-charged piece of content, you're essentially agreeing with that stance. To avoid backlash, be sure to have strict guidelines surrounding engagement. If you do choose to engage with this sort of content, know what your company's positions are hot button issues. If your brand doesn't wish to speak on divisive topics, you can't go wrong with following the age-old mantra: don't speak on politics, religion or money. 4. Remember that we live in a fish bowl. Today, we live in a fish bowl, so it's more crucial than ever before to tread lightly and behave well (in addition to just being a decent human being) any time you're on the clock. United Airlines' recent mishap, which resulted in a man being dragged out of his seat onto the floor by security, proved that many folks still aren't used to the majority of people having 24/7 access to a video camera quite yet. Remember, every person with a charged smartphone has the potential to record anything they see. Always be on your guard. You're just one step away from being on the receiving end of a game-changing video clip that could result in you losing business or your job. We live in a world where information has the ability to travel instantaneously. Whether you're a Fortune 500 company or just starting out in your entrepreneurial journey, keeping a close eye on your social media is one of the easiest ways to safeguard public perception of your brand. In the coming year, dodge social media disasters by implementing the points laid out in this article.",Make your brand bulletproof in 2018 by following these 4 rules.,2017-12-18T19:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Your Guide on Avoiding a Social Media Disaster in 2018,https://www.inc.com/dakota-shane/your-guide-on-avoiding-a-social-media-disaster-in 2018.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_106055174_336690.jpg,,Inc.com,1

Mick Dumper,"Having survived Britain’s recent cabinet reshuffle the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, is confronted with the biggest headache of her short ministerial career: the fallout of the US intention to cut funding to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which constitutes one of the most serious challenges to UK policies in the Middle East. Donald Trump’s threat to cut financial assistance to the UN agency specifically responsible for Palestinian refugees will be a disaster not only for the refugees but also for Israel and neighbouring countries. It does not advance US interests either. Provoked by the Palestinian rejection of Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel, it takes the notion cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face to a completely new diplomatic level. Although a final decision by the US is still pending, the loss of the regular subvention of $350 million for UNRWA would be catastrophic for the region, with immense military and strategic implications for the US and its allies, including the UK. If UNRWA were defunded by the US in this dramatic, sudden, and unplanned way, it would be forced to suspend within a few months most of its services to nearly 5 million Palestinian refugees. Half a million children in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon would be without schools, consigning them to the already volatile streets at a time when extremists are in full recruitment mode. While cuts in education may be the most immediate and dramatic, the losses would not stop there. Nine million health consultations which UNRWA doctors provide each year would cease, 1.7 million refugees who lack basic needs would be without food and cash assistance and 40,000 refugees with disabilities would be without support. Further, UNRWA recreational activities for 200,000 children would cease and the 38,000 microfinance clients working to provide an independent livelihood for their families would be without loans. On top of this, 30,000 teaching staff, doctors, nurses, social workers, sanitation labourers and engineers employed by UNRWA would be out of a job. Has the US, and Israel for that matter, thought this through? Do they really want 270,000 children in Gaza attending Hamas-run schools? Does Washington really know what it is doing? The impact of all these cuts on the political stability in the Middle East is incalculable. Such a move would produce instability affecting some of the key strategic allies of the US, the EU and the UK in the Middle East. Jordan, for instance, has been touted as a beacon of stability in a region that is still reeling from the convulsions of the Arab spring, the Syrian civil war and the proxy wars. Yet Jordan is host to 2 million Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA. It would be unable to cope with replacing the services provided by UNRWA, with the result that its already high unemployment rate would rocket, poverty — already widespread — would accelerate and, with school-age children on the streets, protests would inevitably ensue, threatening the viability of the government. In 2015, when UNRWA suffered a budget shortfall, King Abdullah of Jordan made it clear to the US what the impact on the future of the Jordanian regime would be if the shortfall was not met. Compared with what is envisaged by the proposed US action today, that shortfall was minor. The costs of the major cuts envisaged by the US, if enacted, are likely to be terminal for the Jordanian state, with serious knock-on effects in the region. Similar scenarios play out in other countries where UNRWA has responsibilities. In the occupied Palestinian territories of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, which are controlled by Israel to differing degrees, there are nearly 3 million Palestinian refugees. In Syria, UNRWA serves about half a million Palestinian refugees, despite the civil war and under dangerous conditions. Without UNRWA assistance, they will be easy prey for Daesh [the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant], Al Qaida and other extremist groups. It is clear from the muted reaction from Israel and the high-level representations from Jordan and Egypt that they are very concerned about these scenarios and are signalling for a pause. The US should not dismiss their views. At a time of growing radicalisms and anti-American sentiment, it needs these allies as never before. There are also long-term costs. Apart from such a decision further sidelining the US from resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and thus lessening its ability to influence the shape of the outcome, one lesson learned from the Middle East since 9/11 is that tearing down institutions is easy. Rebuilding them is exponentially more costly in terms of lives and money. Once the human capital of teachers, doctors, accountants, administrators, social workers and lawyers accumulated over decades is dispersed or degraded, it will take years to marshal the skills and expertise again to run societies and communities. The Department for International Development (DfID) knows this well and has heavily invested in capacity-building programmes across the region. In this context, the cost of US investment in human development and stability through UNRWA pales into insignificance compared with the cost of the alternatives: political collapse, failed states, mass migration and the opening of battlefronts. The UK has had a long relationship with UNRWA through DfID. Over the years it has subjected the programmes of the agency to rigorous scrutiny and criticism, spearheading greater transparency, accountability and internal management reforms. Yet at the same time, the UK is still one of its strongest supporters, providing the third largest amount of financial assistance to UNRWA’s core programmes after the EU and the US. And for all its faults, UNRWA has received plaudits for good governance in a region where that is sorely lacking. The UK’s own interests in the region and its long-term investment in the human capital of UNRWA are seriously under threat by these actions by President Trump, and it needs to use its special relationship to prevent the defunding of UNRWA going ahead. — Guardian News &amp; Media Ltd Mick Dumper is professor of Middle East politics at Exeter University, United Kingdom.","gulfnews.com Trump's cut to funding for Palestinian refugees could lead to disaster gulfnews.com Having survived Britain's recent cabinet reshuffle the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, is confronted with the biggest headache of her short m…",2018-01-14T14:01:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gulfnews.com'}",Trump's cut to funding for Palestinian refugees could lead to disaster - gulfnews.com,http://gulfnews.com/opinion/thinkers/trump-s-cut-to-funding-for-palestinian-refugees-could-lead-to-disaster-1.2156763,http://static.gulfnews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2156804!/image/245796528.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_460346/245796528.jpg,,Gulfnews.com,1

He's especially upset that they made him look like a lush. Thomas says he doesn't even drink beer... he was buying it for the guards at the place where he lives. Fuel was added to the fire when TMZ later reported that Mr Markle said he would like to attend the wedding. And, then he proceeded to inform TMZ that he was unable to attend, as he needed surgery after a heart attack he'd had six days before. Royal etiquette expert William Hanson feels the media is ""largely to blame"" in this situation, but ""in many ways Kensington Palace"" is also culpable. ""If the interest wasn't there, and the need to fill days and days' worth of content to make advertising revenue, the media wouldn’t have chased Thomas Markle or any other member of her family,"" says Hanson. But, the fact that TMZ is an American outlet has added an additional dimension to the media handling of this saga. He doesn't feel that British journalists would have gone after a story like this. ""In Britain, journalists by and large respect official lines that come from the palace,"" he says. ""There is a cultural difference. Americans haven't grown up with this loyalty and deference to the monarchy."" That said, Hanson caveats that TMZ journalists and those from other outlets are ""just doing their job,"" and ""that is what celebrity gossip sites do."" As the BBC's Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond put it: ""How has Kensington Palace, the office and residence of Prince Harry, which has rolled out the royal wedding plans and strategy over the past few months, dropped the ball so spectacularly in the last four days?"" How indeed. As Dymond notes, the palace's protocol and ""tactic"" is to stay firmly tight-lipped on rumours that ""run counter to the royal narrative,"" in the hope that they'll eventually disappear. But, as the rumour mill continued turning at seemingly-uncontrollable speed, it became increasing clear that something other than ""no comment"" needed to be said. ""Kensington Palace has been really tightly controlling what information comes out and when it is released,"" says Hanson. ""It's a very well oiled machine, and they like to control the narrative."" Hanson says that Prince Harry has a ""very cautious attitude"" towards the media. Indeed, Harry has spoken out about his anger at the way paparazzi photographers took photos of his mother in the final moments of her life. ""Those people that caused the accident, instead of helping, were taking photographs of her dying on the back seat,"" said Harry. Photographs which subsequently made their way to news desks in the United Kingdom, and can still be accessed on Google Images. This may well explain the palace's reticence and reluctance to respond to a situation arising from interactions with the paparazzi. ""In many ways Kensington Palace is to blame for not realising the Markles needed assistance."" Nevertheless, as Hanson says, the palace in this instance might have been ""too controlling"" when it comes to the media. ""By not feeding the beast, the beast is going to go elsewhere for food,"" he says. That beast was, in this instance, TMZ. Thomas Markle behaved, Hanson feels, as many others would have, had they found themselves thrust suddenly into the spotlight through association with the royal family. These are people who aren't used to celebrity or royal lifestyle,"" he says. ""The perception of fame makes people behave in very odd ways."" This is where Kensington Palace should have stepped in. Given the fact that the Markles don't spring from royal stock, it seems that more could have been done to help them contend with the onslaught of the paparazzi. ""In many ways Kensington Palace is to blame for not realising the Markles needed assistance,"" says Hanson. It's hard not to feel sorry for Meghan in this situation. But, perhaps there's an important lesson to be learned here by Kensington Palace as they enter a new era in which royals marry 'normals'. The words ""no comment"" may no longer cut the mustard, and a little bit of media training for a spouse's family members could go a long way.","Most brides spend the final days before their wedding doing last-minute preparations for the big day. But, Meghan Markle isn't most brides. This isn't most weddings.

Mark Kaufman,"Clouds above Los Angeles are vanishing. A new study recently published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters suggests that summer clouds over Southern California have dwindled as both increasing temperatures and heat-radiated from urban sprawl have driven clouds away. “Cloud cover is plummeting in southern coastal California,” Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University and lead author of the research, said in a statement. SEE ALSO: Extreme flooding in Maryland is a glimpse into our disaster-filled future ""Clouds that used to burn off by noon or 1 o’clock are now gone by 10 [a.m.] or 11 [a.m.], if they form at all,"" Williams said. The clouds in question are called stratus clouds, which hover around 1,000 to 3,000 feet above the ground, and are often referred to as the marine layer by coastal dwellers. During summer, the researchers found that this type of cloud cover has decreased by between 25 to 50 percent over the last five decades. Low-level clouds over Los Angeles. Image: Park williams There aren't many places that keep records of old cloud cover, but researchers were able to gather a rich collection of clouds documented in both big and small Southern California airports dating back to the 1970s. But at the end of the day, what do these disappearing clouds mean for the region? By comparing their trove of cloud cover data to a decades-long history of moisture in Southern California's vegetation, the study's authors found a link between less cloud cover and drier ground, which creates an environment ripe for fire danger. Without cloud cover, the ground can dry out more fully under the baking sun. That said, however, the disappearing clouds don't seem to be driving meaningful changes in the region's fire activity today. ""It’s one piece of the fire story in Southern California — but maybe not even the majority of it,"" Brandon Collins, a research scientist at UC Berkeley's Center for Fire Research and Outreach, said in an interview. ""It’s one piece of the fire story in Southern California"" For instance, the December 2018 fires in Southern California — the largest in the fire-prone state's history — were predominately caused by hot, dry winds, called Santa Anas, blowing fire over vegetation that had grow thick after a drenching winter and then dried out, effectively making it the perfect kindling. ""Don’t jump to the conclusion that changing cloud cover had anything to do with the fires last December,"" said Collins, who had no role in the study. ""That was the Santa Anas."" ""Really, what's been shown over and over is the defining driver of fires in Southern California is the Santa Ana winds,"" he added. Williams, the study's lead author, did note that less cloud cover itself didn't mean more burned land. Year to year, different conditions like rainfall and the location of fire affect how much land ultimately gets burned. “But the dice are now loaded, and in areas where clouds have decreased, the fires should be getting more intense and harder to contain,"" said Williams. Is climate change contributing to the clouds' disappearance? Heat, radiating off of Southern California's sprawling, asphalt-blanketed land and further exacerbated by rising temperatures, appears to be eating away at these coastal, stratus clouds. But warming temperatures haven't necessarily been shown to decimate these coastal clouds. Rather, the researchers only demonstrate that cloud cover is being lost in the region, it's linked to an increased drying out of the land. ""If you put lots of concrete and buildings on the surface, you do change the properties of the local microclimate,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability who had no role in the study, said in an interview. ""But no one has done a formal study why [clouds are decreasing]. We just know that we do observe this trend — it is happening."" The aftermath of the Thomas fire, the largest in California' s history, in Ventura, California. Image: Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images It's possible, though, this trend could be driven by increased warming, as the result of climate change. ""Los Angeles and San Diego are definitely both warmer than they used to be, particularly at night and in the warm season,"" said Swain. ""There is a hint, that might be what's going in here."" But it's certainly not as if increased warming or whatever else has totally driven Southern California's famous marine layer away. ""This year has been particularly foggy in May,"" said Swain, who noted he was standing outside in a late-May morning fog. ""It's the classic May and June gloom,"" said Swain. ""It's so characteristic of the climate here."" ""Yet that may be changing in a meaningful way,"" he added. ""And it's not totally clear why.""",Clouds above Los Angeles are vanishing.

Michelle R. Martinelli,"Welcome to FTW's NASCAR Feud of the Week, where we provide a detailed breakdown of the latest absurd, funny and sometimes legitimate controversies and issues within the racing world - or, in this case, look back on an epic one. Tuesday morning around 8 a.m., Kyle Busch showed up to Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s podcast studio with a box of donuts and a case of beer. Busch was coming off his second consecutive victory of the season - he won the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway on Monday - and was dropping by to talk with Junior about their longtime feud, which dates back to the 2007 NASCAR Cup Series season. Eleven years later, they've settled their differences and moved on - their respective fans have not - but until the latest episode of the Dale Jr. Download, the two had never talked about the race that officially blew everything up - the 2008 Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond Raceway. The former enemies sat down, along with podcast co-host Mike Davis, and rehashed the details of the infamous race - where Busch wrecked Earnhardt, who had the lead, in the final laps, though neither won (Clint Bowyer did) - that truly ignited their feud and divided their fan bases as the 10 year anniversary approaches. NASCAR will race Saturday at Richmond. NEW #DJD PODCAST: On the 10-Year anniversary of the Richmond wreck heard ‘round the world, @DaleJr &amp; guest @KyleBusch talk for the first time about their incident &amp; the decade-long feud that ensued. Listen here: https://t.co/ziGkYxjRiS Subscribe here: https://t.co/7XKWk0ZlEl pic.twitter.com/3q5pCc46Rq — Dirty Mo Media (@DirtyMoMedia) April 17, 2018 From the Dale Jr. Download : Earnhardt: I was really surprised 10 years later, fans are still so freaking passionate about that night. Busch: Yup, I hear about it all the time. Earnhardt: And I know there's a direct divide between our fan base, and we call them unicorns, the ones that like both of us. … And they're really rare. Busch: Yes, absolutely. Recalling the details that divided the two drivers, they also frequently referenced an oral history of the 2008 Richmond race and the events leading up to it on JeffGluck.com. From a fan and driver side, much of the built up tension stemmed from Earnhardt switching to Hendrick Motorsports after the 2007 season, and Busch departing that same year from HMS to drive for Joe Gibbs Racing, the team he's still with. In addition to wrecking each other multiple times in the 2007 season, the pair agreed much of their feud was the result of misunderstandings and assumptions - particularly the false narrative that Earnhardt helped push Busch out of HMS. From the podcast : Earnhardt: I had it in my mind that you thought I was the devil. Busch: Absolutely. As Earnhardt explained to JeffGluck.com, he actually pushed for HMS to keep Busch, but that's not how it worked out. In recent years, the two worked out their differences as their business ventures brought them together. But they both wondered what kind of friends or even teammates they could have been had they talked things out back in the day and both ended up driving for HMS. Via the Dale Jr. Download : Busch: I wish there would have been a chance that you and I would have been able to like get together while all this was kind of going on and just be like, ""What are you doing? What are you doing? What can we do together?"" Now, at this time, at this stage of my career and my age, I would have done that. But as Davis pointed out, as Busch was in his early 20s and Junior in his early 30s, they were both exceptionally stubborn and hard-headed, ignoring the weekly opportunities they had at races to settle their differences. Earnhardt: I think he's right. We were both young. Busch: He was older, though. Earnhardt: I was. Still, I wasn't mature enough even at that point. But yeah, I think people are going to say, ""Well [expletive], it worked out for Kyle,"" and it did. You're in an amazing organization, done amazing things there. But who knows what could have happened had we got together and figured out a way to - had we become teammates, who knows what would have happened? Shifting their attention to the 2008 Richmond race specifically, Junior acknowledged he knew immediately that Busch didn't spin him out in the final laps on purpose. It was simply two drivers fighting for every edge, as Earnhardt drove on the top of the track and Busch on the inside. View embedded content On the specific details of the wreck, they said, via the Dale Jr. Download : Earnhardt: I'm going, he went in the corner a little higher trying to get a better arc into the corner because a shallow entry on the bottom there wasn't going to work, and he knew that. So as I'm moving up the track, he's like, ""OK, if you're gonna go up the track, I'm gonna go up the track a little bit, and I'm going to get a better angle for the exit."" And you know, just got down in there and got loose up underneath me. Busch: Well the other thing too was like each lap, there was a little bit more, a little bit more, a little bit deeper, little bit more. I'm getting the sense of urgency. … Earnhardt: I think the one thing that bugged me, and this was just you at that age, was when you were in front of a microphone the things that you would say. … If it was just, ""Hey man, that was racing, I got in the corner too deep."" But you wouldn't. You would get out of the car and go, ""Ah [expletive] it. I don't care. So what he got wrecked?"" And you had such a chip on your shoulder. (Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports) They can both laugh about it now - and did - even if their fans refuse to and still hate the opposing drivers. Earnhardt called the events leading up to the Richmond race and how it ended ""a recipe for disaster,"" and Busch agreed. Busch: My mindset in that moment was somebody else, if it was a teammate or if it was somebody that I actually kind of (was) like getting along with, there probably would have been two more inches given, right? An extra [expletive] given. But in this moment, there was no [expletive] given. So it was kind of like, ""Eh, I got loose, yeah, whatever,"" like you said. So yeah, sorry. Earnhardt admitted for different stages of his career after that, he was ""consumed"" by their rivalry and always knew where Busch was at the track. But now, they're both happy and relieved that it's over - and that they can joke about it now.

Brian Scudamore,"As a visionary entrepreneur, I'm the kind of person who plays the long game. I prefer to visualize the future first -- and then work backwards for how to get there. Usually, this comes easy to me, but leading a business through change isn't always crystal clear. Every company goes through good times and bad. Even if you plan for the worst, you can never be 100% sure what's around the bend. It's in these uncertain times when strong leadership is more important than ever. So how do you lead your team when you can't even see the future yourself? It's not easy, but with focus, faith and effort, you can get your 20/20 vision back. Remove Fear By Facing It In times of uncertainty, leaders have two choices: retreat in fear or race to the conflict. Ten years ago, I almost walked away after I let our then-COO go -- against the belief of every single person in the company. People began speculating and filling in the blanks on their own, creating a toxic culture of paranoia and confusion. They even questioned whether I was the leader they needed (or wanted) going forward. It's a leader's job to take the fear out of uncertain situations by tackling them head-on. So I went on the road to address our franchise partners face-to-face. We had a series of townhall meetings, where I put big sheets of paper up on the wall and told them to write down any questions and concerns they had. I left the room so they would feel safe to be completely (and brutally) honest. The goal was to get everything on the table and be fully transparent -- nothing was off limits. It was like going up against a firing squad, but my team deserved answers and clarity about the future. They acknowledged I couldn't lead the company on my own (I'm a visionary, not an executor), and asked who would step in to fill the gaps. We stared uncertainty square in the eyes, and together we took back control of the next phase of our company. Hunker Down on Short-Term Goals Our business wasn't spared the effects of the 2008 financial meltdown. We lost $40 million in revenue and our downturn showed no signs of letting up. Prior to the crash, we had always planned four to five years ahead. We called this our Painted Picture: a hyper-detailed snapshot of where we were going and what we would achieve. But in 2008, our future was so unclear that we couldn't think that far ahead. We scaled back and shortened our horizons: what can we accomplish by the end of this year? We wrote the first (and only) one-year Painted Picture, accepting that short-term stability would ultimately lead to long-term success. It worked: we took it slow, rebuilt, and we came back stronger than we ever could've imagined. Empower Your Team to Be Part of the Change People feel most vulnerable when their fate is out of their control. They're also happier and more secure when they feel like their ideas matter. That's why strong leaders empower their teams to be a part of finding solutions -- especially in challenging times. We regularly solicit ideas from our team members for how to improve, in good times and bad. This improves engagement and strengthens our community spirit. The feedback we receive from our employees helps guide our decision-making for the future of the company. Leaders sometimes feel pressured to be the smartest person in the room, but the truth is, they never should be. There's power in numbers and your people probably have innovative ideas you've never thought of. Give them the opportunity to have a say in their own futures. Don't Make Empty Promises Leading your business through uncertainty usually requires you to reset your goals and expectations -- what success used to look like may not be within reach anymore. You may need to redefine what it means to you now, and be realistic about what's achievable. Don't make empty promises that you might not be able to keep. This sets everyone up for failure and breaks your team's trust in you. If I'd promised our team pre-recession numbers when we were in the thick of it, I would have compromised my credibility (and competence) as leader. Finding stability again takes time; it's important to be realistic, optimistic, and to work hard together. It's an intensely humbling experience to admit you're not as strong as you once were. But pretending everything is fine won't earn trust or confidence in your leadership. Go Back to Your Values Your values are guideline for how to make decisions. If you're unsure about the future, go back to basics and remind yourself what you stand for. For example, our values are Passion, Integrity, Professionalism and Empathy. These attributes are a constant we can always be sure of, even when the future looks murky. At the end of the day, your strength as a leader comes from your ability to keep pushing forward and to inspire others to have faith, as well. If you stay true to your values and lead from a place of humility, your team will respect and trust your ability to lead them back into the light.",How you deal with hard times defines you as a leader,2017-11-27T22:39:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Here's How to Turn Disaster into a Lesson in Leadership,https://www.inc.com/brian-scudamore/heres-how-to-turn-disaster-into-a-lesson-in-leadership.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_522390562_333083.jpg,,Inc.com,1
Karissa Bell,"Facebook may not be the only competitor Snap needs to worry about. Twitter is reportedly working on a new Snapchat Discover-like feature that emphasizes photos and videos tied to specific events, according to CNBC. SEE ALSO: Twitter is working to expand its verification to everyone The news follows an earlier report from Bloomberg that Twitter was working on a Snapchat-like camera feature. Details are scarce, and CNBC notes that the feature may never end up seeing the light of day, but the ""camera first feature"" is apparently meant to encourage people to share more photos and videos associated with news that often breaks via Twitter. Such a feature would directly compete with elements of Snapchat Discover, as well as Snap Maps — both of which curate Stories-based current events. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the report, but it's not surprising Twitter would want to build such a feature. Increasingly, Snapchat has become a go-to source to get a first-person view of breaking news. Time and time again, the best place to get a raw, unfiltered look at what's happening during a major event like the Olympics — or, more tragically, during a news event like a natural disaster or a mass shooting — is not Twitter but Snapchat. If you're Twitter, which prides itself on being the platform for "" what's happening, "" this is a worrying trend. The company wants to ensure that their platform stays top of mind when news happens. Incorporating a way for users to more easily share photos and videos — which can then be pulled into Moments or other features that highlight breaking news — would make a lot of sense. Whether or not it would have any measurable impact on Snapchat is another matter. But it's a good way to ensure that Twitter retains its reputation as a go-to source for news.","Facebook may not be the only competitor Snap needs to worry about.

Abhishek Budholiya,"The past decade has seen hundreds of natural disasters in various countries. While the US stays one of the most affected ones, developing countries remain the major sufferers particularly due to denser population and poor evacuation infrastructure. Catastrophic events lead to massive destruction of property and incalculable loss of human and animal life, and handling the post-event adversity is an extremely challenging task that follows. Is IoT making an impact in efficient natural disaster preparedness? With adverse climate change becoming more of a concern for the entire world, experts continue to explore the use of the Internet of Things technology in addressing and optimizing the emergencies that arise as a result of natural calamities. Whether the occurrence includes earthquake, tsunami, wildfire, volcanic eruption, flood, hurricane, tornado, landslide, extreme weather conditions, or any geological process, the loss is often uncontrollable. However, we are fortunately in an era where the immense advancement in technology can help to reduce the intensity of immediate and eventual effects. To be precise, the Internet of Things technology has become sophisticated in no time – extending its practical application areas. Several researchers, scientists, and IoT experts from around the world have been taking efforts to deploy this smart technology in minimizing the destruction caused due to natural disasters. IoT, although cannot prevent any disaster from happening, can definitely aid in efficient disaster preparedness. It has been found to be useful in predicting the upcoming event and delivering an early warning to community through smart systems. Why is IoT a highly potential technology in disaster prediction and management? The very first application is, by default, to minimize and possibly prevent the risk of a natural catastrophic event. With the help of GIS, smart devices, and satellite communication, the IoT technology can be used to design the systems meant for early warning. Following this, awareness about the upcoming event is another important application. What could create awareness and offer quick guidelines about the preparedness better than social media? Conventional media also play a major role. Real-time communication in order to deliver an emergency response is the next potential application of IoT here. The most challenging and probably the most exhaustive job that follows any disastrous event is recovery and rescue. The IoT technology can be efficiently used in creating online systems that search missing people and even manage emergency funds. Moreover, IoT-enabled devices and systems can function as an alternative way for communication when the conventional infrastructure for communication is poor, sensitive, or not working. Though the latest innovations in IoT do not directly account for disaster preparedness, they do bring about excellent disaster resilience. However, deployment of IoT-enabled devices helps here in a totally different way. It does not help in disaster preparedness and resilience but enables a viable option to communicate in such circumstances, in form of limited or emergency communication. How do IoT sensors contribute in disaster preparedness? IoT sensors development is perceived to be an excellent innovation that poses itself as an efficient solution to the lack of foresight which intensifies the adversity of any natural disaster and the following emergency situation. This is exactly what the sensors concentrate on, by monitoring multiple climatic parameters. IoT sensors can be installed within a particular area to create a system that ultimately acts as an emergency unit in case of catastrophic events. Weather parameters, such as humidity, moisture, temperature, air quality, pressure, water level, and many more are constantly monitored by these sensors and the moment any one or more of them reach a dangerous level, the sensor network grasps it. Any other notification system could hardly match up the speed of sensors notification, when it comes to alerting emergency responders and message broadcasters. Moreover, sensors contribute to the available data that provides the real-time details about weather, possible ways of evacuation, traffic, medical services, and police. They in a nutshell anticipate the upcoming hazards well in advance so as to help decisions regarding the next plan of action. Sensors that are designed to predict flood situations through identification of possible critical hazards affecting infrastructure, have to be installed in a strategic manner. Flood depiction and management system can be complicated but if well planned and implemented, its versatility does an excellent job in flood-like events. Several IoT sensor network systems can efficiently function on an automated response solely on the basis of the real-time data absorbed by the sensors. In case of a forest fire, IoT sensors on trees monitor temperature, moisture, CO and CO2 levels. Local population is notified in advance and all the details are informed to firefighters even before they reach the location. Researchers are further working on specific IoT sensor types, including infrared and microwave. While the former one may have its application in flood prediction and management, the latter one is foreseen to be a valuable sensor in case of earthquakes.","<!-- Featured image --> <!-- /Featured image-->The past decade has seen hundreds of natural disasters in various countries.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The wildly unpopular GOP tax bill, which is expected to pass through Congress along party lines imminently, includes a number of provisions that have big ramifications for the climate and the environment. These range from mostly good (preserving solar and wind tax credits) to actually the worst (drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). RL Miller, co-founder of Climate Hawks Vote, told Earther that some of the worst attacks on renewables have been “neutered.” For example, the $7500 tax credit for buying an electric vehicle has been restored. “But it doesn’t begin to make up for the assault on the environment envisioned in this bill,” she said. Here’s a look at what’s going on in the bill from a climate and energy perspective. Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge This might just be the biggest environmental catastrophe in the GOP tax bill. It’s also insanely unpopular, with 70 percent of Americans in opposition, but then that’s par for the course with this bill. The provision was essentially a deal sweetener for Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) who has long coveted drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge, the country’s largest. Doing so would imperil fragile ecosystems and wildlife, like the Porcupine Caribou herd, which use the area as a calving site. That in turn would impact the food security of Alaska Natives. Environmental groups are also highly skeptical it will raise the $1 billion Republicans are promising. “They’re not going to come anywhere close to that,” Alex Taurel, the deputy director for legislative affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, told Earther. “It’s a penny on the dollar compared to the $1.5 trillion tax cut.” Renewable energy The bill the House passed stripped tax credits for renewable energy. Those credits survived in the Senate bill, and are in the final bill Congress is voting on. Those credits aren’t permanent—they’ll phase out in 2020 for wind, and 2022 for solar, as planned in a 2015 tax bill. By sticking to that timeline, renewable companies will have time to cut costs and plan for the phase out rather than preparing for the abrupt changes the House bill would’ve wrought. “We are grateful for the elimination of provisions that would have decimated future renewable energy growth and even penalized past investment in wind and solar power,” Gregory Wetstone, the president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement. The Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) is another piece of the renewable energy puzzle in the bill. The tax is designed to keep corporations from reducing their tax liability through overseas payments. The New York Times has a great explanation of how it applies to wind and solar projects: Many companies building wind and solar farms sell their tax credits to multinational banks and other investors who can use them to lower their own tax burdens. Roughly two-thirds of wind projects and three-fourths of solar projects in the United States are supported by such tax-equity financing. By imposing a minimum tax on multinational investors under certain conditions, the initial Senate bill could have drastically reduced demand for such credits. The final bill includes language that would still allow investors to offset up to 80 percent of the minimum tax using solar and wind credits, which ensures those credits still remain valuable. But the bill also includes more firms that will now fall under the BEAT, which adds a layer of uncertainty to the market. Electrical vehicles Car manufacturers from Chevy to Tesla are also breathing a sigh of relief after it was announced the tax bill would keep the electrical vehicle tax credit. It’s a consumer-side credit worth up to $7,500, with the goal of encouraging more people to buy electric cars. “Keeping the plug-in vehicle credit in place is the right policy for consumers and for the nation,” Genevieve Cullen, the president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, said in a statement. “We appreciate the conferees’ support and will continue to work with Congress to advance U.S. competitiveness through electric mobility.”﻿ Grad students The House bill included a provision that would’ve taxed graduate students on the tuition waivers they currently receive from universities, dramatically increasing their tax burden. It was, to put it lightly, “truly horrifying” and roundly denounced as elitist and unhealthy for American competitiveness in STEM and other fields. It has also, thankfully, been killed in the final bill. Disaster sufferers The tax bill is setup to kick people while they’re down. While people who have lost everything (or close to it) from wildfires and hurricanes this year will be able to write off those losses on taxes, future disaster victims won’t be in the same boat. The personal casualty loss deduction allows victims to write off losses that are greater than 10 percent of a person’s adjusted gross income. Taxpayers were able to deduct $1.6 billion in losses from natural disasters in 2015. The House bill canned it entirely, but the Senate bill kept the deduction in place if a federal disaster is declared, which is how the final bill reads. For people who suffer from tornadoes, hurricanes or large fires, that’s (relatively) good news. But smaller fires or weather disasters may slip through the cracks. There’s a host of other things going on in the tax bill, which clocks in at 1,097 pages with all the notes reconciling the House and Senate versions. It was unveiled on Friday and over the weekend, and senators have copped to not even reading the whole thing before today’s planned vote. That includes Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who was a no until a timely provision was added that would be a huge windfall for him. Among casualties lost in the bill, Republicans decided not to renew expired credits for small-scale renewable energy. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) also added a sneaky amendment that would benefit pipeline companies, and the 16 members of Congress who have stakes in them. And regardless of any windfalls for renewables, this is far from a progressive bill. In the long-term, it will take money away from the middle and lower class in favor of paying off the rich. Miller said she’s already thinking of how the bill’s environmental shortcomings could be used against Republicans who vote for it in the midterm elections next year. “Generally we try to tie climate campaigning to voters’ everyday lives. And this bill gives us a great opportunity to do so. We’re obviously still working on messaging, but I could easily see a message along these lines: ‘The same tax bill that wrecked Obamacare and is taking a bite out of your paycheck has giveaways to Exxon—because Republicans care about Exxon, not you. Time to vote them out!’”","The wildly unpopular GOP tax bill, which is expected to pass through Congress along party lines imminently, includes a number of provisions that have big ramifications for the climate and the environment.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Its been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow. New imagery released on Monday at the American Geophysical Unions annual meeting shows the challenges of getting the light back on. The insights the researchers reveal could be used to help respond to the next disaster on the island or anywhere throughout the Caribbean. The images are what NASA calls its black marble. Its like the blue marblesatellite images of Earth in the daytimebut for nighttime viewing. To create them, NASA scientists looked at satellite images captured at night and weeded out fires, reflective surfaces like lakes that might catch the glimmer of the moon, and other natural sources of light. They took what was leftall the human sources of lightand overlaid it on a striking black map of Puerto Rico. The before-Maria image is vibrant, showing San Juan shining bright like a diamond, and the constellation of smaller cities like Ponce, Mayaguez, and Caguas lit up like Orions belt across the southern tier of the territory. But in images of Puerto Rico after Maria, which struck as a Category 5 monster in September 2017, the entire island is basically dark as only those with solar panels or generators were able to light up their houses. The lights slowly flickered back on, but NASA scientists found that, perhaps not surprisingly, rural areas struggled to power back up. More than 40 percent of long-lasting power outages occurred in rural locales despite being home to much smaller populations. By comparison, just 29 percent of the long-duration outages were in urban areas, places that are largely more wealthy. The lack of light in the countryside is what drove Puerto Rico to have the second-longest blackout ever recorded anywhere in the world. It also neatly illustrates that the poorest suffer the most from climate catastrophe and that inequality is likely to intensify as the planet warms and violent weather becomes more common. With the power out, it wasnt just a question of not being able to watch television, but a question of life and death. According to NASA, areas with prolonged power outages also lacked access to medical resources. A landmark study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government earlier this year found Hurricane Maria led to 2,975 excess deaths on the island, some of which were due to lack of medicine or care. But if the new research shows where governments and Puerto Ricos utility failed during Maria, it also points to opportunities for how to improve disaster response and preparedness for the next storm. By visualizing where the outages lasted the longest, utility crews could pre-position tools or develop plans for how to access and restore power quicker. Ditto for first responders. The maps also reveal where it may make sense to prioritize grid improvements or install community or rooftop solar and battery storage. Ultimately, it will make sense for other cities, states, and countries to take heed, given the weather weve seen over the past year.","It’s been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow.

Monica Mark,"OUALLAM, Niger — The mission that resulted in the death of eight soldiers — including four Americans — in a firefight with Islamist militants in Niger earlier this year was the result of reckless behavior by US Special Forces in Africa, according to insiders and officials with knowledge of the operation. The deaths came as a result of a poorly executed mission intended to gather information about three senior ISIS militants operating in isolated territory on the border between Niger and neighboring Mali. The US-led mission reached its target destination — BuzzFeed News can reveal for the first time that it was a militant camp across the porous border in Mali — on Oct. 3 and was returning back to base the following day when they were attacked, according to a senior ranking Nigerien official. But insiders say the fatalities in the remote village of Tongo Tongo were likely avoidable had the mission been better planned, although it is unclear whether key decisions were made by soldiers or their commanders back at base. Officials warn of the risks of further such operations just as the Trump administration is putting more US boots on the ground through the little-known Special Operations Command, Africa program (Socafrica). A Nigerien general, two senior military officials, and an official from the Nigerien government’s anti-terrorist unit spoke about the mission to BuzzFeed News on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak with the press. In visits to “red zone” areas, deemed out of bounds by US and other foreign embassies, and high-level interviews, locals and senior officials told BuzzFeed News that the worst military fiasco under the Trump administration came after US soldiers rushed into a hornet’s nest of militants with insufficient intelligence, while a series of “negligent” decisions during the operation handed an accidental victory to an ISIS offshoot. The incident highlights the consequences of the US prizing firepower over intelligence-gathering, even in militant-controlled terrain where local military partners are on the backfoot. And it comes as Special Force troops are being drawn deeper into shadow wars against militant Islamists on the continent — wars that have no military solution, according to those mired within them. When a message crackled over the radio at an isolated US military base just before midnight on Oct. 3, it sealed a series of missteps that led to the fatal firefight. Earlier that morning, a convoy of soldiers in desert camouflage sped over the dry riverbed that marks the edge of Ouallam, a garrison outpost almost 60 miles from Niamey, the capital of the vast landlocked West African country. The dozen US Special Forces and their 30 Nigerien counterparts were taking part in what the Pentagon publicly described as a routine reconnaissance mission. Passing one final military checkpoint, beyond which the road dissolved into sand, the men continued northward toward the border with Mali, whose dunes and desert caves are a haven for groups loyal to both al-Qaeda and ISIS. But a second senior Nigerien military commander briefed on the matter told BuzzFeed News they were in fact seeking three specific targets. “The objective was intelligence-gathering on three militants,” the commander said. He also confirmed the names of two of the militants the convoy was searching for: a man who goes under the alias of Petit Tchapori, and Chefou Doundou, a former cattle herder nicknamed Dondo by locals and code-named “Naylor Road” by US intelligence. A US defense spokesperson declined to comment on any questions from BuzzFeed News, citing an ongoing investigation by the Department of Defense. “The investigation is exploring issues of policy, procedures, resources, doctrine, training, judgment, leadership, or valor central to this incident. The Department of Defense will always strive [to] ensure our forces are properly equipped and have the necessary capabilities to accomplish their mission and defeat any threat,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The two militants were key local lieutenants in a fledgling ISIS affiliate called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), led by the Western Sahara-born Adnan al-Sahrawi. Drawing on their deep ties in villages far from any urban area, the two senior militant leaders have spearheaded successful recruiting tactics for ISGS over the past year, swelling its ranks enough to carry out “repeated attacks along the border with Mali.” Under US rules of engagement, troops can only accompany Nigeriens when enemy contact is considered “unlikely.” Although there had been at least 46 militant attacks in the area in the last 18 months, the US soldiers were in unarmored pickups and relatively lightly armed when they ran into an ambush by militants just outside Tongo Tongo, a village of several dozen mudbrick homes. Their assailants easily outgunned them with sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and automatic weapons mounted on trucks, according to a Nigerien anti-terrorism official. The attack lasted for at least two hours, ending only when military aircraft flown by French soldiers stationed in neighboring Mali flew overhead. The Mirage jets and Puma helicopters were unable to drop bombs for fear of hitting Nigerien or US soldiers because they were not in radio contact with them, according to US officials. Officials familiar with such operations have questioned whether the mission should have taken place at all. Approaching high-value militants is by nature a delicate operation that often requires many months of intelligence-gathering and meticulous planning, military and intelligence officials told BuzzFeed News. That appears to be far from the case in this operation. “Socafrica has, in recent years, become increasingly secretive, unaccountable, clientelistic, and — as recent episodes suggest — reckless. Odds are they didn't have the granularity of intel to offset the risk of such a mission,” said Matthew Page, a former Africa specialist with the State Department’s intelligence arm. “I think the bigger issue at stake here is the degree to which Special Forces Africa is increasingly seen by US diplomats and defense officials as a ‘rogue element’ that is pushing the envelope on its missions and activities in the Sahel, and elsewhere in Africa, without explicit buy-in from US policymakers, diplomats, or even senior military commanders.” Questionable decisions were made in the hours preceding the attack. By the afternoon of Oct. 3, the soldiers had reached their destination — a militant bush camp in a village called Akabar, located in a nature reserve some four miles inside the Malian border, a second Nigerien official told BuzzFeed News. A US Defense spokesperson would not comment on the exact nature of the operation, but said: “We don't conduct any operations without the consent of the respective host nations.” The US’s military partnership in the region allows them to accompany Nigerien troops up to 50 kilometers inside the Malian border. After destroying the deserted camp, the patrol made a puzzling decision: They decided to keep pursuing their targets by combing nearby villages, according to the Nigerien general and the anti-terrorist unit official. That meant, without prior planning or any contingency plans, they would be extending the time spent in territory full of militants and their informants — a basic error, say US officials with dozens of such missions under their belts. “That’s not how it’s done,” Donald Bolduc, a retired general who led Socafrica until June, said of what’s known officially about the mission so far. Senior militant leaders are normally well protected, Bolduc said, with rings of security guards and layers of militants who communicate with one another via radio, he said. “The resources and planning didn’t seem to be there for that kind of operation,” he said in an interview with Reuters in October. Long after nightfall, when the mission was due to be debriefed back at the base, instead US soldiers sent a radio call to those awaiting their return in Ouallam. That decision to stay, which was relayed in that call, proved to be a disastrous mistake. “They sent a message just around midnight saying that because their position was still around the border with Mali, and that’s a high-danger zone, they would stay the night there,” a second Nigerien senior military official briefed on the matter said. It’s unclear whether that decision came from the soldiers on the ground or their commanders back at base. Moving around in the dark would make the patrol more vulnerable to attack from militants who were far more familiar with the terrain. The mission set up camp and began a night-watch rota, the official said. They set off to return to base at daybreak, pausing briefly to rest in an unnamed village just after dawn broke. The decision to stay overnight while deep in militant territory was all the stranger considering the very thing they’d set off to do, both US and Nigerien military officers said. “You could call it negligence,” a Nigerien army general briefed on the matter told BuzzFeed News from Niamey. “They were moving around in a zone owned by militants. They let their guard down.” The general said it was likely informants had relayed the fact that US soldiers were in the area to senior militants. “There are a dozen villages around the frontier with Mali. The enemy took advantage of informants in these villages,” the general said. The convoy didn’t radio as they were approaching Tongo Tongo, which was far from where they’d spent the night, because by then they were considered outside the immediate danger zone. Shortly before midday, the mission stopped outside the tiny village because it had a well. The US soldiers had supplies of bottled water, but their Nigerien counterparts needed to fill their flasks, with temperatures hovering around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Souley Mane, a 34-year-old builder from the village, saw the convoy pull up. He said the soldiers approached him to ask if they could use the well. Mane told them he would have to let the village chief know there were soldiers in the area. Mane said the village chief, Alassane Mounkaila, was surprised to hear soldiers were in the area because he was usually forewarned by the Nigerien army when patrols were taking place. “I told him, there are white soldiers with them, too. He immediately got up to go and see them,” Mane told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Ouallam. “All I know is they needed more water and while they were here, they decided to take the opportunity to question the village chief.” When the team set off over an hour later, a group of armed men on motorbikes cut them off from the front, according to an account by a Nigerien anti-terrorist official. Several motorbikes with similarly armed militants then came in from behind. Having “sandwiched” the soldiers, who were initially able to return fire, there was a temporary lull before vehicles mounted with machine guns rolled onto the scene, and unleashed heavy gunfire in an attack both US and Nigerien officials have said was professionally executed. The Oct. 4 ambush bore the fingerprints of Sahrawi, a former al-Qaeda veteran who, having switched allegiance to ISIS, is looking to climb the ranks among the militant groups jostling for influence in the region. US officials, puzzling over what they say was an hour-long delay before soldiers requested aerial support, believe the time it took for the more heavily armed militants to arrive may have led the troops to underestimate the gravity of the attack. An hour after the first contact with militants, a message was relayed to French soldiers, who have taken a lead in anti-terrorism operations in their former colony. By the time French Mirage jets flew overhead two hours after the attack began, four soldiers from each nation had been killed, and the rest had scattered over several kilometers, the Nigerien general said. “When deaths occur in a mission in which, despite the risks, killing wasn’t foreseen, then the mission was a disaster,” the general added. A few days later, Mounkaila, the village chief fell under suspicion from both US soldiers and Nigerien officials for being in cahoots with militants. He has been detained ever since. Niger rarely makes it into the US news, with many people assuming the country is a misspelling of its better-known neighbor, Nigeria. Even senior US officials seemed unaware of the shadow war happening there, let alone the “mission creep” that is taking place under a cloak of darkness afforded by a state of emergency imposed by the Nigerien government. The US has a mandate only to train and assist — and explicitly not to engage in combat missions — although Niger also hosts two US surveillance drone bases. Niger’s defense minister has since announced he has asked the US to begin using armed drones for the first time in the impoverished nation. That’s exactly the sort of mission creep that’s making some observers increasingly uneasy about the 800 US troops stationed in the country, the biggest foreign contingent by far. Mamane Touda, an official at the country’s top civil rights organization, said there was something else that troubled him about US soldiers “creeping in — and creeping in is the phrase I mean to use,” he said in an interview in Niamey. What’s most troubling, said Touda, was that both US and Nigerien soldiers were operating in three counties that have been under a state of emergency since March. “And the state of emergency was declared with no parliamentary consultation whatsoever. That’s totally illegal,” said Touda. With ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliphate in disarray in Syria and Iraq, the organization’s newest branches sprouting in Africa offer a glimpse into the playbook its affiliates might use. In Niger, Sahrawi commands the two-year-old ISGS, which seems to be refining its tactics and showing that they can cause significant damage and mayhem with a relatively small number of fighters, said Andrew Lebovich, a regional security expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “They’re not really geared towards seizing territory — these attacks are happening on trucks. But even so, they’ve been able to inflict a fair amount of pressure on the Nigerien military.” The manner in which the US soldiers’ corpses were found pointed to a plan to capture at least some of them alive. “The soldiers were found naked because the militants took everything they could — military uniforms, weapons, comms equipment,” the Nigerien general told BuzzFeed News, contradicting US officials who have publicly said there were no indications troops fell into enemy hands. “They wanted to cart them away [alive] so that people wouldn’t know if they were dead or alive as hostages. It would have been a negotiating tactic.” That plan was likely scuppered when the arrival of French jets forced the militants to flee. Still, a desire to keep under the radar as the group expands could explain why ISIS has been slow to seize on what would normally be a major propaganda coup. In the sect’s Amaq publication, which typically glorifies ISIS attacks, Tongo Tongo was only mentioned briefly once. For a group that is quick to claim attacks by its affiliates even when those links are tenuous, it seems that in Niger they want to build up numbers on the ground before taking responsibility for attacks that would likely provoke retaliatory airstrikes. For those living in Tongo Tongo, little has changed since it became the site of a massacre. Mane, the builder who lives there, recently stumbled on a makeshift graveyard of militants some 20 kilometers from the village. The graveyard — evidence the militants felt comfortable enough either to wait around or return to bury their dead after the ambush — isn’t what scares him most. It’s the sound of engines on the village’s sandy roads that troubles him now. “The only people that have motorbikes here are them because they use them for patrols,” the builder said. “And we’ve been seeing motorbikes coming in and out of the village, always in pairs or threes, almost everyday ever since.” Almost two weeks after the Tongo Tongo ambush happened, the incident spiraled into a political disaster after Donald Trump got into a public spat with the widow of one of the dead soldiers. Myeshia Johnson was on her way to receive her husband’s body when Trump told her in a condolence call that her husband “knew what he signed up for,” prompting a series of claims and counterclaims over what he said. Key senators said they hadn’t realized US troops were even in a region where Islamist militant groups have taken root in recent years. “We don’t know exactly where we’re at in the world, militarily, and what we're doing,” senator Lindsey Graham said. Some 1,200 soldiers US soldiers are stationed in the Sahel and the US is being drawn deeper into a complicated situation where militants have been operating in the region for years. On a blistering day in January 2013, Abdoulaye Moumouni was moving his cattle in search of water in northwestern Niger when a group of turbaned men appeared on the horizon. The 50-year-old herder was somewhere so far off road it had no name; the nearest inhabited place was Ayorou, a speck of a village a full day’s walk away. As a member of the seminomadic Fulani ethnic group, Moumouni was used to going days without seeing anyone else but other herders. He initially assumed the three men were Tuareg rivals, with whom the Fulanis have been fighting for generations over valuable livestock. As the men got closer, Moumouni saw that their turbans were not wrapped in the Tuareg style. They carried automatic weapons, not the carved knives or homemade muskets typically used to defend against desert animals. “You could tell they weren’t from here. The way they were dressed, and they had long beards and serious guns,” said Moumouni, as he led his herd through fields of sun-frazzled millet. Their leader wanted to know where the nearest well was located — a lifeline in a region where temperatures soar up to 106 degrees Fahrenheit. A second man gestured to indicate they were hungry. Frightened, Moumouni gave them cheese and milk from his meager supplies. The men left without thanking him. Since then, Moumouni has run into them every few months as he crosses the Sahel. Each time, the men demand he pays them zakat — a Muslim tax, or alms-giving, that’s second only to prayer in expressing devotion. A few times, they questioned his Islamic faith, asking him if observes the five daily prayers. Mainly though, they stole and killed his animals, roasting them in makeshift bush camps they set up in the desert. These men were militants drawn to a number of different militant groups that had sprung up in the vast desert area following the demise of the former dictator Muammar Gaddafi in neighboring Libya in 2012. One such group was formed by Sahrawi and a notorious Al-Qaeda commander called Mokthar Belmoktar. Although based in Niger’s neighbor Mali, it wasn’t long before the chaos spilled over porous borders in the vast desert region. Two years into their partnership, the cofounders began to diverge on the best way to grow as an organization. They had watched, from thousands of miles away, the rise of ISIS and its aims of establishing a global caliphate. In May 2015, Sahrawi took an oath of bayah — a pledge of allegiance — to ISIS and its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. He called his new group Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, and soon began trying to grow his ranks. Such extreme religious ideology didn’t gel with the moderate version of Islam that Fulani herders, and indeed most Nigeriens, practice. But many signed up because the Islamists offered them arms and weapons training — which the Fulani wanted to use against their Tuareg rivals. Men like Chefou Doundou, the target of the Oct. 4 mission, were key to convincing Fulani herders to sign up. Doundou was a former livestock farmer who had turned to militancy a decade ago to secure weapons to protect his increasingly large herds. Still, ISIS’s central command in Raqqa only saw the affiliate in Niger as a relatively lowly “battalion.” In order to be recognized as a wilayat or province — a precondition to them funneling valuable logistical and financial support — Sahrawi needed to strike bigger targets. An opportunity came Sahrawi’s way on Oct. 4. Whether or not he and his men knew US soldiers were part of the convoy, the attack catapulted them into the global spotlight. Got a confidential tip?

Jennings Brown,"Legged robots are superior to wheeled robots when it comes to traversing various types of terrain. But legs require balance, and if a two-, or even four-legged robot falls over, it might not be able to get back up. One solution would be to make a robot that is virtually all legs. Maybe a dozen legs. Hell, why not 32 legs! That was the thinking behind Mochibot, a robot created by researchers at Keio University and the University of Tokyo, reports IEEE Spectrum. It might look fairly terrifying coming at you with all those metal urchin-like appendages, but itll have an easy time maneuvering and reaching its destination. Mochibots telescopic legs have three sliding parts that can extend to nearly two feet. These give the bot the multidirectional maneuverability of a sphere, but also allow it to shape to the ground its trying to traverse. Its not as dependent on good traction and can more easily roll-crawl on pebbles and sand than, say, BB- 8, according to Mochibots creators. And if one of the legs jams or breaks, then the robot will likely still be able to keep rambling. Just look at that creepy metal globular echinoderm go! As IEEE Spectrum points out, the robot could be used in planetary exploration or disaster response. Hopefully, future version of the Mochibot will have different feet that dont look like a bunch of toadstools.

Bradley Tusk,"One of the advantages of owning your own business is you can hire whomever you want. Often, that lets you cut through normal bureaucracy and irrational behavior to find the right people and build a really good team. But having that kind of autonomy also means it's easy to talk yourself into things and make mistakes. Over the years, I've hired a number of friends to come work with us at Tusk Holdings (and our subsidiary companies). Some of those hires have worked out really, really well. Others have been a disaster. I've learned a few lessons along the way. 1. Don't hire someone just to help them out. Being a good friend is a mitzvah and that means helping friends in need. You can give them advice and emotional support. You can make connections and introduce them to people. You can even give them money. But you can't give someone a job just because you want to help them. At the end of the day, if there's not a clear need and a clear fit, you're not helping anyone. They end up taking a job they're not equipped for. Your employees are suspicious when the friend you just hired can't perform or produce (because you put them in the wrong role in the first place). At first, you encourage them to hang in there but eventually, you grow frustrated that you're keeping someone around who'd otherwise never last. And they grow frustrated quickly too--they want to produce, they want to help, and when they can't, it's just as upsetting for them (probably more so). Over time, you resent them, they resent you and they end up leaving. And even worse, there's no rescuing the friendship. I've now made this mistake three different times. I really liked and respected each of the people before hiring them. And my relationships with each of them are irreparably broken (we pretend otherwise but we know we're just pretending). 2. Hire friends if they have the exact skill set you need. I've also hired friends who have gone on to be some of our best employees, highest performers and wonderful colleagues. The reason it has worked each time is because they did already what we do. They had the skill set, interest, and background to hit the ground running on day one. They're able to add value immediately and win credibility with the rest of the team immediately. But the clear lesson is that they were each people I would have hired whether I already knew them or not. If you can't answer yes to that question, don't make the hire in the first place. 3. Even when you're hiring friends who are completely qualified, there's still risk. Sometimes things don't work out. It may because your business goes south. It may be because they lost interest over time or just messed something up that's unfixable. Who knows? Luckily, the friends I've hired who were already qualified for the job have all worked out really well. But I know I'm taking the risk of seeing something go wrong and seeing our friendship suffer as a result. 4. Sometimes the relationship is equal, sometimes it isn't. Even when a friend becomes an employee, outside of work, they're still your friend and any good friendship is based on a relationship of equals. But when you're at work, even in the most collegial, flat structure imaginable, you're still the boss. Remembering which is which at the right time can be tricky (especially since the lines between working hours and non-working hours are so blurry)--but it's also essential. 5. Becoming friends with employees is fun, but be careful. When you work closely with people you like and respect, you often become friends with them. Many of my friends outside of work were colleagues or employees in jobs I used to have. There's nothing wrong at all with becoming friends with your employees but especially in the critical moment we're living in right now, you have to always remember that you have more power in the relationship than they do and that they may feel compelled to agree with you. This is obvious when it comes to romantic relationships (we don't permit anyone to date someone who reports to them or they report to) but anyone who supervises anyone else should always be mindful of this (if that wasn't obvious before Harvey Weinstein, it should be extremely clear now). 6. Even after getting the ""hiring friends"" thing both right and wrong over the years, I'd still do it again. It's helped me build my company and enjoy the people I work with every single day. But I also regret the occasions where I hired people for the wrong reasons (well-intentioned but still stupid) and destroyed those friendships in the process. It can be a tough path to navigate but for better and worse, it comes down to one simple rule: if you'd hire them regardless of whether you already knew them or not, go for it. If the only reason you're hiring them is because you know them and want to help, don't do it. Ultimately, you're not helping them or yourself.","Some friends have worked out really, really well.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive. As executive director of Refuge House, which works to end domestic violence in the Big Bend, she had to ensure her organization was ready for what she knew was coming: increased calls to their hotline, and a spike in urgent need for shelter from survivors and victims. Baldwins expectation didnt come out of nowhere. When disaster strikes, domestic violence followsnot just in Florida but around the world, according to the World Health Organization. The violence can take many forms, from child abuse to sexual violence to intimate partner violence. People like Baldwin have seen it all firsthand before. And with residents of the Panhandle still reeling from Michaels destruction, there are already signs that the cycle of violence could repeat itself. Weather events like these and disasters, in general, are opportunities for abusersboth domestic violence attackers and sexual assault perpetratorsto take advantage of the restrictive access survivors have to resources and to also take advantage of the isolation in the aftermath survivors experience, Baldwin told Earther. That isolation becomes even more intense and is even more of an opportunity for attackers to harm others. A considerable number of hotline calls came in before the storm in the eight northern Florida counties Refuge House serves, including hard-hit Wakulla and Gadsden counties, said Baldwin. People, largely women, were seeking immediate shelter (both from the storm and their abuser), and the Houses two emergency shelter locations were overcapacity by the time Hurricane Michael made landfall October 10 as a Category 4 storm. The shelters held more than 60 women between the two, compared with the usual 35 to 40, said Baldwin. A 20-person addition might not sound like a lot, but it is for this rural region. With the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. Escaping abusers is key during disasters because studies show that violence grows more severe in relationships that already experience it and its prevalence increases across the board, said Jennifer First, a mental health program manager at the Disaster and Community Crisis Center at the University of Missouri whos done extensive research in this area. And one doesnt need to look far back in the history books for proof. Take Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston in August 2017. The number of domestic violence victims who sought help between January and August from the Crisis Center at the Katy Christian Ministries, which serves the West Houston area, more than doubled from 417 in 2017 to 1,025 this year. Reports of sexual abuse the center received nearly tripled, according to a report the center released earlier this week. For Hurricane Maria, the deadliest storm in modern U.S. history, the situation didnt look much better. Lack of power threatened the elderly and sick who needed machines for their medicine, but this darkness also left abuse survivors and victims on the island vulnerable, as Refinery 29 reported. After the storm, local nonprofit ESCAPE saw requests for survivor-related services increase by 62 percent. A similar spike in domestic violence has been documented after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. For some, this abuse can be deadly: Nearly half of all female homicide victims are killed by a current or former intimate partner, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly one in five women and about one in seven men report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime, per the CDC. Women of color are especially at risk. Why? A lot of the data points to stress. She may have fewer housing choices, First said. She may have less social support. These are all risks that are often associated with domestic violence. After disasters like hurricanes strike, communities are more likely to experience employment loss, displacement, loss of housing, and financial issues. All this is especially true for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods already experiencing these inequalities. (Michael struck the states poorest region.) Even without a natural disaster, economic and housing challenges can increase the risk of domestic violence, First said. Throw a hurricane into the mix, and chaos can ensue. These communities and these families and these survivors were already very stressed before the storm arrived, said Baldwin from Refuge House to Earther. People are really living day to day, on the edge of being able to meet their basic needs, and thats a normal day. So with the storm hitting those communities, it means that already-isolated victims are even more isolated. It means the resources of law enforcement intended for their protection has been sent to other needs. States like New Jersey and Missouri have begun addressing the spike in domestic violence that accompanies natural disasters through training to emergency response teams and increased funding to domestic violence victims, but more needs to happenespecially in coastal communities in the South that deal with these hurricanes the most, said First. At least in the part of Florida Baldwin serves, her team at Refuge House goes door to door with relief agencies. The state brings the food and water, and Refuge House brings the counseling and comfort victims may seek during this tumultuous time. Theyve been doing this for the last 10 years and remain on the ground in wake of Hurricane Michael. While victims and survivors needed immediate shelter at first, in the weeks and months to come they may need help finding permanent housing or protection from an abuser. As the data shows us, the danger can last long after a storm passes. These coming weeks are just the beginning.","As Hurricane Michael whirled toward Florida over a week ago, Meg Baldwin went into overdrive.

The request would be less than what some government officials say is needed. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House plans to ask the U.S. Congress on Friday for about $45 billion in additional aid for disaster relief to cover damage from hurricanes that struck Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida and other disaster damage, a congressional aide said on late Thursday. The request would be significantly short of what some government officials say is needed. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94.4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island's infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria. The state of Texas earlier this month submitted a request for $61 billion in federal aid. Last month, Congress approved $36.5 billion in emergency relief for Puerto Rico and other areas hit by recent disasters and said it planned to seek another round of funding after it reviewed requests from federal agencies and state and U.S. commonwealth governments. Puerto Rico sought $31.1 billion for housing, followed by $17.8 billion to rebuild and make more resilient the power grid. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said late Thursday at a congressional hearing his staff had been briefed on the White House that would be released on Friday that he called ""wholly inadequate"" but he did not disclose the precise amount. He said the White House had also ""short-changed"" funding for wildfires that have struck the western United States.

GEORGINA KLEEGE,"When people avail themselves of disability services at airports, riding wheelchairs and golf carts and boarding before everyone else, we also find ourselves subject to policies about emergency protocols, such as the requirement to remain in our seats and wait for help.
Still thinking fast, I resisted the urge to list my academic and professional accomplishments as proof that I am a clear thinker, accustomed to directing others, good in a crisis. Fortunately, my fellow passenger only needed to consider for a second. Yeah, he said, she can get around in the dark. She could lead me to safety.
I couldnt tell for sure, but I assessed that the man was young to middle-aged and physically fit. When I stood up to let him in the seat I observed that he was above average in height. He had flipped his suitcase into the overhead bin with ease. His broad shoulders extended beyond the width of his seat. I considered pointing out that in the hypothetical disaster, as I led him to the exit, we could also assist Mr. Shaky-on-my-pins. For all we knew, he might be a physician, or a former Boy Scout, ready to administer first aid. Who knew what valuable skills he might have in a disaster? Between the two of us, surely my seatmate and I could get him out as well.
The flight attendant was a bit flummoxed. My fellow passenger was displaying a kind of defiance in his solidarity with me. Perhaps this is why they usually conduct these briefings before the nondisabled people board. She decided not to argue with us, and that was the end of it.
As we taxied to take off, I became aware that my seatmate was gripping the armrest between us. I could feel the tension in his elbow pressing against my arm. I realized that I had misjudged him. His seeming physical fitness had distracted me from the possibility that he might be a fearful flyer. I wanted to say something reassuring, but I sensed that my presence and the disastrous scenario it had compelled him to imagine had triggered his anxiety. So I resorted to the tried-and-true small talk of travelers: Was this trip business or pleasure? Was he leaving home or on his way back? I am an experienced traveler; I know how people talk. Soon enough, he released his grip on the armrest, the wheels left the tarmac and we were on our way.

"Catie Stewart, Rebecca Krevat","As two Jewish sexual assault survivors, we’ve watched with horror as the Trump nominee for assistant secretary of the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, Kenneth L. Marcus, passed through his initial Senate education committee hearing in mid-January. Now, the full Senate will vote on whether to confirm him. Marcus, an attorney and founder of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, openl y endorses Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ draconian views on campus sexual assault by supporting a rollback of the Title IX guidance the Obama administration put in place to help survivors of sexual assault continue their educations. Oftentimes, Title IX guidance simply ensures that a survivor won’t have to sit next to an assailant during math class, or can receive an extension on a paper. It also dictates that universities must promptly investigate any claims of misconduct and explain how to hold fair hearings for both the accuser and accused. Student survivors could use the guidance to understand how their schools could support their healing and get them back to the classroom (like by providing counseling, which schools must offer free of charge). Equally as important, the guidance proved that the federal government had survivors’ backs. That’s all changed now. DeVos has already replaced the 2011 guidance with interim guidance that greatly tips the scales in favor of accused students. For example, this interim guidance now denies survivors the right to appeal, and has lifted the prohibition on direct cross-examination. This will ensure that survivors are less likely to come forward, given that they may be required to directly face their rapists. To be clear, we expected no different from a Trump nominee ― as Trump is an alleged perpetrator himself. Of course, Marcus agrees with all of Trump’s “civil rights” policy. During his committee hearing, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) asked Marcus if Trump had made any statements on civil rights with which he disagreed. Marcus answered no. Though Marcus is clearly a terrible choice for students, disturbingly, Hillel International, the largest campus Jewish organization in the country, has stood by and vouched for him. Hillel is one of the biggest and most influential Jewish organizations in America, with over 550 campus affiliates. We were both active with Hillel in college ― it’s often the center of campus life for Jewish students, providing spaces where Jewish students can eat Kosher food, attend holiday services and participate in other critical religious and cultural touchstones. Hillel went as far as to submit a letter for the record to the Senate in support of Marcus, citing him as a “longtime champion for civil rights and for college students, ” as he has worked with the group to fight anti-Israel sentiment on college campuses. T he Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, which Marcus founded in 2011, is an advocacy group that fights anti-Israel sentiment and anti-Semitism, particularly on college campuses. Hillel normally takes a strong public stance against sexual assault. We were proud when Hillel joined the “It’s On Us” effort to fight sexual assault through bystander intervention. We also appreciated this resource guide that Hillel put together in the wake of the #MeToo revelations. But its support of Marcus’ nomination completely undermines all of these efforts. How can Hillel protect survivors while supporting a person who is trying to take survivors’ rights away? Hillel and Marcus are particularly worried about BDS ― the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement ― which aims to cut off international support for Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a very sensitive issue for our community, and anti-Israel activism can feel like an attack on Jewish people’s right to self-determination and a safe haven. That being said, as a nonviolent protest movement, BDS is not posing the same threat to student well-being as sexual assault. Fighting BDS simply cannot justify putting all students, including Jewish ones, in harm’s way by rolling back on Title IX. You don’t get to be a “champion” for students if you don’t support their basic right to pursue an education free from gender-based violence. Fighting BDS cannot justify putting all students, including Jewish ones, in harm’s way by rolling back on Title IX. For Trump, this nomination is clear pandering to his extreme base and supporters in the Jewish community. But from the Jewish institutions we grew up in, we expected better. It’s no accident that Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), presiding over the initial hearing, highlighted Hillel’s letter of support for Marcus. Marcus is hardly a civil rights hero. So his endorsement by a Jewish institution ― amid an uptick in anti-Semitism ― gives him some undue credibility. Unfortunately, Hillel’s support of the Marcus nomination is just another instance of “ support Israel at any cost” politics. It’s not just a policy position or ideological decision: It is going to have real, tangible consequences. If, with Hillel’s support, Marcus is approved by the full Senate, he and DeVos could officially decide to rescind the Title IX guidance altogether. Student survivors will essentially lose their tools to pursue academic success, as well as the resources to help them understand their rights. Women, nonbinary and trans folks on campus will become even more vulnerable. One in 5 college women will be sexually assaulted on campus, and the statistics are even more chilling for queer women and trans folks. As the #MeToo movement has shown, nearly every woman, trans person and gender non-conforming person has experienced some type of harassment or abuse. As former campus Hillel leaders ourselves, we know that the last thing a Jewish college student needs is her campus spiritual and social home aligning with a Trump nominee who prioritizes the defense of Israeli government policies over her safety and agency. Our community needs to stand up for us and many thousands of others. Over 30 civil rights organizations agree that Marcus is unfit for this position, including the National Council for Jewish Women, and Jewish Women International. To be clear, this isn’t just the Jewish community’s problem ― there are survivors in every community, and we all must fight the DeVos-Marcus agenda. But it’s time for Hillel to side with students and rescind its endorsement of Marcus. And to the Senate: Protect students’ civil rights ― please do not confirm Marcus. DeVos is bad enough, and now more than ever, survivors need you in their corner. Don’t turn your back on them. Catie Stewart is a community organizer and writer living in San Francisco.

Katharine Schwab,"In 2014, Stanford student structural engineer Ahmad Wani was visiting family in his native Kashmir when a catastrophic flood struck. The rising waters stranded him and his family for seven days without food or water, during which they watched their neighbor’s home collapse, killing everyone inside. After this horrifying experience, Wani was struck by just how disorganized the emergency response was. “There is no science behind how people should be rescued,” he says. “Disaster response is really random.” Today, Wani’s startup One Concern is launching a machine learning platform that provides cities with specialized maps to help emergency crews decide where to focus their efforts in a flood. The maps update in real-time based on data about where water is flowing to estimate where people need help the most. It’s the latest in a wave of AI-powered tools aimed at helping cities prepare for an era of severe, and increasingly frequent, disasters. Since 1980, the U.S. has suffered from 219 climate disasters that cost over $1 billion, with the total cost exceeding $1.5 trillion. In 2017 alone, these disasters cost the country $306 billion. Since 2000, more than 1 million people have perished from these extreme weather events. As climate change heralds more devastating natural disasters, cities will need to rethink how they plan for and respond to disasters. Artificial intelligence, such as the platform One Concern has developed, offers a tantalizing solution. But it’s new and largely untested. And the urgency is growing by the day. [Image: courtesy One Concern] From earthquakes to floods After surviving the devastating flood in Kashmir, Wani returned to Stanford, where he was studying structural engineering. He began contemplating how to predict a disaster’s damage. The idea was that if city officials could anticipate which areas would be most harmed, they would be able to deploy resources faster and more efficiently throughout the disaster zone. But he had a problem: analyzing a single building using traditional structural engineering software took seven days on Stanford’s supercomputer. “We had to recreate that for the entire city” for the idea to work, Wani says. “We didn’t have seven days or seven years. We wanted to do it in three to five minutes.” He decided to focus first on earthquakes, which are more of a threat than floods in California. Wani teamed up with fellow Stanford students Nicole Hu, a computer scientist who focuses on machine learning, and Tim Frank, an earthquake engineer, to build an algorithm that can digest data about how a building was built and how it’s been retrofitted over time. This data is combined with information on the building’s materials and surrounding soil properties to extrapolate what happens to this system when shaking occurs. Then, when a quake hits, the model absorbs new information coming from on-the-ground emergency responders, 911 calls, or even Twitter to make its predictions of the damage more accurate. Because the model identifies patterns by looking through large amounts of data, it needs less computing power than the previous method of asking a computer to perform complex physics equations to understand how shaking will impact a structure. The trade-off is accuracy: Hu estimates that the algorithm is only about 85% accurate. With more data over time, that number will improve, but the team believes that it’s good enough to paint a broad picture of damage immediately after a quake. (Of course, they won’t know for sure until a major earthquake hits.) Wani, Hu, and Frank started One Concern in 2015 and then released its earthquake platform, called Seismic Concern, in 2016. Seismic Concern predicts the damage caused by earthquakes on a block-by-block level and is now used by eight different municipalities, including the cities of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Cupertino. Now, the company is launching Flood Concern, a constantly evolving risk map that crunches huge amounts of data based on the physics of how water flows, information about previous floods, and even satellite imagery to approximate the depth, direction, and speed of the water–and determine which areas of a city are most at risk. Layered on top of the damage prediction is demographic data, so that emergency planners can see what areas of a city might have particularly vulnerable populations, like a significant percentage of seniors or disabled citizens. With that kind of information, planners can figure out which areas should be evacuated, where to put shelters, and what critical infrastructure–like schools or hospitals–needs the most help when flooding begins. [Image: courtesy One Concern] The sad state of emergency response Emergency planners have little technology to work with when it comes to understanding what is happening during a disaster. For floods, many emergency planners rely on static risk maps, which model the flow of water by assuming that rain is falling constantly everywhere. These maps are based on the probability that a flood will happen in any given year: A 100-year risk map has a 1% risk of happening, while a 500-year risk map has a.2% annual probability. These models never change, even as dams burst and flood water reshapes entire neighborhoods. Emergency response teams often react based on what 911 calls come in, with little data to help prioritize resources on a city-wide level. But this process is outdated. “We’ve had four of what they call 500-year events in 20 years,” says Tom Bacon, the chairman of the Houston Parks board who is not affiliated with One Concern but has thoroughly examined the software. “Each time we’re reinventing the process for recovery, reinventing the process for solutions going forward, and we’re not using either historical information or maintaining an accurate record of the current conditions in order to make the best decisions about how we invest. That’s simply because the ability of static databases to understand these fast-changing cities is so limited.” It’s a similar story when it comes to earthquakes. According to Mike Dayton, the deputy director of San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management, state-of-the-art technology during an earthquake is a shake map, which shows the magnitude and epicenter but contains no detail about the extent of damage. Dan Ghiorso, fire chief of the California city of Woodside, told Fast Company earlier this year that he has relied on an even lower-tech strategy: responding to 911 calls and just driving around his district to see what kind of damage resulted from an earthquake. Other companies are trying to tackle these problem using AI. Like One Concern, Geospiza uses data to create city-specific action plans for a variety of disasters using a map-based interface. The nonprofit Field Innovation Team is using machine learning to predict what people in shelters will need post-disaster. Microsoft is getting into the game too, with a recent announcement that it will be investing in AI tech related to disaster response. But One Concern has heavy hitters in the emergency management industry on board, including Craig Fugate, former head of FEMA under Obama, and Greg Brunelle, who headed up New York State’s emergency management agency. The company also focuses on releasing separate tools for each type of disaster rather than a blanket AI that can handle all of them. Seismic Concern can start generating predictions 15 minutes after an earthquake hits with about 85% accuracy, and constantly updates as on-the-ground data about the actual state of damage comes in from 911 calls and emergency response teams. There’s also a mode that allows cities to look at more conservative predictions: If a city has more resources than they know what to do with, the mode will help them figure out where to deploy those resources to be extra safe. Even though there hasn’t been a big quake since San Francisco started using Seismic Concern, Dayton uses it for other types of emergencies as well. Earlier this year, when a high-pressure gas line ruptured during construction, Dayton used Seismic Concern’s demographic layer to look up the types of residents in the area the city planned to evacuate. He said it helped the city decide if they needed a shelter and how big it should be. “It’s not just something that we’ll trigger after the major earthquake,” he says. “It’s a tool we’re using every time we have a shelter or evacuation order.” The city has been using the platform for about two and a half years and has a multiyear contract with the startup at a rate of $100,000 a year. [Image: courtesy One Concern] Mitigating disaster when climate change comes knocking Organizing emergency teams in the immediate aftermath of a disaster is crucial. But so is long-term emergency planning, especially since disasters will become more severe and more frequent in many parts of the United States. One Concern has a mode where officials can run thousands of simulations to understand their city’s weaknesses so they can retrofit buildings and plan how to distribute resources before disaster strikes. “They get an understanding of how does this building or this resource look as compared to this other building or other resource on an annualized aggregated damage level for all the possible scenarios of earthquakes,” Wani says. It’s almost like playing SimCity, where planners click on a fault, watch what happens to each building, and then add icons like sandbags, shelters, or fire trucks to see how these preparation tactics influence the simulation. All of this happens within a relatively simple color-coded map interface, where users toggle on different layers like demographics and critical infrastructure to understand what the damage means in more depth. For emergency planners and responders on the front lines, One Concern’s easily understandable UX can help make the chaos of disaster a little clearer. Dayton says the simulations have helped San Francisco validate where it has decided to put shelters in case of a quake. In Woodside, Ghiorso says its helped the emergency planners identify which buildings need to be retrofitted to survive shaking. “Cities need to figure out what’s the best use of every public dollar that they’re spending,” Wani says. “Should they upgrade the city hall, the bridge, this road, or should they buy a firetruck? What makes the most sense in terms of saving the most lives or livelihoods?” [Image: courtesy One Concern] Bacon of the Houston Parks board believes that cities need to bring more data into planning for the future. “We probably need $25 billion of investment for the next level of resilience and sustainability for these events. We’ll probably get $10 billion [from the government],” he says. “This platform I believe can make us do better models and make better judgements on how we best apply that $10 billion to create safety and sustainability for the greatest portion of the population and have the least amount of impact and future reinvestment required when this happens again.” But to make all this happen, One Concern and other AI startups working on these problems need good data–and lots of it. That kind of data isn’t always available, especially in developing countries. Hu and her team are currently conducting a pilot study in Bogota, Colombia, where they are testing to see whether they can use a smaller data set to make more widespread predictions for the rest of the city. The team found that they were able to do so in San Francisco, but cities in other countries don’t always have enough data to make predictions accurate enough. And even when an algorithm does have enough data to be reasonably accurate, there’s a bigger question: Should we rely on algorithms to decide where to send resources, and where to invest in our cities? Given the harmful lack of nuance that algorithms have demonstrated in other aspects of our lives– like on social media –could a computer program really adequately parse problems as complex as disaster relief? It’s a thorny question with no easy answers. But cities are running out of options. Emergency responders are keen to explore any tools available to diminish the impact of disasters, like the huge wildfires that are overwhelming the state of California right now. Next on the One Concern’s agenda is Fire Concern–which is particularly pressing given Hu says that in some places, the occurrence of a fire can exacerbate a flood because it changes the topography of the land, resulting in the water flowing at a much higher speed. As One Concern continues to build its models and add more data to them, the results will only get more and more accurate. When it comes to fires, Ghiorso of Woodside is hoping that One Concern will be able to tell him how much the weather is impacting the chances of a fire so that he can prepare more effectively. “Climate change has changed the game,” he says. “We have to find a better way of doing this. We need to figure how to mitigate it.”","Cities are looking to machine learning to streamline their disaster-response efforts. Will it be too little too late?

Al Williams,"Ham radio isn’t just one hobby. It is a bunch of hobbies ranging from chatting to building things, bouncing signals off the moon, and lots of things in between. Some of these specialties, such as supporting disaster relief or putting odd locations “on the air”, require portable operation. To encourage disaster readiness, hams participate in Field Days which is a type of contest that encourages simulated emergency conditions. So how do you erect an antenna when you just have a few hours to set up a temporary station? [KB9VBR] shows how he and his friend used a Chameleon Emcomm III portable HF antenna for Winter Field Day. You can see the video review, below.
Unlike some portable antennas, this one is almost 100 feet of wire (73 feet of radiator and a 25 foot counterpoise). The entire affair is meant to be put up and taken down repeatedly.
Unfortunately, the guys didn’t like the setup — it is always going to be tough to manage that much wire. They did like that the Teflon-coated wire didn’t hang up in the trees as easily as some wire. Overall, they still gave it an 8 to 9 out of 10. It seemed to work well, at least in two directions. The way they set it up, they were not getting out to the east and west.
According to EMCOMM, the antenna takes 15 minutes to erect, although that might not take into account the extremely cold Wisconsin weather. The antenna is rated at 100 watts for all HF ham bands and weighs in at 1.5 pounds. Should be fairly easy to stuff in a backpack for hiking.
We expect most radios will want a tuner for this antenna to minimize VSWR mismatch. We’d love to see a network analyzer plot of the antenna in some common configurations.","Ham radio isn’t just one hobby.

STEPHEN WRIGHT and EILEEN NG / AP,"(PALU, Indonesia) — Christians dressed in their tidiest clothes flocked to Sunday sermons in the earthquake and tsunami damaged Indonesian city of Palu, seeking answers as the death toll from the twin disasters breached 1,700 and officials said they feared more than 5,000 others could be missing. Indonesia’s disaster agency said the number of dead had climbed to 1,763, mostly in Palu. Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said many more people could be buried, especially in the Palu neighborhoods of Petobo and Balaroa, where more than 3,000 homes were damaged or sucked into deep mud when the Sept. 28 quake caused loose soil to liquefy. “Based on reports from village chiefs in Balaroa and Petobo, some 5,000 people have not been found. Our workers on the ground are trying to confirm this,” he said at a news briefing in Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital. Nugroho said that efforts to retrieve decomposed bodies in deep, soft mud were getting tougher and that some people may have fled or been rescued and evacuated. More than 8,000 either injured or vulnerable residents have been flown or shipped out of Palu, while others could have left by land, he said. Officially, Nugroho said only 265 people are confirmed missing and 152 others still buried under mud and rubble, nine days after the magnitude 7.5 earthquake and powerful tsunami hit Palu and surrounding areas. The government targets to end search operations by Thursday, nearly two weeks after the disaster, at which time those unaccounted for will be declared missing and considered dead, Nugroho said. In Palu on Sunday, at least 200 people, including soldiers, filled the gray pews of the Protestant Manunggal church for a service. They sang as a young girl in a black and white dress with a red bow danced in the aisle, prayed and listened to a 30-minute sermon from the pastor, Lucky Malonda. A woman in the front pew wept. Min Kapala, a 49-year-old teacher, said she came to the city of more than 25 churches from an outlying area because her usual house of worship was destroyed and liquefaction moved a different piece of ground to its location. “I’m here at this particular church because my own church is no more; it’s leveled, and on its location there’s a corn plant,” she said. “That was very strange to me.” Outside the church, Malonda said the intensity of the disaster had taken even scientists by surprise and called it the will of God. Two people from his congregation were missing, he said. “This is for sure part of godly intervention, not outside the power of almighty God, that can’t be predicted or planned for by anything,” Malonda said. He said religious leaders are discussing holding inter-faith prayers but nothing has been agreed yet. Protestants, Catholics and Charismatics make up about 10 percent of the population of Palu, the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi. The province has a history of violent conflict between Muslims and Christians, though tensions have calmed in the past decade. Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim country. As searchers continued to dig through rubble Sunday, Central Sulawesi Gov. Loki Djanggola said local officials were meeting with religious groups and families of victims to seek their consent to turn neighborhoods wiped out by liquefaction into mass graves. He said on local television that survivors in the Petobo, Balaroa and Jono Oge neighborhoods could be relocated and monuments be built in the areas, which now look like wastelands, to remember the victims interred there. Officials have said that it is not safe for heavy equipment to operate in those areas and that they fear the risk of the spread of disease from decomposed bodies. While grappling with immediate relief needs, the government is also mapping out plans to help more than 70,000 people, including tens of thousands of children, who have been displaced by the disasters to rebuild their lives. Social welfare officials have set up nurseries in makeshift tents as a stopgap to keep children safe and help them heal from the trauma. Market vendors have resumed business and roadside restaurants were open in Palu, but long lines of cars and motorcycles still snarled out of gas stations. In Jakarta, volunteers walked around thoroughfares empty of cars collecting donations for earthquake victims during the weekly car-free morning in the city center. ___ Ng reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.","Indonesia's disaster agency said the number of dead had climbed to 1,763 after an earthquake and tsunami hit the nation in Sept.",2018-10-07T14:18:48Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Death Toll for Recent Indonesian Natural Disasters Reaches 1,700, Officials Say",http://time.com/5417970/death-toll-indonesia-natural-disasters/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/indonesia-death-toll-rises.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
"feedback@businessinsider.com (Sara Hendricks), Sara Hendricks","If you want to have better sex, you have to talk about it. HBO Does your sex life need a boost? If so, you might want to try out something called a sex menu. Or, at least, that's what I did. To clarify, my sex life is — and was — perfectly fine. But I am a fledgling sex journalist. So, when my editor sent me a link to an article about something called a ""sex menu"" and asked if I wanted to try it, I jumped on the opportunity. And that is how I found myself, late on a Sunday night, emailing Google spreadsheet titled ""S*x Menu"" to the guy I am seeing. A sex menu is a way to rank your preference with sex and open up a conversation with your partner. A sex menu works like this: You think about your past sexual experiences and consider what you liked and did not like about your sexual experiences. Then, you put all the things you like in one column that serves, if you will, as the main course. The stuff you don't like goes in another column, which is...poison? Food you are allergic to? Food you don't particularly love, but will eat on special occasions when you know it is important to the person serving it to you? It's up to you. In keeping with this specific food-based analogy, this menu also has dessert; all the sexual things you may not have tried, but would like to do — or would at least consider doing — one day. And that is quite literally all you have to do to create your sex menu. It can be as detailed or as vague as you like. You can also use any medium you prefer to create it, whether it's an Excel document, a Google spreadsheet, pen and paper, or, perhaps, a printed-out mock-up of a real menu. Again — it's up to you. The possibilities for your menu can be endless. Standret/Shutterstock My partner didn't know what to make of my menu, which made things difficult. The main flaw with this experiment was most likely a personal problem — I deeply loathe anything that feels kitschy or cutesy, particularly when it pertains to sex. To me, discussing the things that you'd like to do during sex as ""putting them on the menu"" or ""serving them up"" is about as nauseating as it gets. All the same, I made a list and sent it over to the person I have been seeing for about six months, who did not know what to make of the whole thing. ""Why did you call it a s*x menu?"" he asked me. ""I don't know,"" I said. ""That's not the point."" ""I'm confused,"" he said. I, too, was confused. We did not have sex that night. It's not that the menu presented any problems in the relationship, per se — I didn't feel awkward about discussing it at all, as I sort of expected I might. It's just that the conversation didn't feel all that productive. I already know what I like and don't like in my sex life and, at the risk of revealing too much about my business, it's all working very well for me. This is likely due in large part to the fact that, again, I've been dating this person for about six months. If the relationship was in its earlier stages or something more long-term, I might have gotten more out of it. So, while I appreciate the idea of a sex menu in theory, in reality, I think that I am more comfortable sticking to a straight-up discussion. Sex menus can be beneficial for many relationships — just not mine. This is not to say, however, that no one should try a sex menu. When I asked Dr. Jane Greer, a New York-based marriage and sex therapist and author of "" What About Me? Stop Selfishness From Ruining Your Relationship,"" what she thought about the concept of a sex menu, she was in favor of it. ""This is a creative idea,"" Greer said. ""It's a way to let your partner know what you're interested in doing, and then they can see if it suits their taste without rejecting it outright. Without discussing these needs, it leaves the door open to disappointment and feelings of frustration. You have to go on record with what you like and dislike so that your needs can be factored into the equation."" It seems to me, at least, that the sex menu practice is probably best suited for people who are just starting to have sex with a new partner and want to lay down preferences in a low-drama way, particularly if either party has any past trauma that makes certain sex acts truly out of the question. It's also ideal for couples who have been together for a long time and have forgotten what made sex enjoyable when they first started dating. Even if a sex menu isn't right for you, talking more about your sex life can be helpful. CW I'm still into the overall idea of using a sex menu. It can be difficult to think critically about the sexual experiences you are having, let alone discuss them with the person you're sleeping with. But simply taking the time to ask yourself what you actually want out of sex is something that more people should probably be doing. If you don't want to go the sex menu route, Greer recommended telling your partner about something that you've read or heard about and asking if they'd consider trying it. ""If they don't know, then ask if you can try it and find out whether they like it or not,"" she told INSIDER. And, if thinking of your sexual pre fences in a menu format does make it easier for you to discuss — or, ahem, more appetizing for you— more power to you. In any case, it can hardly be a bad idea for more people to start actively considering what makes sex great or not-so-great for them. This particular sex menu method just wasn't exactly the right thing for me.

Karissa Bell,"One day in the not-so-distant future, search and rescue workers could rush into disaster areas not on foot or in traditional rescue vehicles, but via a robotic avatar. At least, that's the vision behind the latest XPrize, which today announced a new competition that will award $10 million to the first team who's able to create a functional robotic avatar by 2021. SEE ALSO: All-girl team builds flame-throwing robots and takes them into battle XPrize is still hammering out the exact rules and requirements of what this will entail, but the basics are this: it has to be operational from at least 100 km away and user-friendly enough that avatars can be controlled without any specialized training. To do so, teams will need to use a number of different types of technologies: virtual reality, haptics, robotics, and artificial intelligence. (Xprize is also soliciting expert opinions for more feedback on their plans.) It's an ambitious goal, but one XPrize CEO Peter Diamandis believes is possible sooner, rather than later, thanks to advancements in the underlying technology necessary to enable such a creation. Real-life avatars could soon be a thing. Image: Reproduced with permission by Beyond Imagination, Inc. ""We're always looking for the right moment in time that would accelerate the technology and form enough teams together and really cause the seeding of these new companies,"" Diamandis says. Early applications of the technology could be used for medical professionals or search and rescue workers, but could also be used for travel and other consumer industries. (The prize's sponsor is Japanese airliner ANA, of all companies.) It's not the first time XPrize has launched a competition that sounds more like science fiction than reality. The company previously held competitions to bring a private spacecraft to the moon (all of the teams failed ) and to create a real-life version of Star Trek's tricorder (which had a winner, though there's still a ways to go before we see a consumer version). But Diamandis believes avatars are not only possible, but that as an industry they have ""the potential to be as big, or bigger than companies like Uber.""

So does the casting. The actors in “Time’s Journey,” all based in New York, were born in Japan. “Time’s Journey” is more than a reflection on a single catastrophe, though. Told in fragments that come together gradually, it is a chronicle of healing, with all its pain and awkward humor and halting steps. We know from the beginning, because Arisa tells us, that she will become Kazuki’s girlfriend. We watch it happen incrementally, in stilted conversation and silent tableaus. Yet still there is Honoka, weaving gracefully through the room, gently demanding her husband’s attention. “I know you can hear me,” she says.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"To be sure, this latest resurgence of Ebola is still cause for concern. Forty-six cases have been reported so far, with 26 deaths, and the disease has already spread from the country’s remote northern reaches to a populous port city. But so far, the World Health Organization has not declared the crisis a “public health emergency of international concern,” the agency’s most serious designation. If efforts succeed, health officials say, the scourge could be eradicated by summer’s end. “A lot of what’s working now is the result of remembering and learning from previous failures,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development and the director of foreign disaster assistance at the United States Agency for International Development during the Obama administration. The Trump White House, however, appears to be uniquely amnesiac. On the same day that officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo reported the new Ebola cases, the administration sought to rescind $252 million in Ebola response funds left over from the earlier epidemic. Before Congress acts on that request, members should recall how those funds came to be. Public health officials confirmed the 2014 outbreak at the end of a fiscal year, when most agency budgets — at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.A.I.D. and elsewhere — were tapped out. The search for additional funding delayed the American response, which in turn led to more lives lost and, ultimately, more money spent. To prevent the same thing from happening next time, the White House Office of Management and Budget agreed to leave these funds in U.S.A.I.D.’s budget so they would be on hand to combat the next emergency. Rescinding that money brings us back to where we started — ill prepared to mount a rapid response to a new infectious disease threat.","Just four years ago, an epidemic taught the need for speed and global cooperation. The Trump administration is ignoring that lesson.",2018-05-22T23:47:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Ebola, Amnesia and Donald Trump",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/opinion/ebola-outbreak-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/opinion/23wed1/23wed1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Hector Mujica,"Over the last week, three wildfires have devastated communities in California, and there's been a tremendous efforton the part of firefighters, first responders, local officials and NGOsto contain the flames and help thousands of displaced families. Since the start of the fires, we've deployed resources to help those affected in our own backyard. Here's a bit more on that, and how you can help. Improving access to information When the fires broke out, Googles Crisis Response team activated SOS Alerts, allowing people impacted by the disaster to access local emergency information, news and maps of the affected areas. With networks down, it soon it became evident that getting online was a top concern. In collaboration with the Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC), Google volunteers have been on the ground helping communities get back online, allowing many to reconnect with families and friends, file insurance claims, andwhen possibleget back to school or work. They set up WiFi and connected Chromebooks at shelters, distribution centers, churches and clinics, serving over 1,000 evacuees. In just a couple of days, these connections allowed over a dozen shelter guests to be matched to missing persons list entries. ITDRC and our volunteers are also working in Southern California to capture aerial and street-level imagery of the impacted areas. These images will be used to augment existing digital maps allowing emergency managers to evaluate the impact of the fires. Beyond information, there are many critical needs to be met during a crisis of this proportion, including food and shelter. Google.org and Googlers have donated over $1.5 million to support those impacted by the fires. This includes a $500,000 direct grant from Google.org to efforts like the NorCal Disaster Relief Fund and the Southern California Disaster Relief Fund. By leveraging existing partnerships with merchants and carriers, the Google Shopping team has also made a $100,000 in-kind donation of food and basic essentials to local food banks through Feeding America. Everyone can help SOS Alerts is a gateway for people to make donations, 100% of which goes to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, and will be directed to highly impactful organizations spearheading recovery efforts. To date, over 3,500 people have given money to support the victims of the fires through Google, making donations from five dollars, to as much as $500. Today, we want to invite others to donate as well, to the victims of the Camp Fire or to the victims of the Southern California fires. Anyone can also make donations directly to organizations like the American Red Cross, which is working shelter to those displaced, the Wildfire Relief Fund, which is supporting long-term recovery and preparedness, or the Latino Community Foundation as they support groups providing aid to families and farmworker communities in the affected areas. California is our home. Its where we were founded and where over a third of all Google employees live. There is much more to be done and well stay engaged in support of recovery efforts throughout the state during the days and months ahead.","Over the last week, three wildfires have devastated communities in California, and there's been a tremendous effort—on the part of firefighters, first responders, local officials and NGOs—to contain the flames and help thousands of displaced families.

Personal-finance site Wallet Hub recently published its list of the safest and least safe cities in the United States, and the ones at the bottom of the list scored poorly in several key areas. The ranking compared safety metrics in 182 American cities — the 150 most populated in the country, as well as 32 more to ensure that each state had two representatives on the list. It assigned ratings to each city in 39 different safety metrics, broken down into three major groups and weighted for importance: The highest-weighted category was home and community safety, including the presence of terrorist attacks, number of mass shootings, and rates of murde, rape, theft, assault, and hate crimes The second most-weighted category was natural disaster risk, including the risk levels of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, hail, tornadoes, and wildfires (in some cities, data was unavailable in this category) The third most-weighted category was financial safety, including rates of unemployment, poverty, foreclosures, job security, fraud complaints, and identify-theft complaints You can read more about the methodology here.

Morgan Sung,"Sure, reflecting on what you're grateful for on Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the holiday can also be immensely stressful. There's so much that can go wrong during America's gluttonous celebration preparing a massive meal for multiple people is pretty much just asking for disaster. SEE ALSO: 7 videos of people setting their Thanksgiving turkeys on fire From dog poop mishaps to deeply offensive family members, here are seven of the worst Thanksgiving horror stories, either shared with us or found around the internet. 1. The time the family dog ruined dinner Redditor u/baserith's grandmother made the mistake of treating the family dog to a piece of turkey, and was later subjected to absolute horror. 2. The turkey explosion One Redditor's brand new car was destroyed, thanks to a holiday mishap. Raw turkey juice and short stops don't quite go along. 3. An unfortunate clean up An artist's friendsgiving went awry when their dog experienced some stomach troubles. At least their turkey was safe! ""Opened up the fridge to take the turkey out to only be greeted with a horrible rancid smell. After panicking that we bought a rotten turkey and would have to buy a new one on Thanksgiving Day, we turned around to see that my friend's dog had taken a massive dump on the living room carpet a few feet away and this was the source of the smell. We had fed him some canned pumpkin with breakfast earlier without realizing this would be a surefire way to induce doggy diarrhea :/"" - Tristan Silver 4. The bubbly disaster Thanksgiving can be wild, but this Redditor's story takes it to a whole new level. In this case, almost everything that could go wrong did go wrong. 5. The godmother's drunk faux pas For producer Kate Bell, her first Thanksgiving after her parents split took a turn for the worse when her godmother made a snide comment about her mother. Yikes. ""I was 13 and it was right after my parents had divorced - Thanksgiving at my dad and my new stepmom's. They invited my drunk godmother who said to my face, 'Thank god for you Georgia, that other woman was horrible."" Georgia is my stepmom. I ran out while they were eating [and] I spent the rest of that Thanksgiving crying in the bathroom."" - Kate Bell 6. The time someone forgot about a rotting turkey Redditor u/safeburrito had an awful Thanksgiving when they forgot about a frozen turkey gone rancid. Read this until the end it's truly a tragedy. 7. The cats got to it first Redditor u/moneydearest went to a Thanksgiving dinner where someone actually served pumpkin pies with cat footprints. Would you have eaten it?

Violet Blue,"They're not specifically saying this has anything to do with stopping the spread of fake news from virulent racists, politically active conspiracy theorists, or propaganda farms successfully goading our country into tearing itself apart. No, because that would indicate they've identified the problem. Instead, Facebook says this notable change to the News Feed -- its cash cow fed by your attention -- is to make Facebook feel more positive for users. To bring people closer together. Wink. At this stage, Facebook could lead a masterclass on how not to solve the fake news problem. De-prioritizing actual news organizations and instead highlighting that InfoWars story about eating Tide Pods that your racist uncle shared and commented on five times is just the latest hasty missive in what seems like Facebook's desire to amplify the issue. While some are stoking their chins thoughtfully and musing unquestionably that Facebook just wants its users to be happy, it's appropriate to examine the contempt for its users that got us in this situation in the first place. Right after the November 2016 election, despite being warned by the US government and it being widely reported months in advance that fake news and propaganda were influencing American voters, Mark Zuckerberg flatly denied what everyone was telling him, his users, and the world. ""Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,"" he wrote. He also cautioned that the company should not rush into fact-checking. America began its spin into chaos. Countries around the world, including the US, were seeing racial violence in the streets we now know was directly correlated with racist rhetoric on Facebook. Facebook had all the data. All the answers. Facebook treated it like a reputational crisis. In response the company rolled out a ""Disputed"" flagging system announced in a December 2016 post. The weight of policing the fake news disaster was placed on users, who would hopefully flag items they believed were fake. These items were then handed to external fact-checking organizations at a glacial pace. When two of the orgs signed off on the alleged fake item, the post got a very attractive ""disputed"" icon and the kind of stern warning that any marketer could tell you would be great for getting people to click and share. The ""Disputed"" flag system was predicted to fail from the start, but Facebook didn't seem to care. Facebook characterized its efforts as effective in April 2017 stating that ""overall that false news has decreased on Facebook"" but did not provide any proof. It said that was because ""It's hard for us to measure because we can't read everything that gets posted."" In July, Oxford researchers found that ""computational propaganda is now one of the most powerful tools against democracy,"" including that Facebook plays a critical role in it. In August, Facebook announced it would ban pages that post hoax stories from being allowed to advertise on the social network. This precluded a bombshell. In September, everyone who'd been trying to ring the alarm about fake news, despite Facebook's denials and downplaying, all found out just how right they were. This was the month Facebook finally admitted -- under congressional questioning -- that a Russian propaganda mill used the social-media giant's ad service for political operation around the 2016 campaign. This came out when sources revealed to The Washington Post that Facebook was grilled by 2016 Russia-Trump congressional investigators behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Facebook's flag system shambled along like a zombie abandoned in the desert. In September Facebook's fact-checking organizations told press they were ready to throw in the towel citing Facebook's own refusal to work with them. Facebook seemed to be actively undermining the fact-checking efforts. Politico wrote : (...) because the company has declined to share any internal data from the project, the fact-checkers say they have no way of determining whether the ""disputed"" tags they're affixing to ""fake news"" articles slow -- or perhaps even accelerate -- the stories' spread. They also say they're lacking information that would allow them to prioritize the most important stories out of the hundreds possible to fact-check at any given moment. By November 2017 fake news as a service was booming. The following month, December 2017, Facebook publicly declared that the disputed flag system wasn't working after all. One full year after its launch. Its replacement, ""Related Articles,"" was explained in a Medium post that came across as more experimentation on users and a deep aversion to talk about what's really going on behind the scenes. There's more to this story, but you get the idea. It's a juggernaut of a rolling disaster capped off by this month's hand-on-heart pledge to connect people better and cut actual news organizations out of the picture. ""Facebook is a living, breathing crime scene for what happened in the 2016 election -- and only they have full access to what happened,"" Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google told NBC News this week. Facebook's response included the following in a statement : In the past year, we've worked to destroy the business model for false news and reduce its spread, stop bad actors from meddling in elections, and bring a new level of transparency to advertising. Last week, we started prioritizing meaningful posts from friends and family in News Feed to help bring people closer together. We have more work to do and we're heads down on getting it done. As my colleague Swapna Krishna put it, ""The company is making it harder for legitimate news organizations to share their stories (and thus counter any false narratives), and by doing so, is creating a breeding ground for the fake news it's trying to stamp out in the first place."" If only Facebook put as much effort into policing fake news as it does actively stomping on the face of free speech in the form of human sexuality, enforcing extreme, antiquated notions of puritanism with its exacting sex censorship. Indeed, this week a former Facebook content monitor told NBC News that ""Facebook's team of content reviewers focused mainly on violence and pornography, making it ""incredibly easy"" for Russian trolls to fly under the radar with their fake news."" They added, ""To sum it up, what counts as spam is anything that involves full nudity."" Thank goodness. I mean, who knows how the world would spiral uncontrollably into chaos and violence if someone saw a boob.

Ben Paynter,"The nonprofit Direct Relief has traditionally been known for distributing things like medicines, vaccines, and equipment to areas hard hit by natural disasters or severe poverty. But in recent years it’s had to grow in new ways to keep pace with both the increased rate and severity of both natural disasters and inadequate access to decent healthcare among low-income and uninsured people. In 2018, it donated a record amount of both medical supplies but also a new kind of resource–direct funding–to support local health centers within the United States and more than 100 other countries.Last year, Direct Relief provided about $1.2 billion worth of wholesale materials to health centers and clinics alongside $23.5 million in cash to support those group’s own needs, such as staffing up in times of crisis, or, in the case of Puerto Rico, helping many facilities convert to a solar and battery backup microgrid, so they wouldn’t be knocked offline in the next major storm.

For comparison, the group distributed a little under $945 million in supplies in 2017, along with $5.5 million in separate funding. Its materials are typically provided through charitable donations from health industry companies, and Direct Relief also accepts public donations.
“In all respects we ended the year bigger than it began,” says Thomas Tighe, CEO of Direct Relief. “That’s in large part to keep up with what we see as the clear trend of more frequent, larger-scale, and more intense natural disasters that put a lot of people into harm’s way, and the need to maintain support to areas of chronic need [with] deeply entrenched poverty.”

For instance, after Hurricane Florence struck the Carolinas, Direct Relief delivered 14,000 pounds of supplies, including 300,000 daily doses of medicine to health centers and clinics in those areas, according to a public report. When Hurricane Michael made landfall a few weeks later in Florida, it delivered more goods–but also $250,000 to help keep nearby facilities operating.

After Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, the organization rendered more than $70 million in supplies, but also $12 million for projects that included solar arrays with battery backups for 14 different service centers. “We did not anticipate two years ago leaning in so heavily to become a financier and project manager… but that’s what they needed,” Tighe says. After all, it’s difficult to ship refrigerated medicine to a place that has no reliable way to keep it cool.
In Butte Country, California, home of the deadly Camp Fire, it also helped firefighters buy more search and rescue equipment. And the organization is applying some lessons from field operations to its own home base too. In late 2018, the group added its own solar-powered and Tesla battery microgrid on a major warehouse in Santa Barbara, California to ensure operations stay running no matter what obstacles the surrounding area faces.

The organization also helped establish and continues to stock field hospitals with aid supplies for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and equip various pregnancy support centers with equipment and medicine to give impoverished mothers and newborns a better shot at staying healthy.
Tighe hopes the group will continue to ramp up its delivery of not just supplies but financial assistance when necessary, particularly for the U.S.’s vast network of nonprofit community health centers. “There’s this ongoing debate in the United States at least about how much we want the government to do, and how much we’re willing to pay in taxes to have it do it,” he says. “We’ve created a clearinghouse to gather and efficiently allocate medical material. We’re looking at becoming a clearinghouse to gather funds to provide financial assistance for places that can put it to very good immediate use in communities that need it.”","More and more, disaster relief agency Direct Relief is finding that just giving cash is an important part of helping communities recover.

"Rebecca Gale, Rebecca Gale","Gardite Fougy is pictured at center with her sister Stephanie Fougy (far left) and friend Aisha Baker (far right), and Fougy’s three children: Myien, 14; Myiella, 9; and Gabriel, 6. Better Life Lab is a partnership of Slate and New America. In the 1980s, conservatives, led by President Ronald Reagan famously coined the term “ Welfare Queen,” to highlight the supposedly swank, lackadaisical lifestyles of people receiving government assistance. Since that image of the welfare queen took hold, every administration since, Republican and Democrat, has whittled away at public assistance as we knew it. And now, the narrative of the welfare queen is making a comeback with the Trump administration’s executive order requiring people who receive public assistance to work. But is requiring people who receive public assistance to work really that unreasonable? Actually, it is. Evidence analyzed by the Urban Institute shows that work requirements for people receiving public assistance are ineffective and “do more harm than good,” because they tend to push people into very low paying jobs that can’t pay them enough to relieve their need for assistance. In other words, work requirements keep people in a cycle of poverty, rather than ending that cycle. And sometimes they really can’t work. This is particularly true when it comes to work requirements for housing assistance, where nearly half of all of those who receive public housing are elderly or disabled. And the loss of a stable home is catastrophic for any family, especially the most vulnerable. It leads to more problems on all fronts, especially job and income instability, the very problem work requirements are meant to correct. And, since not all families who qualify for housing assistance are getting it, taking away assistance from one family does not produce a dime of taxpayer savings—cutting one family off from public housing just frees a spot for another family from the waiting list. If the Trump administration is serious about creating more self-sufficient recipients of public assistance, as its executive order claims to want to do, then the best way to do so may not be work requirements, but the Family Self-Sufficiency program, which the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called Housing and Urban Development’s “ best kept secret ” for promoting employment and asset building. Gardite Fougy knows the success of FSS firsthand. For Fougy, a mother of three who was in an abusive relationship and working part-time as a cashier at TJ Maxx, money management was impossible. She had never been taught about budgeting or managing costs. She’d blow through whatever money she had, then assess how she’d make it through each week. She was receiving housing assistance for her two bedroom apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a portion of her monthly income of $500 going toward rent and the rest covered by a housing agency. Her credit score has gone up more than 200 points, and she’s collected more than $8,000 in savings and is now looking to purchase her own home. Then she got a postcard from the nonprofit Compass Working Capital, encouraging her to enroll in the Family Self-Sufficiency program. She signed up. She met with two caseworkers who came up with a plan for her to go back to school, work more, and save more. As part of the FSS program, the housing authority locked in a rent subsidy for Fougy; as her income increased, so did her share of the rent, but the excess money she was paying in rent was captured into a savings account, managed by the housing authority, which she’d receive in full when the program was completed. In the five years it took to complete the FSS program, Fougy left the abusive relationship, went back to school, landed a better full-time job as a “family partner,” a coach and mentor for parents of children with serious emotional disturbances, and she now makes more than double her previous salary, taking home $2,000 each month. Her credit score has gone up more than 200 points, she’s paid off some major debts, including furniture she’d bought on credit, and she’s collected more than $8,000 in savings and is now looking to purchase her own home. She “just got preapproved this week,” she told Slate. “The more your credit score is, the less interest you have to pay,” she explained. “The debt-to-income ratio goes down. I didn’t even know words like that before,” she said. Fougy is one of the more than 1,000 people who have graduated or are currently taking part in a Family Self-Sufficiency program managed by Compass Working Capital, which recently partnered with Abt Associates to evaluate their programs in Cambridge and Lynn, Massachusetts. For the first time, rigorous and robust research and evaluation data exists to show that a local FSS program works, and such private-public innovative partnerships can make it happen. FSS has been around for 25 years and Congress provides funding each year for FSS coordinators at housing agencies across the country. But there is a limit to how many people a single coordinator can reach, and many housing agencies do not have the option of a partnership like the one Compass provides. Before Abt’s recent evaluation and data, there was limited evidence on the success of the program. Here’s what they found : Participants spend an average of 40 months in the program, reporting an increase of more than $6,000 in household earnings and a nearly $500 decrease in household welfare income on average. Participants also were able to build good credit, with a 23 point average improvement in credit score and a nearly $800 reduction, on average, of derogatory debt (i.e., the debt that comes from late payments). “FSS combines three things we think are important for low-income families to make progress to economic security: stable affordable housing, case management, and financial incentives for families to increase their earnings,” said Jeffrey Lubell, director of Housing and Community Initiatives at Abt Associates and the principal investigator of the evaluation of the FSS programs in Lynn and Cambridge. Participants report an increase of more than $6,000 in household earnings and a nearly $500 decrease in household welfare income on average. Participation in FSS is optional, both for housing authorities and housing aid recipients. Those who opt into the program work closely with a caseworker to create financial and career goals and a way to meet them. In traditional housing assistance, any increase in earnings translates to an increase in the participant’s share of the rent. “It’s one of the unintended consequences,” said Sherry Riva, the founder and executive director of Compass Working Capital. “As earnings go up, you can lose more benefits tied to income. If you make too much money, you can lose your housing assistance altogether.” But in FSS an increase in earnings translates to more funds in an escrow account, so families are instead building significant savings, with many doing so for the first time in their lives. Unlike work requirements that eventually hurt families’ subsidies, FSS actually incentivizes work and better earnings. Besides the initial gains from several years’ worth of a savings account, the improved credit scores and reductions in debt lower the costs of borrowing and help low-income families access mainstream financial products, says Lubell, such as buying a car with a low-interest or no-interest loan. Building assets under FSS is what distinguishes it from other programs designed to combat poverty. “We have historically approached poverty as an income problem, and as a result, our solutions are income-based,” said Riva. But for a family to graduate from housing assistance, they don’t just need income; they need time to save and plan. The executive order from the president on mandatory work requirements gave HUD 90 days in which to review its regulations and policies, and an agency response is expected in July. In late April, HUD released a detailed legislative proposal which would allow housing agencies and private subsidized housing owners to impose work requirements. But HUD cannot implement such changes without the approval from Congress. Congress recently expanded and made permanent the number of families on public housing assistance who can participate in FSS, as part of the new Dodd-Frank legislation, and housing experts hope that the stated goal of the executive order—self sufficiency—could be achieved through evidenced-based programs like FSS, rather than work requirements. “You don’t need to be threatening people with evictions to help them raise their earnings and find jobs,” said Will Fischer, a senior policy analyst focused on federal low-income housing programs at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And simply having income is no substitute for actually building assets: “There is a big difference between helping people get from $0 to $9,000 a year and helping them attain $20,000 to $30,000 in annual income. Work requirements don’t do much with the latter,” Lubell insists. FSS, on the other hand, gives people the opportunity to build capital, get training, and come up with a plan to leave public assistance altogether. “The potential here is really to help people make larger strides.” Support for this article was provided by Rise Local, a project of the New America National Network.","In the 1980s, conservatives, led by President Ronald Reagan famously coined the term “ Welfare Queen,” to highlight the supposedly swank, lackadaisical lifestyles of people receiving government assistance.

Peter Economy,"Delta Connection/SkyWest flight 4449 scheduled to fly from Salt Lake City to Bozeman, Montana narrowly averted disaster when a lithium-ion battery exploded and caught fire in a passenger suitcase loaded in the cargo hold of the aircraft. Fortunately, the quick-thinking crew members smelled smoke just before the aircraft took off -- halting the flight and triggering a search of the cargo bay, which quickly revealed an exploded lithium-ion battery in a toiletry bag. While the FAA does not prohibit lithium-ion batteries, most major airlines have prohibited them in checked baggage. This includes so-called smart luggage, which rely on lithium-ion batteries to work. According to FAA records, there were 46 incidents with lithium-ion batteries on aircraft in 2017 -- up from 31 in 2016. Kudos to @Delta ground crew in Salt Lake for saving the day (and us). They smelled fire in cargo - unloaded bags and discovered this. If we had taken off... #Thankful As the pilot said, we owe them pic.twitter.com/HMnoEg1AcU -- Kaira Rouda (@KairaRouda) March 12, 2018 Said a Delta spokesperson, ""We are proud of the quick work of our ground crew who recognized and helped extinguish a bag containing a lithium-ion battery that began overheating inside the cargo hold during the loading process of SkyWest flight 4449 operating as Delta Connection from Salt Lake City to Bozeman, Mont. The situation underscores the importance of removing lithium-ion batteries from checked or gate-checked luggage."" The FAA recommends that any devices containing lithium-ion batteries be kept in carry-on bags -- not checked in gate-checked luggage. Unfortunately, as the upward trend in incidents shows, we can expect more such battery explosions and fires in the future. As a 2016 FAA safety alert pointed out, ""FAA battery fire testing has highlighted the potential risk of a catastrophic aircraft loss due to damage resulting from a lithium battery fire or explosion."" As veteran pilot and airline safety consultant John Cox points out about lithium-ion battery incidents, ""It's one of the few rising risks in aviation."" Safe landing in Bozeman!

Karen Tiber Leland,"""Puppy Dies After United Flight."" Is there a businessperson out there who would want that headline featuring their company? Not to mention the uncountable amount of times the image of that adorable French bulldog has been blasted over TV and Internet. This last year seems to have brought a recent rash of PR nightmares facing public figures and companies alike. The other day a woman called me wanting some help unwinding herself from a personal brand debacle. Something in her past was surfacing on a Google search of her name, and it was costing her employment. As she described the situation, and her role in it, I found myself in the unenviable position of having to point out how her actions -- were making an already poor situation worse. Be it the world of politics, sports or business, when PR disasters strike, the way they're handled has as much impact on the outcome as the incident itself. So just in case you ever find yourself in an image-management mess, here's how to make your way back from a PR disaster without a misstep. Focus on facts. There's nothing more damaging (or embarrassing) than standing in front of a group of reporters post PR disaster and having them tell you a fact you should have known. To get a handle on the scope of the situation, you need to go beyond the spin to understanding all the facts. This will likely mean speaking to a wide variety of people inside and outside your organization to get the full picture. Respond right away. Immediately release a statement, even if it is only to say that you're investigating and will make sure that situation is handled in an appropriate manner. When crisis response is slow, it can turn a PR crisis into a PR disaster. Case in point: United's CEO was severely criticized late last year for not speaking out immediately when a passenger was dragged off a plane. Pick an appropriate face to go with your message. It's surprising to me how often in a crisis, a company picks someone to interface with the media who is clearly uncomfortable with the role. A PR disaster requires a person who can face the press and convey confidence, care, and candor. In many cases it is this person's ability to articulate the message in a fitting way that can make the difference between containment and explosion. Never say ""No comment."" In the event that you do get caught unawares by a reporter, keep your cool and try and avoid saying ""No comment."" Instead, if a member of the press raises a sensitive issue you don't know the answer to, simply say, ""That's a good point,"" and, ""I don't have that information at this time, but I will investigate further and get back to you as quickly as I can."" The trick is to mean it and follow up by actually getting back to them once you have the information you need. Stay ahead of the social media storm. The minute the puppy story hit, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz should have been tweeting at the speed of Donald Trump. Too often, we wait until we have a strategy in place for handling the disaster before starting to respond on social media. But social media operates at lightning speed, so getting ahead of the story by sending out short statements of apology and actions to be taken may keep you from getting swept up in the social media storm. Webster defines a crisis as ""the decisive moment"" or ""the turning point."" For both businesses and the individuals who run them, the way they handle a PR crisis can make the difference between a story that comes and goes and one that lingers in the public's minds for months.",The news has been filled lately with PR disasters including the recent United Airlines Puppy incident. how should a company or individual deal with a disaster?,2018-03-14T20:32:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Has United Airlines Become Puppy Killers and Passenger Bruisers?

AP,"SUMUR, Indonesia (AP) Panicked residents, police and soldiers in this remote fishing village clobbered by a devastating weekend tsunami ran to higher ground Tuesday, shouting Water is coming! Water is coming! and reciting verses from the Quran as emergency messages were broadcast over mosque speakers.
It proved to be a false alarm, but a similar frenzy broke out in Tanjung Lesung, another tsunami-stricken area located hours away, as unsettled survivors of the disaster remained traumatized by a tragedy that killed more than 420 people and left thousands homeless.
Meanwhile, Christmas celebrations were replaced by somber prayers, as church leaders called on Christians across Indonesia, the worlds most populous Muslim nation, to pray for tsunami victims.
Unlike other tsunamis that have hit disaster-prone Indonesia following large earthquakes, Saturdays big waves blasted ashore at night without warning. The eruption of Anak Krakatau, or Child of Krakatoa, a volcano in the Sunda Strait, is believed to have created a landslide on the volcanos slope, displacing a large volume of water that slammed into the islands of Java and Sumatra.
People in Sumur village, which has been slow to receive aid due to roads being cut off, remained stunned by how quickly the tsunami hit. The beach, located just a few kilometers from the tourist island of Umang near Javas western tip, is popular for snorkeling and other water activities. The tsunami decimated the area, ripping houses from their foundations and bulldozing concrete buildings.
Scientists have said the tsunamis waves were recorded in several places at about 1 meter (3.3 feet) high, but residents of Sumur insisted they towered more than 3 meters (10 feet) there. They said a soaring white wall of water roared toward them at high speeds, ripping trees out of the ground by their roots.
There was no sign of a tsunami when we were at the beach. The sea didnt recede, said Tati Hayati, a housewife, who was enjoying a pleasant evening with 10 other people when the disaster hit. It was calm and bright with the full moon.
When she spotted high, fast-moving waves launching toward the shore, she ran to her car and managed to get inside. But she couldnt outrun it. She said the car was struck by three waves, breaking out the back window and filling the vehicle with gushing water.
We were locked inside. The car was swaying in the waves and we thought we would all die, Hayati said. We almost could not breathe and I almost gave up when I groped the key in the water and managed to open the door, and the water began to recede. We got out of the car and ran to safety.
The disaster was compounded because it occurred over a busy holiday weekend before Christmas when many people had fled crowded cities such as Jakarta, Indonesias capital, to relax at popular beach areas.
Pastor Markus Taekz said Tuesday that his Rahmat Pentecostal Church in the hard-hit area of Carita did not celebrate Christmas with joyous songs this year. Instead, only about 100 people showed up for the service, which usually brings in double that number. Many congregation members had already left the area for locations away from the disaster zone.
This is an unusual situation because we have a very bad disaster that killed hundreds of our sisters and brothers in Banten, Taekz said, referring to the province on Java island. So our celebration is full of grief.
The death toll climbed to 429 on Tuesday, with more than 1,400 people injured and at least 128 missing, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias Disaster Mitigation Agency.
He said more than 16,000 people were displaced and that there was an urgent need for heavy equipment in the Sumur subdistrict near Ujung Kulon National Park to help get aid flowing and reach people who may be injured or trapped.
Military troops, government personnel and volunteers continued searching along debris-strewn beaches. Yellow, orange and black body bags were laid out where victims were found, and weeping relatives identified the dead. Many searched for missing loved ones at hospital morgues.
The lead singer of the Indonesian pop band Seventeen located the body of his dead wife after posting emotional posts on social media, vowing that he would not leave her. The group was performing at a beach hotel when the tsunami was captured on video smashing into their stage, killing several band members and crew.
Anak Krakatau is a volcanic island that formed in the early part of the 20th century near the site of the cataclysmic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which killed more than 30,000 people and hurled so much ash that it turned day to night in the area and reduced global temperatures.
The head of Indonesias Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, Dwikorita Karnawati, said Saturdays tsunami was likely caused by Anak Krakataus volcanic activity and so could not have been picked up by sensors, which monitor conventional earthquakes responsible for more than 90 percent of Indonesias tsunamis.
She said the tsunami was probably caused by the collapse of a big section of the volcanos slope. Anak Krakatau has been erupting since June and did so again 24 minutes before the tsunami, according to the geophysics agency. Other scientists have said an underwater landslide may also have contributed to the disaster.
Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and home to 260 million people, lies along the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.
In September, thousands were believed killed by a quake and tsunami that hit Indonesias Sulawesi island. A quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August.
Saturdays disaster came ahead of the anniversary of the massive Asian tsunami that hit Dec. 26, 2004, after a magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island spawned huge waves. The giant wall of water killed some 230,000 people in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia.

Priscilla Frank,"The magical crab opened up our hearts ... love of romantic comedies did the rest. Welcome to HuffPost’s Rom-Com Week.
“Taste ... so good,” Tom, the buttoned-up rich guy played by Sean Patrick Flanery, says between ecstatic mouthfuls of Sarah Michelle Gellar’s batter-speckled face. “It’s amazing. Sweet and a little spicy.” He proceeds to kiss and slurp, and kiss and slurp, in indistinguishable motions.
That’s when my boyfriend peered out from behind the magazine he was reading to ask a legitimate question about the movie unfurling before his eyes: “Are they eating dessert or having sex?”
“A little bit of both!” I chirped back. That’s the beauty of “Simply Irresistible,” the most delectably batty, unreasonably forgotten romantic comedy of all time.
The 1999 film stars a red-headed Buffy as Amanda Shelton, a young woman who inherited her mother’s restaurant, but not her culinary talent. The neighborhood haunt is in danger of shutting down for good when Amanda is approached by a mysterious fellow in an old-timey fedora hawking crabs at the farmer’s market. These crabs, it turns out, have magical powers that allow Amanda to channel emotions into her food.

During this same market visit, Amanda crosses paths with Tom Bartlett, the shmancy restauranteur with late-’90s spiky hair, up whose pant leg the magic crab creeps. Because Tom makes Amanda horny, lust is the primary emotion infused into her culinary creations, sending the people in her orbit into a state of sexual frenzy.
I was 9 years old when “Simply Irresistible” came out; after watching it, I was a woman. The film introduced me to aphrodisiacs, pedal pushers, magical realism, Patricia Clarkson, adult pigtails, daytime martinis, domestic witchcraft and the lascivious factoid that men think about sex no less than 238 times a day. (The latter statistic I held as an incontrovertible truth.)
Sadly, this underappreciated cultural gem was rudely panned by the adults of its time. Critics, eager to oh so cleverly whip out the food metaphors, compared it to “flat champagne,” a “botched soufflé,” and an “unclassifiable cinematic leftover.” The A.V. Club’s Nathan Rabin described it as being “both formulaic and bat-shit insane,” which is accurate. Stuffed halfway with the conventions of a hackneyed romantic comedy, and then topped off with a bevy of Lynchian dreamscapes, “Simply Irresistible” is unlike any other film I’ve ever seen. One moment we’re watching retrograde rom-com cliches like a man who think it’s gentlemanly to buy his date a new dress and leave it for her with a note that reads “wear me” and the next, a sea of diners is weeping into their entrees in a “restaurant” reminiscent of the “Twin Peaks” red room.
How did such a beautiful disaster get created? I reached out to writer Judith Roberts and director Mark Tarlov, who are married, to find out.
The plot of this film a rom-com about a woman endowed with magical, culinary abilities by a crab is unusual. Judith, what was your initial vision for the film?
Judith Roberts: I get a lot of ideas. Some of them have stickiness, some of them don’t. This one was really about how women feel with power. I wanted to express what I felt was a challenge for women: How do you manage your power?
It’s also about what we put into the things we create. The idea that women have an ability to conjure things that men don’t. It was originally written like that, but it got rewritten many, many, many times.
Why did you choose food as the vessel for this power? On the one hand, it kind of plays into stereotypes about women and domesticity, but on the other hand, you do get the sense that even when she’s serving others, she’s exerting power over them?
Roberts: Food is an extension of your soul. When you cook, you put yourself into the dish. Food nourishes everybody. It’s elemental to everybody. 
Mark Tarlov: Our family is completely food-dominated. If you believe in context as the determining factor in everyday experience, for us, food always sets the context. We make wine now, so we’ve even further concentrated and focused on sensuality coming from things you put in your mouth. There is a sense of intimacy you achieve with food, because you ask people to put things you created into their body through their mouths, and use their body heat to activate the flavors. 
Roberts: The heat that’s created between two people.
Mark, I read an interview in which you said this is really a movie about physics. Can you explain that a little?
Tarlov: I have certain obsessions, one of which is particle physics. Einstein’s Theory of Relativity says the laws of physics are the same for everyone who shares a frame of reference. Food sets a frame of reference, so there is a shared sense of the laws of physics, which exists nowhere else except over the plate of food. 
The example I use is reading a book on an airplane. It’s not a problem because you and the book are moving at the same speed, so you’re both sitting still. But if you’re not on the plane, the book is flying at 600 miles per hour, and you’re not going to be able to read it at all. The question is: How do you embrace the people you are with in the same frame of reference? It’s all about Einstein and theory. 
Judy, did you always intend “Simply Irresistible” to be a romantic comedy? Are you a big fan of the genre?
Roberts: I think romantic comedies, the old ones especially, are fascinating and wonderful and just joyous. I love “It Happened One Night” and “Heaven Can Wait.” I have a real interest in escapism; I gravitate toward magic and witches and fantasy and love. “Some Like It Hot” is an amazing movie where they are unleashed into their own fantasies and succeeding and romping. 
I know the movie that audiences ended up seeing was very different from what you initially intended to create. What were some of the biggest changes?
Tarlov: When Judy first wrote the script, it was for Holly Hunter. I’d worked with her on “Copycat” as a producer. She’s a great actress and a fascinating woman. It was really intended at the beginning to be about someone in middle age who hasn’t yet caught up with her stuff. Going from Holly Hunter to Sarah Jessica Parker to Sarah Michelle Gellar ...
Roberts: That caused a bunch of rewrites. 
Was this because the studio wanted a younger actress? 
Tarlov: There was a perception that a woman in her late 30s couldn’t open movies. That was fairly well accepted at the time, and maybe still is. And then after they didn’t want to go with Holly, which seemed crazy to me, we had a read through where Sarah Jessica Parker and Greg Kinnear did it. This was at the height of “Sex and the City,” but they were still convinced they needed to go for a younger audience. “Buffy” was very popular, part of the zeitgeist, the whole thing about female empowerment. So we went with that.
What elements do you think remained constant throughout the rewrites? 
Tarlov: The throughline was this notion of context, and also, if you’ll notice, there are hundreds of mirror shots in the film. This idea of: How do we ever catch up with our reflective selves in the sense of how other people see us and how we see ourselves? The entire movie from beginning to end was about: How do we ever catch up to it? How do we perceive ourselves versus how do other people perceive us? How do we make this overlapping images come together?
Roberts: One of the things we wanted to preserve was not making her a full-on witch. When Tom is on the ceiling, and he says, “Let me down!” and she says “Bippity boppity boo,” we see she’s as confused as he is. It’s not really magic, it’s internal force.
Somebody like Spielberg would not pick a crab. Thats why hes Spielberg and Im me. It was probably a mistake.
 Mark Tarlov
How important to you were the mechanics of the magic as it plays out in the film? The crab, [the market man] Gene O’Reilly was there a logic to it all?
Tarlov: It was important to me. The things we bump into that change our direction are often haphazard and not real, they’re perceived. We’re constantly side-stepping things or being bumped around by things that are real or imagined. The body in motion tends to stay in motion unless there is an intervening force. The real question is, what is it that derails us? What is it that pushes us? Most times, they’re not real. 
Roberts: In this case, Gene and his crab become a manifestation of it. 
I was wondering if Amanda’s mom also had magical powers. She was a chef and Gene mentioned he was a friend of hers, so it seemed plausible.
Roberts: In my original drafts these tendencies existed in the family but had always been suppressed. But that was too complicated. 
Why magic crabs, of all things?
Roberts: Peekytoes! [Editor’s note: Peekytoe crabs are a type of crab.] 
Tarlov: We really wanted something that communicated that it doesn’t matter whether this is real or not. The thing about it is, and I think part of the film’s failure with audiences initially, was, there is no explanation for so much of this stuff, you might as well just embrace it.
Roberts: Peekytoes!
Tarlov: Judy does love to say Peekytoe. 
The thing about the crab is, it is ridiculous. It’s so ridiculous it can only mean it doesn’t matter. Everything doesn’t need an explanation. There are some things you need to take on faith. I wanted to find some embodiment of that in the familiar. In this case, it had to be a food thing. In the end, she thinks it’s her mom’s earrings. But then she does it without her earrings. So she understands her abilities are internal. 
Somebody like Spielberg would not pick a crab. That’s why he’s Spielberg and I’m me. It was probably a mistake.
The audience never truly finds out what exactly gave Amanda her powers or why. I imagine eventually the crab will die from lack of sunlight or water living in that kitchen. After that point, will Amanda’s powers continue?
Tarlov: Yes, her power is not in the crab, it’s in her. We want to as humans attribute everything to something. But in fact it’s the collective unconscious that makes us who we are and who we are and who loves us.
Roberts: When Amanda says to Tom, “Ever since I met you, so many amazing things have happened. I don’t know if I need you to keep this going but I know I want you.” To me, that’s saying, there are all these forces at play. There’s the incitation of sensuality she gets from him. But you can’t pinpoint one specific thing that’s making it all happen. 
It didn’t bother me so much when I was a kid but returning to the movie this week, Tom’s character is really an asshole. He’s spoiled, rude, closed-off, cowardly. Do you agree? 
Roberts: No, I think he’s terrified. 
Tarlov: I agree. 
Roberts: You agree?
Tarlov: He’s one of those guys. There are a million of them. He’s an immovable object fighting an irresistible force. He was drawn that way most deliberately. He’s a guy who would never suspend his disbelief until he had to. 
Roberts: He even believed his ability with the paper airplanes was fully scientific. He thought that he, as a master of the universe, could determine the trajectory of a paper airplane so precisely. 
At one point, the character Nolan goes into Amanda’s bedroom, picks up her dolls and starts smashing them together, making them kiss and simulate sex. Why would a grown man do such a thing? 
Tarlov: That came from Larry [Lawrence Gilliard Jr., the actor who played Nolan]. He did it and we just all cracked up, so he kept doing it. I remember when I first saw him do it, I thought, that’s really weird. But that really came out of something Larry wanted to do. 
I also wanted to ask about the iconic statistic, “The average man thinks about sex 238 times a day,” which was taken very seriously by my 9-year-old self. Is this real?
Roberts: I read that in an article. It was actually from a study. [Editor’s Note: We could not find this study.] 
Tarlov: It comes back to this whole idea that men are really binary, all 0s and 1s. Women, at least in my estimation, are not. It’s an on/off, thing. You’re either thinking about it or you’re not, there’s no room for nuance. That was a very fundamental notion of mine about men and women. Men are digital, women are polynomial. 
What about the detail that men touch their belts when they think about sex. Is that real too?
Roberts: No, we just had to find something physical that would suggest it.
One of my theories about “Simply Irresistible” is it’s a movie about being stoned. That’s what Amanda’s really doing sneaking weed into her food. It would explain why people become loopy and ravenous when eating it. Is this a potential secret meaning of the film?
Roberts: No, I never thought about that. 
Tarlov: Though I must say, the whole idea of the vanilla flowers, they were meant to convey some physical manifestation of the exoticism of the vanilla orchid. Vanilla orchids are amazing creatures. They only bloom once a year. They have to be pollinated by hand or in Mexico by these teeny little bees. They have this ecosystem and they’re extremely intoxicating. 
Roberts: But it’s not specifically marijuana, it’s whatever intoxicates you. 
Amanda is pretty forward with Tom. She visits him at his store, drops sexual innuendos, invites him to dance, calls him, and invites him on a date. In reaction, Tom often fears her and thinks she’s a witch. Do you see the movie as commenting on men being afraid of women who act forward in relationships?
Roberts: Absolutely. Totally. That moment where Patty Clarkson says, “you succumbed.” His whole thing is about only going on three dates because by the fourth date, you’re in danger. It’s about him trying to escape intimacy. She doesn’t let him do it.
Tarlov: He’s bewitched. When she coaxes him into that dance sequence, he’s doomed. He’s being led around by the forcefulness of the woman who is in fact really insecure except in this relationship. With him, Amanda was someone she wasn’t in the rest of her life. She manages to find a way to get the book to sit still so she could read it.
The dance sequence! What was the motivation there? 
Tarlov: The dance is a copy of a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance. And that dance floor, which was clearly not curved, is just an optical illusion. That to me, was a metaphor for the whole film. 
I don’t think the film got enough credit for how dreamlike and weird it gets, almost David Lynch-like at moments. What was the inspiration there?
Tarlov: The old Vincent Minnelli musicals. They were romantic and cheerful but they were also weird, kind of Salvador Dali. It’s all about how we surrender when we fall in love. Optical illusions. You look at someone you love and you don’t see them the same way everyone sees them. All of these illusions and reflections ... Is it happening, is it not? The fog, the miasma, when you fall in love. It all really came out of Hollywood in the ’30s and ’40s.
Weird question: What are your astrological signs? I am a Taurus, and the sign is known for loving food and pleasure. This movie is the Taurus love story for the ages. Are either of you into astrology?
Roberts: I’m a Libra.
Tarlov: I’m a Gemini. 
OK, never mind. I also wanted to ask about the part where Tom leaves Amanda a dress to wear with a note that says “wear me.” Why is it such a fantasy for men to buy dresses for the women they’re dating?
Tarlov: I think that’s a male fantasy. 
Roberts: That was Mark’s idea. I thought ew, but we put it in.
What was it like seeing the critical reactions to the film?
Tarlov: I had to hide in the closet. It was interesting, two reviews stick with me: Roger Ebert was the lone voice of “very good.” I don’t know why he felt that way, but he liked it. And The Daily News, I think, said we had done so little to research for the movie. When Amanda gets in the cab, she says “Hudson and Jay Street in Tribeca,” [and The Daily News said] everyone knows Hudson and Jane Street is in Greenwich Village. Of course, he misheard us. We said Jay, not Jane. [Editor’s Note: We could not find this review.] That allowed me to say these critics don’t know anything. But the reviews were universally so very poor, in retrospect, I understand I did something very wrong. 
The script was so much better than the direction. The script was full of big ideas and most of them fell quite flat. On the other hand, over the last 20 years, this movie has played on and on on TV all around the world. It has a small but devoted core of fans like yourself. 
Roberts: It was devastating. I couldn’t believe it. I think the movie required a real suspension of disbelief. You saw it at 9 years old, but adults weren’t willing to go there. It goes back to, people want concrete answers. But our whole point was to be not concrete. Is she a witch or isn’t she a witch? This question plagued the script from the beginning. I was very stubborn about it because it really went to the heart of what I was trying to do. To say we all have this internal magical force.","How did such a beautiful disaster get created?

Chloe Bryan,"Per usual, President Donald Trump woke up bright and early to tweet on Friday morning. This time, he went with, ""What was Nike thinking?,"" a clear reference to the brand's new campaign starring former NFL star Colin Kaepernick. Fresh on the heels of a fear-mongering campaign rally in Montana, the tweet — like most of Trump's tweets — was clearly intended to rile up his base. Fortunately, it was also a rhetorical question, which everyone knows is a recipe for disaster if you're trying to prove a point.

Daniel Bases,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94.4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island’s infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria. A crane is seen inside a sinkhole caused by Hurricane Maria at a construction site along Puerto Rico Highway 2, outside San Juan, Puerto Rico, October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton “This is a conservative estimate based on similar efforts that have been done in New York, New Jersey and of course in Texas most recently,” Rossello said at a press conference streamed online from the National Governors Association in Washington. “Now, I am however confident that we have turned a corner. That we are now flowing out of the life sustainment phase and we are starting the recovery phase, and the rebuilding phase,” Rossello said. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Rossello said recovery from the storm, the worst hurricane to hit the U.S. commonwealth in 90 years, exceeded the resources of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund and associated programs. At the top of priorities is $31.1 billion for housing, followed by $17.8 billion to rebuild and make more resilient the power grid. Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner to the U.S. Congress Jenniffer González-Colón accompanied Rossello and said she introduced legislation to reform the disaster relief law known as the Stafford Act. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo The reform would allow disaster recovery money to be used to modernize infrastructure, not just return it to recent condition. Puerto Rico’s infrastructure was already weak. Restoring the power grid has been a top priority since Maria’s 150 mile per hour winds knocked it out completely on Sept. 20. Rossello and the island’s power authority, PREPA, were criticized for a no-bid contract with a tiny private firm, Whitefish Energy, for a portion of the repairs. Rossello canceled the contract on Oct. 29 after an uproar over its provisions. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest readings indicate 47.8 percent of power capacity has been restored. Puerto Rico’s economy was already in recession before Maria landed and its government filed for bankruptcy in the face of $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities. Rossello said the decisions Congress takes now will define “how successful we are in rebuilding Puerto Rico.” Reporting By Daniel Bases; Editing by Cynthia Osterman","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Monday requested $94.4 billion from Congress to rebuild the island's infrastructure, housing, schools and hospitals devastated by Hurricane Maria.",2017-11-13T19:59:33Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Puerto Rico requests $94.4 billion from U.S. Congress for rebuilding,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-assistance/puerto-rico-requests-94-4-billion-from-u-s-congress-for-rebuilding-idUSKBN1DD2G8,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171113&t=2&i=1209656185&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEDAC1O6,reuters,Reuters,1
Stan Schroeder,"A borough and a town in Alaska have been hit by a devastating ransomware attack, forcing employees to completely forego computers and go back to typewriters and hand receipts. Matanuska-Susitna (Mat-Su), a borough in the Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area, has declared disaster on Tuesday after being hit by several different strains of malware that crippled its computer infrastructure, including computers, servers, telephones and email exchange. The city of Valdez, Alaska, has also been hit by the malware attack. ""The cyber-attack has caused major disruption in Borough services and loss of productivity, which may continue for a prolonged time,"" Assembly Member Ted Leonard said at a Mat-Su Assembly meeting Tuesday. SEE ALSO: Here’s how malicious Android apps are sneaking malware onto your phone According to a report by Mat-Su borough's IT Director Eric Wyatt, the attack was ""multi-pronged, multi-vectored"", its components including the Emotet trojan horse, BitPaymer ransomware and an actual hacker logging into the borough's network. Some of the malware was dormant on the borough's computers since as early as May 3, the report said, but the attack culminated on July 23, when the crypto locker portion of the malware started encrypting the drives of computers on the network. All in all, nearly all of the borough's 500 workstations and 120 out of 150 servers were affected. According to the report, this was a zero-day attack, meaning that it used exploits that were never seen before. To give you an idea of the damage this type of attack can do on a city's infrastructure, here are some of the services that were affected : pool, libraries, animal care, landfill, collections, as well as a number of web services such as e-commerce. The Mat-Su government said Monday that ""most data"" was not lost to the cyber attack. ""Without computers and files, Borough employees acted resourcefully. They re-enlisted typewriters from closets, and wrote by hand receipts and lists of library book patrons and landfill fees at some of the 73 different buildings,"" Public Affairs Director at Mat-Su Patty Sullivan wrote in a post last week. The BitPaymer ransomware made headlines in August 2017, when it hit several Scottish hospitals, causing delays and cancellations in procedures and appointments. Upon infection, it encrypts many of the files it finds, asking a cryptocurrency payment in order to unlock them. Both the Mat-Su borough and the city of Valdez are cooperating with the FBI in restoring their services and investigating the attack, officials said.","A borough and a town in Alaska have been hit by a devastating ransomware attack, forcing employees to completely forego computers and go back to typewriters and hand receipts.

Julia Alexander,"The utter disaster of TanaCon, a poorly organized YouTuber fan event hosted by personality Tana Mongeau and thrown opposite of this year’s VidCon, has caught the attention of just about every YouTuber and fan, including VidCon creator and former CEO Hank Green. Green, who stepped down as CEO last August, left a YouTube comment about the situation on a Shane Dawson video, below, about the event, which includes an interview with a tearful, apologetic Tana. In his post, Green called TanaCon was “terrifying.” “Running events is hard,” Green said. “Making them safe and fun is hard. Watching the event that Good Times put on devolve into a dangerous situation was not fun or pleasant for me or the VidCon team. It was inexcusable and terrifying and we’re all lucky it didn’t go much worse. “I heard a lot of people joking about that, that we were sipping champagne and laughing or whatever, but no. Our head of security said to me, ‘This is like watching all of my nightmares happen in real life.’ It was scary and I was frustrated and sad and angry and following it on social media like everyone else. I think this is bad for all YouTube conferences.” Mongeau’s relationship with both VidCon and Green is fraught. She explained in a previous video that although she was invited out to VidCon in 2017, she wasn’t a “featured creator.” This meant she wasn’t allowed in certain exclusive areas and didn’t have security around her. Fans bombarded Mongeau while she was walking around and, according to her video, led VidCon’s security staff to take measures she didn’t agree with, like not walking around the convention floor or hotel lobbies where other featured creators were staying. “If I were running an event that was based upon creators meeting their fans, and the entire premise of your event, where the entire mission statement of your event is where creators and fans can finally meet, if this creator shows up with millions of followers and hundreds of people are there... why wouldn’t you just print another stupid little fucking badge,” Mongeau said in the anti-VidCon video below. Green said that he takes full responsibility for what happened at VidCon in 2017, and offered an apology to Mongeau and her fans. The full comment is below: In 2017, I 100% screwed up. Tana was part of our content, and not making her a featured creator was a bad call. If we were going to have her doing content, she should have been a featured creator. We were being conservative because of some things that Tana had done and said in the past [including her use of a racist expletive in previous videos, as well as telling another creator, iDubbbz, to kill himself on Twitter, but we should either have had or there or not...not that shitty in-between thing. This isn’t the first time we screwed up, and it won’t be the last. This is a hard business, and I’m not saying “Oh, Tanacon is all my fault!” but I think it’s important to recognize when we make mistakes regardless of the mistakes other people made. It’s been really hard for me to say all this because I love the team of people who puts on VidCon and they are so great and it was really hard to admit we screwed up while the VidCon team was getting attacked on social media. TanaCon’s production company Good Times Productions, which Mongeau has called out as the culprit behind the event’s failure, is reportedly giving full refunds to those who paid $65 for a ticket to the event. Customers have to get in touch via email and specifically request one, however.","The instantaneous disaster of TanaCon during this year’s VidCon has caught the attention of just about every YouTuber and fan, including VidCon creator and former CEO Hank Green.",2018-07-06T16:21:27Z,"{'id': 'polygon', 'name': 'Polygon'}",Former VidCon CEO and YouTuber Hank Green comments on TanaCon disaster,https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/6/17540464/tanacon-hank-green-vidcon-tana-mongeau-shane-dawson,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p5X2I7T3LmpbAaYr2Ia_ezunGcs=/0x0:1280x670/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11652017/tana_2.jpg,polygon,Polygon,1

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp. The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six metres (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicentre of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off. The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighbourhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said. “We don’t know how many victims could be buried there, it’s estimated hundreds,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where workers were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified. Nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. “It’s devastating,” she told Reuters by text. Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said a church in an area of Sigi, south of Palu, had been engulfed in mud and debris. Officials said the area suffered liquefaction, when the shock of the quake temporarily destabilises the soil. “My volunteers found 34 bodies... children who had been doing a bible camp,” Arriani said. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region. Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. AIRPORT CHAOS A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for miles. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while residents streamed out. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 litres of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery. The government has played down worries about looting though witnesses have seen incidents. Chief security minister Wiranto said more than 2,800 troops had been deployed and plans were in place to send in a further 2,000 police. The government would accept offers of help from 18 countries and it had also commandeered 20 excavators from mines and plantations to help with a shortage of equipment to dig through wreckage and clear blocked roads, he said. Nearly 60,000 people were displaced, many terrified by powerful aftershocks, and they needed tents, water and sanitary facilities, while the power utility was working to restore electricity, he said. Commercial flights have yet to resume but military aircraft were taking people out of Palu. About 3,000 people thronged the small airport hoping to get out and officers struggled to keep order. “I’d get a plane anywhere. I’ve been waiting for two days. Haven’t eaten, barely had a drink,” said 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Palu sits astride the Palu-Koro fault, which runs north-south along the edge of Palu Bay. Geologists estimate segments of the fault have a slip that is among the highest in Indonesia, at 4 cm (1.6 inches) a year, exposing the area to a higher risk of quakes. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after the 2004 disaster appear to have failed. Disaster agency spokesman Nugroho told reporters on Sunday none of Indonesia’s tsunami buoys, one device used to detect waves, had been operating since 2012. He blamed a lack of funds. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. However, officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force.

Carry a fully charged cellphone. Work slowly when doing outside chores. Sprinkle cat litter or sand on icy patches. In addition to the above suggestions: Limit your alcohol intake, as it increases the risk of hypothermia and frostbite. Shivering is an indication your body is losing heat. Seek shelter to warm up. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has assembled some great tips for winter motorists. Tips for preventing water pipes from freezing If water pipes freeze, they can burst, which can be costly and inconvenient to repair. BanksPhotos via Getty Images In extreme cold, water pipes can freeze and burst. To help head off potential water freezes, you can take the following precautions, adapted from the American Red Cross : Run water, even at a trickle, to help prevent your pipes from freezing. Open the kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing (be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children). Keep the garage doors closed if there are water lines in the garage. Keep the thermostat at the same temperature day and night. Your heating bill may be a little higher, but you could avoid a costlier repair job if your pipes freeze and burst. In addition to the above suggestions, you should consider winterizing water pipes by wrapping them in insulation (newspaper can also work in a fix) or self-regulating heat tape. These items are available at most home improvement stores. If you suspect your pipes are going to freeze, consider closing the inlet valve on your toilet and then flushing it to prevent damage. If the pipes freeze, open the faucets to allow for expansion of frozen water. If you are a renter, contact your landlord. Do not use a blowtorch or a kerosene or propane heater to unfreeze your pipes, due to risk of fire. If a pipe breaks, shut off the valve controlling the water to your home. If you don’t know where the shutoff valve is, contact your utility provider. In the event your home is damaged by the extreme cold, you might be eligible for financial relief through your homeowner’s policy. If you lose heat due to malfunction or power outage In power outages, heat systems that rely on electricity won’t operate, allowing bitterly cold temperatures to take hold inside the home. Getty Images Living without heat can increase health risks. Here are some tips for staying warm, adapted from the New York City Emergency Management Department : Take measures to trap existing warm air by hanging blankets over windows and doorways. Stay in a well-insulated room. Dress warmly. Wear hats (the body loses between half and three-quarters of its heat through the head), scarves, gloves and layered clothing. If you have a well-maintained working fireplace and use it for heat and light, be sure to keep the damper open for ventilation. Never use a fireplace without a screen. Do not use your oven or fuel-burning space heaters to heat your home. These can release carbon monoxide, a deadly gas that you cannot see or smell. (For these same reasons it is inadvisable to sleep in a running vehicle.) Use only portable heating equipment that is approved for indoor use. Space heaters should only be used for a limited time each day. Plug them directly into a wall outlet. Never use an extension cord or power strip. Keep combustible materials away from the heat source and never leave running space heaters unattended, especially around children. Make sure you have a working smoke alarm in every room. Electric blankets should only be used if they have an automatic safety shut-off and are less than 10 years old. Avoid tucking them in at the sides of the bed. In addition to the above suggestions, you should contact your utility provider to ensure they are aware of your power outage. In some instances, your provider may be able to provide an estimate of when power might be restored. In the event you have electricity but no heat, check your breaker switches. If you use propane or fuel oil, check the levels. If you can’t identify the problem, contact a repairman. Keep pets safe Pets are happiest and healthiest when kept indoors, especially during extreme cold. Amos Chapple via Getty Images Don't let pets fall victim to the cold. Follow these tips, adapted from the Humane Society, to keep animals safe and comfortable: Keep your pets inside with you and your family. Under no circumstances should pet cats be left outdoors, even if they roam outside during other seasons. If your dog is outdoors much of the day for any reason, they must be protected by a dry, draft-free shelter that is large enough to allow them to move comfortably, but small enough to hold in body heat. The floor should be raised a few inches from the ground and covered with cedar shavings or straw. The doorway should be covered with waterproof burlap or heavy plastic. Pets who spend a lot of time outdoors need more food in the winter because keeping warm depletes energy. Routinely check your pet’s water dish to make certain the water is fresh and unfrozen. Use plastic food and water bowls; when the temperature is low, your pet’s tongue can stick and freeze to metal. Windchill can threaten a pet’s life. Exposed skin on noses, ears and paw pads are at risk for frostbite and hypothermia during extreme cold snaps. For this reason, short-haired dogs often feel more comfortable wearing a sweater ― even during short walks. Dogs are at risk of salt poisoning in winter due to the rock salt used in many areas ― often when licking it from their paws after a walk. Store de-icing salt in a safe place and wipe your dog’s paws, even after short walks. If your dog ingests rock salt, call a veterinarian immediately. Be sure your horses have access to a barn or a three-sided run-in, so they can escape the wind and cold. While not all horses will need to be blanketed, blankets will help horses keep warm and dry, especially if there is any rain or snow. If you’ve body-clipped your horses, keep them blanketed throughout the winter. Also, be sure to feed your horses more forage ― unlimited amounts, if possible ― during extreme cold. This will help your horses create heat and regulate their body temperatures. The freezing start to 2018 continues According to the National Weather Service, wind chill advisories and freeze warnings have been issued from South Texas to Canada and from Montana to New England. It’s below freezing in many locations, and states of emergency have been issued in Georgia and North Carolina. An estimated 47 million people live within the affected areas. If the cold persists and you find yourself without heat or shelter, call family, neighbors or friends to see if you can stay with them. Or consider getting a room at a hotel or checking with local officials to find the closest warming shelter. Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

"The Salty Waitress on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Are you a server’s worst nightmare without even knowing it? We’re here to help. The Salty Waitress is The Takeout’s advice column from a real-life waitress that will teach you how not to behave like a garbage person while dining out—and maybe in real life. Dear Salty, As a waitress myself, I absolutely can’t stand it when customers stack their plates in an effort to “help out.” It’s mainly annoying because a) creating a giant vertical stack of plates is not how I would ever bus a table and b) it looks horrible and impatient of you. When dining with non-servers, my tablemates always try to move plates around when they’re done eating and I always tell them to leave that shit alone, and don’t dare call someone over to clean it up. What do other servers think? Do you appreciate the help or would you rather clear a table at your own pace and in your own way? Best, A Plate in the Hand is worth Two on the Table Dear Plate in the Hand, I took a long drag on my Camel Crush while reading your question. It feels good to have a fellow server just get it, right? Solidarity and all that. A couple things here: First, you’re damn right. I hate when tables try to stack their own plates and silverware, which never ends up in a way that I can actually pick up and move to the bins or kitchen. Why are there always forks hidden between the plate layers like a greasy Jenga disaster? I wish they just wouldn’t try. It is literally my job to come get your plates, so just let me do it. Some kitchens I’ve worked in have specific systems for dirty plates and silverware. So when I need to separate the forks from the glass bowls from the ceramic plates, a customer’s shitty stacking job doesn’t help me at all. And if they wedge their napkins and paper and garbage all in there, that makes for extra work, too. Worst of all, the plate tower makes it look like I’m not doing my job. Stacked plates scream “Hey, a little help over here!” when I know for a fact that table was still nibbling their fries until four seconds ago. I’m screwed either way: When I try to clear plates before they’re through, I get the I’m-not-done-yet death glare, and half a minute later, they’ve stacked the whole tower. Give me a chance, huh? I know, they’re trying to help. But please folks, just leave your plates where they are until I clear them. If you want to let me know you’re done, angle your fork and knife in towards the center of the plate like so, which I know is old-fashioned but hey, it still works. I promise I’ll get to you quickly—I know you’re dying to order pie for dessert. Got a question about dining out etiquette? Or just a general question about life we can help you with?

Charles R. Venator-Santiago,"Months after hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico, what should have been an example of how one of the most powerful nations in the world could rebuild a territory is instead an example of a man-made catastrophe now moving to the mainland. Today, about 60 percent of Puerto Rico’s population has access to reliable electric power. Access to potable water is compromised. Food and jobs are scarce, and houses are uninhabitable. More than 40 percent of schools do not have electricity. Thousands of police officers are not showing up to work, and violent crime is rampant. President Donald Trump’s inability to effectively manage the federal agencies tasked with helping U.S. citizens in need has only compounded the problems created by Congress’ historically discriminatory policies toward Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican government’s ineptitude at addressing local corruption. One of the roles of the president is managing federal agencies. If the response to this year’s hurricanes has taught us anything, it’s that the agencies charged with assisting the Puerto Ricans are underfunded, understaffed and overextended. Take, for example, the federal response to the housing problem on the island. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers collected tarps under Operation Blue Roof, but five months into the crisis, thousands of them are in storage. The USACE has fulfilled a little more than half of the requests, leaving upwards of 30,000 households without roofs. Congress should stop treating Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens and step up to finance and supervise the rebuilding of the island. But the executive branch is only part of the problem. For more than a century, Congress, with the support of the Supreme Court, has governed Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory ― that is, a territory that can be treated as a foreign country when it is convenient for the federal government. As a result, Congress has frequently authorized less funding for the development of Puerto Rico’s economy and federal assistance programs than it gives to states; it has also provided insufficient funds for infrastructure repair. Federal lawmakers, again with the support of the Supreme Court, responded to the financial crisis in Puerto Rico by passing the Promesa Act. It declared that Puerto Rico was not a commonwealth with any degree of sovereignty, but was merely a territorial possession of Congress. The legislation created a financial overview board to manage the local economy in order to guarantee that the Puerto Rican government would pay an unpayable debt. Even before two major hurricanes devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure last year, its government wasn’t able to generate sufficient revenue to pay its public debt obligations (some estimates place the debt at over $150 billion). Yet Congress, while it assumed control over Puerto Rico’s economy and while its financial oversight board sought to impose some of the failed austerity measures used in Kansas and Greece, has simultaneously refused to assume responsibility over the economic woes afflicting its territory. And just last month, while it was clear that hurricanes had devastated the Puerto Rican economy, the tax reform bill Congress passed imposed new tariffs or taxes on U.S. companies that held foreign subsidiaries in Puerto Rico. The tariffs could force companies to choose between operating in Puerto Rico and leaving the island ― and could cost the Puerto Rican economy billions of dollars in local taxes and significant job losses. What happens when a state does not have the necessary resources to absorb a traumatized migrant and provide for him and his family? Unfortunately, some local politicians have also hindered efforts to help Puerto Ricans. During the hurricanes, Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Roselló failed to activate the island’s emergency management plan, and his administration’s response was poorly coordinated. It took him 40 days to assess damages and ask for federal money for rebuilding projects. Roselló’s administration initially refused to hire the established American Public Power Association and instead granted multimillion-dollar contracts to shoestring companies like Whitefish Energy and Cobra Acquisitions to raise power lines across the island. Local media report almost every day that mayors and agencies on the island are embezzling federal relief money, and relying on partisan clientelism to provide or deny local services across the island. The governor consistently refused to provide a transparent audit of the Puerto Rican government’s finances, and is busy trying to distract resident with a dead-end campaign for statehood. Roselló proposed a fiscal plan last week that depends heavily on Congress’ commitment to give Puerto Rico more than $50 billion over the next five years. The plan operates on deficit spending and doesn’t promise to balance the government’s budget for another five years. It also doesn’t include payments to bondholders, which has been a nonstarter for the financial oversight board in the past. The board agreed to make a decision on the fiscal plan by Feb. 23. As for Puerto Rican citizens, some are now being moved to the mainland without the necessary financial support. Under current practices, the Federal Emergency Management Agency assists in bringing Puerto Ricans to the mainland, providing temporary assistance with housing and a small amount of money to help rebuild homes on the island. However, as we are experiencing in Connecticut, the state government is expected to assume responsibility for the well-being of the migrant once he or she arrives. Earlier this month, for instance, 36 families living at a Red Roof Inn in Hartford were abruptly told that they would have to leave earlier than expected after there was an error with FEMA paperwork. (The state stepped up to cover the cost of lodging at that hotel and others.) The humanitarian crisis on the island is being moved to the mainland. What happens when there is no available work, housing or medicine? What happens when a state does not have the necessary resources to absorb a traumatized migrant and provide for him and his family? Private charitable giving is not going to be enough to help Puerto Ricans. Trump should direct federal agencies to work together and with states, and have the government assume financial responsibility over the lives of these U.S. citizens. Congress should stop treating Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens and step up to finance and supervise the rebuilding of the island. Yes, the people of Puerto Rico can and should take this opportunity to conduct a referendum on their own government. But we shouldn’t expect them to take on the challenge of recovering from these terrible disasters alone. Charles R.

Cory Doctorow,"Ajit Pai is a member of the Ayn Rand/James Buchanan cult that says that any government regulation is an unfair attack on the ""freedom"" of business, which is why his ascendancy to the Chairmanship of the FCC under Donald Trump was attended by an orgy of deregulation -- most of us know about his senseless slaughter of Net Neutrality, but that was just for starters. Among the rules Ajit Pai killed was one that required telcos rebuilding after natural disasters to quickly replace ruined telcoms infrastructure with equivalent systems. The rule dates back to Hurricane Sandy's devastation of Fire Island, when Verizon tried to weasel out of rebuilding service, saying that cheaper cellular towers could replace all that downed copper. Pai said that this rule got in the way of carriers laying down fiber (in reality, the biggest impediment to fiber rollout is the ban on competition from municipal fiber networks, a competitive pressure that often spurs carriers into action). He killed it. Ajit Pai has publicly slammed the carriers for dragging their heels in rebuilding Florida's telcoms infrastructure, but thanks to the dastardly shortsightedness of his archenemy Ajit Pai, he is unable to force them to pull their socks up and get to work. Similarly, Florida Governor Rick Scott -- a fellow deregulation neofeudalist -- signed a bill in 2011 (the 'Regulatory Reform Act of 2011') which ended Florida's oversight of residential phone service, including a mandate to connect everyone in the state. Scott killed recordkeeping of citizen complaints about poor phone service, so there is no data about how badly his rule screwed over the people of Florida. Rick Scott is also publicly flaming the carriers for doing too little, too slow after Hurricane Michael, but he, like Ajit Pai, has been foiled by the cunning work of his archnemesis Florida Governor Rick Scott, who has tied his hands when it comes to forcing the carriers to get to work. ""The deregulation was so thorough that the Florida PSC is not even allowed to take consumer complaints about residential phone service, which conveniently prevents the collection of any data that might show deregulation has costs in terms of consumer welfare,"" Feld also wrote in a second, more-detailed blog post yesterday. Gov. Scott has been doing the rounds with media to keep pressure on Verizonand to make sure that Floridians know he's fighting for them. Similarly, Pai announced that he will visit the Florida Panhandle on Friday ""to assess the damage inflicted by Hurricane Michael and get an update on recovery efforts"" and said he will ""continu[e] to work to help residents and communities bounce back from this tragic storm."" ""What neither Pai nor Scott mention is their own role in creating this sorry state of affairs,"" Feld wrote. ""Their radical deregulation of the telephone industry, despite the lessons of previous natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy, guaranteed that providers would choose to cut costs and increase profits rather than invest in hardening networks or emergency preparedness."" An FCC spokesperson criticized Feld and Public Knowledge, saying they made ""cheap and false political attacks while people in the Florida Panhandle are suffering,"" according to Politico. ""Indeed, it is disgraceful that they would seek to co-opt this disaster to advocate for ideologically motivated regulations that have nothing to do with what is going on in the Florida Panhandle.

Rayne Ellis,"Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month. Since the island's long recovery began, the government and independent institutions have worked to figure out exactly how many lives were taken by the effects of the extreme storm. SEE ALSO: We may never see a hurricane season worse than the one that brought us Katrina Today, we have a new, better estimate — and it’s more than 46 times the old one. According to a new study released by George Washington University (GW), 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane. The government of Puerto Rico now accepts that number as an accurate death toll, updating their previous official estimate of 64. A group of workers repair a gravestone damaged by Hurricane Maria in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The GW group teamed up with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health to analyze death certificates and other mortality data collected from September 2017 to February 2018. They found that the number of deaths during that time were uncharacteristically high, when compared to that same time period from other years. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups – those in lower income areas and the elderly – faced the highest risk,” lead investigator Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in statement on Tuesday. In fact, the study found that in the poorest communities, the risk of dying increased 60 percent in the wake of Hurricane Maria. And the risk of dying increased 35 percent for older Puerto Rican males. This means that though the exact causes of death may be varied or unclear, in the six months after Hurricane Maria, more people died than usual. This kind of statistical analysis allows researchers to say that the hurricane left groups of people extremely vulnerable after the storm, even if the flooding rains and wind didn't explicitly kill these individuals. Broken headstones pile up in a cemetery in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images Researchers and journalists alike have long speculated that Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 64 was suspiciously low. Back in 2017, a New York Times investigation estimated that the death toll was around 1,052 — nearly 1,000 more than the original calculation. This led the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Roselló, to commission an independent study looking into the death toll in February 2018. “It is of great interest to the State to identify how many lives were lost due to the passage of Maria through the Island,"" Roselló said in a statement announcing the effort. ""It is our interest that experts can identify as accurately as possible the deaths directly and indirectly associated with the hurricane to improve protocols for future natural disasters.” In early July, researchers at Harvard released a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which estimated that an excess of 4,500 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria by surveying more than 3,000 houses. Then in late July, the Puerto Rican government quietly acknowledged that the death toll was likely much higher than 64, after releasing a 400-page document that put the toll at more than 1,400 people. The government waited for the GW study to officially update the death toll. Broken tree branches pile up as workers push to clear out cemeteries in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The newest count puts Hurricane Maria in second place as the deadliest hurricane to ever hit the United States, behind the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 which reportedly took 6,000 lives or more. Aside from the official death toll, the study also provided recommendations to Puerto Rico’s local government and the U.S. federal government to better prepare for the next deadly storm. The study suggests a more efficient way to tally deaths after disasters, a fully staffed Department of Health, better intra-department communication, and other recommendations. “The lessons learned from this report and subsequent studies will help not just Puerto Rico, but other regions in the U.S. and around the world that face the ongoing threat of hurricanes and other natural disasters,” co-author Lynn R. Goldman said. “If enacted, the recommendations of this report could help save lives in Puerto Rico and beyond.”","Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month.

Jeff Paterson,"Goaltending will be the focus when the Vancouver Canucks (25-25-7) open a three-game California road trip tonight against the struggling Anaheim Ducks (21-26-9) at Honda Center.
The Canucks will go with Jacob Markstrom in net two days after he was unable to play in Mondays game due to back spasms. Newcomer Marek Mazanec, who was acquired yesterday from the New York Rangers for a 2020 seventh round draft pick, arrived in Anaheim this morning and is slated to back up tonight. Mazanec has been recalled from on an emergency basis allowing the Canucks to keep Michael DiPietro on the roster in case Markstroms back issues flare up again.
With DiPietro making his first NHL start on Monday, the Canucks got shelled 7-2 by San Jose. Bo Horvat and Derrick Pouliot scored the Vancouver goals. Horvat has scored in back to back games and has reached the 20-goal mark for the second consecutive season. Hes just two goals shy of matching his career-high of 22 set in 64 games last season. Pouliots goal was his third of the season and the 20th by a Canuck defenseman. The group scored 21 all of last season. Mondays goal was Pouliots first since he scored here in Anaheim on November 21st.
On Tuesday, the Canucks recalled centre Adam Gaudette from Utica. Last years Hobey Baker Award winner has appeared in 32 games with the Canucks this season and has scored in 2 of his last 4 NHL games including his last game on January 10th against Arizona.
Gaudette skated with Zack MacEwen and Markus Granlund this morning. It appears hell replace Nikolay Goldobin in the Canuck line-up.
Tonight is the start of a three games in four night trek through the Golden State. The Canucks are 0-2-1 in their past three road games and 1-4-1 in their last six.
The Ducks start a new era tonight with General Manager Bob Murray behind the bench. With the team in a free fall on a seven-game losing streak and with just two victories in its past 21 (2-15-4), Randy Carlyle was relieved of his duties on Sunday. Murray has never coached in the National Hockey League but said he felt it was necessary to go behind the bench to get a sense of whats wrong with the hockey club he has built.
Anaheim fell 6-2 in Philadelphia in its last outing on Saturday in Randy Carlyles final game as head coach. Adam Henrique and Nick Ritchie scored the Ducks goals and rookie Kevin Boyle made 24 saves in relief in his NHL debut. He will make his first NHL start this evening with former Canuck Ryan Miller serving as the back-up.
The numbers are shocking. The Ducks have been outscored 37-8 on their seven-game skid and 82-34 over their past 21 since December 18th. Perhaps the most-bizarre statistic is that the 21-game tailspin came immediately on the heels of a 9-1 stretch for the Ducks from November 27th to December 17th.
Anaheim is the lowest-scoring team in the league with 124 goals 10 goals behind the Los Angeles Kings. Hardly a surprise, the Ducks are 29th in the league on the power play at 14.9% and ahead of only Montreal and Nashville. The Ducks are tied with Ottawa and New Jersey with the fewest wins in the league this season (21).
Jakob Silfverberg leads the team with 12 goals while captain Ryan Getzlaf leads the Ducks in scoring with 36 points. He is the only player on the roster with more than 30 points this season.
Perhaps no one illustrates the plight of the Ducks better than former Canuck Ryan Kesler who has 4+2=6 in 48 games this season and is currently mired in a 22-game pointless stretch dating back to an assist on December 2nd at Washington. Kesler, who is 11 games away from 1,000 in his NHL career, has not scored in his last 35 games since November 6th against LA.
Michael Del Zotto has appeared in six games for the Ducks after being acquired from the Canucks on January 17th. Between the Canucks struggles earlier in the season and Anaheims troubles of late, Del Zotto has tasted victory just once in the last 20 games hes appeared in (1-17-2) when Vancouver won in LA on November 24th.
Tonight is just the Ducks second game on The Pond since January 11th. They had a pair of five-game road trips separated by just a single home appearance against St. Louis on January 23rd. Their last home win was December 12th against Dallas. Overall, the team has two victories in the last 57 days.
The Ducks beat the Canucks 4-3 in the lone meeting between the teams so far this season. Anaheim still has to make a pair of visits to Vancouver over the final two months of the schedule.

Melanie Marquis,"OTTAWA -- After initially refusing, Netflix has agreed to remove images of the 2013 Lac-Megantic disaster from its blockbuster film, ""Bird Box.""
""Netflix and the filmmakers of 'Bird Box' have decided to replace the clip,"" a spokesman for the streaming company said in an email to The Canadian Press. ""We're sorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Megantic community.""
People in the Quebec town and across the province were shocked after learning in January that footage from the derailment and explosion that killed 47 people was used in the drama starring Sandra Bullock.
Demands that the brief scene be removed came from politicians at all levels, including Lac-Megantic Mayor Julie Morin.
Morin said she is satisfied with Netflix's decision. ""Yes, there was a delay, but I think in the end, what's more important for me, is that we have a solution to this situation we felt was important to settle,"" she said in an interview.
Quebec Culture Minister Nathalie Roy wrote to the company Jan. 18 calling for it to take out footage of the burning town. The company apologized and promised to do better, but until now it had refused to edit the film.
Three months later, Netflix has decided to change course.
Morin said the film industry needs to reconsider its use of stock footage. ""I think it's important for the industry to reflect on this,"" she said in an interview. ""It appears that has happened in this case.""
In a written statement, Roy said ""the gesture was long sought by Quebecers.""
The House of Commons adopted a motion Jan. 29 demanding Netflix remove the images and compensate the town. The NDP's Pierre Nantel introduced the motion with the support of Conservative MP Luc Berthold. Nantel said Thursday that the incident shows it is time for streaming services to be subject to ""our laws and the jurisdiction of the CRTC.""
Federal Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said he is pleased that Netflix has changed its tune.
""My heart goes out to the people of Lac-Megantic. I perfectly understand their dismay at the use of footage of the tragedy,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""The company has taken the good decision by stepping back and removing this footage from its movie.""
The Canadian Press learned that the footage will be removed from the film within the next two weeks.
Producers of the Netflix science fiction series ""Travelers,"" which used footage of the derailment to depict a nuclear attack, agreed in January to remove it from the episode in question.","Netflix says Lac-Megantic footage will be removed from 'Bird Box' movie CTV News After initially refusing, Netflix has agreed to remove images of the 2013 Lac-Megantic disaster from its blockbuster film, ""Bird Box.""

Seamus Bellamy,"I've lived in British Columbia and Nova Scotia. This is, hands down, the best story I've ever read that involves both coasts. According to The Times Colonist, 17 years ago, Nick Burchill, a naval reservist from Nova Scotia, was in Victoria, British Columbia for a work-related conference. He chose to stay at the Fairmont Empress Hotel : a high-falootin' luxury joint that's been a fixture on the city's downtown waterfront for decades. When Burchill came from the east coast, he knew that he'd be meeting with friends from the navy when time allowed for it. He brought them a gift: Chris Brothers Pepperoni sticks : a much-loved Nova Scotian delicacy. Not wanting anyone to feel left out, he brought, well, a lot. To keep the meat cool and edible until he could hand it over to his pals, Burchill cracked the window in his hotel room and laid the pepperoni out on the windowsill. He figured that the cool spring air would be enough to refrigerate the food. What happened next is the stuff of legend: From the Times Colonist : He spread the packages of pepperoni out on a table and along the window sill, then went for a leisurely four or five hour walk. “I remember walking down the long hall and opening the door to my room to find an entire flock of seagulls in my room,” Burchill wrote. “I didn’t have time to count, but there must have been 40 of them and they had been in my room, eating pepperoni for a long time.” Burchill discovered that spicy pepperoni does not agree with a seagull’s digestive system. The room was covered in guano. Burchill’s unexpected entry startled the birds. The birds, losing their shit over their being a human in the room, began to literally lose their shit, everywhere they flew in the room, spreading poop over everything. As they took to the air, the seagulls knocked over lamps, decorations and anything else that wasn't bolted down. As Burchill put it, the resulting chaos was ""...a tornado of seagull excrement, feathers, pepperoni chunks and fairly large birds whipping around the room."" Fighting his way through the flock, Burchill managed to open the rest of the windows in his suite so that the birds could escape. As one of the birds tried to re-enter the room in search of more food, Burchill threw his shoe at it. The shoe ended up on the front lawn of the hotel, narrowly missing a group of vistors. Burchill has been, understandably, banned from staying at the Empress for the past 17 years. This past week, his lifetime ban was lifted by the hotel's management after he wrote them a passionate letter explaining his part in the pepperoni-and-seagull related disaster. That Burchill included a pound of Chris Brothers pepperoni with the letter as a peace offering may have had something to do with it too.

U. K. Dey,"Real Madrid Press Conference
Whats the rumour?
Ever since Maurizio Sarris Chelsea found it difficult to win games, the sack seems to be looming over the head of the Italian coach. Amid rumours of the former Napoli man being shown the door, Zinedine Zidane popped up as one of the names to replace him.
However, according to this report from RMC Sport, Zidane is not interested in the possibility of joining the Blues.
In case you didnt know
Maurizio Sarris job started coming under scrutiny after Chelseas 4-0 loss at Bournemouth. The whispers intensified after the Blues lost 6-0 at the Etihad and things deteriorated even further after a 2-0 loss to Manchester United.
The heart of the matter
As a result, Maurizio Sarris job at Chelsea is under danger and Zinedine Zidane is being touted as one of the replacement. However, there is no chance that the Frenchman would accept a job during the middle of the season, which is why he is not giving priority to this move.
He is also not so keen to join the Premier League yet as he never played there during his playing career and doesn't know English, resulting in him being cautious.
Rumour rating: 7/10
Zinedine Zidane is perhaps the wisest man in the game right now. He left Real Madrid when he was at a peak and it completely sensible for him to not take the Chelsea job with so much going on around him. He is a man who evaluates everything very carefully before making the final decision.
Whats next?
For now, Maurizio Sarri will have to win the next two games at least if he wants to keep these stories away for the time being. Chelsea fans, too, would hope that they pick themselves up from this rut.

https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/author/dylan_berthiaume/,"The Corsica NHL betting predictions looks to bounce back from a mediocre performance on Monday. Corsica correctly predicted the under for the Pens and Flyers, the nights most valuable bet, but missed on their high-probability play. Despite there being just two games on Wednesdays slate, there is some value to be found. Ive highlighted Corsicas most probable and valuable bets below. You can find predictions for all of tonights games here. Good luck!
Highest Value
Canucks @ Ducks Moneyline | ANA (+114)
As far as Corsica is concerned, things can only get better for the Ducks now that Randy Carlyle is out of the picture. The Ducks top-nine was underperforming across the board this season, so some systematic changes could certainly help their production.  To be fair, Corsicas predictions tonight are less about believing in Anaheim and more about doubting the Canucks. At 5v5, Vancouver is averaging the second-least shot attempts and scoring chances in the NHL. They routinely struggle to maintain any sort of meaningful possession in the opponents end. This matchup projects to be more of a coinflip, and Corsica will always give the tie to the home team. Theyre giving the Ducks a 55.42% chance of winning the game outright. At +114, it is the most valuable bet on tonights slate, with the under for the Pens and Oilers finishing in a close second.
Highest Probability
Canucks @ Ducks Spread | ANA +1.5 (-235)
With only two games on the slate, Corsica is doubling down on the Ducks. Unfortunately for Corsica, John Gibson is injured and wont play tonight, but fortunately for Corsica, so is Chad Johnson. Kevin Boyle is expected to make his first career start in goal tonight.  The 26-year-old impressed in his lone NHL appearance against the Flyers on Saturday. He stopped 24 of the 26 shots he faced in relief of Johnson. He owns a career .918 SV% across three AHL seasons. Boyle adds some obvious risk to the Ducks chances tonight, but he projects to be an adequate replacement for Johnson and his .879 SV%. Corsica gives Anaheim a 77.15% chance of covering the +1.5-goal spread tonight. Not only is it the safest bet on the slate, but at -235, it offers some decent value too.",DailyFaceoff/Corsica NHL Bets (February 13th) Daily Faceoff Ed Willes: Canucks hopeful their backup plan works if Markstrom's back doesn't The Province How have the Anaheim Ducks so quickly become a disaster?

Beth Elderkin,"Theres a good movie in Robin Hood somewhere, hidden underneath that hood. Actually, I take that backnot a good movie, but a fun one. A film that coasts on Taron Egertons undeniable charisma, lets Ben Mendelsohns teeth rot from too much scenery chewing, and doesnt care about the fact that its so historically inaccurate it exists outside of time itself. I wanted so much for Robin Hood to be that movie. It is not that movie. Directed by Otto Bathurst, Robin Hood tells the well-known story of Robin of Loxley (Egerton), a legendary hero who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. I put tell in quotation marks because the only thing this version has in common with its source material is the names and time period it takes place in. That should be finein fact, I was looking forward to that! Robin Hood is a centuries-old tale thats had countless adaptations, and creators should have the freedom to make these stories their own. However, there are limits. Robin Hood stomps on those limits, steals their babies, throws the babies on the floor, pours gasoline on all them babies, and lights them on fire. By the way, gasoline exists in the Middle Ages nowas do midriff tops, wire-rimmed glasses, roulette, the entire Industrial Revolution, and my permanently bewildered expression. My mom always warned me my face would freeze like this, and alas. Here we are. Our saga begins during the Third Crusades. Yes, the film is indeed set in the Middle Ages, as much as I wanted to believe it would exist in some mythical alternate realityor perhaps a post-apocalyptic wastelandto justify every choice it makes. Robin, or Rob, is a humble lord who falls in love with a hot thief named Marian (Eve Hewson). I wont waste time talking about Marian, the movies only notable female character, because she fails every representation test there is. Shes worse than a Sexy Lamp, shes a Human Stare. All she does is look at stuff, lips partially opened, waiting to have a thought. She bought her clothes in Forever 21's Reign section. Their lives are a non-stop sex and stare montage...until the Sheriff of Nottingham (Mendelsohn) drafts Rob for service in the war. Nottingham is the main villain in this version, as Prince John doesnt exist here. This leads Robin to the Middle East, where he and his platoon of fatigues-wearing soldiers walk around an abandoned desert village, arrows permanently notched in their bows like theyre AK-47s ready to fire. I wish I was kidding. This war montage starts off silly, but then things quickly get uncomfortable. Crossbows fire like machine guns through peoples chests, Islamic prisoners of war are mocked for their faith and then brutally decapitated, and the whole thing reeks of some failing college sophomores edgy commentary on modern warfare. I bring this up for two reasons: 1) I hate it, and 2) it represents everything that doesnt work about this movie. Also, I hate it. As mentioned earlier, theres a good film inside Robin Hood...for about 40 minutes. In between Operation: Desert Crusades and a whole Antifa thing Ill get to momentarily, we get an actual Robin Hood movie. Hes robbing from the rich, fighting in great action sequences with silly archery, and making wisecracks to the camera that are so charming you cant help but love them. None of it is historically accurate, nor does it make sense, but its enjoyable to watch. Sure, hes basically Batman, but Egerton is having the time of his life playing the rich boy by day, hero by night. Jamie Foxx phones it in as John, Robins trainer and new best friend, but hes so naturally charismatic its easy to forgive. I also have to note that Foxx and Egerton have great chemistry together, to the point where it feels downright romantic. The problem with Robin Hood is everything else. The entertaining buddy action comedy about a pair of sexually confused rebel heroes clashes with the overall unpleasant tone. The film thinks its saying more than it actually is. The world Robin Hood takes place in is bleak, but not in the way that actual feudalism was bleak. This movie wants us to identify with these peoples struggles, so it all comes across as very moh-dern. The Sheriff of Nottingham is portrayed as a fascist whose pleather coat audibly creaks in every other scene. Theres representational democracy in the form of parliament lords, whom the Sheriff sucks up to for votes on tax bills (Rob represents the youth vote apparently). The Sheriff has also teamed up for general evil-doing with the Catholic Church. The church itself is so corrupt that the cardinal, played by a criminally underused F. Murray Abraham, flat-out admits the church invented hell...a jarring statement that comes out of nowhere and is never addressed. Then, there are the People. The poor, poor commoners who wander coal mines as if they strolled off the set of Les Misérables, with empty soup bowls and at least two doses of Ambien in their veins. The Hood (because Robin Hood doesnt sound hip enough) becomes their resistance symbol, as they tack actual hoods onto walls like Guy Fawkes masks. And their eventual rebellion, led by Jamie Dornan as Will Scarlet, takes visual cues from modern political movements like Antifa and Anonymous. None of it clicks. And its not because the time period Robin Hood takes place in was a monarchy, rather than a fascist republic, rendering the whole thing stupid on its face (though thats part of it). Its because Robin Hood doesnt bother figuring out what its statement actually is. Im not against reinterpreting history to make a point on contemporary culture. I celebrate that...when it works. A Knights Tale is an excellent example of a period piece cleverly integrating modern references, as its use of current music and fandom drew parallels to modern sports culture. But thats not what Robin Hood is doing. Its not reinterpreting history to make a point about the ties between absolute power and fascism. Its not smart enough to make those parallels fit. Its doing it because someone thought having guys in masks throw cannon ball Molotov cocktails at 12th century riot shields would look cool, and someone else figured that they could because, in their eyes, symbols equal commentary.

Martha Tesema,"Try naming a Zac Efron movie in which he doesn't kiss someone. I dare you. His latest film, The Greatest Showman, is no exception, and according to him, it might have been the best kiss of any film he's done so far.

Shannon Connellan,"Donald Trump could be fixing his immigration disaster right now, but instead spent part of Monday night insulting late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, and Jimmy Kimmel. And we're pretty sure they'll have something to say about it. During a rally for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, Trump railed against all three comedians, especially NBC star Fallon, who was criticized by liberals for playfully ruffling Trump's hair.

Earlier this week, he hit back at the president's ""be a man"" tweet, which came after Fallon said he regretted the pre-election interview from 2016 when he tousled Trump's hair. Here's the whole speech. Trump starts on the comedians at 1:11:07. ""Jimmy Fallon apologized for humanizing me, the poor guy. Because now he's gonna lose all of us,"" said Trump, gesturing to the people attending the rally. ""He's like, a nice guy. He's lost, he looks like a lost soul."" Trump claimed his appearance on the show in 2016 attributed to Fallon's ""monster ratings,"" and that the host ""should be thankful, he shouldn't be upset and angry."" Trump also kept flagging Late Show host Stephen Colbert, who he wouldn't actually refer to by name, you know, like Voldemort. Trump simply referred to ""the guy on CBS"" as a ""low life."" Of course, Trump fleetingly steered the ship to Jimmy Kimmel, who has been a longtime critic of the president, telling a longwinded story about a time he appeared on Kimmel's show before the election. ""Now I wouldn't do a show, the guy's terrible."" Throw in a few brags and drags about Arnold Schwarzenegger sucking on NBC's The Apprentice, and you've got one of the weirdest tangents a president has taken during a rally. Get ready.

Chloe Bryan,"There are two types of people in this world: beach lovers and beach haters. And while these two categories are mostly inflexible, it is technically possible to make a hater come around. How do I know this? Friends, I used to be a beach hater. I hated the sand, the perpetually drippy sunscreen, the seagulls stealing my Doritos. I was practically a walking Anakin Skywalker clip. But now I know the key to a good beach trip: planning. You don't need to plan a lot, either — avoiding a beach disaster requires just a little bit of foresight. SEE ALSO: If you want to stay cool this summer, don't be afraid to look corny You'll be basking in the sun and taking convincing plandids in no time. Leave for the beach very early. If you begin your journey early enough, you're likely to be one of the first people on the shore. Plus, if you're taking public transit or are not the one driving to the beach, you can doze off, stay drowsy, or enjoy a cup of (iced) coffee en route. Walk a little further and find the good part of the beach. One of the worst things about the beach? The other people at the beach. Luckily, they can often be avoided. If you begin your journey early enough, you're likely to be one of the first people on the shore. ""In my experience, a long, very hot, very sandy, lightly exhausting walk to a more remote beach is worth it purely for the bliss of setting up camp in an area that will always, always, ALWAYS be less populated than the more accessible option your fellow beach-goers will flock to,"" my wise colleague Laura Vitto says. She's right: a slightly annoying walk early on is worth a full day of peace. Don't rely on the snack bar. Beachside snack bars are universally overpriced and almost universally bad. Instead, bring your own snacks. Here is a nice selection of ideas courtesy of Martha Stewart, whom I trust with my life. Also, bring canned wine! That way, no one has to be responsible for those wine bottles. Bring a water bottle. Everyone and their self-care bot are always talking about hydration, and for good reason. Fill up a reusable water bottle before you leave, then refill it at every possible opportunity. Carrying a heavy bottle is annoying, sure, but you know what's more annoying? Passing out in the sand. human friend! you must drink hydration. — hydration time!! (@hydratebot) July 12, 2018 Pack two towels. One towel for lounging and one towel for drying off. You need two! (One can be a beach blanket, of course; I am just advocating for the basic double-towel concept.) Accept that you will get sand in your body crevices. This cannot be avoided. Do not try to stave it off. You will rinse it off later in the shower and it will all be OK. Invite a friend who owns a Bluetooth speaker. Beach tunes are a must, and to have beach tunes, you must have a speaker. Just make sure your friend with the speaker is a friend you would invite even if they did not have the speaker. Beach season is no time for dishonesty. Alternatively, you could buy a Bluetooth speaker. Make sure your beach playlist is good. Here! I made you one. Do not screw around with your phone. If you leave your phone out while you're at the beach, it will get wet. Or it will get stolen. Or it will get sand in the crevice between the case and the phone, which is nearly impossible to remove. The solution is to take your phone out one time during your beach trip — to capture the one beach Instagram you will post when you get home. Choose carefully! Beware the accidental beach nap. The ABN might seem like an innocent practice (what could be wrong with an impromptu snooze?) but it has the potential to absolutely ruin your already risky outing. Why? If you fall asleep for too long, you could end up with a highly painful, uneven sunburn. Wear your damn SPF. There is nothing more important than sunscreen. To convince you, a cautionary tale: Several years ago, I went to the beach with some friends, one of whom did not apply sunscreen to his back because he was ""too proud to ask for help."" He later fell prey to an ABN, got sun poisoning, and did not speak for the rest of the day. RIP, man. (Just kidding; he is now fine. Still wear sunscreen, though.)

Jack Morse,"When you're a shady organization railing against regulation and advocating for a blockchain-based society, it pays to have friends in strange places. Decenturion, the latest head-scratcher to emerge out of the blockchain fever dream, appears to have found just such a friend in the form of a yacht-partying former Congressman Dennis Kucinich. SEE ALSO: This 'blockchain-based state' is the disaster love child of Ayn Rand's ghost and pain The mysterious group, which didn't answer a host of emailed questions regarding its financial backing, claims to be in the process of opening physical embassies around the world with the goal of ""being acknowledged with the status of an independent state of a new society."" But wait, there's more. Decenturion's manifesto speaks of casting aside the ""inhibitors"" (aka government officials) in favor of ""the innovators, who dare to follow the path of progress,"" and its numerous bizarro Youtube videos railing against representative democracy and the Olympics (""a rigged farce put on by the chemical industry"") come across as a mix between a marketing student's prank and a QAnon wet dream. So to celebrate the wacko confluence of new money and aggrandized self-importance the crypto-boom has made possible, on June 4, Decenturion threw a yacht party on what it dubbed a ""floating embassy"" located at Pier 40 in New York, City. Thankfully for us, Decenturion posted photos from the event to its Facebook page. ""There's no earthly way of knowing / Which direction we are going."" Image: decenturion facebook page And yeah, those photos show that for some reason former Congressman and 2008 Democratic party presidential nominee hopeful Dennis Kucinich showed up with his wife Elizabeth. All smiles. Image: decenturion facebook page It's not exactly clear what they were doing there. We reached out to both Decenturion and Mr. Kucinich regarding his involvement but received no response as of press time. But it's not like he just accidentally stumbled in on a cult party while in search of free champagne. The event invite makes pretty clear what's going on. ""The [Blockchain for Impact] Global Summit at the UN will be followed by a special evening event,"" read the invitation. ""BFI members and invited guests will gather at the floating embassy of DECENTURION, the first decentralized autonomous society. DECENTURION is the world’s only decentralized state, in which the economy, governance, and communications are built on blockchain technology and where all resources such as money, power, and glory belong to its residents."" And attendees checked in at a table adjacent to a huge Decenturion sign declaring ""enough with taxes!"" The decentralized future starts with a registration line. Image: decenturion facebook page But maybe, just maybe, Kucinich knows something that we non-blockchain based suckers don't. It's possible that he sees which way the pre-nuclear winds are blowing and is planning his escape now. For his sake, we just hope he's brushed up on the current state of Ayn Rand fan-fiction.

Adam Rosenberg,"For every unmitigated disaster like Solo, there are multiple other box office hits for Disney. Incredibles 2 is the latest. The 14-years-later sequel is on a pace to finish off its opening weekend with a $180 million box office haul in the United States. That's the highest opening to date for any animated release, and for any PG-rated release as well. It's also the eighth-largest domestic opening weekend ever, overall. SEE ALSO: How 'Incredibles 2' carves out its own space in a superhero-saturated world Incredibles 2 soars past another Pixar sequel, Finding Dory, the previous top animated opener. The Finding Nemo sequel launched in 2016 on the same June weekend as Incredibles 2, but it only (only!) managed to pull in $135.1 million in its first three days. The new $180 million bar will be a tough one for future competitors to beat, though even that record is bound to eventually fall. Inflation and rising ticket prices all but ensure it. Disney currently has three recent releases in the weekend box office top 10. Solo: A Star Wars Story comes in at #4 on this weekend's chart, with an estimated $9.1 million. That brings its domestic total up to $192.8 million. Solo will probably cross $200 million domestic in the next week or two, but it's currently the lowest-earning live action Star Wars movie to date. There's even some question at this point as to whether or not it will manage to beat The Empire Strikes Back. Not accounting for inflation, that second-ever Star Wars movie ended its box office run in 1980 with $209.4 million. Disney's lowest entrant on this weekend's box office top 10 is Avengers: Infinity War, at #8. The April 2018 release is still kicking in its eight week after hitting theaters. It picked up an estimated $5.3 million this weekend, bring the movie's domestic box office total to $664.2 million. While not quite the biggest domestic hit of 2018 — that honor goes to Black Panther, which earned $699.6 million in the U.S. — Infinity War has had a monster run. It's the top box office winner of 2018 on the global stage, with more than $2 billion earned to date. Disney also isn't quite done with trying to commandeer the summer 2018 box office.

ANNIE KARNI,"But the official, who refused to be identified according to the ground rules of the briefing, framed the speech as an opportunity to change the tone of the current political debate.
Together we can break decades of political stalemate, Mr. Trump is expected to say, according to an excerpt from the speech shared by the official. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of Americas future. The decision is ours to make.
The overarching theme of the speech, the official said, will be Choosing Greatness, and it will focus on issues where there is a possibility of bipartisan consensus: infrastructure, lowering health care and prescription drug costs, protecting American workers affected by what he described as decades of flawed trade deals and safeguarding national security.
The president will also call on Congress to replace what he described as the Nafta disaster with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and discuss the trading relationship with China.
In his first State of the Union address last year, Mr. Trump also sought to strike a unifying tone that was a contrast to the political attacks and divisive messaging that he is better known for.

DAVID SEGAL,"It turns out that to grasp how this showdown entered the realm of national mythology in Norway, you can’t just watch the ending. The tape must first be rolled back roughly 20 minutes. In the third leg of the relay, the man racing for Norway, Pal Gunnar Mikkelsplass, inexplicably fell while skiing all alone on a downhill portion of the course. He wound up briefly in an undignified heap. Mikkelsplass would later receive death threats that were taken seriously enough to merit a police escort for the Norwegian team out of the arena. More immediately, the disaster left Bra with a roughly 15-second deficit when it was finally his turn to race. In other words, once you see the contest in its totality, this is a comeback story. Now roll the tape back a full decade. In the years before 1982, Bra distinguished himself as one of Norway’s greatest skiers, winning more than a dozen national titles starting in his early 20s. In a sport known for its slow and steady pace, Bra was a born sprinter who would once beat the English soccer player Kevin Keegan in a televised foot race. Bra also had a freakishly high tolerance for pain and could race in an agony that produced a recurring visual hallucination. “I see this gray fog,” he said in the interview. “Especially during 50-kilometer races. The point is not to just keep going. The point is to enjoy it.” Bra seemed destined for an epic career, but his promise was matched only by his terrible fortune. In the ‘70s, at both the Olympics and world championships, he caught the flu, or he chose a catastrophically wrong set of skis or wax. Gradually, he began to seem cursed, a great talent thwarted by the stars. Norwegians never abandoned hope. That’s because Bra seems reverse-engineered to be irresistible to them.

ALAN RAPPEPORT and THOMAS KAPLAN,"Mr. Mnuchin’s request to raise the debt limit stems from the simple fact that federal spending is far outpacing revenue. The Treasury must borrow money from private investors but needs congressional approval to go above the $ 20.5 trillion debt limit that caps the United States debt load. Fiscal hawks warn that mounting federal debt will ultimately slow economic growth, but Washington shows no signs of paying heed. Congress is poised to dole out billions of dollars for a host of different priorities, and the spending spree is being embraced across party lines. Mr. Trump and Republicans are pushing for a big increase in military spending, warning that the nation’s security is at stake. The president wants $25 billion for border security, including his promised wall on the border with Mexico. Mr. Mnuchin also said on Tuesday that infrastructure would be an administration priority this year. Mr. Trump has suggested that rebuilding roads and bridges is something that could garner bipartisan support, and White House has signaled that it will seek $200 billion from Congress to jump-start an infrastructure investment program. On top of that spending, the party is still celebrating its sweeping overhaul of the tax code, casting aside expectations of how it will impact the national debt. After loudly bemoaning that the tax overhaul would swell the national debt, Democrats are pressing to secure a sizable boost in spending on domestic programs, including billions of dollars to address the opioid crisis. And lawmakers from both parties are looking to approve at least about $80 billion in additional aid in response to last year’s hurricanes and wildfires. “The deep dark secret is Republicans like to spend money just as much as Democrats,” said Representative Jim Costa, Democrat of California and a co-chairman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition. “They just want to spend it on something different.” Just last week, lawmakers approved a stopgap spending bill to end a government shutdown and keep agencies funded until Feb. 8 while also extending funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years. But the fine print of the bill also suspended or delayed a handful of taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act, which will cost the government $31 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The deficit is now projected to reach $1 trillion in the 2019 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group. That could grow even larger if, as expected, congressional leaders from both parties can reach an agreement to raise strict caps on military and domestic spending that were imposed in 2011. Republicans are pushing for a big increase to the cap on military spending, while Democrats are insisting on an equal increase in nonmilitary spending. All told, lawmakers could reach a two-year agreement to raise the spending caps by more than $200 billion over that period. For Democrats, the firm posture in spending talks does not perfectly harmonize with their outcry during the battle over the Republican tax overhaul. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, recalled that just recently, during the fight over taxes, Democrats were “absolutely outraged at what potential deficit impact there might be.” “And then we immediately get into a tens and hundreds of billion dollars of discussion about how we now raise the spending caps,” Mr. Blunt said. “So I think there’s plenty of inconsistency.” With the tax overhaul now law and with lawmakers pushing to increase spending, fiscal watchdogs have been left reeling. “Even just to keep the government open for a few weeks, for some reason it was necessary to add to our debt,” said Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which advocates reining in federal budget deficits. The tax overhaul approved in December “clearly dug the hole deeper,” Mr. Peterson said. The bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, or about $1.1 trillion if the effects of economic growth and interest rates are taken into account, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Mr. Mnuchin dismissed that idea on Tuesday, reiterating his position that if economic growth can be sustained at an annual rate of 3 percent, the tax cuts will pay for themselves. (Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, expects growth in the first three months of 2018 to fall to 2.3 percent.) While Democrats tried to draw attention to how the tax cuts would worsen the government’s finances, few Republicans expressed similar concerns. One who did, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, vowed to oppose the tax rewrite if it added “one penny” to the deficit, but even he ended up voting for it. At the hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Corker praised the tax bill for bringing better results than he expected, noting that the International Monetary Fund had raised its global economic growth projections in response to the tax cuts. “It seems to be having an impact far beyond what we thought it would have just on our own country,” Mr. Corker said. In conversations about the deficit, Republican lawmakers are quick to talk about the need to rein in the cost of entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, which make up a big portion of federal spending. But there is little expectation that Congress will take any significant action in those areas any time soon. “This is out of control,” complained Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, as he lamented that lawmakers were set to approve disaster aid without finding a way to pay for it. “Every dime that we’re talking about for disaster relief is borrowed,” Mr. Perdue said. “We have to go to China and borrow that money to give disaster relief to farmers in Texas and people in Florida.” At the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump has been focused on initiatives that will spur economic growth as a way of generating additional revenue for the government. “His first priority was to create economic growth,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “That’s the single most important thing that will create revenues.” Some Republicans are not so sure. “At some point we’re going to have to change the name of the Department of Treasury to the Department of Debt, because there’s not going to be any treasury left,” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. “It would seem to me that we need to have an adult discussion at some point about how we’re going to get control of that.” Continue reading the main story",Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress to lift the debt ceiling as lawmakers embark on a spending spree.,2018-01-31T03:46:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","As Deficit Soars Toward $1 Trillion, Congress Shrugs and Keeps Spending",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/politics/federal-deficit-1-trillion.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/31/us/politics/31dc-deficit-1/31dc-deficit-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
STEPHEN CASTLE and STEVEN ERLANGER,"But the prime ministers angry denunciation of lawmakers in a national address Wednesday evening is unlikely to make it any easier to win over opposition legislators.
The Europeans do not want to be seen as responsible for the disaster of a no-deal exit. Not only would this hurt their economies, but it could leave a bitter legacy with a big and important neighbor while complicating the blocs finances.
Mrs. May, though, has been hinting that she might prefer a no-deal Brexit, even if that outcome was opposed overwhelmingly in Parliament.
She has always jealously guarded the interests of the Conservative Party, and she would reasonably fear that calling for a lengthy extension could split the party irrevocably.
Britain has the power to withdraw its decision to leave the bloc as opposed to requesting an extension of negotiations and could do that unilaterally. Yet it is almost impossible to imagine Mrs. May doing this, since she has vowed to deliver Brexit one way or another.
That has prompted speculation that, if Mrs. May loses again next week, she could face a leadership crisis, particularly if she tries to pursue a no-deal Brexit. But it would be hard to force her out, even if more pro-European cabinet ministers threatened to quit.

DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD,"Iran first succeeded in putting a small satellite into orbit in 2009, just as it was ramping up its nuclear program. It did so again in 2011, 2012 and 2015. Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who publishes Jonathans Space Report and specializes in orbital monitoring, recently noted that those four launches were the only clear successes out of a dozen.
At least once, an Iranian rocket exploded on the launchpad, leaving damage so extensive that satellites passing overhead could make out blast scars, burned wreckage and a blackened rocket transporter. Iranian officials kept silent on that disaster, in 2012.
So far, Iran has failed to successfully test the newest generation of its satellite launcher a bigger, more powerful rocket known as Simorgh or Phoenix. The vehicle, roughly nine stories tall, debuted in April 2016. Iran wrapped the test flight in secrecy, and sky monitors know for sure only that no satellite went into orbit.
In July 2017, another Simorgh roared off a launchpad at the Imam Khomeini Space Center, a complex east of Tehran named for the nations first supreme leader. Iran called it a success. But once again, no satellite was seen. Reports said Washington concluded there was a catastrophic failure.
In January, Mr. Pompeo warned Iran against launching a Simorgh that spy satellites had detected was in preparation. After it lifted off, on Jan. 15, Iranian officials declared it suffered what they called a third-stage failure.",The covert attacks on aerospace supply chains are meant to cripple Iran’s missile fleets.

Shannon Connellan,"Grant Margolin, the chief marketing officer of the colossal disaster that was Fyre Festival, seemed to drop off the face of the Earth after the event. 
The festival's founder and CEO, Billy McFarland, is serving six years in prison for defrauding over 100 investors out of $27.4 million. But Margolin, who is portrayed in both recent Fyre Festival documentaries as McFarland's right-hand man, settled out of court and has kept a low profile. 
All the documentaries managed to say about what he does now is that he volunteers as an EMT. 
But now it seems Margolin has been found selling his services in New York City as a tutor, specializing in business and marketing, for $90 an hour. But we'll get back to that. 
To recap: Fyre Festival became notorious as ""the greatest party that never happened"" a multi-million dollar swindle that left investors with empty pockets. Tickets were sold for anywhere between $450 and $12,000. Attendees, promised the experience of a lifetime with major music acts and social media influencers, found themselves stranded at a construction site in the Bahamas. Local contractors and vendors went unpaid. 
In July 2018, Margolin faced fraud-related charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alongside McFarland, independent contractor Daniel Simon, Fyre Media, and McFarland's shady credit card company, Magnises. Margolin was also Magnises' vice president of marketing and branding. 
Without admitting to or denying the charges, Margolin agreed to a settlement offered by the SEC, which involved a $35,000 fine and a seven-year ban on being a corporate officer or director. Compared to McFarland's sentence, it seemed a slap on the wrist.

The lawsuits aren't done for Margolin, though, with a class action lawsuit filed by festival-goers against the organisers (including Fyre Festival co-founder Ja Rule), and another class action suit against Margolin only, accusing him of deleting social media comments criticising the festival.
And then? We can't say for certain, but someone who bears a striking resemblance to Margolin was offering their services on the the tutoring website Wyzant. The profile has recently been deleted, but the Margolin doppelganger was offering services as ""experienced tutor"" with a ""business background,"" available to anyone within 25 miles of Manhattan.

Charging $90 per hour and supposedly located in New York's Upper East Side although the zip code he lists is actually the Upper West Side, ahem) ""Grant M."" is offering tutoring in business, career development, marketing, public speaking, and project management. 
Mashable reached out to Wyzant and Grant M. for comment through the platform. Grant's profile promised a response time of 23 minutes. That was not true in our case. The Wyzant account Mashable created was closed by the site after our request for comment was made. And Grant M.'s tutoring page was eventually taken down. 
Two words you won't read here: Fyre Festival
Margolin's alma mater, Syracuse University, is listed. And ""Grant M.,"" who uses a picture of Margolin for his profile, says that he volunteers as an EMT and firefighter in his spare time, when he isn't playing music or exploring ""the food &amp; culture scene in New York City.""
""I am a marketer and brand strategist, consulting with clients across multiple industries to solve marketing and strategic business challenges,"" the profile reads. Two words you won't read here: Fyre Festival. 
To be approved as a tutor on Wyzant, you do not have to pass a background check but you can pay $15.99 for one. ""Wyzant does not require tutors on its website to have a background check conducted on themselves,"" reads the site's FAQ section.
Nonetheless, Grant M.'s profile says he passed
 a background check on March 23, 2018. The SEC complaint against Margolin was filed April 24, 2018. Wyzant's checks include a criminal background check (felony and misdemeanor convictions within the past seven years) and Social Security number trace. 
There are seven ratings from students who have seemingly been tutored by Grant M., all of whom have left glowing remarks. None have dates attached, and all gave him five stars.
Grant M. has some glowing tutor reviews.
Image: wyzant/mashable screenshot
""Grant was of great help, in my school project. Patient, direct and with a comprehensive view, he guided me in all the spots where I was having trouble and stimulated the areas where I felt comfortable,"" said a user going by ""Fabio,"" who is listed as having completed five lessons.
""I appreciated how direct Grant was in helping me prepare for an interview. He asked me questions that would be similar to what they may ask in an interview setting. He is very up to date on current marketing information and provided insight on modern marketing in todays digital world,"" said another review, this one from Rebecca, a user who has completed one lesson.
Whether these students are in fact relying on one of the key decision makers behind one of the biggest scams of the decade remains to be seen. But if it has let Margolin slip through the cracks without alerting its users, Wyzant might need to think twice about its background check system.

De Niro, who has previously said he would like to punch the president, received a standing ovation for his two-word attack at the Tony Awards. But in a tweet, Mr Trump described the actor as ""a very Low IQ individual"". ""I watched him... and truly believe he may be 'punch-drunk',"" he said.

(Deleted account),"At first glance, Apple canceling AirPower seems like a huge fail. But its nothing compared to another recent hardware disaster. 
The company announced its cool new wireless charger, Apples first, in 2017. It was supposed to charge multiple devices (iPhones, AirPods, Apple Watches, etc.) simultaneously something other wireless chargers currently cant do.

Thats an embarrassment.
With AirPower, Apple says it couldnt build a high quality product, so instead of releasing a subpar device that would possibly be prone to issues, it didnt. That sounds like a reasonable and responsible move. In addition, the company broke the news itself, controlling how it wanted the information to come out.
SEE ALSO: Let's face it, AirPower looked lame as hell anyway
With the butterfly keyboard, however, Apple has committed to making this defective product the default keyboard on its MacBook Pro line of computers. Unlike AirPower, Apple actually sells this product to customers.
Unlike AirPower, Apple actually sells this product to customers.
Keys constantly get stuck and fail, debris is more difficult to blow out, and unlike every other keyboard, its impossible to replace because it's attached to other laptop components such as the battery. The company has been hit with a class action lawsuit
 over it.
The butterfly keyboards are one of the main reasons I chose to go with a 2015 MacBook Pro
, the last of Apples laptops with the old style keyboard, as my personal computer just last year.
Apple has tried to fix the keyboard problem plaguing customers who purchased its near $2,000 flagship laptops. Now, in its third generation, Apples butterfly keyboard is still rife with issues
. Thats embarrassing. 
Perhaps Apple has a bit of egg on its face for announcing a product before it was ready. Maybe the company should feel a little foolish for shipping products released just this week in packaging still touting AirPower.

Rob Beschizza,"Several years ago media sites began firing writers en-masse to hire video people instead, because Facebook and other social media companies told them that this was the future. "" Pivoting to video,"" some called it. But what Facebook actually delivered was ""fraudulent"" analytics. Advertisers slowly figured out the view counts were fake and that the videos weren't being watched. Facebook lied about it for a while. Then it apparently admitted it. Then the media sites started firing the video people too. Here's an excerpt from a lawsuit unsealed yesterday, posted to Twitter by Jason Kint, the CEO of an online publishers' trade group. 63. In June 2016, a Facebook engineering manager finally followed up on advertiser complaints dating back to early 2015, writing that ""[s]omehow there was no progress on the task for a year."" But even once it was decided to take action on the metrics, Facebook did not promptly fix its calculation or disclose that the calculation was wrong. Instead, it continued reporting miscalculated viewership metrics for another several months, as it developed a ""no PR"" strategy to avoid drawing attention to the error. The company decided to ""obfuscate the fact that we screwed up the math"" by quietly retiring the erroneous metrics and replacing them with corrected metrics under a new name. For instance, Average Duration of Video Viewed would be replaced with Average Watch Time. 64. In August 2016, Facebook began reaching out privately to select, large advertisers, telling them that Facebook had ""recently discovered a discrepancy"" in the video ad average view metrics. Facebook pushed that message even as personnel internally emphasized that ""we didn't recently discover a discrepancy."" (emphasis added). Aspects of the underlying problem were reported as long ago as 2016, but now we're finding out the gory details of how Facebook tricked publishers into upending their content models and how it screwed advertisers. Suzanne Vranica in the WSJ: A group of small advertisers filed a lawsuit in California federal court in 2016, alleging the tech giant engaged in unfair business conduct by disseminating inaccurate metrics that significantly overestimated the amount of time users were spending watching video ads. The plaintiffs later added a fraud claim, and in Tuesdays court filing they alleged Facebook knew of irregularities in its video metrics by January 2015 and understood the nature of the miscalculation within a few months, but failed to disclose the information for over a year. The filing followed the plaintiffs review of some 80,000 pages of internal Facebook records that they obtained as part of court proceedings. The complaint, which cites the internal Facebook documents, also alleges that the scale of the miscalculation was far worse than understood. Facebooks internal efforts behind the scenes reflect a company mentality of reckless indifference toward the accuracy of its metrics, the plaintiffs said in Tuesdays filing. The good news: Facebook downgrades the number of accounts hit in the breach they disclosed two weeks ago to 29 million, down from 50 million. The bad news: Uh, that’s still a LOT. And if you were one of those 29 million Facebook users, A LOT of your intimate personal data was stolen.

While the option of a second referendum on Brexit was once seen as highly unlikely, there's now a semblance of hope for those backing the vote. Prime Minister May has bungled the process and is faced with a variety of dubious options, including a yet-again delayed exit or even a no-deal Brexit that would have serious ramifications.
Dubbed ""Put It To The People,"" Saturday's march saw around a million people participate, organizers said. The event also included a rally in front of Parliament. London Mayor Sadiq Khan was among those marching and he was scheduled to speak at the post-march rally. 
The swarm of people in London was in direct contrast to the much smaller ""March to Leave,"" a two-week trek of pro-leave protesters led by Nigel Farage, walking from Sunderland with the aim of arriving in London on Friday, March 29, the originally planned Brexit date. 
In London, though, the streets were flooded with protesters holding quippy signs and marching in costume, all part of the growing movement to demand a new vote over leaving the EU. 
Even superheroes backed the second vote protest.

The movement to remain in the EU got a big boost in visibility earlier in the week when an online petition calling for revoking Article 50, the law that outlines how countries can exit the EU, gained so many signatures (now at 4.4 million) that it crashed the government's petition website. 
Organizers pegged the crowd at just over a million participants.

Even dogs joined the march.

To say the Brexit process has been a disaster is putting it mildly, as can be seen by the fact that Prime Minister May is the target of both aforementioned protests that take opposing sides. It's reflective of the infighting that's taken place in Parliament, leaving that body of government in a deadlock with no plan in place for an exit. 
Despite Saturday's enormous protest, odds of a second referendum are still long thanks to the hurdles that need to be cleared including approval from that deadlocked Parliament, a decision on what, exactly, the referendum would be a vote on, and negotiating a timetable on the vote. 
Madness is an understatement when it comes to the Brexit mess

For now, it's a wait-and-see situation for everyone. The EU has given May until April 12 to get a deal passed by Parliament. 
The protesters were not kind to May.

Failure to get a deal done will mean either a no-deal Brexit or May will have to propose yet another alternative before that deadline. And, with that, yet another journey into the unknown for the UK.","As the tire fire that is Theresa May's handling of Brexit continues to burn, a crowd pegged at around a million people flooded the streets of London on Saturday, protesting the disastrous policy and calling on a new referendum.

Heather Alexandra,"This weekend, I sat down to play Sea of Thieves. As I sailed on my lonesome, passing time until my friends could log on, I returned to port and ran into another group of players. This type of encounter usually leads to disaster, but I was instead treated to a surprise: I had come face to face with a Pirate Legend. When the other ship first came into port, I was surprised by how decorated it was. The hull was painted a deep shade of purple and trimmed with hints of gold, while the main sail bore a large skull. It was clear I was dealing with an experienced crew and as I leapt from my tiny ship to theirs, I hopped up and down to communicate peaceful intent. They seemed to consider me, as you consider a dog pawing at your shins, before deciding that I wasn’t a threat. That’s when I realized that one of the players was a Pirate Legend. His name was Ghaanja and he was the most impressive pirate I’d ever seen. Daily thoughts from a Kotaku staffer about a game we’re playing. Becoming a Pirate Legend in Sea of Thieves is a lengthy process that requires achieving max reputation with all three of the game’s main factions. The first player to become Pirate Legend was a streamer named Prod1gyX, whose viewers helped him out by gathering treasure for him. It sparked a controversy within the community about if his title was legitimate or not. Here before me was another Pirate Legend, a player so tenacious—or perhaps simply so bored—that they grinded hundreds of voyages to achieve the title. They wore a gold-trimmed outfit, colorful as their ship and suddenly, I felt very shabby. My Sovereign clothing set is among the most ostentatious in the game but I was nothing compared to the Pirate Legend. It felt like I was standing next to a kind of celebrity. Pirate Legends are able to access a special underground location called the Tavern of Legends by playing a special sea shanty in any of the game’s various taverns. Curious, I asked this Pirate Legend if I could see that hidden location. To my surprise, they agreed. We rushed off to the tavern and they played the song. A magical glow covered the floor, revealing a hidden stairwell. I followed it down into an underwater tunnel leading to the Tavern of Legends but could not enter. A strange portal blocked my way. When I tried to return to the surface, I was dropped into a random island far from port. The Pirate Legend was nowhere to be found. Getting the Pirate Legend to play the special sea shanty and open up a portal to the Tavern of Legends feels a bit like getting a digital autograph. I’d mention this to my game-playing friends the same way I might bring up the fact I have Magic Johnson’s autograph or a tube of ping pong balls signed by the cast of Beerfest. You can’t really do much with an autograph besides trot it around from time to time.","This weekend, I sat down to play Sea of Thieves.

Ron Gibori,"The life of an entrepreneur sounds glamorous when you're on the outside looking in. Setting your own schedule, creating your own rules, and building the type of company you want to work for can be incredibly alluring. In the 20 years I've been an entrepreneur, the perception of entrepreneurship has shifted 180 degrees. When I graduated college, everyone wanted to work for a big corporation -- that was the definition of success. Now it seems that the opposite is true. Everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. However, far from a way of life, entrepreneurship -- with or without success -- is a ticket to a perpetual roller coaster ride that can be nauseating most of the time. The truth from within the trenches of being a serial entrepreneur is a bit darker than in the glow personified in publications such as Inc. or Fast Company. You should think carefully if you're considering entrepreneurship, which might mean you'll never work 9 to 5 again, instead your typical workday becomes more like 16 hours, all hours of the day and night, 7 days a week. And for what? A chance to own 1 out of the 10 startups that actually do succeed. Cold statistics like these are not intended to discourage entrepreneurs, but to encourage them to understand the realities and sacrifices you have to be willing to make to become entrepreneurs. In fact, successful entrepreneurs tend to be idolized by the masses because they appear to be happier, more successful, and more driven than anyone else. There are a multitude of books, courses, and companies devoted entirely to selling the dream of business ownership. Yet, there's a hidden dark side to being an entrepreneur that's rarely discussed -- the lifestyle can be a setup for a variety of serious issues. I can tell you from personal experience that entrepreneurship -- starting your own company -- is hard and emotionally draining. I started a few companies in my career, and each one is as difficult as the last. It's difficult because partners, employees, and investors are investing in you, not your company. So the better you can handle a 5 - 9 workday, and 80-hour workweeks, the better your company will perform. So before you get too excited about becoming an entrepreneur, reevaluate your expectations and consider these facts: 1. Starting a business is never as easy or as fast as you believe it will be. Young entrepreneurs who think to own your business leads to profits, needs a financial eye-opener. The truth is, I've spent more more than I generate in revenue, and as a result, I haven't received a paycheck for several years. I've had to rely on my savings or reserves for basic living expenses with the hope that things will pan out in the future. Even the things you can predict won't happen exactly how you envisioned. As an entrepreneur, you'll be forced to adapt, sometimes in ways, you don't want to adapt. Nothing will happen the way you think it will. 2. It's been said that ""Every great achievement requires great sacrifices."" Those sacrifices usually means your personal life will suffer. And let me tell you from experience: whatever you value in your life you will have to sacrifice in some measure to be successful. I definitely worked at least 40 percent more than a typical 9-5 corporate job. Even when I wasn't working I couldn't help but be distracted constantly, thinking about the problems my business was facing, and the financial stress I was asked t bear took its toll on my relationships. 3. The divide between what you want to do and what you have to do. As an entrepreneur, I've had to juggle many balls. I got do some of the work I love to do, but also ended up doing more work I never wanted. I was an administrator, a supervisor, an accountant, an HR manager, and a marketer all at the same time. It was exhausting. No matter how excited I was to take on these responsibilities at the beginning of the week, this constant gear shifting always inevitably wore me down -- It will take its toll on you. 4. Failure is not an option, it's a certainty Every successful entrepreneur fails fast, learns fast, and fixes fast. If they don't, there will be some other failure, massive or minor, that will interfere with your plans and compromise your vision. Failure is an inevitable, and essential, part of entrepreneurship, though realizing this rarely makes it easier to accept. The obstacle of failure is ever present and always daunting when you're leading a business, and working through that failure is too much for some. The ability to recover from failure is what separates successes from the rest. Not everyone can start a business -- And not everyone should. No one wants to crush anyone's dreams, but that's not what this is about. Not everyone has what it takes and not everyone wants to do what it takes to start, launch, and scale a company of their own. The word 'entrepreneur' has become too trendy and the meaning lost in pop-cultures glamours personification.","These 4 Lessons Will Save You From Entrepreneurial Disaster.

Rachel Waldholz,"During a storm, the Alaskan village of Newtok can lose 10 to 20 feet of tundra. Erosion is getting worse because of warming temperatures and record low sea ice. Rachel Waldholz/Alaska's Energy Desk Record low sea ice this fall, and near record warm temperatures, are bad news for villages along Alaska's coast. Winter ice used to serve as a buffer, protecting the shoreline during the region's strong fall storms. Now, it's forming later in the year, leaving communities exposed. Nowhere is that more evident than in Newtok, which sits on a river not far from the Bering Sea. The later freeze-up has allowed the river to eat away at the village's thawing permafrost. During a storm, blocks of tundra the size of a minivan slump into the water and disappear. Andrew John, Newtok's tribal administrator, is standing on the bank of the Ninglick River, taking stock after a short trip away. ""I took some measurements and oh my goodness!"" John says. ""I don't recognize any of this."" Erosion has always been a problem here. But it's getting worse as Alaska warms faster than the rest of the U.S. John estimates that, just this season, the river has torn off 40 feet of tundra. The nearest homes? They're less than 40 feet away. Katie Ayuluk lives in one of them, and she says the storms feel closer and closer. Three generations live in the three-room house where Ayuluk grew up. As she serves baked salmon and duck for dinner, Ayuluk, 24, says when she was little, the river was so far away you could barely see it. Now, she and her husband Dalen say it feels like the storms are at their doorstep. Noah ""Robert"" Waska (left), Dalen Ayuluk, Andrew John and Jason John stand above the rock quarry at Mertarvik, the site where Newtok residents hope to relocate their entire village. Rachel Waldholz/Alaska's Energy Desk ""You're looking at huge swells during a storm,"" Dalen says. ""And when those swells hit the side of the land, you'll see water shoot up."" ""Even up to this day,"" Katie says, ""it surprises me there's big waves, even though I've seen it every day of my life. So every day I'm scared."" ""I need to move,"" she adds quietly. ""I want to move."" People here want to move, but not to a distant city like Anchorage, some 500 miles from here. Connection To Culture And Language Life in Newtok is distinct. Nearly all of the village's 400 or so residents are Alaska Native. Families depend on hunting and fishing. Stop by the school, and you can hear the pledge of allegiance in the local language, Yup'ik. People here worry if they're forced to scatter, they'll lose that tight connection to language and culture. So in 2003, Newtok negotiated a land swap with the federal government, hoping to relocate the entire village together. The new site is a bumpy half-hour boat ride up river into a brutal wind. ""We're going to heaven!"" Andrew John shouts over the sound of the motor. ""That's what it feels like when we're there. It's beautiful!"" That heaven is Mertarvik — the new Newtok — a site up on the side of a low mountain, firmly grounded in rock. It's not about to erode away. Over the past decade, the village has pieced together enough funding to start building. There are a handful of modest wood houses, framed this summer. A row of heavy equipment waits for the next construction season. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates it will cost $130 million to move the whole village. In a community where more than 40 percent of residents live below the poverty line, that money will have to come from outside. 'A Disaster In The Making' If Newtok were destroyed in a single hurricane, the funding might come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Congress, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski has pressed FEMA for disaster relief. ""Clearly these are situations that anyone would look at and say, 'This is a disaster,'"" she said at a hearing in February. ""And if it's not a disaster immediately, it's clearly a disaster in the making."" But FEMA says federal disaster relief isn't meant to deal with the gradual impacts of climate change, like thawing permafrost and erosion. Last year, the Obama administration turned down Newtok's request for a federal disaster declaration. The Alaskan village of Newtok, seen from a plane in 2015, is threatened by eroding land. The Yupik people have lived in coastal areas along the Bering Sea for thousands of years. Andrew Burton/Getty Images FEMA official Alex Amparo told Murkowski that the main law governing disaster relief, the Stafford Act, only recognizes damage from a single major event, like a severe storm or earthquake. ""The situation of a slow-moving disaster in the making is something not contemplated under the Stafford Act,"" Amparo said, adding that adapting to climate impacts like those facing Newtok will require a ""whole of government"" response. That response has yet to happen. Joel Neimeyer heads the Denali Commission, the federal agency most closely involved in Newtok's relocation efforts. He says this problem is bigger than Newtok. ""We have these examples all across the country where you're having extreme weather events,"" Neimeyer says. ""And as a country we haven't yet resolved the question of how we want to respond to these."" He says Congress never envisioned relocating whole communities. There's no agency in charge of it, no pot of money to fund it. And yet, as climate change hits coastal communities around the country with flooding and erosion, it's a problem we will likely see more and more. In 2016, the Obama administration did offer a grant to move an entire town in coastal Louisiana, but that was a one-time solution. Neimeyer believes Congress needs to make a decision: In these situations, is it U.S. policy to move whole communities? Or just move families? Or do nothing? ""Obviously moving a village is more expensive than moving families,"" he says. ""But when you move families, you are dispersing a community, you're dispersing a tribe, you're dispersing a culture. And you'll lose that. So that is a very real policy decision Congress needs to grapple with."" At the new village site, Andrew John and Dalen Ayuluk say, with no coordinated response, their village faces a Catch-22. Federal and state agencies won't devote funding to things like roads or power until enough people live here. But there's no money for housing unless you have that infrastructure. ""Frustrated is an understatement,"" John says. ""We're here, fighting for our way of life. We're fighting for our sustainability as a people."" Ayuluk wishes the rest of the country would decide that his home is worth saving. ""We grew up here,"" he says. ""We fish here, we hunt here. Our community doesn't want to separate. We want to live together. So it's like asking, why destroy that?"" Newtok residents believe they have three or four years, at most, before the river reaches the school and the airstrip. At that point, they'll have to move, whether there's a new home waiting for them or not.","Melting permafrost and major storms are eating away at the coastal Alaskan village of Newtok.

Cory Doctorow,"The only thing worse than driving a car with defective breaks is unknowingly driving a car with defective brakes -- and learning about them the hard way. That's why Zack Whittaker's excellent roundup of civil lawsuits filed against infosec researchers and journalists is so fucking terrifying. Deep-pocketed, thin-skinned companies are able to abuse the law in bids to become the custodians of who can utter inconvenient truths about the defects in their products. Whittaker describes these suits and threats used against young, independent researchers, senior researchers at large corporations, and journalists who report on their findings. He also reveals that in the past year his own employer, Zdnet, ""did not publish three security stories after researchers' abandoned their work, fearing legal threats."" The belligerents involved in these suits run the gamut as well: there's Keeper Security, suing Ars Technica and reporter Dan Goodin over news of a defect in their flagship password manager; River City Media is suing veteran security researcher Chris Vickery, reporter Steve Ragan and his publisher CSO over an investigation into evidence that River City had been running a ""massive, illegal spam operation...using illegal IP hijacking techniques during some of their campaigns""; PwC threatened to sue a researcher who found a defect in a security product; Ashley Madison threatened to sue a reporter who obtained information suggesting the company had hacked its competition; drone maker DJI threated to sue a researcher who submitted a critical bug to its bug-bounty program. Whittaker quotes researchers who say they're now just dumping bugs anonymously, rather than risking civil liability for going through channels. Securing computers is hard. Getting it right requires, at a minimum: 1. The right to investigate computers; 2. The right to tell the truth about what you find in those investigations; and 3. The right to reconfigure computers to try to fix defects affect you or people you want to help. This is the minimum, necessary precondition for security. But laws like the CFAA and DMCA 1201, as well as license agreements, civil threats, weak anti-SLAPP protections and patchwork cost-shifting mechanisms for people victimized by corporations seeking to silence them means that all of these are under threat. Our world is made of computers; they are woven into devices in our bodies and devices we put our bodies into -- they hold the power of financial security, integrity in our health and personal information, and even life-or-death. Unless we get this right, we are in enormous trouble. Johnny Xmas may be best known for releasing the master key for luggage locks used by the Transportation Security Administration two years ago. In his early days, his hobby-hacking led him to uncover a flaw in the magnetic stripe found in his university's student ID cards. Each student's information was easily accessible -- including their Social Security number -- and all he needed was a student's card, ""which everyone lost like once a month,"" he said. ""I thought I'd let everyone in the school know about the issue the same way I let them know about my band's shows: by wallpapering the hallways in flyers,"" he explained in an email. ""The school of course caught wind, verified the issue, and attempted to sever their contract with the ID company citing a breach in a clause where the company agreed to secure the personal identifiable information,"" he said. That company, which he did not name, was ""livid at the loss of a huge client"" and sued him directly for slander -- a claim he denies, ""as my claims were verifiably true,"" he said. Xmas was also expelled from his school. He was later forced to settle out of court after the company, in his words, ""dragged the case out until I ran out of funds to pay my counsel.""

Greg Allen,"This photo taken last month in San Juan, Puerto Rico, shows roofs damaged by Hurricane Maria and the interior of buildings still exposed to the elements. Carlos Giusti/AP An international human rights group, Refugees International, has issued a scathing report on the U.S. response in Puerto Rico to Hurricane Maria. The group says ""poor coordination and logistics on the ground"" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Puerto Rican government ""seriously undermined the effectiveness of the aid delivery process."" Refugees International is an independent non-profit group that advocates on behalf of displaced people around the world. This was the first time the group had investigated a situation in the U.S. When its team arrived in Puerto Rico, more than two months after the storm, Refugees International says it was surprised that the relief effort was ""uncoordinated and poorly implemented."" The group says the poor response was ""prolonging the humanitarian emergency on the ground."" Puerto Rico was especially vulnerable to a disaster like a hurricane, the group says, because of its aging population, poorly maintained infrastructure and lack of emergency management assets, like helicopters and backup generators. ""In light of these known limitations,"" the report says, ""it is troubling that it took five days before any senior federal official from the U.S. mainland visited the island."" Comparing it with past natural disasters, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake, the group found the U.S. response lacking. In Haiti, the group says 8,000 U.S. troops were deployed to the island within two days of the disaster. In Puerto Rico, it took 10 days for 4,500 U.S. troops to arrive. Central to FEMA's problematic response, Refugees International says, is that the federal agency is designed to supplement local and state disaster response efforts. But in Puerto Rico, the group found, municipalities and the Commonwealth had ""limited capacity and ability to respond."" Now that immediate needs like food and water are taken care of, the group says, Puerto Rico's greatest need is housing. Puerto Rico's government says more than 472,000 homes were destroyed or badly damaged in Hurricane Maria. Months after the storm, Refugees International says, housing assistance provided by FEMA and the Puerto Rican government is not reaching the most vulnerable populations. Authorities have failed to distribute tarps and temporary roofs to all who need them, the group says. And the process for receiving assistance is complicated, confusing and poorly executed. Responding to the Refugees International report, FEMA agreed that coordination of efforts in disaster response is vital. But FEMA said Puerto Rico's devastation by the hurricane presented a difficult situation. ""More than 1,000 nautical miles from the mainland United States with an already fragile infrastructure and facing challenging economic circumstances presented communication and logistical challenges unique to the situation."" FEMA said: ""We regret the loss of life after any disaster and our thoughts and prayers are with the family members affected by the devastation of Hurricane Maria. FEMA continues to work every day to bring back a sense of normalcy to Puerto Rico.... ""Unity of effort is required for disaster response and recovery on any scale, but especially during this historic season. When emergency managers call for unity of effort, we mean that all levels of government, non-profit organizations, private sector businesses, and survivors must work together – each drawing upon their unique skills and capabilities – to meet the needs of disaster survivors."" Also Monday, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello announced he was ordering a review of all deaths in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico's government has listed the official death toll from the hurricane at just 64. Independent reporting from journalists and statistical analyses with past years suggest that more than 1,000 deaths may have been due to Hurricane Maria. Rossello said by law in Puerto Rico, the cause of death must be certified by a doctor or coroner, something not always possible in the chaos after the storm. Rossello has ordered Puerto Rico's Demographic Registry and the Department of Public Safety to review all deaths to get ""the most accurate count and understanding of how people lost their lives to fully account for the impact of these storms."" The governor has also called for the creation of an expert panel to look at how deaths are certified and make suggestions on how to improve the process in the future.","Refugees International cites ""poor coordination and logistics on the ground.""

A mining dam has collapsed in Brazil, causing a sea of sludge to spread to rural areas of the country's south-east state of Minas Gerais.
Up to 200 people are missing, the fire brigade says, although there have been no confirmed fatalities.
Rescue teams were dispatched and officials said a number of residents close to the dam had been evacuated. 
The dam and Feijão iron ore mine are owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale.
Vale and local authorities said on Friday that leaked tailings from the Corrego de Feijão mine had spread into the nearby community Vila Forteco, close to Brumadinho. 
Footage broadcast on local television showed the mudflow sweeping over roads and destroying buildings in its path.

Japan's Olympics Minister Yoshitaka Sakurada has resigned over comments that offended people affected by a huge tsunami and earthquake in 2011. 
At a fund-raising event, he suggested that backing the governing LDP member of parliament for the region was more important than its economic revival. 
It is not the first time Mr Sakurada has been forced to apologise. 
He said in February that he was disappointed by a Japanese swimmer's leukaemia diagnosis.
He said he was worried that medal favourite Rikako Ikee's illness might dampen enthusiasm for next year's Olympics. 
Mr Sakurada also admitted last year to never having used a computer, despite being Japan's cyber security minister. 
After accepting Mr Sakurada's resignation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe apologised for appointing him. 
""I deeply apologise for his remark to the people in the disaster-hit areas,"" said Mr Abe.
The 2011 tsunami left more than 20,000 dead and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. 
Shunichi Suzuki, who had been Olympics minister before Mr Sakurada was appointed last October, will be return to the post. 
In February, Mr Sakurada had to make another apology, after arriving three minutes late to a parliamentary meeting on Thursday. 
Opposition MPs said his poor timekeeping showed disrespect for his office and boycotted a meeting of the budget committee for five hours in protest. 
He also came under fire in 2016 for describing so-called comfort women forced to provide sexual services to Japanese war-time troops as ""professional prostitutes"".","Yoshitaka Sakurada latest error has brought his resignation, 15 months before the Tokyo 2020 games.",2019-04-11T00:19:10Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Japan's Yoshitaka Sakurada resigns as Olympics minister,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47889356,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10900/production/_106404876_afp.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1
Kendra Atleework,"In October 2017, 250 square miles burned in Northern California, destroying 6,000 homes and businesses and killing 44 people. For now, the cause of these fires has not been determined. The private utility company Pacific Gas and Electric, known to Californians as PG&E, is under investigation. Total damage for the Northern California wildfires comes to $9 billion. PG&E has started stockpiling cash. In California, this is a familiar story. Three years ago, in February of 2015, one-third of the houses in my remote neighborhood in Eastern California burned down. Here, before the fire, 100 houses lay scattered across the leeward flank of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The people who live here spend their time walking steep roads, listening to crickets, chasing mule deer out of the garden, and looking over a desert valley below. Days after the fire, my neighbor, Cassie, wasn’t doing any of these things. Instead, she stood inside her smoking foundation. Tall and easygoing with freckles on her nose, Cassie had come home from college that winter to sift rubble with her mom and dad. Under different circumstances, we might have hiked together or skated frozen ponds. I used to carpool with her family to school, and I remember her house, wooden and gorgeous and overlooking a ravine from which flames later rose. We wore rubber gloves to sort the rubble, but there was not much rubble to sort. The air smelled of sulfur, and mostly only dust lingered, as if a great storm had picked up the walls and roof and furniture and lifted everything away. Like the 2017 fires in Northern California, the cause of the fire that burned our neighborhood, according to the government database, is still under investigation. One source is more likely than others: On that day, strong winds whipped power lines that hung over dry brush. A power line can start a fire if it breaks in the wind. It can start a fire when a tree or a branch falls across it, or when lines slap together, or when equipment gets old and fails without anyone noticing. In 2015, fires started by electrical lines and equipment burned more acres in California than any other cause. Power lines sparked fires that set records in New Mexico and fed a blaze in Great Smoky Mountains National Park that entered the city of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and killed 14 people in 2016. In recent years, they have consistently been among the three major causes of California wildfires. Hurricane-force winds periodically shriek off the Pacific and rattle California. Wind strong enough to break a power line spreads fire fast. This past October, when I sniffed the air and found that California was once again burning, I looked around and saw many wires thatching an orange sky. I was visiting my aunt in Northern California, 50 miles from the fires. We sat inside and watched the noon sun dim. My childhood home didn’t burn the year Cassie’s did. But it should have. Dry leaves lay in piles beside the wooden walls. The volunteer fire chief’s house across the street burned, although he maintained plenty of defensible space. And so I wait, even now, for the next windstorm. In the months after my neighborhood burned, I waited fearfully, which means I waited angrily. In particular, I hoped power companies would put their lines underground. In 1995, fire-related costs ate up 16 percent of the U.S. Forest Service budget. By 2015, half of the budget was devoted to fire. Some of us wondered how safe our power can be when utility-company profits drive power operations. PG&E has been found guilty of negligence before in wildfires, and some of us point at negligence and greed again this time. There’s a precedent for fire occurring alongside an infrastructure that drives economic growth. From 1870 until the 1920s, most major fires in America were caused by locomotives. We fixed that problem, says Stephen Pyne, a firefighter-turned-historian. “New laws were enforced, fines and lawsuits applied economic pressure, engines were compelled to replace coal with oil as fuel, suitable spark arrestors were invented, rights-of-way were cleaned of debris, lines were patrolled.” And so locomotives started wildfires for decades, but not forever. Like railroads, power lines deliver a seemingly limitless supply of a product wherever people want it. On a good day, the grid makes life easy. Far from urban centers, in my house up the side of a mountain, in an ocean of dry brush, the lights still flick on. In general, power lines only cause fire when things go wrong above ground. Even utility companies agree, after a 2012 study by the Edison Electric Institute revealed that underground lines had fewer problems during storms and were better for public safety all around. But California has 210,000 miles of electrical lines. The cost to put lines underground is about $1 million per mile to start, and much more in mountainous areas. That’s five to 10 times what it costs to hang a line overhead, which usually makes underground lines logistically or economically impractical. In North Carolina, for example, a plan to put power lines underground was dropped because utility rates in the impacted area would have risen by 125 percent. And despite the impulse to blame industry, the power companies aren’t entirely in control of the solution. California utility companies don’t get to decide how much line they install underground; that matter is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission, in order to “protect consumers,” “safeguard the environment,” and “assure Californians’ access to safe and reliable utility infrastructure,” according to the organization’s stated mission. The commission balances risk with cost and limits how much utility companies can spend by putting wires underground. Other improvements to the grid are being investigated, including better line insulation and technology that could anticipate line failure and shut off power in advance. But all of these solutions will be slow and costly to implement. I might get angry with utility companies, but I like to turn lights on in the dark. In the United States, fossil fuels burned to make electricity and heat put more greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere than any industry. My neighbors’ houses burned amid the worst drought California had seen in a millennium. In recent decades, wildfires in the American West have begun to range farther and burn longer. Scientists from eight universities got together in 2016 and looked at tendencies in wildfire and the ways we manage wildfire. They concluded that “wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming.” They called this a “new era.” Fires burn bigger areas and destroy three times as many houses as they used to. What was once a problem in June, July, and August now extends through November and beyond. I evacuated for avalanche warnings in the winters of my childhood. In February 2015, I wandered my neighborhood and gaped at new patches of sky, as smoke seeped out of the ground. When a fire comes up the side of the mountain and destroys our homes, we say: natural disaster. When lightning starts that fire, we say: natural disaster. When power lines start that fire, we still say: natural disaster. Deliberate debris burning, fireworks, and rogue campfires are among the most common causes of so-called wildfire in some parts of California. Still, when people consider wildfire—even wildfire caused by human tools—it seems to us as inescapable as lightning. Three years after her house burned down, I asked my childhood neighbor Cassie whether she felt the fire that destroyed her house was inevitable. She lives in San Francisco now, where she prepares environmental impact reports for federal and state agencies. Her parents live in a house rebuilt atop the ashes of the old. “The smell of smoke made me nauseous,” Cassie told me, while Napa and Sonoma burned last fall. “I woke up in the middle of the night because I could smell it. It felt so close.” Cassie did not consider the loss of her home unavoidable. When people treat fire as an inevitability, she said, its consequences become divorced from human behavior. What she saw on the local news after the Northern California fires were the stories of “people and families and homes,” over and over. It makes sense, because people’s lives are changed, she said. “But that’s always the focus, instead of the bigger issue... instead of, this could have been prevented, and there’s a reason that it happened, and it’s connected to our infrastructure. But I just don’t think it’s something people want to talk about.” It sickened her, to feel fire’s heat, to smell its smoke, without facing its implications. And those implications are complicated. “Many of the problems of fire management do not have technical fixes,” Pyne, the fire historian, wrote during the Northern California fires. “They depend on social choices hammered out in politics—appropriate land use, the purpose of public lands, competing economic interests, cultural values, and philosophies.” It’s possible to update technology to dodge disaster, to a point. We can make advance warning systems for earthquakes, cloak first responders in NASA -developed fire suits, and mitigate rising sea levels with permeable pavement and rain gardens. We can also update technology to avoid having to change the assumptions that cause some of the problems in the first place. When locomotives burned forests, people changed the mechanics of trains—they didn’t reevaluate the long-term viability of rail. The need to move thousands of tons of lumber and coal and food and passengers at high speeds through forest and prairie and desert did not come into question. It’s easier to find a quick fix than it is to change culture. Some biologists contend that our brains did not evolve to conceive of the long-term consequences of our choices; that we are not primed to master deep time but to put out small fires⁠, if you will. Yet it appears we have also evolved to comprehend the far future, if only in flashes. We operate, Pyne writes, “not according to strict evolutionary selection but in the realm of culture, which is to say, of choice and confusion.” The night our neighborhood went up in smoke, I was 2,000 miles away. I sat on the floor and held a phone to my ear while my father described our mountain, burning. I gathered the things I had taken from my childhood bedroom around me like talismans and I imagined the world in flames. My house survived the fire because the volunteer fire chief, who drove up his street in a fire truck and saw his own house burning, had the presence of mind to keep moving, to keep working to save what remained. He or another volunteer doused the flames that devoured a pile of railroad ties in our yard, flames that could have laddered up our brush hill and laced fingers through the railings of the porch. Eventually, the scientists say, wildfires in the western United States might dwindle. This could happen when precipitation withers to the point that vegetation doesn’t come back. The fires will end when there is nothing more to burn. Cassie and I would like to choose a world in which there is a lot left to lose—we would prefer to protect our mountain homes, not to mention our larger communities and the global climate, and direct our lives in ways that will save what we love. Others would, too. Last October somebody put up signs in Sonoma that said, “The Love in the Air Is Thicker Than the Smoke.” For those of us living in the path of wildfire, we have come to understand that we must live with it, that no quick solution awaits us, that changing the ways we think and being open to new ways of living might protect our communities. Pyne writes that fire as we know it is “largely the outcome of what this creature has done, and not done.” Humans have changed fire, and fire will change us, one way or another. We can try to choose the way. Maybe this means smarter technology, already in the works. Maybe it means making new relationships with fire, making fire a tool, listening to the people who understand fire when it’s time to rebuild and then rebuilding in different ways, or even in different places. The scientists say we can choose to accept wildfire as “as an inevitable catalyst of change,” and we can adapt. Here, in a nation that currently suppresses 95 percent of all wildfires, at great cost and with questionable efficacy, it might be best to focus more on guiding the way fire burns. Communities can put more resources into controlled burns—more than 99 percent of which stay within selected boundaries—and teach the public about their benefit. Local governments can help educate and support landowners in fuel removal and property protection. And both residents and developers can think carefully before they build farther into wilderness, which is, after all, fire’s country. And yet it’s hard to work to change more than the technology—to change ourselves in order to accommodate and support these adaptations. It’s easy instead to slip back into life as we know it, to forget what a new era may ask of us, even when the stakes are very high. “Despite the fact that I feel very passionately about a lot of these issues, and they impact me personally, I don’t think about it day to day,” Cassie said. “At all. Ever.” And neither do I. This is life, the slow build of the wind on the Pacific, the heave of power over our heads.","Human technologies, especially power lines, are responsible for more loss from fire than any other cause.

"USA TODAY, David Jackson and Gregory Korte, USA TODAY","When President Trump addresses a joint session of congress Tuesday night, he will undoubtedly say that the State of the Union is strong, and he's right. The economy is growing, the stock market is booming, and unemployment is low. USA TODAY President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, this year's designated survivor. (Photo: Mark Humphrey, AP) WASHINGTON – And this year's ""designated survivor"" is... Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. Perdue, a former governor of Georgia, will sit out President Trump's State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol, waiting for the worst. For decades, presidential administrations have selected one Cabinet member to stay away from State of the Union speeches attended by the president and his staff, in case disaster strikes and wipes out the line of presidential succession. During the speech, the designated survivor is taken to a safe, secure, undisclosed location. The identity of the official is kept secret until just before the speech, when his or her absence would be apparent. When Trump spoke to a joint session of Congress in February of 2017, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin sat out the event as the designated survivor. The tradition harkens back to the dawn of Cold War, amid fears of a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union. Its roots are in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, which outlines who would assume the presidency in the case of a catastrophic event such as a nuclear attack.

One member of Trump’s cabinet cannot serve as a designated survivor: Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao. She was born in Taiwan and does not meet the constitutional requirements to serve as president. The selection of a designated survivor was relatively routine and unremarkable until the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the practice took on new urgency. Hollywood has long been fascinated with idea, from a 2000 episode of NBC's The West Wing to the current ABC series actually entitled Designated Survivor, in which Kiefer Sutherland plays a Cabinet member who assumes the presidency after a terrorist attack on a State of the Union address wipes out the rest of the other possible successors.

Louise Matsakis,"When Hurricane Harvey wreaked destruction in Houston last August, the country turned not just to cable television, but also to Snapchat. Two months before the storm, the social media app had debuted Snap Map, a crowdsourced, interactive feature that displays what’s happening on Snapchat around the world. At launch, Snap Map seemed mostly like a fun toy, albeit one with potential privacy implications ; Snap Map can broadcast your location to your friends if you opt in. But when Harvey hit, the map’s real utility became clear. Houston residents [began sharing] (https://www.wired.com/story/it-took-a-natural-disaster-for-me-to-understand-snap-map/) raw, intimate footage of paddling in canoes, huddling in shelters, and their living rooms filling with water. Snap Map communicated the breadth of the disaster better than a slickly produced cable news broadcast ever could. The problem: Snap Map lived exclusively inside Snapchat itself. It presented a range of experiences and emotions, but little in the way of context, being divorced from the rest of the web. Users could record or take photos of their screens to bring those videos to the wider internet, but there was no streamlined method. On Monday, Snapchat announced a potential solution to that problem. Beginning today, Snap Map, which has 100 million monthly users, will exist outside of the Snapchat app on a dedicated website. Redrawing the Snap Map News organizations, bloggers, and anyone else can embed Snap Map content right into web pages or other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Unlike embedding a tweet or YouTube video—and true to Snapchat’s purpose—Snap Map content will be ephemeral, disappearing after 30 days. That’s far longer than normal Snapchat stories, which only last 24 hours. Users can contribute to the map by opting to share their snap to “Our Story.” You can embed Snap Map stories elsewhere on the web in three formats: individual stories, a collection from a location or event, or stories in a specific geographic area. For example, in an article about the Olympics, WIRED could choose to embed a specific story from skier Lindsey Vonn, a series of stories about the Olympic Games, or every story from the Pyeongchang area. No matter the format, the stories will disappear after 30 days. The embed won’t break, but will say that the content is no longer available. The Snapchat staff moderates every Snap Map story in some way. An editorial team curates Official Stories, designated by purple font. Algorithms generate other Snap Map stories—designated by black font—around specific events or locations, though they still have to go through a content moderation process. Snap Map stories offer some anonymity to users by not including screen names. It’s hard to spoof the system, however, because you can only post from your GPS location; you can’t, say, pretend to be in New York if you’re really in Berlin. I had a chance to try the new Snap Map at Snapchat’s offices in New York last week. It was easy to see the utility for news organizations, especially because embedding Snap Map stories feels like a new iteration of what reporters have done for years. A hallmark feature of viral web stories in publications like Buzzfeed has always been the inclusion of a smattering of tweets or Facebook posts. That now carries over to Snapchat, with one important difference: The format is short videos instead of 280 characters. Snap Maps on the web hopes to capitalize on a fundamental shift taking place in how we consume and communicate information online. When the internet first became popular, dial-up connections were too slow to quickly send videos, GIFs, and photos. Today, people increasingly use augmented videos and pictures to communicate emotions. A snap of the State of the Union with a thumbs-down emoji can be a more effective way than a tweet—or worse, an essay—to communicate how much you hated it. While Snap Map provides rich visual detail, it also makes it difficult to follow up and understand the full context of what’s being shown. Countless stories have been uncovered by reporters who emailed or direct messaged sources after seeing their tweets, Facebook posts, or Reddit comments. With Snap Map, journalists have little information to go off of aside from a user’s location. There’s no way to find more information, at least for now. From the users’ perspective, this might be a bonus. Twitter is full of people unhappy that their tweets were plopped into a news story without their consent. With a snap, your content might still be featured, but at least your name isn’t attached to it. Going Wide The Snap Map expansion is part of Snapchat’s larger strategy to bring its content outside of the app. For years, Snapchat has struggled to communicate the kind of content it offers to potential users. In a previous job, I made daily Snapchat stories for a news publisher; it was difficult to communicate what that was like to anyone who didn’t use the app themselves. In contrast, my mom has never tweeted, but she understands the basics of Twitter from having seen its content elsewhere on the web. Snap Map is just the latest—and potentially most visible—effort to address that problem. Last month, Snapchat made it possible to share some types of Snapchat Stories beyond the app itself. You can now hold down on any Official Story —meaning it was posted by a public figure and approved by Snapchat—and share it elsewhere on the internet. You can also share Snapchat’s curated Our Stories, edited collections of videos from Snapchatters focused on a cultural moment, event, or holiday. This also represents a rare moment where Snapchat and Instagram have diverged. Over the past several years, Instagram has repeatedly copied Snapchat’s latest features, resulting in a ongoing one-upmanship between the platforms. The rivalry began in 2016 when Instagram copied Snapchat’s signature feature: stories, strings of consecutive vertical videos pushed to all of a user’s followers at once. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has rolled out stories to its other properties, including WhatsApp and Facebook itself. There’s even a meme making fun of how Snapchat’s beloved feature has seemingly ended up everywhere. Snapchat’s efforts to share content elsewhere on the web are being led by Rahul Chopra, the former CEO of Storyful, an agency that licenses viral videos and other content online. Chopra was tapped to be the head of “Stories Everywhere” at Snapchat in December. Embedding Snap Map stories feels like a new iteration of what reporters have done for years. Snapchat’s latest announcement arrives on the heels of a promising earnings report. For much of the last year since Snapchat became a publicly traded company, its stock has slumped. But last week, Snapchat announced it had reversed that trend. After the company’s CEO Evan Spiegel announced the company had made $30 million more than projected, shares rose by 20 percent, to the level they were when the stock first went public. During the earnings call, Spiegel emphasized bringing Snapchat’s content outside the app. “Removing friction from the way people use Snapchat and view Snaps will help us continue to grow our community over the coming year,"" he said. Snapchat also announced that its number of daily users had risen nine million, to 187 million. Instagram may already have more than twice that amount, but it looks Snapchat can’t be counted out just yet—especially now that it’s about to show up everywhere you look.

It has continued spewing ash since, with explosive eruptions and weak blasts that can be heard up to 12km (7 mi) away from the peak. However, what has got authorities worried is the threat of a large-scale eruption. Authorities on Monday raised the warning level to the maximum level 4, and the designated exclusion zone has been extended to a 10km (6 mi) radius.

Sasha Lekach,"Veterans dealing with stress have a new option for self-care, and they don't need to leave the house to use it. Those dealing with sleep issues, pain, anger, loneliness, or anxiety after serving in the military or transitioning out can turn to a new meditation app for help. The Bravo Tango Brain Training app was designed specifically for veterans with the guidance of a former Air Force psychologist and combat vet. The voice-powered app uses Google Assistant and helps reduce stress with meditation, breathing, and mindfulness prompts. It was released this week in honor of Veteran's Day. SEE ALSO: This is how veterans are helping disaster victims Dr. Michael Valdovinos, the former Air Force psychologist who wrote most of the app's content, specializes in the intersection of technology and behavioral health. He tapped into his experiences in the military and his mental health background to create exercises for the voice-controlled program that lets users interact with a machine. ""It's a really a powerful tool,"" he said in a phone call Friday. ""It’s responding based on how you’re doing and what you’re saying."" After asking, ""OK, Google, start Bravo Tango,"" users can begin talking to the app. Tell it, ""I'm feeling lonely"" or ""I'm in pain,"" and it will respond accordingly and bring up an appropriate exercise based on the real-time conversation. The psychologist sees interactive engagement appealing for veterans who usually experience meditation or other mindfulness exercises by plugging in headphones and having directions told to them. The app attempts to mimic an in-person session. Valdovinos also hopes veterans will be drawn to the app because it's accessible and available in a safe space: at home. ""Run with it and see where it takes you,"" he encouraged. ""Worst case scenario it won’t understand you."" But knowing Google, it should understand you just fine and get you straight into exercises that involve breathing, focusing, grounding, visualization, interpersonal connection, and muscle relaxation. The app came together through a collaboration with National Geographic, 360i, Xapp, and, of course, Google. NatGeo had produced the series, The Long Road Home, which followed military members returning from service. Their stories prompted NatGeo to create the mental health app. The app is available now through the Google Assistant app on Google Home devices and on Android devoices. Valdovinos hopes the veteran community will discover the app and integrate it into their self-care practices. ""Get into the app and start that dialogue right away,"" he suggested.","Veterans dealing with stress have a new option for self-care, and they don't need to leave the house to use it.

Max Knoblauch,"It's been two months since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, leaving the island without power and causing the longest blackout in United States history. Thousands of protesters marched throughout Washington D.C. on Sunday in the ""Unity March for Puerto Rico,"" a show of support for ongoing disaster relief efforts after the U.S. territory was decimated by Maria, a Category 4 storm. SEE ALSO: Trump says Puerto Rico hurricane response was a '10' but these numbers prove otherwise The march, attended by numerous politicians, as well as celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and chef José Andres, led protesters from the Capitol Building to the Lincoln Memorial. As of Nov. 19, two months after the storm made landfall, 50 percent of the island is still without power. Power lines that have been restored remain unstable, causing daily, widespread outages. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that 75 percent of the island will have power by the end of January. According to their website, Unity March organizers are calling for more aid in rebuilding Puerto Rico, the permanent repeal of the Jones Act (which slows down recovery efforts), and the cancellation of Puerto Rico's more than $70 billion in debt. President Donald Trump has previously criticized Puerto Rico's debt, suggesting that it could limit the aid it receives. In fact, that criticism is one of the factors that prompted Sunday's march. Sunday in Puerto Rico 60 days after Maria Status.pr reports: *49% power generation (power outages are occurring almost daily) *91% of ppl have water (boil advisory remains in effect) Today, Puerto Ricans are marching in Washigton DC using the hashtag #UnityMarchforPuertoRico — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) November 19, 2017 The Trump administration recently requested $44 billion in hurricane aid from Congress, though much of it would be dedicated to recovery in Florida and Texas. The White House's request falls billions short of the aid sought by both Texas (Governor Abbot asked for $61 billion in aid ) and Puerto Rico (Governor Rosselló requested $94 billion ). According to the White House, Puerto Rico's damage assessment is still not completed, and more aid will be requested from Congress in the future. Democratic and Republican lawmakers from areas affected by the Hurricane have called the White House's response ""wholly inadequate.""

SEE ALSO: Donald Trump tries to talk trash on Twitter but tags the wrong account But Thursday's display for the ""urgent question"" at the House of Commons, after the U.S. president retweeted three videos from extreme far-right, anti-Muslim group Britain First, is in many ways unprecedented. While Home Secretary Amber Rudd kept an institutional profile, reiterating the government's line that Donald Trump was ""wrong"" to retweet Britain First and confirming his state visit has been postponed until further notice, other MPs went much further, venting their anger and condemnation at Trump's words. Here's Conservative MP Peter Bone, calling for Prime Minister Theresa May to convince the U.S. president to delete his account, in an unusually blunt way: UK lawmaker: ""Wouldn't the world be a better place if the Prime Minister could persuade the President of the United States to delete his Twitter account?""

Stephen Doughty, a Labour MP, is one of the many officials who said May should cancel Trump's state visit, noting that Trump shared ""inflammatory and divisive content"" on Twitter by Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen, who he calls ""a convicted criminal who is facing further charges, who represents a vile fascist organisation seeking to spread hatred and violence in person and online."" He added, ""By sharing it, he is either a racist, incompetent, or unthinking—or all three."" Doughty's colleague Yvette Cooper said Trump will ""keep spreading extremism"" while Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable called Trump an ""evil racist"" and also called for his invitation to be withdrawn. The same appeal came from London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said any official visit from Trump to Britain ""would not be welcomed.""

KIM BARKER and NICHOLAS KULISH,"In February 2017, Comprehensive Health Services paid a settlement of almost $4 million over improperly charging the government for medical screenings. The company said the overbilling was a mistake.
The countrys second-largest provider, a San Antonio-based nonprofit called BCFS, seems unlikely to take over all Southwest Keys shelters. Its primary focus has long been disaster relief and international aid, and the nonprofit has faced daily protests for running a sprawling tent city in Tornillo, Tex.
The government may also try to delay deciding on Southwest Key contracts until it reduces the number of children in federal custody or, at the least, reduces the number of children placed with Southwest Key.
A major reason for the shelters overcrowding was the administrations decision in June to require fingerprints for every member of a household that wanted to care for migrant children. As fingerprinting slowed placement, the average length of time children spent in shelters stretched from about a month to nearly two.
In December, the Trump administration relaxed the fingerprinting requirements. The tent city, scheduled to close by Jan. 15, has already been reduced from 2,850 children to 1,500. In November, Southwest Key housed as many as 5,000, but as of Friday, there were only 3,900.
Still, the temporary shelter run by Comprehensive Health Services is expanding, from a capacity of 1,350 to 2,350 children.","Outside Casa Padre, a Walmart turned shelter for migrant children in Brownsville, Tex.

On Monday Nguyen Van Hoa was found guilty of spreading ""anti-state propaganda"" about a chemical spill that occured in Vietnam in 2016. SEE ALSO: Trump slurps shark fin soup as U.S. works to remove itself from the shark fin trade The spill, which occured in April, has been dubbed the country's worst environmental disaster. It happened when Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, a Taiwanese-owned steel factory released chemicals which included cyanide, into the sea. The discharge killed marine life, causing at least 70 tonnes of dead fish to be washed ashore and destroyed some 200 hectares of coral reef. Hundreds of people were believed to have fallen ill after eating the poisoned fish. Thousands of demonstrators had come out to the factory protesting and demanding compensation. It was these protests that the 22-year-old blogger wrote about that led to his arrest earlier this year. “The sentencing of Nguyen Van Hoa shows how profoundly the government’s paranoid desire to maintain political control trumps notions of justice and human rights,"" Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia told the New York Times.

Vietnamese blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, also known as ""Mother Mushroom"" (L) Image: AFP/Getty Images Vietnam's government was heavily criticised after it remained silent for weeks after the chemical spill incident, only coming out later in June to acknowledge that Formosa had indeed leaked chemicals into the South China Sea.

Adam Rosenberg,"Doom — the original Doom, from 1993 — never had loot boxes. Now it does. This is why we can't have nice things. OK, it's not actually as bad as it sounds. The ""loot boxes"" come from a new mod for ZDoom, a fan-made port that, among other things, allows you to play and alter the original Doom on modern computers. SEE ALSO: EA's 'Star Wars' PR disaster finally pushed gamers into open revolt against loot boxes The so-called ""Doom Loot Box Mod"" removes all weapons and power-ups from the map, replacing them with locked crates. You need a key to unlock each crate, and keys can be obtained either as a rare random drop from downed enemies or via in-game purchases. I mean, not really. There's a ""Market"" menu in the modded game that ostensibly lets you buy packages of keys and crates. But it doesn't actually work. Thankfully. What you're left with is an extremely challenging version of Doom ! As you can see in StronkiTube's video below, keys drop as infrequently as promised and the crates they unlock are few and far between. The mod amounts to a wry nod toward the ongoing conversation in the gaming world around post-release monetization. Game publishers are looking for new income sources now, a time when the cost of development has reached a point that the standard $60 price for most major releases carries too much risk. The just-released Star Wars: Battlefront II has been making headlines for much of the past two weeks because of the way it locks online progression — which is to say, the guns and gadgets you unlock — behind random loot boxes that can be purchased using real money. It's a ""pay-to-win"" setup, essentially, and much of the backlash stems from the fact that loot boxes are an egregious presence in a high-profile blockbuster game. The ""Doom Loot Box Mod"" doesn't explicitly reference Battlefront II or any other game. But its clever execution — coupled with the fact that, yes, Doom is basically impossible to play when weapons and power-ups are locked behind loot boxes — makes it an incisive commentary on the gaming drama of the moment all the same.","Doom — the original Doom, from 1993 — never had loot boxes.

Rebecca Ruiz,"This weekend marks a year since millions of nasty women (and men) marched in protest following the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. March On, a new organization branching out from the Women's March movement, wants to take a ""bottom up"" approach to the resistance. SEE ALSO: Trump was a disaster for women in 2017. It may be his undoing. Founded by people who organized and led sister Women's March events around the country, March On is using this weekend's anniversary to launch "" Operation Marching Orders,"" a tech-driven campaign to crowdsource an agenda for political change. That agenda will put into words what the movement is fighting for in advance of the 2018 midterm elections. It may also become a set of demands or expectations of political candidates and elected officials. ""This movement is the people’s movement, it belongs to the people."" The project begins Saturday with the debut of an interactive Pol.is poll that allows people to vote on value statements (example: ""We need a new political party of the left that takes no money from corporations""). People can agree, disagree, or pass and propose their own statements, which are also subject to a vote. Once machine learning analyzes that data, the goal is to understand participants' common values, how their opinions diverge, and what issues are most important to them. ""This movement is the people’s movement, it belongs to the people,"" says March On executive director Vanessa Wruble. ""We can’t impose what we think this movement wants. We need to hear from the movement itself."" The split between Women's March and March On has largely been amicable in public, but it hints at the tension over which political and organizing strategies best engage the millions of people who showed up to protest last year, some of whom became fixtures at demonstrations and town hall meetings in their own communities. Wruble, who previously served on the Women's March national committee, wants to effectively hand the mic to people on the ground, with an assist from Pol.is' technology and artificial intelligence. People who participate in the March On poll must register their email address. Statements submitted by users will be heavily moderated for duplication and trolling. Colin Megill, cofounder of Pol.is, describes the tool as a survey created by the people who take it, which is then analyzed by an algorithm designed to see beyond binary beliefs and instead pull out nuances in people's political positions. The results, he says, ""give a snapshot of the landscape of opinion amongst a bunch of people who’ve never talked to each other about these issues."" Pol.is is used by private companies, public and academic institutions, and governments in Canada and Taiwan. One of the key challenges for March On is enlisting a diverse group of participants. Otherwise, the values and priorities expressed by users risk reflecting narrow slices of the moderate and liberal American electorate. Wruble is aware of that possibility and says March On is working with many partners, including local leaders who participated in the Women's March, to distribute the poll widely amongst different networks and communities. Once the poll closes on Feb. 4 at midnight Pacific Standard Time, Pol.is will analyze the results and provide the insights to March On leadership. From there, March On will use that information to draft a ""declaration for the future"" that reflects participants' values, principles, and high-priority issues. That grand vision wouldn't be complete, of course, without some kind of massive in-real-life turnout. The end game for March On in 2018, says Wruble, is to send people marching in the streets (or by caravan and rally) to vote on Nov. 6 in the midterm elections. ""We want to take the movement's creative spirit and intergenerational spirit and point it toward something that can really move the needle, and that is the vote,"" says Wruble. If March On can begin its efforts with an interactive poll and culminate in a huge showing at the polls, it'll indeed become a fascinating player in American politics.","This weekend marks a year since millions of nasty women (and men) marched in protest following the inauguration of Donald J.

The goal is to learn how we do justice work that is adaptive, focuses on the small things that make up all large systems, and prioritizes critical connections over critical mass. I am also a visionary fiction writer (part of the Octavia's Brood team) and a pleasure activist, which means I believe pleasure is an important measure of freedom, and that we need to make justice the most pleasurable experience we can have. And, even as someone focused on ease, nature, future, and pleasure, 2017 was a daunting year. And, even as someone focused on ease, nature, future, and pleasure, 2017 was a daunting year. But I am still going. Movements for social and environmental justice are still moving forward. Which gets me curious about how we are surviving, how we are generating energy to move forward in 2018 when everything is heavy and everything hurts. What do we do? The first thing is to give ourselves lots of room and respect for whatever we have done. It got us this far. So, shout outs to alcohol, sugar, sex, and weed, which have been doing the work of comforting and numbing millions. After the 2016 election, drinking definitely became one of my coping mechanisms for that ""They all want my death"" feeling that has become daily life. I know the newness of feeling this every day is as much an indication of my privilege as it is of political change; things aren't getting worse, they are getting unveiled. Whatever I didn't see before this moment is a sign that I was somehow benefiting from not seeing it. It feels worse nonetheless. just saw three grown black men racing through the light tunnel at dtw giggling like children. #publicjoy — adriennemaree (@adriennemaree) January 7, 2018 But we need to be careful about numbing. The long-term impacts of numbing move us away from the very aliveness we are fighting for, that erotic level of presence, alertness, and feeling our miraculous existence in real time. Audre Lorde taught us that, ""In touch with the erotic, I become less willing to accept powerlessness, or those other supplied states of being which are not native to me, such as resignation, despair, self-effacement, depression, self-denial."" I wanted to offer some strategies beyond numbing that have helped me protect my aliveness. I invite you to practice these throughout 2018. 1. Reconnect with our movement ancestors. We are not the first to be in impossible conditions. And what we know is that we have survived, that our ancestors found ways to survive, to be in dignity and resistance. Focus on ancestors of your own lineage, knowing that every lineage on earth has individuals and groups who have left lessons behind. For me this year has been lit by the north star of Harriet Tubman. You might call on freedom fighters like Berta Cáceres or Bobby Sands — there are so many who inspire. Ancestors can and should humble us. 2. Tune in to the three Gs every day: gratitude, good news, and genius. If you look, all three are within reach. a) Start and/or end the day with gratitude. It’s a gorgeous world; pay attention to the beauty, the connection, the generosity and growth. b) Read between the lines and find the good news. It's always there, but it might be very small. For me, it's often in the news of what movements for social and environmental justice are doing to resist. Boost it, grow it with your attention. c) Our continued survival is actually a long, iterative practice of collective genius. Pay attention to the people and organizations who are doing more than reacting to the daily news or pulling each other down. Tune into the work of the Movement for Black Lives, the Women’s March, #MeToo, Cooperation Jackson, Movement Generation, #ourpowerpr, Mi Gente. These initiatives are attempting audacious, visionary, and difficult work that relies on the genius that arises from people working together across difference to address the challenges and opportunities of their real lives. 3. That thing about putting on your oxygen mask before helping others? It’s real. It's not like other masks that hide your true face from others, which is an important distinction here. You don't need to put anything over your truth right now to cover the emotional rollercoaster of being a human who is paying attention. But you do need to take care of yourself at a material level. Soothe without numbing, rest without guilt, hydrate to replenish your foundation, and use your body while there is still miracle in it. Hibernate: turn inward, get still, write down what you have learned from surviving the last year as well as what has been liberated within you, and what you are ready to grow. 4. And I wouldn’t be me if I didn’t remind y’all that an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away. Remember that your body is literally wired to feel good, thread with nerves that communicate pleasure and let you know what to move toward. And you can choose between the orgasm and the orgasmic — do a massage exchange with friends, eat delicious home-cooked meals, watch comedy shows. There are so many ways to turn up your aliveness. None of these practices are small or trite. We are in the worst of times right now. If you need to be convinced to care for your body, mind, and spirit so that you can care for your community and this planet, let's just review the past 12 months. There was a period of denial and grief for many of us. Perhaps you also spent some time under a blanket, wondering why our species is so self-sabotaging and embarrassing? Maybe you too called friends to discuss where you could run to, and realized, again, that there was no place far enough, no place beyond the reach of the United States? Those of us with an intersectional analysis of our current situation know that every uphill battle we've been fighting is at least twice as steep. We are looking ahead at battles around the tax plan, net neutrality, protecting the planet as a livable planet for our species, resisting a police force encouraged to unleash increased violence on our devastated vulnerable communities. All while watching 45 play nuclear roulette with North Korea on Twitter. For those of us working to create social change, 2017 was a wild year. We take our whiplashed necks and try to keep up the pace as we run from protest to petition to planning meeting. We have held some lines, we have shown up and said no to racist bans and efforts to strip us of hard-won rights, and we have reached for each other. We’ve been surprised and excited as scientists marched and national parks workers used Twitter to resist fascist policy making. a. if i can’t see what you are creating, i’m not interested in watching you destroy. b. creating is the hardest work. creating when you could destroy is a sign of maturity at any age. — adriennemaree (@adriennemaree) December 3, 2017 And, in our exhaustion, we have sometimes turned on each other. Interpersonal beef drains organizational resources. Tactical differences become landmines. Places where we could learn together instead become battlegrounds that play out on social media. We long for something different but are stretched too thin to practice new approaches. We want each other to be perfect and to be transparent about our flaws. We are punitive and transformative in the same breath. We are in a fight for our survival and there's no turning away from it, no turning back. 2017 was a reckoning, an unveiling. An embarrassment, yes, but it's honest. And now we are at a very real risk of becoming too exhausted to continue our fight, our journey. Ella Baker taught us that “we who believe in freedom cannot rest.” Ella Baker taught us that ""we who believe in freedom cannot rest."" I wrestle with these words all the time, because I believe in freedom, and I believe my body is a crucial part of the fight for freedom. So I interpret these words through my work. I do not rest in terms of how I work. I tirelessly show up for movements I believe in, to hold planned or unexpected hard conversations and mediations, to invite transformation in the face of frustration. I tirelessly seek out old and new ways of moving through our current paradigm and into a viable future. But when it comes to my body, I rest. I rest in myriad ways that allow me to show up fully for each facilitation. I ensure that I have quiet time each evening, a bath when there’s a tub, at least seven hours of sleep each night. I want to give us more permission to rest our bodies so that we don’t burn out our spirits and minds in our lifelong commitment to liberation. It is in that spirit that I invite you to honor your ancestors and remember that they believed in you before your first breath. They believed you could generate gratitude, uplift good news, contribute to genius. Put on your oxygen mask and open to the pleasurable experiences of life. This is our moment to shape.","I was listening to The Read recently — it's my favorite podcast — and I was struck by co-host Kid Fury’s observations about reaching the end of the year and feeling tired.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Many victims are thought to have been trapped inside the vessel when it went down Indonesian police have detained the captain of a ferry that sank in Lake Toba in Sumatra leaving three people dead and at least 190 missing. The vessel went down on Monday in what is feared to be one of Indonesia's most deadly maritime disasters. It was only licensed to transport 60 passengers and was operating without an official ticket system, making it difficult to trace those on board. Police say they have yet to question the captain because he is traumatised. Lake Toba, the world's largest volcanic lake, was busy with tourists celebrating the annual Eid holiday when the ferry sank in poor weather. As many as 193 people, including children, are feared to be unaccounted for, police said on Thursday. Authorities have relied on reports from survivors and the families of missing relatives, they added. Many victims are thought to have been trapped inside the vessel, police said. Image copyright EPA Image caption Divers and an underwater drone joined the search efforts on the world's largest volcanic lake ""This is a test from God for our family,"" Fajar Alamsyah Putra, whose brother Bagas Prama Ananta is among the missing passengers, told BBC News Indonesian. ""He was inside the ferry when the ship sank and could not get out, the ferry quickly capsized. A friend of his was on the deck and was able to jump off in time to get help from another passing ferry,"" he said. Indonesia's national search and rescue agency earlier said that only 18 survivors had been found, all within hours of the tragedy, and that three bodies had been recovered. Desperate families have spent the past days waiting for news from the search-and-rescue boats returning to shore. On Wednesday, divers and an underwater drone joined the search efforts. The teams still need to locate the wooden ferry at the bottom of the 450m (1,500ft)-deep lake. According to official regulations, all boats in Indonesia must not exceed capacity and must have life jackets for every passenger on board. But authorities admit that they struggle to monitor all the boats operating across Indonesia's vast archipelago. The national committee for transportation safety says that 40% of boat accidents in Indonesia are caused by human error, and only 12% are due to bad weather.",Indonesian police are to question the captain of an overloaded vessel that sank in Lake Toba.,2018-06-21T10:53:25Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Indonesia ferry disaster: Lake Toba captain detained,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44560262,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5D06/production/_102141832_tv047562333.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The checks were only carried out in cases where there were doubts as to the person's age A Swedish investigation into migrants claiming asylum as children suggests that three-quarters of those tested were over the age of 18. Sweden's national forensic medicine agency checked the age of nearly 8,000 people and found that some 6,600 were 18 or over. The checks were only carried out in cases where there were doubts as to the person's age. Child migrants are less likely to be sent back to their country of origin. Between mid-March and late October, the agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) carried out a total of 7,858 age assessments. Of those, examinations suggested 6,628 were 18 or older (84%), and 112 ""possibly"" 18 or older, The Local newspaper reports. The Migration Agency has so far made 5,700 decisions on the basis of those assessments. In 79% of those cases, the agency decided to formally consider the applicant as older than they had initially claimed in their asylum application, reports Svenska Dagbladet. Age assessment is carried out by taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analysed to determine age. Many asylum seekers do not have identity documents as they may have lost them as they fled conflict or a natural disaster, says the International Organization for Migration. In other cases their country of birth may not have the structures in place to record births, so it is not unusual for people not to know their exact age, says The Local. When the Migration Agency assessed asylum seekers' ages last year, before the task was handed over to Rättsmedicinalverket, it formally increased the age of 17% of those whose age was in doubt.

The Conversation,"Social media was recently credited with reducing the number of casualties caused by air strikes in the Syrian civil war. The early warning system, developed by tech startup Hala Systems, uses remote sensors to detect aircraft flying over the opposition-held northern province of Idlib. Alerts are then sent via Facebook and instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp to civilians and aid workers in affected areas. These messages give relevant information such as the areas likely to come under heavy bombardment and the duration of these raids. Since its launch in 2016, the system has reportedly reduced the number of casualties in the region caused by air strikes by as much as 27%. The system also triggers traditional air raid sirens that might actually be more effective than social media in reaching key demographics in affected areas. Nevertheless, this example shows why social media has become big news for emergency managers seeking to provide accurate and timely information to people affected by disasters. Incidents such as Hurricane Sandy in September 2012 have shown how disaster response teams can leverage the “ power of collective intelligence ” given by social media. Members of the public use these platforms to share critical information that helps build a bigger picture of the situation. They also play a key role in correcting misinformation and dispelling rumors that have the potential to hinder efforts to restore critical services in affected areas. Twitter hashtags in particular function as “fire spaces”, transforming data generated by citizens into information that helps first responders allocate resources to the people who need them most. Emergency managers frequently use information-gathering platforms such as Ushahidi and Twitcident to help them sift through the large volume of data available on these sites at each stage of the incident. They have also mobilized “digital volunteers” who offer their time without having to leave home to assist with this task. Groups such as the Virtual Operations Support Teams and the Digital Humanitarian Network helped analyze the social media data generated during natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey, as well as terrorist incidents such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. Social media can also be used by citizens to provide emotional and material support to those living in disaster-affected areas. Our research projects CascEff and IMPROVER found several examples of such citizen-led social media campaigns. These included #hasselthelp, which provided shelter to those festival goers who had fled the 2011 Pukkelpop festival disaster. And #PorteOuverte, which fulfilled the same function for those caught up in the Paris terrorist attacks. Leighton Walter Killé/TCF, CC BY-ND. These hashtags appeared to empower local communities to join in disaster response, theoretically increasing their resilience towards such incidents in the future. Yet social media users typically disengaged from these online groups once their questions about the incident had been answered. And we found that they didn’t necessarily show a stronger commitment to responding to the disasters. What’s more, emergency management organizations are likely to remain the most influential and reputable sources of crisis information for the foreseeable future. The problem with relying on digital media for disaster response is that not everyone has access to it. Many people are still skeptical about the trustworthiness and reliability of information posted online. Research shows that members of the public are still more likely to perceive traditional media such as newspapers, radio and television as more credible than social media. Because there’s always a risk of mobile networks also going down, any communication strategy has to involve a mix of traditional and digital media. Our research found that radio was still seen as the most resilient communication channel that could help reach large numbers of people when power supplies were disrupted. Our work also suggests there aren’t any ways social media is used that make it indispensable to emergency managers. Instead, they need to assess how people are behaving and the information they need to work out the best way to communicate in any scenario, including by learning lessons from previous disasters. Overly optimistic views of social media as a panacea for the problems in crisis communication often ignore the importance of a mix of traditional and digital tools. Perhaps that’s why the Syrian air strike warning system, which sounded conventional alarms based on data gathered by social media, has proved so successful.

Michelle Mark,"Outraged Canadians say two recent Netflix productions — including the hit movie ""Bird Box"" — used footage from a deadly 2013 train disaster that killed 47 people and flattened much of the downtown core in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. 
 Lac-Mégantic's mayor, Julie Morin, took to Canadian media to complain about Netflix's use of the footage and demand that the streaming service ensures no more images of the disaster are being used as entertainment in fictional shows and movies. 
 ""We are looking for assurances from Netflix that they are going to remove them,"" Morin told the Canadian Press. ""You can be sure we are going to follow up on this, and our citizens are on our side."" 
 The Lac-Mégantic disaster occurred in July 2013, when an unattended, runaway train holding roughly 2 million gallons of crude oil barreled into the town at 65 miles per hour, derailing at a bend in the tracks. The ensuing explosion destroyed 44 buildings, left 160 people homeless, and left 27 children with one or more dead parents. 
 INSIDER has since learned from Netflix that the footage in ""Bird Box"" was indeed from Lac-Mégantic and that Netflix will be keeping the footage in the film. 
 ""Bird Box"" is a post-apocalyptic psychological horror, and the Lac-Mégantic footage appears in the first five minutes of the movie when several characters are watching a news segment about people around the world displaying ""psychotic behavior.""

 Robert Bellefleur, a member of the Coalition of Citizens and Organizations Committed to Railway Safety in Lac-Mégantic, told Radio-Canada that he found Netflix's use of the footage disturbing. 
 ""It brings us back to pain,"" he told the outlet in French. 
 Another Netflix show used the same footage 
 ""Bird Box"" hasn't been the only production the Canadians have accused the streaming service of using the footage in — the Canadian-made Netflix show ""Travelers"" did, too. 
 The production company, Peacock Alley Entertainment, said in a statement via Netflix that they would be replacing the footage in the show. 
 ""As the Canadian producers of 'Travelers,' we acquired this footage from stock footage vendor Pond 5 and weren't aware of its specific source,"" the statement said. ""We sincerely apologize and had no intention to dishonour the tragic events of 2013."" 
 How did the disaster footage get in the Netflix productions? 
 Pond5 told INSIDER in a statement that its content database offers 14 million video clips, including fictional scenes, actual news clips, and archival footage. The company is ""taking additional steps to correct the situation"" and contacting all customers who have purchased the clip to ensure they're aware of the ""sensitive"" context. 
 ""We deeply regret that this happened and sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended, especially the victims and their families,"" the statement said. 
 The Lac-Mégantic footage can be found by searching the website. The clip of the inferno is labeled ""Young Boy Riding Bicycle Near Spectacular Train Crash With Fire."" 
 Lac-Mégantic's mayor told the Canadian Press that the survivors are already traumatized from the disaster, and seeing images on popular shows and movies could make the problem worse.

DANIEL VICTOR,"A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration from ending special protections for immigrants from four countries devastated by war and natural disaster, temporarily relieving more than 300,000 people from the threat of deportation. Immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan some of whom have spent two decades in the United States cheered Wednesdays decision to retain the program, which was signed into law in 1990 by President George Bush. The program includes more than 263,000 Salvadorans, almost 59,000 Haitians, more than 5,000 Nicaraguans and more than 1,000 Sudanese, according to the court. In the injunction, Judge Edward M. Chen said the beneficiaries, if deported, indisputably will suffer irreparable harm and great hardship, many having to choose between bringing their American-born children with them or splitting their families apart. The injunction was another instance of a judge using President Trumps own words on immigration against him. Judge Chen cited comments in the presidents speeches and Twitter posts as evidence of an animus against nonwhite, non-European immigrants. He wrote that there was circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.","The decision temporarily relieves more than 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan from the threat of deportation.",2018-10-04T05:27:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Judge Blocks Trump Administration From Ending Some Immigrant Protections,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/immigration-temporary-protected-status.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/04/world/04xp-immigration-1/04xp-immigration-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Hurricane Michael comes as undecided voters and polls suggest there are not many of them in Florida this year are finalizing their choices less than four weeks before statewide elections. It presents opportunities and hazards for a host of candidates eager to display competence and gravitas as voters make up their minds and begin casting their ballots. Among the candidates are Gov. Rick Scott, who is running a fierce race for Senate against the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson, and Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the Democratic nominee for governor. How they tackle the preparations and response to the storm could cement their standing as front-runners or upend months of painstaking campaign work, rendered useless by the late-arriving taint of a botched disaster.

"John D. Sutter and Leyla Santiago, CNN","San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) An estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico, according to an academic report published Tuesday in a prestigious medical journal. That figure dwarfs Puerto Rico's official death toll of 64, which the article's authors called a ""substantial underestimate"" of Hurricane Maria's death toll. ""These numbers... underscore the inattention of the US government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" authors from Harvard University and other institutions wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. The official death toll in Puerto Rico has been the subject of substantial controversy since Hurricane Maria hit this island, a US territory, on September 20. CNN and other news outlets have used government statistics and extensive interviews with families of the deceased and funeral home directors to question the Puerto Rican government's official tally of deaths. Previous estimates suggested Maria contributed to about 1,000 deaths. The team from Harvard arrived at its much-higher estimate by surveying 3,299 randomly chosen households across the island earlier this year. Authors compared results of that survey -- which asked island residents about deaths in their homes, among other things -- with official mortality statistics from 2016. That allowed researchers to estimate the number of deaths that likely occurred as a result of Hurricane Maria between the date of the storm and December 31, 2017. ""The difference is that we went out and we had boots on the ground and we did the interviews,"" said Domingo Marqués, an associate professor of clinical psychology at Carlos Albizu University in Puerto Rico, who was among the report's authors. ""Statistically, it's like having interviewed the whole island,"" he said. Still, the exact death toll is likely to remain a mystery. Experts tell CNN it is difficult to say with certainty whether a hurricane ""caused"" certain deaths, especially those that occurred because of the chaotic and unsafe conditions that have lingered for months in Puerto Rico. Marqués and colleagues say 793 to 8,498 hurricane deaths occurred. In a news conference on Tuesday, Hector Pesquera, head of Puerto Rico's public safety department, said the government did not have reason to question the latest estimates, which come from researchers at Harvard University as well as Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the University of Colorado and universities in Puerto Rico. US territory officials stressed that the Puerto Rican government has hired George Washington University to conduct an assessment of Maria's death toll and that the results of that review are still forthcoming. Previously, officials had expected the George Washington University report to be released this spring, before the Atlantic hurricane season, which begins on June 1. ""The Government of Puerto Rico welcomes the newly released Harvard University survey and we look forward to analyzing it,"" Carlos R. Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said in a press release. ""As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported. That is why we commissioned The George Washington University to carry out a thorough study on the number of fatalities caused by Hurricane Maria which will be released soon. Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost."" The Harvard study says the Puerto Rican and US governments did not provide adequate services -- including electrical power and medical assistance -- after the hurricane. It also notes that Puerto Rican officials have refused to make public basic mortality statistics. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees disaster recovery, has said it encountered unique logistical challenges on the island after the storm that make comparisons between the response to Maria and other storms problematic. CNN and the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) in Puerto Rico are suing the island's demographic registry for access to death records that have been withheld. In November, CNN surveyed 112 funeral homes -- about half the total -- across Puerto Rico, in a moment when many communication systems remained inoperable. At that time, funeral home directors identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related. Puerto Rico added at least two people to its official count following CNN's investigation. One was Quintín Vidal Rolón, 89, who died in a lantern fire that relatives said occurred because of the storm; Vidal was using the lantern because he didn't have electricity. Other uncounted deaths occurred in environments where people lacked electricity or other basic services, including communications. Many roads were blocked after the storm. And hurricane-related deaths appear to have continued for months after the September hurricane. Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, 77, for example, died in Maunabo, Puerto Rico, in January. His family says that's because they couldn't afford to power a breathing machine that helped keep him alive. While most power and water service has been restored, thousands of people here remain without electricity -- more than eight months after Hurricane Maria. The latest death-toll estimate could be seen as an indictment of the federal response to the storm, said Dr. Gregory J. Davis, director of the University of Kentucky's Forensic Pathology Consultation Service. ""This alone should make your readers and the readers of the New England Journal really stand up and take notice -- and frankly be asking our government 'Why?' "" he said. ""Our government is not doing what they should be doing down there. It's infuriating, that's the bottom line."" The New England Journal of Medicine article adds to ""a growing consensus that deaths have been undercounted by the Puerto Rican government,"" said Alexis Santos, a demographer at Penn State University who also has researched the death toll following Maria. ""This is a valid way of looking at it,"" he said of the research from Harvard. Still, ""The way this is done, by interviews with people in different barrios in Puerto Rico, it seems to me that someone could report a death as associated with the hurricane when it was not."" That could result in an overcounting of deaths, he said. The Harvard team, meanwhile, says that, if anything, its estimates are low. It would be impossible to identify some deaths using a survey, Marqués said. For example, if a person died while living alone there would be no person in that home able to answer questions. Researchers also underscored how much an accurate death toll matters -- in terms of supplying adequate assistance, for the families of victims and for the prevention of future deaths. ""As the United States prepares for its next hurricane season,"" the researchers wrote, ""it will be critical to review how disaster-related deaths will be counted, in order to mobilize an appropriate response operation and account for the fate of those affected.""","An estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico, according to an academic report published Tuesday in a prestigious medical journal.

Cory Doctorow,"Ray Corrigan ( previously ), a campaigning computer scientist at the UK's Open University, has an excellent explainer on the EU's disastrous copyright directive on the progressive academic group blog Crooked Timber ( previously ). Corrigan's work is, as always, careful, detailed and measured -- and incredibly worrying. He describes the technical problems with the proposals -- a mandatory copyright filter and a requirement to license links to news stories -- and delves into the reasons that policy-makers are so willing to create policies with such obvious deficiencies. The first press outlets to notice these proposals were from the far right, and this has led some progressives to assume that this is a stalking horse for far right causes, but nothing could be farther from the truth. These proposals will crush all but the largest platforms -- Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, etc -- and the smarter elements of the far right understand that a world with fewer outlets for free expression will be difficult for them, because they're increasingly unwelcome on the mainstream platforms. But they aren't the the only ones who need to fear an internet where the right to speak is contingent on the approval of a few giant corporations: as states take action against all forms of insurgent politics, including the struggles for racial equality and against wealth inequality, creating permanent advantages for Google and its rivals is also creating bottlenecks where increasingly authoritarian states can decide who gets to speak and who can be heard. Creators, authors, ordinary internet users will be guilty of copyright infringement and automatically censored, until or unless they can prove their innocence, through an as yet unspecified process, run and administered by “content sharing service providers” in turn monitored by “rightholders.” The result will a chilling effect as authors will attempt to adapt their writings to the vagaries of the filter just to make them available to otehrs. There are broader problems. The internet is already a giant surveillance machine. The first step in blanket filtering for copyright infringement is blanket surveillance for copyright infringement. Google already have a major head start in the copyright robot filter stakes with their YouTube Content ID system. Article 13 amounts to doubling down on the surveillance architecture of the internet and handing the keys to it to Google and other large technology companies. While Google may not want this – since it would come with responsibilities (towards copyright holders) as well as power, it will surely use these tools to cement its own market advantage if it has to. More generally, network effects will mean that is only those large companies whose filters will be approved for use in the longer term.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption California wildfires continue to rage Strong winds have been fuelling California's deadly fires as search-and-rescue teams begin the grim task of searching for bodies among the ashes. Winds of up to 40mph (64km/h) are expected throughout Tuesday in the state's south, where the Woolsey Fire is threatening some 57,000 homes. Firefighters in the north are still battling the Camp Fire, which has left at least 42 people dead. Meanwhile, two new fires began in the south on Monday. They started within minutes of each other. The smaller of the two has since been put out, news agency Reuters reports. In the north, the Camp Fire, which has destroyed almost 7,200 homes, surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster to become the deadliest in California's history after 13 more bodies were found, bringing the total killed to 42. The earlier tragedy left 31 dead. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for, with coroner-led search teams preparing to comb the largely incinerated town of Paradise on Tuesday. Three portable morgue, as well as specialist dog units, forensic anthropologists and a ""disaster mortuary"" have been requested to help with the operation, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters on Monday. The Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu, a favourite with the rich and famous. More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California. US President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. What's the latest on the Camp Fire? Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in a nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate overnight. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many of the town's 26,000 residents have had their homes devastated Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she was first woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. She described the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"" and said she did not know if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened. ""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme. ""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised - I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it."" Many of the victims are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Media caption Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. What about further south? The separate Woosley Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Thousands of firefighters, some from across the US, have been brought in to help battle the blazes. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

STACY COWLEY,"Photo President Obama signs the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Republicans have opposed. Credit Charles Dharapak/Associated Press The leadership standoff between President Trump and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent government agency, is headed to court. Leandra English, the bureau’s deputy director, filed a lawsuit on Sunday night to block Mr. Trump’s choice of a temporary chief from taking control of the agency on Monday morning. Ms. English, an agency veteran, was appointed to the deputy director position on Friday by the consumer bureau’s outgoing director, Richard Cordray, who abruptly resigned that day. Under the terms of the law that created the agency, Ms. English should succeed him as its temporary leader, Mr. Cordray told the staff. But Mr. Trump, citing a different federal law, moved hours later to install his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, as the agency’s acting director. The bureau had been a “total disaster” and needed new leadership to “bring it back to life,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. The dueling appointments left it unclear who would be running the agency on Monday. Ms. English is looking to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to resolve the dispute. The lawsuit she filed seeks a temporary injunction to halt Mr. Mulvaney’s appointment. “The President’s attempt to appoint a still-serving White House staffer to displace the acting head of an independent agency is contrary to the overall statutory design and independence of the bureau,” Ms. English wrote in her lawsuit.

Nathan Grayson,"Last weekend, Epic kicked off its $8 million Fortnite “Summer Skirmish” series with a $250,000 tournament featuring top-tier players and content creators. Thanks to latency issues and confusing camera work, it was a disaster. Now Epic has put out a postmortem acknowledging that, yeah, between lag and hyper-cautious players, things didn’t go super great. The tournament was originally set to go for ten games, but Epic swerved the unwieldy thing into a ditch after just four. Lag was unbearable, and players spent most of their time hiding rather than seeking and destroying. The event pulled in hundreds of thousands of viewers, and they came away from it in a state of near-unanimous disappointment. In the postmortem on Fortnite ’s website, Epic conceded that the tournament “did not go as planned,” but noted that it was a useful learning experience. The company went on to address viewers’ qualms point-by-point, beginning with server performance. “We believe that there are number of factors that caused the poor server conditions during this event,” Epic wrote. “This includes the number of players still alive in the later circles, the number of players that stayed connected to spectate until the end, and the amount of dense building that occurred late in the matches.” The developer plans to improve server performance to better accommodate in-game events that require a lot of bandwidth, like structure damage and large groups of players. Epic believes this will not only make tournaments more watchable, but will also help out in “intense” game modes like 50v50. Epic also plans to experiment with rulesets that encourage competitors to get out there and mix it up, rather than employing strategies popularized in nature by frightened bunnies. “Week 1 also illustrated some of the difficult player vs. player engagement scenarios with so many talented builders under one roof,” said Epic. “Complicated, snaking tunnels make it difficult to follow the action, but also amplify the lack of it (action). We’re thinking carefully about how to address late-game building for long-term health of competitive play.” The company plans to try different formats every week, including ones that more directly incentivize eliminations. Epic plans to exercise caution, though, because complicated scoring systems can be “confusing and anticlimactic”—which could dilute the central one-life-and-then-you’re-mincemeat-on- a-desert-burger tension of the battle royale genre. The goal is to strike a balance between tactical play and flashy play. This week’s tournament will employ a public—rather than private—server format that follows each player over a period of 10 games. The reception to Epic’s announcement has already been fraught, though, because Keemstar, a YouTube star who has made “drama” into his personal brand, takes issue with Epic’s alleged—though still unconfirmed—decision to host a tournament this Friday (last week’s was on Saturday). That’s because it conflicts with the final entry in Keemstar’s “Friday Fortnite ” tournament series, which pits other popular YouTubers and streamers against each other. Keemstar had been planning to move his tournaments to Sunday anyway so as to dive-roll away from Epic’s oncoming 18-wheeler, but not until next week. Epic’s tournament this week still hasn’t been confirmed, but Keemstar believes that Epic is about to rain on his parade. “This is the last insult I’m gonna take from y’all,” he said in a video yesterday. “I’m doing Friday Fortnite this Friday... I’m talking to all these YouTubers right now, and they’re playing Friday Fortnite. This is what you get for not communicating with me, not working with me, and just being Epic. Just being Epic. You be Epic. I’ll be Keemstar.” He later claimed that he had talked directly with Epic about how “communications need to be better in the future.” Kotaku reached out to both Keemstar and Epic for comment, but as of publishing, neither had replied to our questions. Fortnite is Epic’s game; its owns the rights and can franchise it however it damn well pleases. Keemstar is just a YouTuber and independent tournament organizer, albeit a very well-known YouTuber organizing tournaments for some of the most popular players in the world. He has power and clout within a competitive community that Epic’s only just beginning to cultivate. It’s an odd spot for Epic to be in, to say the least. No matter what, though, this week’s Summer Skirmish tournament can already claim to be more gripping than last week’s, if only because of all the off-stream drama. The real battle royale is which stream you choose to bestow with your precious viewership.","Last weekend, Epic kicked off its $8 million Fortnite “Summer Skirmish” series with a $250,000 tournament featuring top-tier players and content creators.

Eillie Anzilotti,"In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Houston and poured water on the city for days, growing into the worst documented rainstorm in United States history. In the months after the storm, it became clear to the Houston Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) that the money coming in from FEMA for homeowners impacted by flooding would not be enough; it rarely is. FEMA bases how much aid it administers to a disaster-struck region on how many people apply for it, and then again, which of those applications meet the agency’s threshold for sustained damage. This approach results in a severe underestimation of need : It fails to capture people who do not know to apply, or cannot, or whose properties sustained damage that FEMA doesn’t recognize. So Houston HCD, in November, issued a request for proposals, calling for a new, data-driven approach to identifying and quantifying need after a disaster like Harvey strikes. “Houston’s been hit by five federally declared disasters in three years,” Tom McCasland, HCD director, tells Fast Company. “If the damage from these disasters is chronically undercounted, then we’re being chronically under-resourced for recovery. Harvey presented an opportunity to take on the problem of undercounting with this data project.” [Photo: Flickr user Jill Carlson ] HCD ultimately awarded the contract to the data consultancy firm Civis Analytics, which proposed a method of calculating aid based on both existing data streams that the city collects, like trash pickup locations and flood level modeling, and comprehensive community surveys and outreach. “We focused on helping them understand, at a really individual level, exactly which households were impacted by flooding,” says Amy Deora, Civis’s director of public sector analytics. The federal government agencies responsible for post-disaster relief, FEMA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, she adds, “use a basic set of standards and heuristics to estimate aid–they assume an average level of damage for each house that reports, and assign funding in that way.” But Civis’s model showed that this method resulted in an incomplete picture of the need following Harvey–one that failed to reach 50% of Houstonians who experienced flooding, and underestimated the need for housing funding by $2 billion. So instead of leaning on applications for FEMA assistance, Civis assessed need by first accessing property files from the Harris County Assessors’ database to get a sense of how many residential buildings existed in Houston before the hurricane, and what their value was. They then cross-analyzed that data with stats from the Census Bureau on how many people lived in each building, what their income was, and whether they rented or owned. Working with Dewberry, a company that models flood patterns, Civis overlayed the flooding impact from Harvey with the residential landscape of the city that they compiled. “We wanted to start from the ground up,” Deora says. They also analyzed metadata on emergency calls placed during the hurricane, and much more esoteric data points, like the drone footage that some residents uploaded to YouTube showing the extent of the flooding. From this model, Civis learned that not only did the traditional way of assessing need dramatically undercount the people affected, it also perpetuated discrepancies in aid delivery along socioeconomic lines. The flooding had the largest impact in areas of high poverty, and residents in 12 neighborhoods sustained levels of damage to their buildings that amounted to more than 50% of their annual income to repair. But so far, most of the assistance has flowed to neighborhoods with high home values. Residents of lower-income communities often face barriers to accessing aid under the traditional FEMA-centric system, Deora says: They may not know to apply for FEMA assistance, or live in a mobile home, which does not qualify for aid. Around one in five Houstonians are immigrants who may not be comfortable with English, and for whom the FEMA application process is doubly daunting. When they began developing the model in February, Deora says, the initial goal was to discover the extent to which the current aid delivery model undercounted people in need. But because the Civis model pulls from such a wide variety of data, it can also show other patterns in how a disaster affects communities: The team found that people with disabilities were disproportionately affected, and seniors sustained the most damage, dollar-value-wise, because they were more likely to be homeowners. They also noted a 15% rise in homelessness following the flood. All of these data points, Deora says, will go toward informing the city in how it continues to source and deliver assistance. “The data will help us identify priority areas for starting our outreach for disaster recovery so that we’re prioritizing helping those people with the fewest private resources to recover,” McCasland says. Currently, Houston HCD is sourcing feedback on the new analytical model, and will use the data as leverage to raise more funds for housing rebuilding and repair projects, but also flood mitigation efforts and homeless services efforts. While the Civis model was built specifically for Houston, it’s applicable for other cities, Deora says, and could help at-risk localities identify at-risk populations–based on flooding models and residential data–before disaster strikes.","The city of Houston suspected that many people in need after Harvey weren’t getting aid from the federal government, so they contracted with Civis Analytics to build a new, data-driven model.

Volcanologists say the lava's presence is sometimes reflected in the ash plume which takes on a reddish-orange glow even in daytime. Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said bigger eruptions than those currently happening are possible based on the information the disaster agency is receiving from the volcano monitoring center. He said that ""since yesterday there were explosive eruptions whose sound was heard up to 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away."" Nugroho said officials are responding based on a worst-case scenario occurring because Agung has a history of violent eruptions. Its last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. He said ""We cannot be sure whether this time eruptions will be the same with 1963."" ___ 11:50 a.m. Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency says as many as 100,000 villagers need to leave the expanded danger zone around the Mount Agung volcano on Bali, but that less than half that number have left. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the crater in places affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. The volcano's alert was raised to the highest level earlier Monday and ash clouds have forced the closure of Bali's international airport. Nugroho said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. He said that ""authorities will comb the area to persuade them. If needed, we will forcibly evacuate them."" ___ 10:50 a.m. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation says 100 buses are being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. Bali's international airport was closed early Monday after ash from the volcano reached its airspace. Hundreds of flights were canceled and tens of thousands of travelers affected. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Authorities say the airport closure is in effect until Tuesday morning and is being reviewed every six hours. ___ 9:50 a.m. Video released by Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency shows water and volcanic debris flowing down the slopes of the ash-spewing Mount Agung on Bali as rain falls on the island. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said people should stay away from rivers and not enter the 10 kilometer (6 mile) exclusion zone around the volcano. He says lahars could increase as it's rainy season in Bali. The mudflows can move rapidly and are a frequent killer during volcanic eruptions. Mount Agung has been hurling ash thousands of meters into the atmosphere since the weekend, forcing the closure of Bali's airport and stranding tens of thousands of travelers. ___ 8:30 a.m. Tens of thousands of travelers are stranded in Bali after ash from the Mount Agung volcano on the tourist island forced the international airport to close early Monday. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy Bali airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. Authorities say seven flights were diverted to airports in Jakarta, Surabaya and Singapore when the closure was announced early Monday. Mount Agung has been hurling ash thousands of meters into the atmosphere, which forced the small international airport on the neighboring island of Lombok to close Sunday as the plumes drifted east. It has since reopened. Airport authorities say the decision to close Bali's I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport was made after tests showed ash had reached its airspace. ___ 6 a.m. Indonesian authorities raised the alert for a menacing volcano on the tourist island of Bali to the highest level Monday and ordered people within 10 kilometers (6 miles) to evacuate. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said Bali's international airport had closed for 24 hours and authorities would consider reopening it Tuesday after evaluating the situation. Mount Agung has been hurling ash thousands of meters into the atmosphere, which forced the small international airport on the neighboring island of Lombok to close Sunday as the plumes drifted east. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised at 6 a.m. on Monday because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. However he says he's still not expecting a major eruption. ""We don't expect a big eruption but we have to stay alert and anticipate,"" he says. Previously the exclusion zone around the volcano ranged between 6 and 7.5 kilometers. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people.","KARANGASEM, Indonesia (AP) - The Latest on a rumbling volcano on the Indonesian tourist island of Bali (all times local):

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","One of the underlying principles of Lifehacker is that not every hack works for every person. This is especially true of money advice, because everyones individual situation and goals will vary dramatically from everyone elses. You might overspend when using a credit card, for example, so advice on the best rewards card doesnt work for you. 
But there are some rules-of-thumb that make sense for pretty much everyone to follow. Those include:
Dont Accrue Credit Card Debt
This one is obvious, but it bears repeating: If youre using a card to pay for something because you dont have the money in your bank account, youre digging yourself into debt, and youll end up paying significantly more in the longterm. On a similar note, you shouldnt spend more than you earn, and you should always pay your bill on time, even if you can only make the minimum payment. But those go without saying, er, writing, right?
You might think that this applies to all debt, but thats not the case. Theres a difference between good debt and bad debt. To put it simply: Good debt, like a mortgage or car loan, will typically help your credit score because it is secured by something tangible, while bad debt, like credit card debt, will harm your credit score because it is not.

Student loan debt is a trickier topicit can be good debt for many people, in that it might help boost a credit score and open up more opportunities. But it can also be bad if it oppressively overshadows every financial and career decision you make. As with all things, there are shades of gray and variations between the two extremes.
Exceptions: Youre in the midst of a disaster/emergency and have no other recourse but to use a credit card.

401(k) accounts get a bad rap, and some of that is warranted. They can be expensive to operate and offer limited investing options, plus theyre no substitute for a defined benefit plan for most workers. Not everyone has access to one or spare cash to put away. But, theyre also one of the most efficient financial vehicles offered to full-time workers. 
If youre unhappy with your 401(k) options and fees, which is a legitimate critique, then at least contribute up to the match so that youre getting your full compensation. As I wrote previously:
You should think of that money as part of your compensation. Would you be ok with your employer paying you $49k instead of $50k when you agreed to the latter? No? Its the same thing with your 401(k) match. Suddenly your two percent contribution becomes four percent. They should be giving you the money anyway, but theyve put this requirement on it, so you should do it regardless. If you dont put in enough to get the match, youre essentially forfeiting a portion of your salary.
Plus, 401(k)s lower your taxable income, giving you a tax break now, and youll benefit from the compound interest if you leave your money alone. 
Exceptions: You need some money in the short term, but plan to increase your contributions once youre caught up.

Open Your Bills and Financial Documents When You Get Them
Last week I logged into my Fidelity account to download some tax forms. When I did, I saw that the account tied to my old employer was completely drained of money. Balance: $0. I had a momentary freakout, and then texted an old coworker. Turns out the company had switched providers, which I would have known if I bothered to open my mail. The upshot of this sad tale: Open your mail, especially if its from your bank or another financial institution you do business with. Youll save yourself a lot of headaches (and shock).
Exceptions: Now, thieves are banking (sorry) on you opening your mail, which also means you need to be on the lookout for scams. This is especially true for seniors. Generally, skip out on anything promising you a certain return, or, if you have student loans, claiming that they can make them disappear. 
Something else youll want to ignore? Credit card convenience checks. Dont use them.
The only greater annoyance than junk email is junk postal mail. Not only does it clog your

Pay Yourself First

Pay yourself first, before you spend on superfluous expenses, and youll get ahead in the long run and be able to live more comfortably and stress-free day-to-day. 
That means automating your savings from your paycheck, ideally before you even receive it. Better yet, make that money more difficult to access: Put it in a separate, high-yield account, or use an app like Digit to save.
Exceptions: You have at least $1,000 or one months worth of expenses saved and you want to pay off some of your debt.

Read Everything Before You Sign (or Buy)
While this one also seems obvious, there are plenty of less-obvious situations it applies, ranging from housing to credit cards to loans:
Ask your landlord what happens if your roommate moves out mid-lease, or if you lose your job and need to terminate early. Make sure thats spelled out in your lease.
You didnt realize your car loan included an extended warranty.
Your gym automatically renews for a year-long membership after the one-week trial.
Your payday loans costs you significantly more than you understood when you signed up.
Your student loan interest starts accruing while youre still in school.
A credit card you use has a deferred-interest policy that kicks in after a certain number of months.
Something that was verbally agreed to in a house purchase (for example) wasnt included in your closing documents.

Know That Past Performance Does Not Ensure Future Results
When writing about investing for the longterm, Lifehacker recommends low-cost, diversified mutual funds and ETFs, which have historically returned better results at a cheaper cost than actively-managed funds. But as with most things in life, theres a huge caveat: Results arent guaranteed. No one can actually predict what the stock marketor your bank, boss, spouse, etc.will do. Thats important to keep in mind when researching any sort of fund, credit card or bank account.
Similarly, know that nothingexcept death and taxesis guaranteed. If someone is trying to sell you a product with a guaranteed, 100 percent happening return or outcome, call bullshit and walk away. 
Exceptions: None. Everything changes and nothing stays the same.","One of the underlying principles of Lifehacker is that not every hack works for every person.

Heather Alexandra,"In real life, death is my greatest fear. In video games, I’ll court disaster. When faced with obvious traps or perilous dialog choices, I will run in with reckless abandon. I’m not really sure what this says about me. Death, in video games, often feels to me like a carry over from the arcade designs of yesteryear. When arcade games were more perilous, more quarters would get spent. Failure is so important to games that some people believe it is a requirement for something to be a game, although a game can’t be too punishing, lest the player take their quarters (or $60) elsewhere. When I play games, I’m eager to experience the many strange deaths that can befall me, and my favorite games are those that make failure as compelling as success. Often, this is a roleplaying decision on my part. I like to really get into the mindset of my character, even if that means making poor decisions, assuming those decisions would make sense for my character to make. Recently, I’ve started playing Reigns: Her Majesty on the train ride to work. In that game, you control the decisions of countless queens throughout their lives, trying to manage public opinion and avoid grisly death. It’s expected that you’ll fail. You might prove too pious, at which point the Church tests your sainthood by depriving you of water until you die. You can mismanage your finances until the kingdom is in ruin and you flee, only be devoured by a pack of dogs. The idea of Reigns: Her Majesty is to use the knowledge of your previous lives to manage the kingdom and avoid these deaths. But I often get swept up in the personalities I build in my head for each of my characters. I’ll flaunt my pagan interests in front of the church. I’ll crush rebellions until citizens guillotine me. That’s not how the game is meant to be played, but it makes sense to me, according to the personalities that I’ve envisioned for each of my successive queens. That freedom to guide my character’s actions can feel empowering. One of the reasons I’m not as afraid of horror games as horror films is because I get to choose when to open the door to the basements where monsters lurk. Whenever I see a new monster in a horror game, I’ll let it kill me. A major component of horror is the terror that comes from not knowing what comes next. Once you know what a monster can do, it’s not as scary. My typical horror game play-through would seem very strange from a narrative standpoint, since my characters start off by dying, coming back, meeting a new monster and pissing them off, dying some more, and so on. What must that be like for my characters? Yes, I know it’s just a game, but the implications are fascinating to me. Being a player feels like being a tyrant; commanding a character and bidding them into constant demise is diabolical. Think about trying to get a Big Boss rank in Metal Gear Solid 2, a game which I just streamed on Kotaku ’ s Twitch channel. That process requires subjecting Raiden to countless cycles of life and death. In a game where the lines between player and characters are razor thin, it ends up feeling like a self-destructive act. Daily thoughts from a Kotaku staffer about a game we’re playing. Whether it’s for the sake of story, my own curiosity, or my own self-preservation (seeing how my character’s death can unfold better prepares me to later live), I keep sending my character headlong into disaster. In some cases, it makes for a better ending. In other cases it helps me prepare for failure. I’m not sure if it’s really the best way to handle things—most people play to win—but I don’t think I’m going to stop anytime soon.","In real life, death is my greatest fear.

Dutch photographer Erwin Zwaan, 47, traveled to the 18-mile exclusion zone around Chernobyl in Northern Ukraine in 2016 and 2018 to photograph the ghostly ruins.
The power plant and nearby town Pripyat - once home to 50,000 people - remain more or less untouched three decades after they were evacuated in 1986.
“Chernobyl is unlike any other place,” Zwaan explained.

“It’s surreal, impressive, sad, but also beautiful. You’re roaming around in an area where chapters ended and at the same time new chapters started.
""Nature took over and is doing very well. I don’t think there is any other place that has so many sides to just as many stories.”
Chernobyl was the scene of the worlds’ worst nuclear disaster when the No.4 reactor overheated during a bungled safety test on the night of 25–26 April 1986.
The explosion and fire that raged for nine days sent radioactive particles into the atmosphere which spread across Europe.

At least 31 people died - including two at the scene and dozens more who succumbed to radiation sickness in the following weeks - but the number of deaths including from cancer could eventually hit 4,000.
For Zwaan, who focused more on his photography after almost losing his sight when he was 32, it is important to remember the repercussions of the horrendous nuclear catastrophe.
“The message I try to convey in this book is to raise awareness to this disaster that still goes on today,” added Zwaan, who used his Canon EOS 5D Mark 3 and Mark 4 for the shots.
Nowadays, more than 10,000 tourists explore the disaster site every year.

"The Associated Press, The Associated Press","Filipino villagers look on as floodwaters hit the town of Salvador, Lanao del Norte province in the Philippines. (Photo: Jeoffrey Maitem, EPA-EFE) ZAMBOANGA, Philippines – A tropical storm unleashed flash floods and set off landslides in the southern Philippines at a peak time for travel and Christmas preparations, leaving at least 75 people dead and 58 others missing, officials said Saturday. Romina Marasigan of the government’s disaster-response agency said landslides and flash floods triggered by Tropical Storm Tembin inflicted most of the deaths in the hard-hit provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur and on the Zamboanga Peninsula. Officials were getting more details to validate the reported casualties, Marasigan said. It’s the latest disaster to hit the Philippines, which is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making the archipelago that lies on the Pacific typhoon belt one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. Mayor Bong Edding of Zamboanga del Norte province’s Sibuco town said by phone that a search and rescue operation was underway for more than 30 people swept away by flash floods in the fishing village of Anungan. Five bodies have been recovered so far in the village. “The floodwaters from the mountain came down so fast and swept away people and houses,” Edding said. “It’s really sad because Christmas is just a few days away, but these things happen beyond our control.” Edding blamed years of logging in the mountains near Anungan for the tragedy that unfolded Friday, adding that he and other officials would move to halt the logging operations. The rest of the deaths were reported in Lanao del Norte, where floodwaters from a mountain also swept away several riverside houses and villagers, and Lanao del Sur, police and officials said. Thousands of villagers moved to emergency shelters and thousands more were stranded in airports and seaports after the coast guard prohibited ferries from venturing out in the rough seas and several flights were canceled. More: From floods to fires, U.S. weather went to extremes in 2017 An inter-island ferry sank off northeastern Quezon province Thursday after being lashed by fierce winds and big waves, leaving at least five dead. More than 250 passengers and crewmen were rescued. Tembin, locally known as Vinta, was packing maximum sustained winds of 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 95 kph (59 mph), and is forecast to blow away from the southern Philippines on Sunday toward the South China Sea, moving closer to Vietnam. “It is unfortunate that another tropical cyclone, Vinta, made its presence felt so near Christmas,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said, adding that food packs and other aid were being distributed in storm-hit communities. Earlier in the week, a tropical storm left more than 50 people dead and 31 others missing, mostly due to landslides, and damaged more than 10,000 houses in the central Philippines before weakening and blowing into the South China Sea. Among the areas battered by Tembin was Marawi, a lakeside city in Lanao del Sur that is still recovering from a five-month siege by pro-Islamic State group extremists that left more than 1,000 people dead.

Cory Doctorow,"When the news of two showstopping bugs in virtually every computer in use today broke, it was scary stuff -- experts predicted that mitigating these bugs would be difficult and impose severe performance penalties on patched systems; a week later, Google released research suggesting that the fear was misplaced, and that patching would be an orderly and relatively painless process. But as manufacturers have rolled out their patches, it's looking more and more like the Spectre and Meltdown disaster are a long way off from being mitigated: these patches crash systems, or brick them, and have been recalled again and again. This, combined with the chip manufacturers' initial downplaying of the severity of the bugs (and their execs' suspicious financial dealings in the runup to the bugs' disclosure), suggests that the companies are not taking the bug seriously and don't know what they're doing. Intel memorably said in its first statement about Meltdown and Spectre that, ""any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time."" Sounds great, right? In practice, Intel has had to repeatedly step on this initial nonchalance, revealing that its newer processors are also susceptible to patch-related slowdowns, and that it pushed out some patches too soon. On Monday, Intel retracted one of its Spectre patches because of random reboot issues, and suggested that system administrators roll it back or skip it if they haven't installed it already. ""I apologize for any disruption this change in guidance may cause,"" Intel executive vice president Neil Shenoy said in a statement.

Sidney Fussell,"From Power Rangers to Pacific Rim, we’ve always had the same dream: controlling a badass robot and saving the world. Now’s the time. The X Prize Foundation (stylized as “XPRIZE”) is a nonprofit helmed by Peter Diamandis that funds technological grand challenges. Since the inaugural 1996 competition, challenge themes have included adult literacy, AI, women’s safety, and suborbital spaceflight. Co-sponsored by All Nippon Airways, the newly announced four-year challenge is a $8 million prize for creating human-controlled robot avatars “that will enable us to remotely see, hear, touch and interact with physical environments and other people.” Diamandis says the time has come for technology to allow people to help each other across long distances. According to the current draft of the competition guidelines, avatars should be able to pick up objects as small as a playing card or as heavy as debris and work perfectly controlled by an operator 100 kilometers (or about 62 miles) away for participants to win the prize. “Our ability to physically experience another geographic location, or to provide on-the-ground assistance where needed, is limited by cost and the simple availability of time,” said Diamandis in a press release. “The ANA Avatar XPRIZE can enable creation of an audacious alternative that could bypass these limitations allowing us to more rapidly and efficiently distribute skill and hands-on expertise to distant geographic locations where they are needed, bridging the gap between distance, time and cultures.” A few of the ideas floated by X Prize are incredible. Strap into a suit and help your elderly parents with yard work or taking a dog for a walk. Alternatively, pitch in with disaster relief thousands of miles away. Under the current guidelines, submitted bots will be judged based on the five senses. Operators should have full range of vision and depth perception when controlling the avatars. Their voices should be clearly audible to people interacting with the avatars and the operators should be able to hear ambient noises. Applications are also judged based on set up time and how long the robots can operate without a charge. One of the most interesting judging criteria is “touch.” Operators should be able to lift and carry heavy objects distances up to 3 kilometers (or about 1.8 miles), recognize the temperature of the objects they touch, and sensors should tell them where on the avatars they’re being touched. There are smaller $1 million milestone prizes in April 2020 and April 2021 (winning or losing the smaller prizes doesn’t disqualify teams from the big one), with the $8 million grand prize awarded in October 2021.

"Josh Voorhees, Josh Voorhees","Don Blankenship speaks at a town hall meeting at West Virginia University on March 1, 2018. Fearing another Alabama-like disaster, Republicans are upping their efforts to prevent an ex-con coal baron from becoming their Senate nominee in West Virginia next month—going from silence and snubs to barely concealed subterfuge. A newly formed super PAC with ties to the GOP establishment is spending nearly $700,000 on attack ads against Don Blankenship, the former Massey Energy CEO who spent a year in prison in connection with an explosion that killed 29 men at one of his West Virginia mines in 2010. Republicans are afraid that conviction will be enough to tank Blankenship in a general election, spoiling the party’s chances of defeating Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin this fall in a state Trump won by more than 40 points in 2016. The 30-second spots, which began airing in the state late last week, accuse Massey Energy of contaminating local drinking water with “toxic coal slurry,” all while Blankenship pumped clean water into his own mansion. “Isn’t there enough toxic sludge in Washington?” the narrator says. (The company reached a settlement with hundreds of West Virginia residents in 2011, but it did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.) Notably, the GOP tried to put some distance between itself and the attack. The group behind it, Mountain Families PAC, was created late last month as a standalone entity. But it didn’t take reporters long to connect the dots. The Charleston Gazette-Mail noticed almost immediately that the address the group gave to the FEC was an Arlington, Va., P.O. Box, and that its treasurer previously worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Politico then reported additional ties to Senate Republicans over the weekend. The covert attack comes as Republicans have spent months trying to figure out how to derail Blankenship’s campaign. They fear that if they attack him directly, they’ll only boost his anti-establishment bona fides in a possible repeat of what happened in Alabama last year, when Donald Trump and national Republicans tried and failed to stop Roy Moore from getting the nomination. Moore won anyway, and then promptly lost the general election after damning allegations about his conduct with teenage girls. Earlier this month, the White House attempted to thread the needle in West Virginia by having the president snub Blankenship during an official visit to the state. Flanked by Blankenship’s two rivals—state attorney general Patrick Morrisey and U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins—Trump praised both men but made sure to not to mention Blankenship. Passive-aggressive attacks might not be enough to derail Blankenship, who is spending big on campaign ads that pledge allegiance to Trump and is also offering a similar conspiracy- and persecution-themed pitch to voters. Blankenship maintains that he was merely a “ political prisoner ” in the Obama administration’s war on coal and an innocent victim of a Benghazi-style cover-up. When he first jumped into the race last fall, many wondered whether his motivation was less about the Senate and more about rehabbing his image after getting out of prison. But with only three weeks to go until the primary, Blankenship has emerged as a top contender in a race that could help decide control of the Senate. He’s also proven willing to take covert action of his own. He recently launched a campaign website masquerading as an independent fact-checking organization, one that claims Blankenship was “unfair[ly]” convicted for his role in the mine explosion while simultaneously claiming he was “never even charged for anything related” to it.

Jamie Ducharme and Arpita Aneja,"President Donald Trump on Thursday denounced a George Washington University study that attributed 2,975 deaths to Hurricane Maria, suggesting that the estimate — which is far higher than the 64 deaths initially reported — was politically motivated. In response, representatives from the GWU Milken Institute School of Public Health said they stand by their science, and “are confident that the number — 2,975 — is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date.” But how can a death toll jump from 64 to nearly 3,000 ? The answer hinges on one fundamental question: What constitutes a disaster death? “You have to think of [64 and 3,000] as two different indicators,” says Carlos Santos-Burgoa, one of the GWU report’s authors and a professor of global health at the school. “The 64 comes from death certificates that have stated that the death is related to the hurricane,” such as those caused by drowning, falling buildings or projectile debris, Burgoa explains. Meanwhile, the number highlighted in the GWU report, which was based on an analysis of death certificates filed between September 2017 and February 2018, represents deaths “in excess of what would have been predicted if there had not been a hurricane, regardless of if a physician says it was related or not,” Burgoa says. This could include deaths caused by dangerous conditions encountered while evacuating, for example, or by disruptions to medical care stemming from widespread, lasting power outages in Puerto Rico, for example. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines say that these indirect deaths should be counted in disaster totals, but the GWU report found that “many physicians were not oriented in the appropriate certification protocol” and that “most physicians have no formal training in completing a death certificate and thus are not aware of appropriate death certification practices.” Add in challenges like impaired communications and transportation, which may affect normal reporting processes, and it’s easy to see how, by GWU’s estimates, some 2,911 deaths that should have been counted as storm-related were not. (After the storm, in October 2017, the CDC pushed out more detailed information about what qualifies as a disaster-related death and what does not.) An earlier study of Hurricane Maria deaths, published in July by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found an even wider margin of error. Harvard’s report, which was based on systematic household surveys throughout Puerto Rico, reached a “conservative” estimate of 4,645 storm-related deaths between September and December 2017, many as a result of “delayed or interrupted health care.” Household surveys are often used to estimate death counts when regular reporting channels are unavailable or nonexistent. This number may be higher than GWU’s, Burgoa says, because it used select households to extrapolate the total number of deaths. Burgoa likens the process to political polling, which can capture trends but may not be totally accurate. “When you do political campaigns, you do surveys. But at the end, there is a result,” he says. “We had the result because we had the total universal deaths.” These calculation complications are nothing new. Determining death counts after Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, was a similarly convoluted process. A study published in 2014, almost a full decade after the hurricane left huge swaths of New Orleans flooded and hospitals without power, attributed 1,170 deaths to Hurricane Katrina — 184 more than a widely cited 2008 study on the subject, thanks to new availability of autopsy data. Both of these numbers, however, were considerably lower than an initial estimate from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which initially cited the death toll at 1,833. Death tolls were much lower after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast in 2012, but calculations vary there, too. The National Hurricane Center said at least 87 deaths were directly or indirectly caused by Hurricane Sandy, while the CDC, using Red Cross data, tallied 117 deaths tied to the storm. The CDC has strengthened its guidance around what counts as a disaster-related death in the years since Sandy and Katrina, but Burgoa says there’s still work to be done in clarifying and disseminating those policies. But more importantly, he says exact death counts are not the most meaningful piece of information to be gleaned from studying disasters. “Our goal is to provide a way to move forward, to get away from the controversy of numbers and move into, what can we do to protect and prevent [deaths] in the future?” Burgoa says. “That is what is important for public health: What are the needs of the population?”","Trump criticized a study that estimates the Hurricane Maria death toll at 3,000.

Terry Glavin,"Andy Yan is a 42-year-old East Vancouverite who came up out of the proud working class ranks of Van Tech high school, toiling on weekends in the kill tank at the old Hallmark Poultry Factory on Clark Drive. He set out on a career in urban regeneration and applied demographics that took him to projects in New Orleans, New York City and San Francisco.
Nowadays hes the director of the City Program at Simon Fraser University, and while hes too modest to boast about it, along the way hes picked up a couple of exceedingly rare civic distinctions.
The first is the enduring enmity of all the politicians, real estate speculators, white-collar currency pirates and money launderers who have turned Vancouver into a global swindlers paradise for real estate racketeering, a city that is now also one of the worlds most hopelessly pathetic urban landscapes of housing affordability. The second thing Yan has earned is an unfettered and unimpeachable right to say I told you so.
Three years ago, Yan was anxious to get a handle on the role foreign capital was playing in Vancouvers weirdly convulsing real estate market. At the time, Yans main gig was his work as an urban planner with Bing Thom Architects, on contract as an urban planner. When Yan published the results of his research in November, 2015, it came as a shock, for two main reasons. It seemed to conclusively prove what everybody knew but nobody was supposed to say out loud. And it broke a taboo that was enforced so absurdly that Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson resorted to dismissing Yans research as racist.
Yan found that buyers with non-Anglicised Chinese names had picked up two-thirds of 172 houses sold over a six-month period beginning in September 2014 in Vancouvers posh west side neighbourhoods. Contrary to public perception, however, the buyers werent just showing up with bags of cash to make their buys. Some of Canadas biggest banks were in on it. Roughly 80 per cent of the deals involved a mortgage, and half of the mortgages were held by two banks CIBC and HSBC.
WATCH: 5 signs Canada is in the grips of real estate mania
Canadas banks have mastered the manipulation of clandestine back channels around Chinas currency control regulationsthe same routes that well-connected Chinese multi-millionaires have been using to shift up to a trillion dollars worth of yuan out of China every year. What wasnt clear about what was happening on Vancouver s west side, however, was who the real buyers were, exactly. The new homeowners most commonly stated occupation: housewife or homemaker.
Fast forward three years. The weirdness that Yan documented in Point Grey, Dunbar, Kerrisdale and Shaughnessy has rapidly spread southward and eastward, decoupling the bonds linking incomes with housing values across Burnaby, Richmond, Coquitlam, all the way out to Surrey and White Rock on the Canada-U.S. border. Metro Vancouvers real estate market is now a dystopian tableau of panic buying, tax fraud, property flipping, overseas pre-construction condominium sales, stone cold speculation and elaborate, multiple-account money transfer rigmaroles that are the conduit of choice for drug cartel tycoons. Not even the heaviest regulatory hands at the controls of the Chinese Communist Partys surveillance state seem capable of shutting the networks down.
Its not just about shady Chinese moneynot by a long shot. Vancouvers old establishment property developers and real-estate companies fed the frenzies and made a killing. Along the way, they greased the skids by pouring buckets of money into Gregor Robertsons now-dying Vision Vancouver civic party and Christy Clarks Liberal Party. Robertson is now a sad figure, his legacy a shambles, his term up in October, and even his celebrated relationship with his glamorous girlfriend, the Chinese pop star Wanting Qu, fell apart last year. Qus mother, a Communist Party official in Harbin, remains on trial on charges of embezzling $70 million in a land swindle. Christy Clark is history, too. Her government was toppled last year by John Horgans New Democrats. With at least 60,000 Chinese immigrant investors sloshing their money around Metro Vancouver real estate over the past few years, federal politicians, tooLiberals, mainlyhave been more than happy to rake it in at cash-for-access soirees and in generous donations to election campaign war chests.
READ: Why Canadians need to start worrying about China
In these ways, in Vancouver’s political circles, and in polite company, one simply didnt mention the way the city’s housing market was being restructured to serve as an offshore investment bolthole for billions of dollars worth of shadow currency being spirited out of China, Iran, Russia and other such kleptocracies. But back in 2015, when the profoundly caucasian Mayor Robertson attempted to dismiss Yans findingsIm very concerned with the racist tones that are implied here, Robertson saidit was a smear too far.
Yans great-grandfather was allowed into Canada only after being obliged to pay the infamously racist head tax Ottawa put in effect to keep out working-class Chinese immigrants. Students, merchants and diplomats were exempt. The head tax was in place until 1923. Yan wasn’t going to put up with Robertson’s backchat, and by that time, Vancouvers ethnic Chinese community leaders had similarly lost their patience. White real estate moguls and politicians like Robertson persisted in proclaiming their anti-racist bona fides and purporting to be the champions of Vancouvers Chinese community by shutting down public debates about the regions housing catastrophe. Brandon Yan, a civic activist and volunteer on Vancouvers planning commission, put it best: Lets leave it to the rich white dudes to decide whats racist, right?
Vancouvers condo king Bob Renniea primary financial backer of Robertsons NDP-tilting Vision Vancouver team and also the chief fundraiser for the NDPs adversaries in Christy Clarks Liberalshad cultivated a particularly brazen habit of it. So you had these whispers about racism being used to shut down a dialogue about affordability and the kind of city we want to build here, Andy Yan explained. Its a kind of moral signalling to camouflage immoral actions. Its opportunism, and its a cover for the tremendous injustices that are emerging in the City of Vancouver and across the region. Its a weird Vancouver thing. Its very annoying. Its kale in the smoothies or something.
READ: The battle to clean up B.C.
While the politicians and their friends in the property industry were making speeches about diversity and the importance of having sensitive feelings, foreign ownership grew to account for more than $45 billion dollars worth of Metro Vancouver residential property. Within Vancouver city limits, 7.6 per cent of all residential properties are now owned directly by individuals whose principal residence is outside of Canada, by the definition of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Roughly one in ten Vancouver condos are owned by non-residents. And thats just the owners we know about.
Transparency International reckons that perhaps half of Vancouvers most expensive properties are owned by shell companies or trusts, with the nominal owners commonly listed as student, housewife, or homemaker. Roughly 99 per cent of the single detached houses within Vancouvers city limits are now valued in excess of $1 million. More than 20,000 Vancouver homes are vacant, year round. Vancouvers rental vacancy rate is hovering just below one per cent.
Im always careful about using biomedical analogies, Yan told me the other day, but what was like a little skin ailment, if you will, over the last 10 or 15 years, has become a full fledged cancer. Over just the past four years, throughout Metro Vancouver, homes worth $1 million or more have risen from 23 per cent of the housing market in 2014 to 73 per cent of the market now. Yan has been putting together a series of maps that show how the $1 million red line has been moving inexorably across the region, deep into the suburbs. But what those maps dont do is they dont factor in transportation costs, Yan said. The top two expenditures of any Canadian household is shelter and transportation. God help you if you factor in child care. The whole map might as well be red. A number of factors have all come together to produce this catastrophic situation, but what was a small concentrated pattern in the west side of Vancouver has now metastasized to hit every single part of the region, and its similarly metastasized into the rest of the economy.
As for where things are headed, Horgans NDP government has raised expectations, mainly because of Attorney-General David Ebys avowed determination to chase dirty money out of Vancouvers housing market and bust up the gangland playground B.C.s provincially-licenced casinos have becomemoney laundered through casinos has also been pouring into residential property acquisitions. In Tuesday’s throne speech,  delivered by Lt.-Gov. Judith Guichon, Horgan’s government directly addressed tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in the real estate market, hinting that a speculation tax is in the works. Next week, the New Democrats release their first full budget. The housing file, however, falls mainly to the more timid Carole James, former NDP leader and now deputy premier and finance minister. Preliminary indications arent particularly promising.
With short-term AirBnB rentals swallowing up long-term rental inventory, Yan was less than impressed with James solution, announced last week: short-term rental outfits will now pay the eight per cent provincial sales tax, and two or three per cent in municipal taxes. Thats like taxing cigarettes to pay for lung cancer treatments, Yan said.
READ: Ian Young on Vancouver’s ‘freak show’ housing market
Developing appropriately punitive taxes to discourage property-flipping and offshore pre-construction sales those are obvious fixes. But knowing how to fix things requires a clear understanding of whats wrong, Yan says, and closing the bare trust loophole that allows property owners to hide their holdings is a must-do. Ontario closed the loophole back in the 1980s. Clarks Liberals promised to close it, but they never did.
In the meantime, Yan is focusing on converting hidden-away data into publicly comprehensible information. Some key information Yan has drawn from a trove recently released by Statistics Canadas Canadian Housing Statistics Program, for instance, shows that simply building more condominiums wont do. A condo building boom in Metro Vancouver has kept the property developers happy, but theres no evidence that the boost in supply has lessened demand or beaten back prices. Nearly one in five condos built in Vancouver since 2016 were snapped up by non-residents.
To a certain extent, theres nothing new here, Yan said, pointing to the Guinness familys financing of the Lions Gate Bridge in the 1920s, and the opening up of the British Properties on Burrard Inlets north shore. But what is new is the hyper-commodification of residential real estate, mixed in with an intensification of global flows of people and capital. Its just a statement in fact. Were talking about the globalization of the Chinese economy and its impacts.
Yan says there may be some solutiona mix of remedies, new laws, purpose-built rental housing, tax adjustments and so onthat does not mean a collapse in Metro Vancouvers real estate prices. Channelling foreign investment in such a way as to serve the public interest might be possible. But whether this comes out as a bubble-popping isnt the point. Thats a secondary concern to the kind of society we want to build. We need to go back to civic virtues.
“We need to talk about the sacrifices we are willing and we need to make for the greater good of the community. We need to have a discussion about what the public good is, and what we are willing to sacrifice to make it happen.","Hated by politicians, speculators and money-launderers, Andy Yan's data on Vancouver housing has earned him the right to say, 'I told you so'",2019-03-30T01:28:55Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Macleans.ca'}",Analyst who exposed Vancouver's real estate disaster,https://www.macleans.ca/economy/realestateeconomy/andy-yan-the-analyst-who-exposed-vancouvers-real-estate-disaster/,https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FEB13_GLAVIN_VANCOUVER_POST.jpg,,Macleans.ca,1
Alex Cranz,"It might look like the $300 GoPro Hero 5 (which is now two years old), or the $400 GoPro Hero 6 (which was released last year) but this is actually a brand new, and much cheaper GoPro. Simply called the GoPro Hero, this new $200 action camera will feature most of the best features of the Hero 5 and Hero 6, at half the cost. The big reason to buy a GoPro Hero 5 or 6 over something else is due to the quality of the 4K footage produced by such a tiny and durable camera. Unfortunately there’s no shooting 4K video with the new Hero. Instead you’ll be stuck with 1440p or 1080p. There’s also no shooting at high frame rates like 120 or 240 frames per second. The new GoPro Hero is strictly a 60fps or lower shooter. But if you can somehow get past that pretty big downside the Hero will include most of the other stuff that has traditionally made the GoPro superior to other cheaper action cameras. It’s waterproof up to 30 feet without additional housing, has voice control, video stabilization, and a 2-inch touch display. It also works with the loads of GoPro accessories already on the market. It’s not the first cheap GoPro, inexpensive Heroes have existed before, but it’s been more than two years since GoPro has offered a budget camera with an actual display. And this return to budget cameras could be a very good thing for a company that has struggled mightily in the last year. The company’s stock continues to hover around an all time low of $4.80 and since January has faced rumors of a potential sale. The reasons are multifold. First there’s the Karma drone disaster, which went off so poorly the company laid of hundreds in January. Second, the camera maker has been clobbered in sales by cheaper action cameras from companies like Sony and Yi. That was no doubt one of the reasons GoPro signed a licensing deal last week with Jabil (who actually builds many of GoPro’s cameras) to put its camera tech into third party devices. Finally GoPro has run into a problem also faced by the Apple’s iPad, where people buy one and rarely if ever upgrade it. A new cheaper GoPro Hero isn’t necessarily going to fix any of those problems, but it could entice people put off by the high price of previous GoPros. Until now you either had to spend a lot of money for a potentially too much camera or you had to seek out a knock off. Now you can drop $200 and get nearly everything that’s made GoPro one of the best action cameras around.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"Pokémon Go developer Niantic thinks being the very best like no one ever was should include a bit of community cleanup in honor of this year’s upcoming Earth Day. Niantic, in partnership with conservation organization Mission Blue, is encouraging players to participate in local cleanup events with some in-game incentives. As some may know, however, a live event from Niantic could potentially turn into a dumpster fire. Right now, Niantic lists a total of 37 events happening across 12 different countries, all hosted by the company, along with local nonprofits. You can sign up for a cleanup event on Pokémon Go ’s Earth Day Cleanup page. Though the events are scheduled to last for about two hours, Niantic suggests you check the specific event for which you’re registered. The events are only open to participants ages 13 and older. If the thought of joining a community cleanup effort isn’t enough to get you out the door in support of environmental activism, I don’t blame you. Pokémon Go and live events don’t exactly mix well, as evidenced by the disaster that was Pokémon Go Fest, which left many paying attendees without access to the lovable monsters during the event. Niantic recently paid $1.6 million to settle a lawsuit related to the debacle that was its inaugural festival in Chicago. Still, Niantic’s sweetening the pot for those more interested in catching ‘em all. If at least 1,500 people participate in the challenge within 48 hours, every trainer (whether they participated or not) will earn 2x Stardust for capturing Ground, Water, and Grass-type Pokémon. If 3,000 people participate, that multiplier gets bumped up to 3x Stardust when capturing those same types. The cleanup events could be a great way to meet like-minded players.

Jason Schreier,"When Final Fantasy XIV first launched, in 2010, it was such a disaster that publisher Square Enix made the unprecedented move of taking it offline and launching a brand new version three years later. What was it like to be there? Today on Kotaku Splitscreen, we discuss. Michael-Christopher Koji Fox, who heads up the translation department for the Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, joins the show to talk about how he joined Square on the day it became Square Enix way back in 2003, his work on both Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV, and what it was like being part of the catastrophic launch and subsequent rejuvenation of Square’s biggest MMORPG. Listen here: Get the MP3 right here, or read an excerpt: Michael-Christopher Koji Fox: Getting to work on the original [ Final Fantasy ] XIV was for me really exciting at the beginning, because when I joined [ Final Fantasy ] XI, all the groundwork had been done. The style had already been decided, the characterizations had already been decided, the world was already built. I was just hired to translate the text. Whereas with [ Final Fantasy ] XIV, it was my opportunity to get in from the ground floor, and work with the world-building team, and the scenario teams to create this world and create things like the dragon language, which I got a chance to create from the ground up, or create the naming conventions for the characters and languages and backgrounds and things like that. Getting a chance to decide on characterizations, and the directions some of these stories might go was really exciting to me. But at the same time, being there and seeing how the game development was going, and kinda realizing that, ‘OK this might not be good,’ and then fully realizing, ‘OK this is not gonna be good.’ But then coming to that realization that ‘OK, it doesn’t matter what the project is doing right now, I need to concentrate on my section,’ so trying to get at least a great localization out there. Then comes the launch, then comes the blowback from fans, then the change in leadership over here. It was a whirlwind. People were frustrated, some people were leaving the project, some people were depressed about what had happened, they’d put two or three years of their lives into this and it’d come to this. And then [ A Realm Reborn director Naoki] Yoshida-san comes in and gives us all a new hope, he gives us this vision, takes the reigns and turn things around. I’d never been part of anything like that, where you’re so dedicated to something, you see it come crashing down, and then you see someone come in and bring it back up. And it wasn’t just him bringing it up, it was him telling us that we could do it, and us believing in that, and following him, and really bringing it back. There were major ups and downs. Literally very depressed for a long amount of time, going home on the last train, so I’d take a train at 12:30, go home at maybe two in the morning, and literally be back on a train five hours later, coming into work for the next day, times three or four weeks of crunch, only to see the worst reviews you’d ever seen, and thinking ‘Oh my god,’ but then getting a second chance. Doing the exact same thing, staying late, but not feeling bad about it knowing that you’re taking things in the right direction. Just getting a chance to do that has been exciting, and it’s been a growing experience for me. No longer can I take things for granted, because I know that the minute you stop putting 100% in, the same thing could happen again, so you’re always on your toes now.

Peter Kotecki,"Communication networks are often the first to fail when natural disasters strike. More than 30 millions people in the United States already do not have quality internet connectivity, and this number rises by millions during a disaster. In an effort to make the internet more resilient, Mozilla runs the Off-The-Grid Internet Challenge, which rewards new ideas for deploying wireless communication to areas where internet access is unavailable. A company called Rhizomatica took home the $400,000 prize this year for HERMES, or the High­-frequency Emergency and Rural Multimedia Exchange System. HERMES does not rely on cables or satellites. Instead, it uses short-wave radio and Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technology, which makes it reliable in rural areas and disaster scenarios, according to Rhizomatica. The system, contained in two suitcases, allows people to make local calls and send text messages, and it allows people who are not at disaster sites to relay information to those affected. ""In an emergency, you want to be able to tell people you're okay,"" Rhizomatica said in a statement. ""HERMES allows you to tell anyone, anywhere with a phone number that you're okay. And that person can respond to you over text or with a voice message."" Rhizomatica's main user-facing technology is 2G GSM, the most common digital communication technology worldwide. It also lets people connect to the network for a longer period of time, as it drains the battery minimally. ""By investing in affordable, scalable solutions like these, we can unlock opportunity for millions of Americans,"" Jim Kurose, head of the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation, which sponsors the competition, said in a statement. The version of HERMES presented at the Off-The-Grid Internet Challenge cost about $7,000, Peter Bloom, general coordinator at Rhizomatica, told Business Insider. Bloom said the company believes it can lower the cost significantly by using different hardware, and it hopes to offer HERMES for $1,000 one day. Rhizomatica has not yet decided whether it will sell HERMES as a standalone product for the public, Bloom said. It's more likely that the company will deploy the suitcases to organizations.","Internet connectivity can fail when natural disasters strike, and it is not available in some rural areas to begin with.

Up to 57,000 people could be forced to leave the US by 5 January 2020, when their temporary protected status (TPS) will be revoked. Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1999. The Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The 2020 deadline gives time for people with TPS ""to arrange for their departure or to seek an alternative lawful immigration,"" the statement reads. Honduras's government said it ""profoundly regrets"" the end of the programme. The country's ambassador to the US, Marlon Tabora, said the country could not handle repatriating tens of thousands of people, Reuters news agency reports. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Trump administration has announced plans to end TPS for several nationalities ""These families have lived in the United States for 20 years and re-integrating them into the country will not be easy if they decide to return,"" he said. The Trump administration previously announced plans to cancel TPS for immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador, which they had been given after natural disasters in those countries. Critics believe the US government is ignoring continuing dangers in home countries in its decisions to cancel TPS. But some argue the repeated extension of the programme has resulted in de facto residency rights for those who benefit.

"USA TODAY Sports, Nick Schwartz, USA TODAY Sports","Cavaliers-Warriors is the NBA Finals matchup analysts predicted at the start of the season, and though it seemed unlikely at times that LeBron could carry his team or that the Warriors could overcome the Rockets, both the Cavs and Warriors pulled through for a fourth consecutive year. Even if the series is predictable, it's not the disaster for the NBA some fans and analysts are making it out to be. We've been hearing for years that the Warriors' dominance has trivialized the season and that Kevin Durant has ruined the NBA, but people are still tuning in. Although a Rockets-Cavaliers matchup may have been more interesting, it's likely that at least 20 million fans will watch Thursday evening to see if LeBron can carry his team against the Warriors' squad of future Hall of Famers. You might be tired of Cavs-Warriors, but the two teams have delivered a trio of NBA Finals that have been the most watched series in the last two decades. Finals ratings spiked significantly in 2015, a year after the Spurs dominated the Heat, when LeBron James led the Cavs to the finals in 2015. At the time, Cavs vs. Warriors I had the highest average viewership of any Finals matchup since Michael Jordan's last year in Chicago. Even more people watched in 2016 and 2017. Viewership has remained consistent for each chapter of the Cavs-Warriors saga, and Game 7 of the 2016 Finals drew 31 million viewers, making it the third-most watched game since 1987 (behind two Jordan series-clinchers). LeBron's Cavs may be huge underdogs and the Warriors may win in a sweep, but that doesn't mean no one will watch the games.

CAMPBELL ROBERTSON,"Despite Mr. Fairfaxs and Mr. Northams vows to remain in office, it is not clear how much support they can regain. Appearing on CBSs Face the Nation after clips of the interview with Mr. Northam were played, two Democratic members of Virginias congressional delegation, Representatives Jennifer Wexton and Don Beyer, said they still believed Mr. Northam and Mr. Fairfax should step down.
I dont believe he can effectively lead the commonwealth at this time, Ms. Wexton said of the governor. Of Mr. Fairfax, she said, I believe the lieutenant governor will do the right thing for Virginia and resign.
Neither representative called for the resignation of Mr. Herring, contrasting his heartfelt apology and outreach to African-American leaders with Mr. Northams peculiar response, first apologizing for being in the photo and then insisting it was not him. They also dismissed Mr. Fairfaxs calls for an investigation, describing the accusations against him as extremely credible.
In the Washington Post poll, nearly two-thirds of respondents said they did not know enough to form an opinion about Mr. Fairfaxs denial of the initial sexual assault allegation by Vanessa C. Tyson. The poll was taken before the second allegation of sexual assault became public.
Ms. Wexton and Mr. Beyer were not the only politicians to weigh in on the scandals in Virginia on Sunday morning. Shortly before their appearances, President Trump chimed in on Twitter, apparently alluding to the political awkwardness of scandals that may take down the black lieutenant governor while leaving in place the white governor and attorney general, who have both admitted to wearing blackface.

"NATALIE KITROEFF, DAVID GELLES, JAMES GLANZ and HANNAH BEECH","At a news conference on Thursday, Dagmawit Moges, Ethiopias minister of transportation, said the flight crew had performed all the procedures, repeatedly, provided by the manufacturer, but were not able to control the aircraft.
The report, which could change in the coming months when its completed, doesnt rule out the potential for pilot error in the Ethiopian crash. And some pilots in the United States raised doubts about whether the problems on board had been properly handled.
They did not follow the Boeing procedures, said Hart Langer, a former Pan Am pilot and United Airlines executive. If the pilots had used the electric controls to pull the nose up more, he said, they would have been able to recover the plane.
Had they done that, it would have cut out the MCAS input, he said.
When Boeing outlined the emergency process in November after the Lion Air disaster, many pilots were confident that the new instructions were enough to avoid a crash. However, pilots didnt test the updated procedures in flight simulators, because few airlines had them for the 737 Max.
The problems with the Ethiopian Airlines flight started almost immediately after takeoff, according to the report, amplifying the pressure for pilots to act. About two minutes after takeoff, a safety system warned, Dont sink, multiple times.
A sensor that measures the angle at which the plane is flying began producing erroneous readings, suggesting that the plane was about to stall. There are two so-called angle of attack sensors on the plane, and the one on the left began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from the one on the right. The faulty data activated the software that automatically pushed down the nose of the plane.","While the findings are not final, initial evidence has raised new concerns about whether Boeing and federal regulators provided sufficient guidance for pilots of the new 737 Max model.",2019-04-05T00:59:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Ethiopian Crash Report Indicates Pilots Followed Boeing’s Emergency Procedures,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/business/boeing-ethiopian-airlines-crash-report.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/04/business/04boeing-1/04boeing-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Tyler Lauletta,"Urban Meyer's responses to questions during a press conference announcing his three-game suspension made clear that he wasn't sorry to anyone except ""Buckeye Nation."" AP Photo/Paul Vernon On Wednesday night, Ohio State University announced head coach Urban Meyer would be suspended three games for his mishandling of allegations of domestic violence against his former assistant Zach Smith. The ruling is the end result of a two-week investigation into what Meyer knew of the allegations against Smith, and when he knew it. College football insider Brett McMurphy initially reported on allegations made by Smith's wife, Courtney, saying that the former Buckeyes assistant coach had abused her physically and emotionally. Meyer denied any knowledge of the allegations during Ohio State's media day, but further reporting revealed evidence that Meyer likely had been aware of Courtney Smith's claims, prompting the investigation. Ultimately, the committee came to the conclusion that Meyer ""fail[ed] to take sufficient management action regarding Zach Smith"" and was ""not complete and accurate on media day."" At the press conference announcing Meyer's punishment, many felt the Ohio State head coach made an embarrassment of himself, and only made more clear where the school's priorities were. Reading his statement, Meyer repeatedly apologized to ""Buckeye Nation,"" for letting them down, and the impact that his actions had on a program that he loved so dearly. Meyer said that he gave Smith the benefit of the doubt due to personal loyalties and that he did a ""poor job at media day."" ""I appreciate the opportunity to learn from a mistake, and I will work as hard as I ever have to make our strong program even stronger,"" he concluded. Through all of his apologies, one name was notably absent — that of the accuser, Courtney Smith. Listening to Meyer and athletic director Gene Smith respond to questions from reporters, it became clear that the apologies were not being offered for Courtney Smith, but rather to fans and boosters who had to go through three weeks of seeing their school's name in unflattering headlines. Meyer never mentioned Courtney Smith in his apology. When ESPN's Greg Amante asked what he would say to her, Meyer replied, ""Well, I have a message for everyone involved in this. I'm sorry we're in this situation. And, um... I'm just sorry we're in this situation."" The reply, Meyer's apparent dismissal of Smith's experience in favor of apologizing to ""Buckeye Nation,"" was widely criticized across sports media. ""Buckeye Nation,"" wrote ESPN's Heather Dinich. ""The loyal fans who pay for season tickets. The boosters who write the checks. The parents and players and recruits who would give anything to be a part of it all. Not Courtney Smith, who can't seem to escape it."" ""He sold his soul,"" said ESPN's Paul Finebaum. ""He sold his integrity. Ohio State still has one of the great college football coaches in modern history, but at what price?"" Dennis Dodd at CBS Sports was even more critical of Meyer and the school's response. ""Now we know what domestic abuse is worth in terms of missing football games — at Ohio State, it's a quarter of a season."" He went on to note that Ohio State's explanation for the timeline of who knew what and when was ""description of a borderline cover-up."" Meyer had the opportunity to acknowledge Courtney Smith, to apologize for his inaction and elevate her voice. Instead, he could only be bothered to apologize to the fans and spenders that help make him the highest-paid public employee in the state for the fact that his actions meant that he'll miss a few games.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Daniel Alpert), Daniel Alpert","Mike Segar/Reuters The last time the U.S. attempted major changes in the tax code in 1986, it set the stage for a major asset and banking crisis. With the new tax plan, as income available to service debt falls and the after-tax costs of owning a home rise, property values will fall. Since real estate asset value underpins the largest component of debt owed to financial institutions and capital markets participants, such disruption – as we saw in the late 80s and again during the global financial crisis beginning in 2008 – can become systemic. The recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) is may set off a new systemic financial crisis and push the country back into recession. Got your attention? Good. “History does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” – often attributed to Mark Twain – and we are about to experience rhyming time. The history in question here involves the last time the U.S. attempted major changes in the tax code in 1986 – trying to pull the tablecloth out from under the table settings without having the plates end up on the floor – and ended with shards of financial glass and china all over the place, in a major asset and banking crisis. Some thirty years later we now have TCJA, in connection with which Congress is once again attempting the “tablecloth trick,” with what may be similar results. The plan includes the elimination of tax deductions for state and local income taxes, the limitation of real estate property tax deductions to $10,000 per annum and the elimination of interest deductions in connection with many Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and – if the House of Representatives version of the act prevails – restricting ordinary mortgage deductibility to loans in excess of $500,000. This will have deleterious effects on the disposable incomes of households in the regions of the country accounting for the bulk of mortgage (and other) debt and will make the cost of carrying real estate, on an after-tax basis, significantly greater. As income available to service debt falls and the after-tax costs of owning a home rise, property values will fall. In fact, property values – even prior to the passage of TCJA – have already stalled out in the highest price states with the highest levels of income and property taxes. There is a reasonable chance that the latest congressional version of tax “reform” will accelerate and exacerbate what is already in the works, to the point of igniting an, arguably at least, unintended disaster. Given the overall slapdash nature of TCJA, one can hardly help but be surprised, yet I believe this potentially catastrophic rhyme of history is wholly unanticipated by members of both parties. Here’s what happened last time: Back in 1986, Congress and the Reagan administration teamed up in a major overhaul of the U.S. tax code. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) was generally considered landmark legislation and made a number of substantial changes, many quite beneficial. Ronald Reagan Presidential Library From the early days of the Reagan years, through 1986, the commercial and multifamily real estate industry was on a tear (amazing, in hindsight, because the 10 year Treasury yield fluctuated between 7.2% and 15.4% during that period). Most of the explosion in real estate acquisition and construction was driven by the enormous tax advantages conferred on the sector that emerged from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and its twin, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, allowing even individual investors to wipe out huge chunks of their tax bill by investing in real estate. As a consequence property values rose substantially with demand. Construction of commercial buildings zoomed from $80 billion per annum in 1980 to over $125 billion per annum in 1985. And with the rise in real estate volumes and values came an enormous bubble in real estate backed debt, growing by 125% during the decade. Ultimately, the industry became massively overbuilt in quite a few markets and vacancy rates began to rise. It was clear to most policymakers that the huge tax advantages enjoyed by the real estate industry were not necessary any longer. Accordingly, the TRA pared back depreciation deductions, eliminated some tax credits, and phased out tax deductions to passive individual investors in real estate (among other investments). As much of 1980s construction and investment was driven by tax benefits, the TRA’s elimination of these tax perks made real estate far less attractive and commercial and multifamily property values fell precipitously over several years, with loan losses accelerating correspondingly. This led to one-third of all U.S. Savings and Loan failing from 1986 through 1995. Including commercial banks and conventional savings banks, over 2,000 U.S. financial institutions failed during that period. In 1989, Congress established the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1989 to resolve or auction off nearly $400 billion in bank assets over the period. The U.S. economy ultimately fell into recession by 1990 and the real estate industry fell into depression-like conditions throughout the country by 1991. A direct threat to home values Bank failures in the US Andy Kiersz/Business Insider The problem, then and now, is that we can’t just change the tax environment surrounding our major financial assets, real estate being by far the largest (totaling some $70 trillion, compared to the value of all public companies which is about $30 trillion) without impacting demand for those assets and, therefore, value. Since real estate asset value underpins the largest component of debt owed to financial institutions and capital markets participants, such disruption – as we saw in the late 80s and again during the global financial crisis beginning in 2008 – can become systemic. This time, the TCJA is directly threatening the value of homes and the performance of residential mortgage debt, which have only recently semi-recovered from the crisis 10 years ago. (This contrasts with the 1986 act which disemboweled commercial and multifamily property and debt that actually fare well under TCJA) In particular, the new law is targeting the economies of, and real estate in, the nation’s most expensive and highly taxed states which – not coincidentally – is where the lion’s share of mortgage debt resides. Credit Suisse The ten states with the highest amounts outstanding per mortgage – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Virginia and the State of Washington, have over 46% of the mortgages balances outstanding in the United States – some $4.8 trillion of the U.S. total of $10.4 trillion. All except Washington State are high-income-tax states, averaging over 9% in state and local income taxes, weighted by number of homes. Many are also up there in terms of property tax levels, averaging 1.2% of assessed value per year on a similarly weighted basis. While there are some potential offsets in TCJA (such as reducing the impact of the alternative minimum tax) the new law could be incredibly disruptive. If a homeowner can no longer deduct state and local taxes, nor more than $10,000/year in property taxes, this could amount to a reduction of disposable cash equal to as much as 5% of gross income ($12,500 per year for a $250,000 earner) in the highest tax states. Given that the above ten states account for an aggregate of 38.4% of U.S. GDP, this could be the equivalent of a reduction in gross demand by as much as $354 billion of GDP (1.9% of U.S. GDP). That is bad enough, of course, but then consider how falling home prices would impact the financial institutions and investors in the mortgage markets, especially if mortgage interest deduction is also pared back. You don’t have to think long, just back to 2007 – 2012. If someone told you they could pull the tablecloth off your full laden dining room table, would you let them? Well, that’s just what Congress is telling us – be prepared to clean up the mess.

SOMINI SENGUPTA,"This year, heat has been a problem in both northern and southern hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes dont have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 91 degrees, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940.
Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, we have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities.
Some preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought.
Dr. Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. Its why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we dont. We think well make it, because weve made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong.
In our DNA, weve got this extreme resilience baked in, Dr. Kolden said. That ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.

At its height, Inkopolis featured art like this: Now Inkopolis is full of stuff like this: There have always been some shitposting and injokes in Inkopolis. It’s never just been a museum for great fan-art. Inkopolis was both a gallery and message board. Post were often positive and part of interesting ongoing discussions. It was common for the lobby to fill up with LGBTQ-positive posts as well as art-heavy discussions about furries. This melting pot of art and in-jokes kept things fresh but the scale never tipped towards one end of the other. After a small break from Splatoon 2, I’ve found that the dynamic has dramatically shifted. Outside of art related to the competitive “this versus that” Splatfests, Inkopolis teems with bizarre in-jokes and memes that drown out most art. One of the most perplexing examples was a recent obsession with toe sucking. Splatoon 2 ’s latest memes have devolved beyond art and into the realm of pure shitposting to rival the most cavalier message boards. It’s truly bizarre to watch daily Callie art and lingering Splatfest allegiance posts give way to an extended war about sexual fetishes. This is particularly strange within a Nintendo game aimed at all age groups. It’s largely harmless but Inkopolis’ tonal shift from celebratory art show to snickering in-jokes is one of the most bizarre transitions I’ve ever encountered in a gaming lobby. Weekly memes reached their nadir recently as certain community members rallied around a player named Craig. Craig received a 14 day suspension from Nintendo for poor conduct during online play and and inappropriate nickname. At the time of his suspension, Craig was using the name “Bike Cuck.” The name meant to poke fun at an online comic about a stolen bike also incorporated a common insult of forum trolls and the alt-right. Craig told Kotaku that he deserved to be banned but his story nevertheless came to dominate Inkopolis. It only faded away with the arrival of the latest Splatfest: socks versus sweaters. Perhaps I’m blinded by nostalgia for Splatoon 2 ’s launch or have missed some recent great art thanks to also taking time out to play other games. Nevertheless, returning to Inkopolis only to drown in the sea of memes takes some of the magic out of the Splatoon 2 experience. A few weeks ago, a gorgeous mural in my neighborhood was covered with a hasty piece of throw-up. Inkopolis evokes a similar feeling; something special feels like it’s been painted over and I’m not sure if I’ll ever get it back.","Splatoon 2 ’s hub world of Inkopolis is a place to relax, try out new gear, and share awesome art.

MAGGIE ASTOR,"Throughout the campaign, Mr. Kemp denied intentional voter suppression. Asked for comment on Wednesday, his spokesman directed The Times to video of a news conference where Mr. Kemp suggested that the investigation was a politically motivated distraction from more important issues.
They need to quit playing politics up there, Mr. Kemp said at the news conference, before pivoting to an attack on House Democrats for giving billions of dollars in disaster aid to Puerto Rico when we have our own farmers that are fixing to lose their farm. He said nothing about the substance of the allegations or the document requests, and his spokesman did not respond to a follow-up email.
Mr. Raffensperger, the current secretary of state, said that he had received his own letter and that his office looks forward to an open dialogue and a thorough process.
Mr. Cummings and Mr. Raskin, the Democratic committee leaders, were not immediately available for interviews on Wednesday. But their decision to open the investigation was more evidence that House Democrats, newly empowered by the November election, intend to act aggressively on issues like allegations of voter suppression that were on the back burner for the first two years of the Trump administration.
Representative Jim Jordan, the committees ranking Republican, said through a spokesman that it was highly unusual for a congressional committee to involve itself in a states election.
This is squarely in the purview of the state of Georgia, not the House Oversight Committee, Mr. Jordan said in a statement. We cant help but think that attempts by the Democrats to insert the committee into the states business is an attempt to relitigate an election result that they do not like.
Mr. Kemp narrowly defeated Ms. Abrams, who ended her campaign by declaring, This is not a speech of concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper.","The House Oversight and Reform Committee is investigating possible voting rights violations by Mr. Kemp, who presided over his own election in November.",2019-03-06T22:14:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Georgia Governor Brian Kemp Faces Investigation by House Panel,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/governor-brian-kemp-voter-suppression.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/07/us/politics/07georgia/07georgia-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Brad Udall, a senior scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on water supplies in the West, told a congressional panel last month that the lower basin uses about 10.2 million acre-feet of water from the river each year, while upstream flows provide just nine million. (An acre-foot is the volume of one foot of water over one acre, about 325,000 gallons.)
Beyond that drain, climate change is bringing on a long-term crisis. The Colorado River, and the entire Southwest, has shifted to a new hotter and drier climate, and, equally important, will continue to shift to a hotter and drier climate for several decades after we stop emitting greenhouse gases, he said in his testimony.
In an interview, Mr. Udall said the influence of climate change was already apparent in the West. Climate change is not some distant process, he said. Its here, its now, its in our faces. Its creating messes we have to deal with.
Jonathan T. Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan, said that politicians and policymakers needed to factor climate change into their plans. Lack of river water will lead people to pump more groundwater, which was deposited in the ice ages. Were using this fossil groundwater in unsustainable ways, he said.
In a warming world, Dr. Overpeck said, less water in rivers and lakes is inevitable, whatever relief a wet season might bring. But for the most part, Western political leaders dont want to talk about it, he said. It is the disaster thats over the horizon, if we dont talk about it.

"MITCH SMITH, JACK HEALY and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS","We didnt know what to do with them. We never, ever expected anything like this, Mr. Ruzicka said Monday. We just ran out of time. It was either sacrifice them or sacrifice ourselves.
Crisis has grown all too familiar for some people in the region. In Knox County, Neb., Hannah Sucha, 25, helped coordinate efforts to deliver emergency supplies including minerals, antibiotics and salt blocks to farmers hurt by the floods. Just two years ago, Ms. Sucha said, farmers and ranchers in the area were busy donating bales of their hay to ranches in Kansas and Oklahoma devastated by wildfires.
Its going to affect them for years, Ms. Sucha said. Youre not going to be able to sleep at night because youve got so much loss.
Farm experts said it was too early to quantify the full economic toll of the floods, but Steve Wellman, director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, said the disaster could cost the states livestock sector $400 million. Farm groups said it would take months or years to recover, and that residents across the region would need emergency federal aid.
Youve got a generation of young farmers on the verge of leaving; youve got a lot of mental health stress out there and that was before the storm, said Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union. You just pile this on top.
As floodwaters slowly ebbed in some places on Monday, other cities, including Fargo, N.D., were getting sandbags ready and bracing for floods from rivers overflowing with snowmelt and late-winter rains. And farmers in flooded rural areas were just starting to calculate losses and consider whether they would be able to get their fields ready for spring planting.","The Ruzicka family farm in Verdigre, Neb., on Monday.

Heather Alexandra,"Left Alive, the new game by Square-Enix, sounds amazing. It mixes intense sneaking and massive robot battles, and if that doesnt sound familiar enough, it even has art from Metal Gears Yoji Shinkawa to drive the point home. But the reality is less impressive than the concept. Left Alive is a clunky disaster whose good ideas are undercut by horrible gameplay.
Its hard to know where to even begin talking about Left Alive, which is out now for PC and Playstation 4. Conceptually, its exactly the sort of game Id want to play. Set in the universe of Square Enixs mecha strategy series Front Mission, and directed by Armored Core veteran Toshifumi Nabeshima, it focuses on a war between two fictional European nations. The conflict is exacerbated by the use of giant robots called Wanzers, who leave devastation in their wake.
You leap between the perspectives of multiple characters, including a shot-down mech pilot and a canny police detective whose investigation is complicated by the wars outbreak. The goal is to survive in the middle of the growing warzone, avoiding enemy patrols and creating improvised weapons to use when you cant avoid combat. The mood is intense, with fire-bombed cities and desperate survivors struggling to last even one more day in the wreckage. 
The promise of this concept falls apart when you actually play Left Alive. There are cool ideas here: scrounging items to craft makeshift weapons, guiding survivors to safe houses, and figuring out the best way to take down enemy mechs when the time comes. But playing Left Alive feels like traveling back in time by about a decade. The controls are stiff, aiming and firing weapons is both sluggish and lacking in any sense of impact, and the difficulty curve is so profoundly steep that youll replay segments dozens of times before succeeding. Left Alive is a brutal and often unenjoyable experience. The difficulty comes less from the encounter design and more from wrestling with controls that dont always register, enemies who perceive you far too easily, and a horrendous checkpoint system. Fail, and you can lose 10 or 15 minutes of progress. And youre going to fail. A lot.
In spite of this, I am utterly drawn to Left Alive in way Ive not been for some time. I can see the individual pieces that could make up a good experience and, in flashes, everything seems to come together. Ill scavenge for partslifted from the corpses of fallen players, added asynchronously to my playthroughand manage to take down an enemy checkpoint. Ill sneak by a patrol and climb into the cockpit of an unattended Wanzer for a brief but explosive moment of triumph, rockets blazing and enemy mechs crumpling before me. These moments point towards something astounding, but the parts never add up to a satisfactory whole. 
Some people might find these mech sections clunky, but I think theres the hint of something neat here. 
If you look at Left Alives user reviews on Steam, the ranking is currently very negative. Concerns focus on the rough gameplay but also mention a buggy PC version. Ive not run into any problems of my own playing on the PC, though it might be best to check out the PlayStation 4 version if youre curious. Still, I cant begrudge anyone who left a negative review for this game. Its a mess. Yes, I want to examine every piece of that mess, but thats just the type of gamer I am. 
Folks expecting smooth stealth and killer mech fights are going to be disappointed. Left Alive is not going to deliver them. Its a shame. Left Alive drips with style and mood. If you poke and prod, you might see a tiny glimpse of what it could have been. I want to play all of Left Alive, but Ill do it knowing that Im wading through a junkpile of a game.","Left Alive, the new game by Square-Enix, sounds amazing.

"The Salty Waitress on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Dear Salty, I am not usually the type to post reviews on the internet, but I’m not sure I have any other choice in this situation. Yesterday, a group of four of us went out to dinner at a sushi place in our town that other people have been raving about. Everything was a disaster from the start. We waited forever for our server, who didn’t apologize or anything. Then we waited forever for our appetizers, which were only half correct (she brought out two wrong dishes), and then waited again for the sushi. The food tasted fine, but the server would constantly ignore us, not apologize, not refill drinks, etc. It was just lazy. The whole dinner took three hours. When I asked to see a manager, the server rolled her eyes! The manager was clearly her friend or cousin or something, because he didn’t apologize either and didn’t seem to care that our dinner took three hours and wasn’t enjoyable. I’m ready to write all of this and more in a mean but truthful Yelp review. Other people deserve to know how crappy the service was, especially because we were told by numerous people to go here! I am usually anti-Yelp reviews, but am I right to want to post a long one about this place? Thanks, Sushi Sucked Dear Sushi Sucked, I’m old enough to remember the innocent days before Yelp reviews, when the worst you could do to damage a restaurant’s reputation was to tell every single person you knew—and maybe strangers, too—about your terrible meal. That all changed with Yelp, and now that stupid little red website runs the show. So you can see I’m generally anti-Yelp. To any customers I’ve pissed off, I’d say: If you’ve got a problem with me, pal, say it to my face. I promise I can take it. If you complain to the restaurant in person, they can have an actual conversation and ask you exactly what went wrong. That means more to the owners and then they’re more likely to believe you. When you write something online, the owners can easily write it off as just another nutjob who doesn’t know what they’re talking about. But you did try to speak up, and I’ll give you kudos for that. Here’s the catch with bitching about the service on Yelp, though—if you’ve never done the Yelp thing before, you’ll just have that one angry review on there, which would look to me like you’re just some wacko with an ax to grind. Especially if I see the other Yelp reviews for this place are mostly good, I personally wouldn’t give your three-page rant much more than a nickle’s worth of credit. (Maybe you caught the worst server on her worst night?) What I’m saying is, you’re probably not changing too many minds by posting on Yelp. If you’re still losing sleep over this, though, you could try calling the restaurant to speak to an owner or different manager—or, as a last resort, go ahead and write something on Yelp. It’ll be more for you than anyone else, though, I wager, so you have to ask yourself whether it’s really going to make you feel better. I think you’re better off keeping your grievances off the internet, but considering I answer questions about people’s grievances on the internet, take that with a grain of salt.","Dear Salty, I am not usually the type to post reviews on the internet, but I’m not sure I have any other choice in this situation.

Mix,"Following a deluge of complaints, Coinbase confirmed it suffered a glitch which resulted in charging numerous users multiple times for the same cryptocurrency purchase – some for up to 50 times the original sum. But while customers deal with negative balances, both companies remain reluctant to own up to this epic blunder. Despite initially admitting the erratic overcharges originated from its own payment processing network, Coinbase swiftly changed the tune, blaming the malfunction on Visa and recent changes to the MCC code implemented by a heap of leading financial institutions. “We’re currently investigating an issue where some customers were charged incorrectly for purchases of digital currency with credit and debit cards,” a Coinbase spokesperson told TNW. “This is related to the recent MCC code change by the card networks and card issuers charging additional fees.” “We have identified a solution and future purchases will not be affected,” the company assured. Hours after releasing this statement, the popular exchange desk took to Twitter to pin the accident on Visa. 2/ Over the last few months, large banks and card issuers requested that card networks change the MCC for purchases of digital currency. Visa changed the MCC for digital currency purchases to a code that allows large banks and card issuers to charge consumers additional fees. — Coinbase (@coinbase) February 16, 2018 The situation took an interesting twist when several hours later, Visa came forward with its own statement, insisting there was no evidence to suggest the flaw stemmed from its system. “Visa has not made any systems changes that would result in the duplicate transactions cardholders are reporting,” a Visa spokesperson said to TNW. “We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue.” “We are reaching out to this merchant’s acquiring financial institution to offer assistance and to ensure cardholders are protected from unauthorized transactions,” it continued. While the language appears deliberately vague, the statement strongly implied that it was the “merchant” – namely Coinbase – and not Visa at fault. In the meantime, broke users kept flocking to Reddit in search for a way out of this horrid affair. Coinbase had already assured users that the multiple charges were indeed a mistake, but the company was yet to clarify how affected customers can claim their money back. “We will ensure any customer affected by this issue is fully refunded,” a Coinbase spokesperson explained. Unfortunately, she could not provide a clear timeline for the refunds, other than they should take place “automatically through [the customers’] bank.” The truly appalling part is that, while the two companies were bickering over who should take the fall for this disaster, thousands of customers were stranded without any cash – or clarity how to go on about settling the exorbitant overdrafts they had incurred. “You [meaning Coinbase] drained my bank account and now I have nothing,” one user cried out on Reddit. “Welp officially broke, charged 17×1000$ on my account,” said another user. This is when Visa and Coinbase decided to co-ordinate yet another statement on the matter, this time around in collaboration with payment processing service, Worldpay. “Over the last two days, some customers who used a credit or debit card at Coinbase may have seen duplicate transactions posted to their cardholder accounts,” Visa and Wordplay explained in the statement posted on the official Coinbase blog. “This issue was not caused by Coinbase,” it continued. “Worldpay and Coinbase have been working with Visa and Visa issuing banks to ensure that the duplicate transactions have been reversed and appropriate credits have been posted to cardholder accounts.” “All reversal transactions have now been issued, and should appear on customers’ credit card and debit card accounts within the next few days,” the statement clarified further. “We believe the majority of these reversals have already posted to accounts.” Though it is encouraging that Coinbase and Visa are both vouching that affected customers will be remunerated for the wrongly billed multiple charges, it is frustrating that both companies are so actively avoiding to accept responsibility for the technical issue. The carefully phrased statements are telling: three announcements in, there is still no culprit to blame for the accidental overcharges – not according to the statements, at least. How is it possible there are numerous affected users, but no companies at fault? Someone clearly messed up – and we should not let the parties involved walk away from this without any repercussions for the terrible customer service they’ve provided. The issue was caused by a number of other separate companies and only they can resolve. If we had any power to do so, we would. We are pushing for resolution as quickly as possible. — Dan Romero (@dwr) February 19, 2018 (tweets from Coinbase Vice President/General Manager Dan Romero) Contrary to promises made by Coinbase and Visa, Redditors are still reporting being unable to claim refunds for the wrongly incurred multiple charges. But here is the kicker: users are reporting that – despite Visa’s public announcements – its customer support still blames Coinbase for the mishap. This is clearly an inconsistency in communication Visa and Coinbase should address before the confusion escalates even further. “On the phone [with] Visa,” read one post on Reddit. “They are refusing to reverse charges as instructed by Coinbase email.” A commenter in the tread was quick to second the claim. “I got the same response,” the other user said. “I also spoke to a manager at Visa who denied knowing anything about Visa ‘accepting responsibility’ for overcharging.” “Are we still getting our fund back,” asked another concerned poster. “I woke up with a negative balance way above a grand on [F]riday morning. I have [three] direct debits due on that [F]riday […] rejected and that included my rent.” In all fairness, some fortunate Coinbase customers have reported receiving refunds already – so we know the exchange desk is indeed working on a solution with Visa. The problem is that most users still have no idea when they can expect this whole matter to be resolved. In any case, it is truly scary that Coinbase and Visa can simply bail out from a howler of this magnitude without even accepting a smidgen of accountability. We should all be worried when the parties involved are more interested in protecting each other’s brands than helping their respective users. One thing is for sure though: those are not the actions of companies that have the customers’ best interest at heart.","Following a deluge of complaints, Coinbase confirmed it suffered a glitch which resulted in charging numerous users multiple times for the same cryptocurrency purchase – some for up to 50 times the original sum.

Luke Plunkett,"Hello. Are you a Disney executive, passing a few minutes downtime between acquisitions and layoffs? Maybe you work at EA, and are trying to work out how to salvage your brand’s Star Wars efforts after the disaster that is Battlefront II. Here’s a free idea: make another space shooter. If you’re new to this concept—maybe you worked your way up through the ranks green-lighting Chicken Little and Bolt, or were too busy crushing Westwood Studios to invest the time in playing—there have been three semi-serious, first-person space shooters set in the Star Wars universe already. The first two, 1993's X-Wing and 1995's TIE Fighter are among the best PC games of all time, while the third (1999's X-Wing Alliance ) wasn’t bad either. So there’s pedigree! Note : I refuse to acknowledge the awful X-Wing vs Tie Fighter. Those games were a long time ago. And there haven’t been any since, because the death of the joystick and the explosion of home console gaming killed off any hopes for the continuation of massmarket flight games. So I can see how you could confuse the lack of new games with a lack of interest in new ones. And yet, the core appeal of the series—that people love to fly Star Wars ships, blowing up Star Wars stuff while listening to Star Wars music—remains. It lingered through the excellent Rogue Squadron series (which traded first-person simulation for third-person arcade action), and more recently in Battlefront II the space shooting sequences—made by Burnout creators Criterion—were easily the highlight of the game, as brief and simple as they were. Outside traditional avenues and control schemes there are opportunities to be had in the VR space, too. Criterion’s VR mission for the first Battlefront was a tantalising glimpse into my teenage dreams, and if a few years of VR games struggling to grasp the strengths of the platform has taught us anything, it’s that the one thing everyone can agree on is that the games that work best are the ones where you’re stuck sitting down in a cockpit. Oh, and let’s not also forget there was a new Star Wars movie released last week that has people jazzed, not just for matters of the Force, but for some A+ space action as well. The Last Jedi’s opening battle showcases classic ships duking it out, old ships with new tricks, and as I sat through the film for the first time, the first thing I thought when I saw the Resistance’s giant bombers was “oh shit I want to play a video game where I fly one of these”. And yet I can’t, because this entire genre of Star Wars experience lies comatose, leaving modders alone in the dark of space to do the heavy lifting. Can one of you two just, I don’t know, do something about this? Space simulation is surely one of the easiest things to make a Star Wars game out of, with the strongest heritage of any other series based on the property and timeless reference points sitting right there to take notes from. I get that there’s probably reluctance to go big on a project like this. But you don’t need to spend $300 million on a big holiday title and destroy the lives of 800 over-worked developers. TIE Fighter was made using six polygons and a hatful of pixels (relative to modern development, anyway) and it’s still to this day one of the best video games out there. Any new Star Wars space shooter can be closer to that on the Blockbuster Spectrum than Battlefront II. If any of this sounds selfish, or a weird thing to specifically call out when everyone has dreams for video games they want made, I guess it just feels like a perfect storm at the moment, where there’s a movie inspiring people, a legacy reminding them of great games of the past and brief teases from the present as to how something like this could look/play. And it just hasn’t come together yet.","Hello. Are you a Disney executive, passing a few minutes downtime between acquisitions and layoffs?

Lindsay Dodgson,"Type A people are the go-getters in life. They're impatient because time is an important resource to them to achieve all of their goals and meet their incredibly high standards. 
 They have many strengths, like being inspirational and pushing others to succeed. But their traits can also make type A people targets for narcissists. 
Read more: What it means to be a type A, B, C, or D personality — and how to find the strength in whatever you are
 One reason for this, according to psychologist and dark personality expert Perpetua Neo, is they tend to want to give somebody more than what they receive. 
 ""Someone who is extremely type A with a problem receiving... will say no to any favours no matter how small,"" Neo said. ""This is really good bait for the narcissist, because narcissists tend to be freeloaders."" 
 Type As want to understand people 
 Type As also tend not to feel very well understood, because they pursue perfection and excellence ""in a world that wants you to be vanilla or mediocre,"" Neo said. 
 So they might work especially hard to try and understand other people. In psychology trying to fix the pain in your past with current relationships is called repetition compulsion, and it's a sign you haven't worked through your trauma. 
Being an over-giver can lead you down a dark path.

Add this to the fact type As are very logical and try to find an explanation for everything, and you have a ""perfect storm"" for a toxic relationship with a narcissist, Neo said. 
 ""They tend to want to understand the cause, for instance, 'why is my partner so impulsive, or why does my partner get into a rage or drink so much?"" Neo said. 
 ""But the problem is the person themselves. You'll never know the real cause because they're going to keep moving the finishing posts, and you're too busy with their smoke and mirrors to realise the problem is the narcissist."" 
 Being a type A with empathy is a perfect storm 
Narcissists use excuses to keep their victims hooked. They can use sob stories and even pretend to have mental health disorders to get their victims to feel sympathy. That's why empaths often get sucked into toxic partnerships with them. 
 ""When you're empathetic as well you try to understand and over-give and repair and save your narcissist, because an empath likes to save,"" Neo said. ""Type As have amazing tenacity and perseverance, so they don't give up. You basically have a perfect storm, a ticking time bomb.""

 Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and author of ""The Empath's Survival Guide,"" told INSIDER in a previous article that people with high levels of empathy end up blaming themselves, so put more and more into the relationship, even though they're getting nothing back. 
 ""It's so hard for many empaths to believe that somebody just doesn't have empathy, and that they can't heal the other person with their love,"" she said. 
 Type As can also be dangerous to narcissists 
 Although they can be targeted, type A people can also become a narcissist's worst nightmare. One of the most important defenses against dark personalities is having strong boundaries yourself, and type A people are usually aware they have the right to build them. 
 In the aftermath, they tend to learn from the experience and fortify any gaps where the narcissist got in. 
 ""Narcissists know how to hurt people and how to use people, but there's no longevity in that,"" Neo said. ""Because eventually people find out — they often have to change jobs, change cities, and their friendships tend to be pretty superficial."" 
Narcissism can often come from an intense feeling of shame, meaning their sense of self is so small and crumbly they have to build up a false one on the outside. 
 ""Whereas if you are a type A empath, you become dangerous because there is longevity to what you do,"" Neo said. ""You inspire people, and with your longevity of your relationships and inspiring people, you actually help a bunch of people to evolve faster than a narcissist.""","Narcissists know exactly who to target. Often they go after people with high levels of empathy. But they also target people who are type A. Having a type A personality means you're a go-getter, and you push others to succeed.

Tanza Loudenback,"A growing number of Americans are sacrificing a comfortable retirement in the name of love. 
 A 2018 Merrill Lynch survey revealed that 79% of US parents provide financial support to their adult children, contributing to $500 billion spent annually. That's double the amount they contribute to retirement accounts, the bank's study found. 
 Seventy-two percent of parents said they put their children's interests ahead of their own need to save for retirement, Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower previously reported. On top of that, 63% of parents reported sacrificing their own financial security for their children's sake. Specifically, Asian, Latino, and African American parents are more likely to give up financial security for their children, the report found. 
 According to a similar study from Country Financial, some people are feeling the financial squeeze from both ends. ""Millions of parents find themselves in both roles when they become 'sandwiched' between supporting their children and supporting or acting as caregivers to their aging parents."" Parents who are oversupporting today could land their children in the same position down the road. 
 A recent pair of articles by Barron's hones in on these troubling statistics and explains how parents may consider responsibly bankrolling their children. 
 ""Many financial advisors advocate abstinence — cut the financial apron strings as soon as kids land their first jobs,"" Barron's Sarah Max wrote. ""But there are ways to offer aid that put your adult children on better financial footing without creating an air of entitlement or damaging your own financial situation."" 
How close are you to being able to retire? Find out with this calculator from our partners:
 According to the Merrill Lynch survey, parents today are largely helping out with food and groceries, cell phone bills, and car expenses. While paying for school comes in fifth on the list, its financial impact is often greater. In 2018, 2.8 million Americans over 50 owed a total of $260 billion in student loans — a sevenfold increase since 2004, according to Federal Reserve data cited by CNBC. 
 ""When it comes to saving for college, the advice goes like this: Secure an emergency fund, max out the retirement accounts, and then contribute to a 529 college-savings plan. These grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free, too, as long as the money is used for education expenses,"" Barron's Reshma Kapadia wrote. 
 But lack of planning leaves some parents scrambling for funds as college approaches. Ultimately, it's best to steer clear of tapping tax-advantaged retirement accounts, financial experts told Kapadia, and treat ""college like any other investment — through the lens of risk and return."" If the child is the one taking on the debt, they should be able to repay it in under 10 years. 
 The post-college years, when parents are fast-approaching retirement, are where the true balancing act comes into play. ""Temporary assistance with rent or a couple of extra courses can morph into a pattern that lasts for years,"" Kapadia wrote. 
Many parents surveyed would make various financial sacrifices for their adult children.
 Andy Kiersz/Business Insider 
If a parent is willing and able to offer financial help to a child in a high-cost-of-living city, for example, financial experts recommend establishing a clear purpose and timeline. The most important thing is to be realistic — giving a gift or paying a percentage of rent is OK, Kapadia said, but effectively paying their bills won't end well. 
 When it comes to homebuying, 26% of parents told Merrill Lynch they would help their child with a down payment. Dana Bull, a realtor and real estate investor near Boston, says about half of her millennial clients receive financial help from parents or grandparents to buy their first home. 
 Whether the home buyer receives help in the form of a gift, loan, or co-sign, Bull said, it's important to develop a plan before starting the home-shopping process — and leave the family drama out of it. 
 Even if a parent has the means to help out — e.g. it won't derail their retirement plans — experts suggest putting the money toward their child's own savings. ""I've had many clients who offer to effectively match their adult kids' contributions to their 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA,"" Criscuolo Anthony, a CFP based in Florida, told Barron's.","Nearly 80% of American parents financially support their adult children, according to a 2018 Merrill Lynch survey.

Frederic Lardinois,"It’s a big day for Microsoft today, which announced a slew of updates across virtually all of its product lines at its Ignite conference today. Unsurprisingly, one theme this year is artificial intelligence and machine learning. Microsoft is launching new tools to bring its Cortana assistant to the enterprise, but there is also a number of other developer-centric updates and products that are launching today. One of those is an update to the Azure Machine Learning services, the company’s platform for letting anyone build and train machine learning models with a focus on prediction. With today’s update, this platform is getting a new tool that automates much of the time-consuming selection, testing and tweaking necessary to build a solid model. Like many of Microsoft’s AI initiatives, the idea here is to allow any developer to build and use these models without having to delve into the depths of TensorFlow, PyTorch or other AI frameworks. In addition to this automation service, Microsoft is also making more hardware-accelerated models for FPGAs available on Azure Machine Learning, as well as a Python SDK that will make the service more accessible from a number of popular IDEs and notebooks. Azure Cognitive Services, which plays home to most of Microsoft’s pre-built and customizable machine learning APIs, is also getting a few updates. The Cognitive Services speech service for speech recognition and translation is now generally available, for example, and Microsoft argues that the voices its deep learning-based speech synthesis system generates are now nearly indistinguishable from recordings of real people. The same, of course, is true of Google’s and AWS’s speech synthesis engines, so we’ll have to hear them ourselves to see how true to life these voices are. Microsoft’s Bot Framework SDK is also getting an update that promises to make human and computer interactions more natural. Version 4 of this framework is now generally available, and Microsoft specifically highlights that building a first bot is now easier. Since the hype around bots has died down significantly, though, we’ll have to see if developers still care now that most consumers tend to shy away from interacting with these systems. Given that the term ‘AI’ doesn’t always have the most positive connotations (and not just because developers prefer a more precise terminology), it’s maybe also no surprise that Microsoft is launching a new program today that aims to “harness the power of artificial intelligence for disaster recovery, helping children, protecting refugees and displaced people, and promoting respect for human rights.” This new AI for Humanitarian Action project is a $40 million, five-year program that is part of the company’s AI for Good Initiative.","It’s a big day for Microsoft today, which announced a slew of updates across virtually all of its product lines at its Ignite conference today.

James Rogers,"A new theory on the Chernobyl disaster could shed fresh light on the world’s worst nuclear accident. In an article published in the journal Nuclear Technology, scientists argue that the first of two explosions reported by eyewitnesses was a nuclear, not a steam explosion, as is widely thought. Instead, the researchers believe that the first explosive event noted by eyewitnesses was a jet of debris ejected to an altitude of almost 2 miles by a series of nuclear explosions within the Chernobyl reactor. Some 2.7 seconds later, they say, a steam explosion ruptured the reactor and sent yet more debris into the atmosphere at lower altitudes. “We realized that we, based on real measurements and observations, could explain details in the Chernobyl accident scenario and the nature of the two major explosions that occurred during a few seconds that unfortunate night more than 31 years ago,” explained the report’s lead author Lars-Erik De Geer, in an email to Fox News. BEWARE RADIOACTIVE WILD BOARS: HUNTERS IN SWEDEN CONCERNED ABOUT CHERNOBYL’S FRIGHTENING LEGACY The 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine sparked a widespread environmental disaster. Thirty workers died either from the explosion at the number four reactor or from acute radiation sickness within several months. The accident exposed millions in the region to dangerous levels of radiation and forced a wide-scale, permanent evacuation of hundreds of towns and villages in Ukraine and Belarus. A helicopter dropping concrete onto the fourth reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power after its explosion is seen in this 1986 file picture. (Reuters) A cloud of radioactive particles from the disaster reached other parts of parts of Europe, such as Sweden. The report cites xenon isotopes detected by the V.G. Khlopin Radium Institute in Leningrad four days after the accident. Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, is about 599 miles north of Chernobyl. Xenon isotopes were also reported in Cherepovets, about 622 miles north of Chernobyl. The result of recent nuclear fission, the isotopes were likely caused by a recent nuclear explosion, according to the experts. This is in contrast to the main Chernobyl debris that contained equilibrium xenon isotopes from the reactor’s rupture and drifted toward Scandinavia. This new theory presented by experts from the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute and Stockholm University, could offer fresh insight into the disaster. The new analysis could help prevent similar incidents from occurring, experts say. INSIDE THE NEW EFFORT TO ENTOMB CHERNOBYL’S WRECKAGE A panel with a portrait of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin and an abandoned building are seen at the 30 km (19 miles) exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in the abandoned village of Orevichi, Belarus, March 12, 2016. (REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko) The destroyed reactor tank suggests that the first explosion caused temperatures high enough to melt a 6.6-foot bottom plate in part of the core, the researchers said, noting that this damage is consistent with a nuclear explosion. In the rest of the core, the bottom plate was relatively intact, but had dropped by nearly 13 feet. This, they say, is consistent with a steam explosion, noting that the temperature would not be sufficient to melt the plate, but could generate enough pressure to force it down. Additionally, seismic measurements and eyewitness reports of a blue flash above the reactor a few seconds after the first explosion could also support the new theory of a nuclear explosion followed by a steam explosion. De Geer told Fox News that the Chernobyl disaster could only happen in Soviet-era reactors built using a design known as Reaktor Bolshoy Moshchnosti Kanalnyy (RBMK), or ‘High Power Channel-Type Reactor.’ There are 11 RBMK Reactors operating in Russia, according to The World Nuclear Association. “Our new theory deepens the understanding of the severe effects that can be the result of some original design faults in such reactors,” he said. “Much has been corrected in remaining RBMK reactors, but a better understanding of what really happened in 1986 must of course be of great value for overseeing and possibly improving the design also in the future.” UKRAINE MARKS 30 YEARS SINCE CHERNOBYL DISASTER The disaster shone a spotlight on lax safety standards and government secrecy in the former Soviet Union. The explosion on April 26, 1986, was not reported by Soviet authorities for two days, and then only after winds had carried the fallout across Europe and Swedish experts had gone public with their concerns. The final death toll from Chernobyl is subject to speculation, due to the long-term effects of radiation. Estimates range from 9,000 by the World Health Organization to one of a possible 90,000 by the environmental group Greenpeace. The terrible environmental fallout of Chernobyl is still being felt. A wild boar with more than 10-times the safe limit of radiation, for example, was recently killed by hunters hundreds of miles away in Sweden. The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Dan Maloney,"In general, tattoo artists are not electrical engineers. That’s fine; the world needs both professions. But when you need a circuit designed, you’re better off turning to an EE rather than a tattoo artist. And you certainly don’t want an EE doing your new ink. Disaster lies that way.
Surprisingly, [Missa]’s tattoo of a heart-shaped circuit turned out at least to be plausible design, even if it’s not clear what it’s supposed to do. So her friend [Jeremy Elson] took up the challenge to create a circuit that looked like the tattoo while actually doing something useful. He had to work around the results of tattoo artistic license, like sending traces off to the board’s edge and stranding surface-mount components without any traces. The artist had rendered an 8-pin DIP device, albeit somewhat proportionally challenged, so [Jeremy] went with an ATtiny85, threw on a couple of SMD resistors and a cap, and placed two LEDs for the necessary blinkenlights. Most of the SMDs are fed from traces on the back of the board that resurface through vias, and a small coin cell hidden on the back powers it. One LED blinks “Happy Birthday [Missa]” in Morse, while the other blinks prime numbers from 2 to 23 – we’ll assume this means it was [Missa]’s 23rd birthday.

THOMAS FULLER,"Ms. Breed, whose brother is in prison and whose sister died of a drug overdose, says she would remove encampments from the streets within a year. She has vowed to crack down on vandalism and graffiti, and is proposing to increase the use of legal conservatorship, essentially forcing mentally ill and drug dependent people off the streets. “Taking away someone’s civil liberties is not something that I take lightly, but if we want to see a change on our streets we have got to do something different than what we’re doing now,” Ms. Breed said in a campaign speech last week at a Jewish community center. “I plan to introduce the kind of solutions that in some ways can be quite controversial, but are necessary.” Ms. Alioto, whose father, Joseph Alioto, was mayor in the late 1960s and 1970s, is critical of what she calls leftist politicians out of touch with the concerns of San Franciscans. She uses the example of the decision by the board of supervisors to ban fur clothing and products in March. “People are dying on the street, they are shooting up, they are slumped over in their own vomit, other people are walking right by them to go to their jobs every morning — and the board of supervisors is spending time on banning fur,” she said. Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday. • What is a jungle primary and how does it work? • Republicans are struggling to field candidates on the ballot in November. • Meanwhile, Democrats, too, are wary of a possible disaster. • In farm country, the tide of ‘resistance’ is running dry. • Everything you need to know about the top races in the state. Ms. Alioto broke with the three other front-runners early in May by proposing a change to the city’s so-called sanctuary policy, which puts strict limits on cooperation between city officials and federal immigration authorities. The law does not protect illegal immigrants who have committed a serious felony within the past seven years. Saying the city’s current law “attracts dangerous felons,” Ms. Alioto proposed making it any serious or violent felony, not just those committed in the past seven years.","London Breed, a candidate for mayor of San Francisco, campaigned at a senior center last week. “I plan to introduce the kind of solutions that in some ways can be quite controversial, but are necessary,” she says.",2018-05-30T15:25:41Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",San Francisco’s Homeless Crisis Tests Mayoral Candidates’ Liberal Ideals,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/us/san-francisco-mayoral-election-homeless.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/us/31sfmayor-1-print/00sfmayor-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
CHRIS WHIPPLE,"It was a mistake. Within months, President Kennedy was embroiled in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. After the debacle, believing his generals had lied to him, he leaned heavily on his brother Bobby as a de facto chief of staff and teller of hard truths. Richard Nixon took the model of a strong chief of staff to another level. H. R. Haldeman, known as Bob — his “pluperfect son of a bitch,” as Nixon called him — created the template for the modern position. Mr. Haldeman controlled the president’s schedule and access to the Oval Office, making time and space for Mr. Nixon to think. He made sure that only the toughest decisions reached the Oval Office. He took charge of communications and speechwriting. And he was, as Mr. Nixon called him, his “lord high executioner,” herding the cabinet into line. It all came apart when the Watergate scandal struck, forcing Nixon from office and sending Mr. Haldeman to prison. Yet they created the model that presidents ever since have strayed from at their peril. Gerald Ford strayed, and paid the price. At first he gave his advisers equal, freewheeling access to the Oval Office. (A management model much like the 26th floor of Trump Tower.) The experiment was a disaster — like “learning by fire hose,” said an aide. He soon installed a tough chief of staff named Donald Rumsfeld, who, along with his young deputy Dick Cheney, brought discipline, and results, to the White House. Jimmy Carter became the ultimate cautionary tale of trying to govern without a chief. Trained as a nuclear submarine naval officer and convinced he could run the White House himself, Mr. Carter served, in effect, as his own chief — managing everything from his schedule to reservations for the White House tennis court. But he was politically tone-deaf, immersed in detail and unwilling to prioritize. About two and a half years into his presidency, with his agenda stalled, the 39th president realized his mistake and reluctantly appointed a chief of staff. The lesson of this current presidency — the most chaotic in modern history — is not that Mr. Trump would somehow be better off unchained. After more than a year, it is clear that he has learned nothing about governing. Ronald Reagan understood that an outsider president needs a consummate insider to tell him what he does not want to hear; he found that person in the form of his first chief, James A. Baker III; without Mr. Baker’s no-holds-barred advice, there probably would have been no Reagan revolution.",The president desperately needs a chief of staff who will tell him hard truths.,2018-05-09T22:55:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Does Trump Want Even More Chaos in the White House?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/opinion/donald-trump-john-kelly.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/opinion/09whipple1/09whipple1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
NICOLE STEPHENS,"During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others. “We had a good community” one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. “All the people here help one another.” Another said, “I was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.” As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor. The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes. These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please. Considering the government’s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people — especially those in working-class and minority communities — frequently do not trust the government’s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn’t care about “people like us” is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops. Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.","Jay Allen swam in the pool at his residence in Garden Beach, S.C., on Thursday, having decided to ignore an order to evacuate the day before Hurricane Florence makes landfall.",2018-09-14T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/hurricane-maria-staying-home.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/opinion/14nicolestephens/14nicolestephens-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

The photo belongs to R.D. ""Westy"" Legate, the 4th officer of the C.S. Mackay-Bennett, a cable laying ship that helped recover 300 bodies of those lost on the Titanic, including the ship's band-leader, Wallace Hartley. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge, from auction house Henry Aldridge &amp; Son, said material from this part of the ship's history is ""extremely scarce"" and the fact that it comes from an officer onboard during the recovery mission, makes it ""exceptionally important."" SAILING TO DISASTER: RARE TITANIC PHOTOS UP FOR AUCTION In the photo, Rev. Hind is shown conducting a burial service and consigning a body into the ocean. What is fascinating, Aldridge noted, is that the canvas bag for body number 177 is clearly shown, even though Hind only presided over 166 bodies buried at sea aboard the Mackay-Bennett. Hind performed the same prayer for each body, Aldridge added. Body No. 177 belonged to crewman William Peter Mayo. ""Despite the number of bodies buried at sea, visual records of the burial and service, such as this photograph, are almost non-existent, even in period publications,"" Aldridge added in the email to Fox News. ""Reverend Hind found it curious that White Star would have chartered the Mackay-Bennett to recover the bodies while not sending a company agent to accompany the vessel. This was the case for all the vessels chartered by the company for this purpose."" The photo is part of a period album along with other images from Legate, including two of him in uniform, as well as two albums full of photographs. It has a pre-sale estimate of $7,114-$11,383 (£5,000 – £8,000). The lot is just one of several that are set to go up for auction, nearly 106 years to the day that the Titanic suffered its fate. An extraordinarily rare copy of a lunch menu from the first meal served onboard the ship is listed. Additionally, a rare love letter from one of the survivor's of the wreck, Kate Buss, is also being listed by Henry Aldridge &amp; Son. The Titanic sank in the Atlantic Ocean in the early hours of April 15, 1912, just five days after its maiden voyage started.

More: Why Franco and Rogen's biggest gamble yet might send them to the Oscars Review: James Franco embraces eccentricity in hilarious 'The Disaster Artist' Q: What have you learned from that experience? Have you recovered? Rogen: It probably took me a solid year to be over it. Having a few other movies come out was helpful and have them be received well. Franco (joking): Sausage Party just wiped it away. Q: Were you worried about your career? Rogen: I was worried that (it would) have some effect that I wasn’t aware of. Like, 'Will people just not think we’re funny anymore because we have this connotation of being involved in this somewhat serious international incident?' But it turned out OK. I don’t even know if North Korea hacked Sony, to be totally honest. The more time goes by, the less I actually feel like I know what happened, truthfully.

(Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer, Getty Images for SXSW) Q: Let's talk about the sexual harassment allegations piling up inside Hollywood. What can men in positions of power do to make work environments healthier for women? Rogen: They can hire more women. It is a systemic issue. Personally, we try to make movies with a lot of diverse people and diverse filmmakers and we try to occupy our company with a lot of people who aren’t white dudes, because we’ve got that box ticked really (expletive) well. I don’t think men writing women’s roles better is the answer. I think women having more opportunities to write those roles is probably a much better solution. Franco: I just get plain bored of the same old stuff of white male heroes. As a producer, I’m just looking for projects that don’t have that. Q: Have you been witnessed men changing their behavior based on what’s no longer deemed acceptable in the workplace? Rogen: Judd Apatow, who is the person who really raised us in this industry, was outrageously respectful — and what I’m learning is maybe exceptionally respectful — in the workplace. My parents always raised me to be that way. It literally never even honestly occurred to me until I was a little older that this was something that was probably a problem throughout Hollywood.... It’s insane to think how much it’s out there, honestly. It’s just gross. Because it’s something that seems so easy to avoid, acting disgusting. I think I very almost effortlessly have avoided acting disgusting my entire life. It’s not even something I try to do! Franco: Everybody is now thinking differently. You’d have to be pretty dense not to just be aware of it. Every company’s had a workplace lecture. Q: Is it true studios across town are holding reactive lectures on sexual impropriety in the workplace? Rogen: They’ve had those on everything I’ve ever worked on for the last decade. Everyone treats them like a joke..... A lot of the rules they’re generally conveying don’t apply to a movie set, which is a very weird environment. I can see how if you’re disgusting, it’s easy to use those blurred lines to justify horrendous behavior. And if you’re not disgusting, it just creates a pleasant work environment that doesn’t feel too uptight and is casual and allows you to be yourself. But I do now understand how that behavior could thrive under the guise of, ‘Hey, it’s a movie set, we make edgy material. That’s what we’re doing here.’ I would just shut down if I saw it. I literally wouldn’t be able to work in an environment where I thought that was happening. But I guess a lot of people are very comfortable working in environments where that’s happening. A lot of men seem to be. Which is terrible. And very disappointing.

James Rogers,"With Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano wreaking devastation on parts of the Big Island, experts are weighing possible worst-case scenarios for the disaster. On Monday, another fissure spewing lava and unhealthy gas opened up; and a crack in the Earth that emerged a day earlier was sending molten rock on a slow run for the ocean, officials said. Nearly 20 fissures have opened since the Kilauea volcano started erupting 12 days ago, and officials warn it may soon blow its top with a massive steam eruption that would shoot boulders and ash miles into the sky. HAWAII VOLCANO EVACUATION ALERT MAY ARRIVE ON SHORT NOTICE, OFFICIALS WARN “The worst case is a long-lived eruption that spreads down the rift to the Pacific, mostly because it exposes more homes and businesses to lava flows,” Dr. Erik Klemetti, associate professor and chair at the Department of Geosciences at Denison University, told Fox News via email. Lava erupts from a fissure east of the Leilani Estates subdivision during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., May 13, 2018. (REUTERS/Terray Sylvester) “An explosive eruption from the summit would cause damage to the structures at the summit like the Hawaii Volcano Observatory or the Jaggar Museum &amp; Overlook,” he added. Part of the U.S. Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Program, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory is perched on the rim of Kīlauea’s summit caldera. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum, which is operated by the National Park Service, is located next to the Volcano Observatory. Einat Lev, Lamont Assistant Research Professor at Columbia University agrees that summit damage and a long-running eruption are possibilities. “In my opinion, the worst scenario includes a combination of large (for Hawaii) explosion at the summit combined with extended (many months) effusion of lava at the lower East Rift Zone,” she told Fox News, via email. “Such extended effusion will hamper any rebuilding efforts in that part of the island.” IS HAWAII'S KILAUEA VOLCANO GOING TO EXPLODE? WHAT MOUNT ST. HELENS AND OTHER ERUPTIONS HAVE TAUGHT US Lava erupts from a fissure on the outskirts of Pahoa during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., May 14, 2018. (REUTERS/Terray Sylvester) Rift zones are areas where the volcano is “rifting” or splitting apart, according to the University of Hawaii at Hilo. Because the rocks in rift zones have multiple cracks and are relatively weak, it is easy for magma to make its way to the surface in these areas, it explains on its website. The volcano, one of the most active in the world, has already destroyed dozens of homes since its latest eruption began. President Trump declared a major disaster area in Hawaii on May 11. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported a fissure opened Saturday just east of the Puna Geothermal Venture energy conversion plant, where steam and hot liquid are brought up through underground wells and the steam feeds a turbine generator to produce electricity. KILAUEA VOLCANO COULD LAUNCH 10-TON BALLISTIC BOULDERS IN DRAMATIC EXPLOSION View of the Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano from the International Space Station in this undated image obtained from social media and tweeted on May 13, 2018. (Andrew J. Feustel/NASA/via REUTERS) As a precaution, plant workers last week removed 50,000 gallons (189,265 liters) of a flammable liquid stored at the site. Dr. Jessica Johnson, lecturer in geophysics at the University of East Anglia in the UK, told Fox News that the worst-case scenario is for ""more of the same"" in the volcano's lower East Rift Zone.""There is the potential for more fissures to open and for the lava to become more voluminous and fast flowing, destroy more homes and infrastructure, even the geothermal power plant,"" she explained, via email. The geophysicist also acknowledged the possibility of large explosions if falling rocks trap steam rising from Kilauea. ""These explosions could project ballistics up to 2 m [6.6 feet] across as far as a kilometre [0.6 miles]. Smaller particles may be ejected further, and ash could reach kms into the atmosphere. This scenario last happened in 1924,"" she wrote. INCREDIBLE PHOTOS SHOW HAWAII'S KILAUEA VOLCANO ERUPTION SPOTTED FROM SPACE Johnson notes, however, that Kilauea's summit is inside the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and not in a residential area, ""If this [major explosion] happened, nobody's lives would be in danger as long as people listen to the authorities and respect the evacuation areas,"" she said. Despite the worrying scale of the Kilauea’s latest spate of activity, Klemetti said there is “very little-to-no chance” that the volcano could have a global impact, or even impact the Hawaiian towns of Hilo or Kona. So, what’s the best-case scenario for the eruption? “Best case is easy: the eruption ends soon,” said Klemetti. “The supply of magma from the summit drops, so the lava being fed into the fissures runs out.” While this is a possibility, the expert noted that similar eruptions in the past have gone on for weeks or even months. HAWAII'S KILAUEA VOLCANO'S ACTIVE HISTORY, AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE MOST RECENT ERUPTION Patricia Spinoza, of Puna, takes a photo of lava on a lawn on the outskirts of Pahoa during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., May 14, 2018. (REUTERS/Terray Sylvester) “The key to remember for Kilauea is that most of the eruptions, because they are lava flows, are hazardous to property and infrastructure but not particularly dangerous to people as they can be evacuated,” he added. Columbia University’s Lev agrees that a rapid decline in the magma supply is the best possible outcome, one which would see “things quiet back down.” Late on Monday officials gave an update on volcano’s East Rift zone, warning that fissures in the southeast of the Lanipuna Gardens neighborhood are issuing high levels of Sulfur Dioxide gas. Hawaii County Civil Defense warned residents that air quality in the area poses an immediate threat to health. Klemetti told Fox News that the volcanic gases are mostly water vapor, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. “The sulfur dioxide can react with water to form acid, so if you breathe it in, you can damage your lungs, throat and nose and irritate your eyes,” he explained. “If the vapor is particularly dense or you’re already susceptible, it could kill you — which is again why people need to evacuate. Luckily, it disperses quickly so people further away don’t need to be concerned about death but rather irritation.” The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Ben Paynter,"On Friday, September 14, Hurricane Florence made landfall along the North Carolina coast, prompting high winds and massive flooding throughout the region. All of that was in the forecast. But at the same time, disaster response agencies faced some vexing questions: What were the people warned to evacuate actually doing? And where exactly had they fled? In what has become an increasingly common tactic, many organizations including the Direct Relief, and the Red Cross, turned to Facebook data to provide some answers. Last year, Facebook launched Disaster Maps, an initiative through its Data for Good division that tracks the geographic coordinates of user signals to show trends in people’s movements during a crisis. The result is a series of time-stamped images that can help emergency responders get a rough idea of how a situation is really unfolding, and where their services might be needed most. All of the data is aggregated in a way that makes it anonymous. It’s also collected automatically, as long as the social network users have their location services enabled. At least a dozen nonprofit groups began using the service in 2017, including Direct Relief, which provides medical supplies to overtaxed hospitals and health centers in times of critical need. In 2017, for instance, the group used Disaster Maps data to help inform where they staged respiration mask depots for residents dealing with Southern California’s massive wildfires. [Images: courtesy Facebook] In the case of Hurricane Florence, Facebook began offering imagery several days ahead of landfall. To create it, the company first developed a baseline of what user activity historically looked like in the affected areas based on signal positions from three months prior. Then it began to color-code areas that were transmitting abnormal population density spikes (in blue) or lulls (in red) to highlight areas where folks seemed to be flocking or fleeing. Andrew Schroeder, the director of research and analysis at Direct Relief, says Facebook shared the first maps with him on Sunday, September 9. The nonprofit has since received new snapshots every eight hours, which is especially important as relief efforts continue. “It lets us actually compare what Facebook is seeing with media reports of where people are evacuating,” Schroeder says. That helps because initial media reports can be vague. And so far, at least one trend has been surprising: Initially, Facebook data showed only the pace of the exodus where people were specifically taking shelter in larger cities like Raleigh and Charlotte. In many big cities, Schroeder says there has been a flip in their usual activity. Whereas a blue cluster traditionally marks downtowns, more people seem to be congregating around the outer edges of these places versus in the center. “That’s probably because people are actually just staying home and they don’t go into the downtown area to seek services,” he says, nothing that transportation routes may also have been disrupted. For Direct Relief, the information could inform how aid is rendered in the days ahead. Many of the nonprofit group’s targeted health centers are located in downtown areas for obvious business reasons. Many actually re-supplied just before the storm because, as happens every storm season, Direct Relief pre-positioned “hurricane preparedness modules” with things like bandages, water purification supplies, antibiotics, and asthma medication at six locations throughout South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Earlier this week, the group told Fast Company that it had since sent 11 shipments to five different health centers, and had five more shipments prepped to move. But some of the people clustered on the outer edge of these cities may not be able to get back downtown, or, if they arrived from other places, might be unsure where the nearest reliable medical care would be. Others may also be stranded there because they can’t yet return home. “Over the long term, if that persists, you do need to actually shift where you’re focusing the point of care,” Schroeder says. “It’s a real argument for mobile [units] going out to where people are, [and] for supporting health centers that are actually farther out along the periphery and making sure at least that we’re aware of the conditions that they’re facing.” Direct Relief doesn’t just use Facebook data to inform such decisions. (It might, for instance, be especially misleading if, after a day or two, signals in places with no power blinked out.) The group also uses government data to pinpoint spots with large population densities and social vulnerabilities, and reports from another nonprofit called Humanity Road, which compiles all sorts of data about how crucial infrastructure is holding up, including power outages, 911 call routing, and cell sites. “I don’t think that Facebook data is a slam-dunk on anything, but I think it’s good hypothesis formation stuff,” says Schroeder, who expects that the company will allow many responders continued access for at least the next couple of weeks. That’s important because as separate reports by Harvard and George Washington University on the tragically high death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico have shown, much of the mortality that happens in events like this comes from the slow toll of being isolated or uprooted. People may not have access to important health services, and at the same time that they also lack income because their workplace was wiped out or jobs aren’t transportable. In the meantime, serious medical conditions like diabetes or hypertension can remain untreated. As Schroeder puts it, most mortality in Hurricane Maria was the result of “the impact on the system” of how traditional society works “and you’ll see the same thing with Hurricane Florence.” Facebook may be providing some early clues about how to render aid, but there’s plenty more work to be done. “It’s good to see that people left their homes,” he says. “We need to know how fast they come back. We need to know if there are neighborhoods where you see long term low population evidence that [means] whole areas have not necessarily seen recovery. And then that needs to be combined with other information to really figure out what the heck it means.”","The social network tracks where people evacuate to after a disaster–and then helps organizations figure out in real time where to bring food and supplies.

"USA TODAY, Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY","In this Aug. 5, 2018 photo, police investigate the scene where multiple people were shot in Chicago. (Photo: AP) For years, Jim Adcock, a former coroner living in the South, has been sounding the alarm to police brass and anyone else who will listen: America’s big city police departments are mired in a cold case crisis. The national murder clearance rate—the calculation of cases that end with an arrest or identification of a suspect who can’t be apprehended—fell to 59.4 percent in 2016, the lowest it’s been since the FBI has tracked the issue. The data tells a grim story of thousands of murders in which no one is held accountable, Adcock said. “If we don’t address it, the issue is just going to get worse,” said Adcock, who recently started the Mid-South Cold Case Initiative, a non-profit that aims to provide assistance to departments looking to bolster their cold case units. “The hole we’re in is just going to get deeper and deeper.” The issue of murder clearance rates is in the spotlight as Chicago officials struggles to solve gun violence that’s plaguing the city. But the nation’s third-largest city, which only cleared 26 percent of its homicides in 2016, is just one among many big cities struggling to quickly solve gun crimes, according to FBI data and crime experts. Last weekend in Chicago, more than 70 people were shot, including 12 fatally, but only a single arrest has been made so far from the dozens of shootings over a 60-hour period. The frustrating weekend led Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to decry a culture where too few Chicagoans living in some of the city’s most violence-plagued neighborhoods are willing to cooperate with police. Politicians and police chiefs in many other cities know the struggle. It’s one that has been exacerbated in municipalities to varying degrees by politics, fear, a no-snitching philosophy mentality pervasive in some enclaves, diminished resources for law enforcement and discontent with policing in minority communities, experts say. Gangs fueling much of the violence have become less hierarchical over the last several decades. As a result, they have also become more perplexing for investigators to understand, said Peter Scharf, a Louisiana State University criminologist who has advised the New Orleans Police Department in the past. In big cities like Baltimore, Chicago and New Orleans—which cleared less than 28 percent of its homicide cases in 2016—the fracturing of gangs has added a difficult dimension for detectives as they try to glean information from the streets. “It’s a national disaster,” said Scharf of the declining national clearance rate. “With every one of these weekends where you see multiple killed and even more wounded and few arrested, the gangs become more emboldened and the witnesses weaker in their conviction to step up.” More: Trump blames violent spree in Chicago on 'bad leadership' More: Why Chicago PD can't get more residents to identify gun violence suspects More: At least 72 shot, 13 killed in Chicago over violent summer weekend, police department says More: Can you change how criminals think? Chicago hopes behavioral therapy can cut gun violence In Memphis, where Adcock is based, the city saw their homicide clearance fall to 38% in 2016. The same city cleared more than 99 percent of its 126 homicides in 1972. The Memphis Police Department has more than 1,500 cold cases on the books, Adcock said. Detroit, which last year had the third worst per capita homicide rate in the nation, managed to clear less than 15 percent of homicides in 2016, down from about 35 percent the year prior year. (Detroit and many other cities include all homicides solved in a calendar year in its annual reporting to the FBI. For example, a homicide committed in 2015, but solved in 2016 would be tallied as a homicide cleared in the more recent year. In Indianapolis, where the murder rate has surged, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police command staff earlier this year called on outside experts to help with the growing number of unsolved homicide cases. The Midwest city has seen its annual clearance rate tumble since 2014, when 66 percent of murders were solved. Last year, about 40 percent of Indianapolis’s cases were solved, according to an analysis by the IndyStar, part of the USA TODAY Network. Police there believe part of the problem is that witnesses have become increasingly reluctant to speak out because of fear of retaliation. The problem is so acute that half the people who survive gunshots refuse to answer questions about the shootings. In one case last September, Indianapolis Police said that 10 young people were present when 13-year-old Matthew McGee was gunned down in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. No one spoke up. ""This young man did not deserve to die on a parking lot of Long John Silver's on a Saturday night,"" Chris Bailey, Indianapolis Police deputy chief, said after the killing. ""Those with information who are not sharing with us should be ashamed of themselves."" More: A 13-year-old boy was killed near a crowd. But no one's talking, Indy police say. More: Indianapolis will create a witness protection program The Indianapolis City Council passed a proposal this year cr eating a $300,000 witness protection fund in hopes of bolstering the police department’s ability to persuade witnesses to cooperate. Kelly Robinson, whose son Philip Brown’s 2016 murder went unsolved, told council members that it was essential that authorities provide witnesses with help from the incident until conviction. ""If y'all don't handle it, it'll be handled in the streets,"" said Robinson, who says there were at least 30 witnesses to her child’s killing. In the past, cities such as Boston have made headway improving clearance rates by throwing more bodies on homicides and improving investigative techniques. Between 2007 and 2011, the Boston Police Department Homicide Unit cleared, 47.1 percent of the homicides investigated. After putting focus on the issue, the department managed to improve the clearance rate to 56.9 percent for 2012 to 2014. The department, which saw its clearance rate dip below 50 percent last year, increased the amount of evidence analyzed by the crime lab and interviewed more witnesses at the scene of the crime immediately after the crime, according to review of the Boston initiative by Anthony Braga, a Northeastern University criminologist, and Desiree Dusseault, deputy chief of staff in the Boston Police commissioner’s office. Former Police Commissioner Ed Davis, who launched the Boston initiative during his time leading Boston’s department, said simple changes—such as adding more detectives to weekend duty—made a difference. The terrain, Davis said, has become more complicated as police standing in minority communities has been diminished by several controversial cases such as the fatal officer-involved shootings of black suspects such as Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.; Laquan McDonald in Chicago; and Philando Castille in suburban St. Paul. But improved tactics can help departments improve clearance rates, Davis says. “There’s been a reduction in trust in policing over the last five years, and that plays a role in it,” Davis told USA TODAY. “But that’s not the deciding factor. One of the things that matters most is the aggressiveness in which you pursue these cases in the first 48 hours.” CHICAGO, IL - AUGUST 6 : Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson arrive at a news conference to address reporters about Chicago's weekend of gun violence, Monday, August 6, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago experienced one of it's most violent weekends of the year, after more then 70 people were shot, with 12 fatalities. (Photo: Getty Images) In Chicago, where Mayor Emanuel faces reelection in February, the persistent gun violence has become a top issue for residents. Murders are down 20 percent in the Windy City compared to last year. But with more than 325 homicides already this year, Chicago is again on pace to end the year with more murders than New York and Los Angeles, cities with far bigger populations. During the McDonald shooting fallout, two top officers in the investigative division retired from the department and the mayor fired superintendent Garry McCarthy, who oversaw a relatively less violent period in recent Chicago history. McCarthy, who is now running for mayor against Emanuel, said bettering Chicago's clearance rate will be more complicated than cops improving relations in the city’s black community. “When politicians think it’s politically expedient to be tough on cops…how do you expect the detectives to get up and go out and do their jobs and put themselves in jeopardy when this is the environment they’re working in?” McCarthy said.

"USA TODAY, Ledyard King, USA TODAY","Satellite imagery from the ISS and NOAA show the powerful eye of Category 4 Hurricane Florence from space as it continues to track towards the southeastern U.S. USA TODAY Kevin Orth loads sandbags into cars on Milford Street as he helps residents prepare for Hurricane Florence, Monday, Sept. 10, 2018, in Charleston, S.C. (Photo: Grace Beahm Alford, The Post And Courier, via AP) WASHINGTON – FEMA is ramping up preparations for Hurricane Florence as the powerful Category 4 storm rumbles towards the Carolinas. As of Monday evening, the emergency agency had positioned more than 80,000 liters of water, 402,000 meals, 1,200 cots and 34 generators at Fort Bragg near Fayetteville, N.C. In addition, both Fort Bragg and North Field Air Base near Columbia, S.C., are serving as ""incident support bases"" to distribute more supplies, including meals, water, blankets when needed. And FEMA teams have been sent to both states where they will serve as ""rapidly deployable assets, with expertise in operations, logistics, planning, and recovery."" Still smarting from the criticism hurled at the agency following Hurricane Maria, the Trump administration wants to leave nothing to chance as it faces its first major storm in nearrly a year. Nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Maria, making it the second deadliest hurricane in U.S. history. The toll far exceeded the original estimates, leading to verbal reprimands that FEMA did not do its job. ""Because FEMA and the federal government were simply unprepared, thousands of our fellow American citizens have perished – and we now know that the poor and elderly were the most at risk,"" Rep. Bennie Thompson D-Miss., ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement when the revised death toll was released two weeks ago. In a report issued in July, FEMA acknowledged staffing shortages and logistical challenges in responding to Maria where Puerto Rico's aging infrastructure and its island terrain complicated relief efforts. But FEMA Administrator Brock Long also said the agency was facing an unprecedented workload that included three catastrophic hurricanes, historic wildfires in California and dozens of other disasters. The agency has learned from last year and will be better prepared to confront disasters this year, he said. ""It is always a question of when, not if, we will be called on again,"" Long wrote in a column last month for USA TODAY. ""FEMA began incorporating lessons in real time as they were identified and continues to do so to prepare for the 2018 hurricane season. We have substantially increased stockpiles of resources across the nation, focusing on remote, hard-to-reach locations."" Florence will be the administration's first major hurricane since Maria. In a tweet Monday afternoon, President Donald Trump said the storm looks ""very bad"" and told residents to ""take all necessary precautions."" He also mentioned that his administration has begun ""mobilizing our assets to respond accordingly, and we are here for you!"" To the incredible citizens of North Carolina, South Carolina and the entire East Coast - the storm looks very bad! Please take all necessary precautions. We have already began mobilizing our assets to respond accordingly, and we are here for you! pic.twitter.com/g74cyD6b6K — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2018 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he had asked the president for a federal disaster declaration ahead of the storm but that request has not been granted as of 7 p.m. Monday. The declaration will allow the state and localities to seek more assistance as well as federal reimbursement for debris removal, infrastructure repairs and other hurricane-related costs. Mandatory evacuations were underway Monday in North Carolina and more are scheduled for Tuesday – including the entire coastline of South Carolina. The National Hurricane Center said Florence was expected to slam into the coast around North and South Carolina as a Category 3 or 4 hurricane on Thursday or Friday.

Kieran Corcoran,"A composite image showing victim Jennifer Riordan (right) and the damaged plane on which she was fatally injured. AP The woman who died in a mid-air disaster aboard a Southwest Airlines flight caused by a failed engine was killed by blunt objects smacking into her head, neck, and torso, medical officials have ruled. The official cause of death for 43-year-old Jennifer Riordan, a Wells Fargo executive from Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recorded as ""blunt trauma impact."" Riordan's upper body was sucked out of her plane window by sudden decompression when her window broke. She was wearing a seatbelt. She was hit by shrapnel flying from the nearby broken engine, and a passenger near her said she also smacked into the plane's fuselage. The Southwest flight after its landing. The broken window is visible a few rows behind the engine. Mark Makela / Reuters Experts from the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office gave the assessment after the stricken flight made an emergency landing there. They also ruled that the death had been accidental. The service, Flight 1380, was headed from New York City to Dallas, Texas. The engine failed mid-flight, prompting the pilot to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia. Peggy Phillips, a nurse who was sitting a few rows in front of Riordan, described the moment of impact in an interview with Philadelphia news station 6 ABC. She said: ""If you can possibly imagine going through the window of an airplane at about 600mph, and hitting either the fuselage or the wing with your body, with your face, then I think I can probably tell you there was significant trauma.""

"Ashley Killough, Kate Sullivan and Manu Raju, CNN","(CNN)Confusion swept across Capitol Hill Thursday morning as Republicans faced stiff opposition over a short-term spending bill needed to avert a partial government shutdown.
Conservatives along with President Donald Trump continued to demand new money for a border wall in the legislation, complicating the House passage of a bill approved by the Senate the night before. 
While the Senate passed a stop-gap spending bill Wednesday night that would fund the remaining parts of the government through February 8, 2019, the measure still needs to be approved by the House and signed by the President before it can take effect. 
But House Republicans emerged from a closed-door meeting Thursday morning with mixed signals on whether the President would support the measure, as it faces significant opposition from conservatives who are demanding the President's request for $5 billion be fulfilled.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: ""The President is having a meeting with Republican House Members at noon today. At this moment, the President does not want to go further without border security, which includes steel slats or a wall. The President is continuing to weigh his options."" 
A source tells CNN House Speaker Paul Ryan took a phone call from Trump during the House GOP Conference meeting. 
Republican leaders huddled after the meeting in Ryan's office as they considered next steps, including whether to add more money to the stopgap spending bill, such as wall funding and disaster aid being separately demanded by a number of members. 
Making any changes to the bill at this point could complicate passage and add hurdles to passing the bill on time by midnight Friday. 
Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN Thursday the state of play on the spending bill is ""very fluid right now."" Meadows and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, two of the House's most conservative members, are among the Republican leaders going to a midday White House meeting. House Republican Whip Rep. Steve Scalise is also expected to attend. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposal had the backing of the top congressional Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and top congressional Republicans have indicated they were optimistic that the President would sign the measure.
Pelosi, however, argued the situation was descending into a ""meltdown"" among Republicans. While she expressed openness to additional funds for issues like disaster aid, she said wall funding would be a dealbreaker for Democrats. 
""We'll see what they come up with in terms of disaster assistance, we'll see. But in terms of wall funding, that's a non-starter.""
New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins told CNN that at a closed-door meeting Thursday morning Speaker Paul Ryan indicated that he expected the CR to pass and Trump to sign it. 
Other Republicans, however, were less certain. ""I think the next few days could get complicated real fast,"" said Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. 
Asked whether the President will sign the bill, Republican Rep. Mo Brooks said ""that is the million dollar question.""
""Or, rather I should say, that is the $5 billion question,"" he added. ""I wish we had clarity on that.""
The House GOP conference meeting this morning was a ""strong rebuke"" against the short-term spending bill passed by the Senate, according to North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Walker. ""There wasn't any ambiguity in the room today,"" Walker told CNN. 
""We've got to stay here and get this job done and get border security passed,"" Walker said. ""The Senate's voice vote on the CR was strongly rejected by the conference this morning.""
The North Carolina Republican said one member who hadn't spoken in the conference in eight years stood up to speak Thursday and that Rep. Virginia Foxx's husband called her from back home to say you've got to get the wall done. ""It wasn't just one group or one caucus; It was across the board,"" Walker said.
""There's a lot of frustration,"" said Rep. Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon. 
The measure faces opposition from a broad group of conservatives. Members of the House Freedom Caucus and other conservative allies of the President spoke on the House floor Wednesday night, urging Trump not to abandon new money for border wall funding. 
Jordan, speaking on the floor, blasted the idea of postponing another spending bill fight to February, when Democrats will hold the majority in the House. 
""You've got to be kidding me, really? I mean February 8th? When Nancy Pelosi is speaker? I'm supposed to believe, we're supposed to believe that we're then going to build the border security wall and keep our promise from the 2016 campaign? No way!"" Jordan said.

Scott Davis,"As mandatory minicamps in the NFL get underway, Dez Bryant remains on the free agency market, waiting for a new contract. The Dallas Cowboys released Bryant in mid-April, and he has yet to find a landing spot. Bryant's contract (he was slated to make over $12 million this season) and declining production played roles in the Cowboys' decision. And while Bryant's effectiveness has been diminished in recent seasons, due in part to foot surgery in 2016, it's still somewhat of a surprise to see a player once regarded as one of the league's best receivers remain unemployed. In late April, the Baltimore Ravens reportedly offered Bryant a multi-year deal that NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported was in the neighborhood of three years, $21 million. Bryant, however, turned it down, instead opting for a one-year deal with the hopes of putting in a strong season, then cashing in next year. Unfortunately, for Bryant, more offers don't seem to be coming in. In an offseason that saw several of the top free agent receivers get big contracts, Bryant hit the market too late in the game. Teams with needs at wide receiver spent their money or later drafted receivers. Additionally, Bryant's game may not fit the modern NFL as well anymore. With his athleticism sapped, Bryant's best skill at this point may be using his big frame to bully smaller cornerbacks and make well-contested catches, as The Ringer's Robert Mays noted. That's a useful skill in some situations, but ultimately, a low-percentage play. Mays wrote that in today's NFL, many teams focus on receivers who can create separation and make plays, all within a larger system. That doesn't seem to be Bryant's forte anymore. Even still, it remains a surprise that Bryant hasn't been picked up on a one-year offer by a team looking to bolster its receiving corps. It could be a low-risk, high-reward move for a team looking for extra weapons without making a long-term commitment. The view of Bryant around the league may be that he doesn't have much more to offer. Though he's still only 29, consider how Aaron Rodgers labeled Bryant when asked about rumors that Bryant could be a fit with the Green Bay Packers. ""We like young receivers, so I'm assuming that's the way they are going to keep going,"" Rodgers said. ""I don't know why you'd cut Jordy [Nelson] and bring in Dez."" Rodgers added he'd welcome Bryant with open arms. Nonetheless, it's worth wondering if that's how the rest of the league now views Bryant — old. Add in some of his attitude issues — something Bryant himself alluded to when the Cowboys cut him — and teams may not be that interested.","Wide receiver Dez Bryant is still on the free agency market as NFL teams begin minicamps.

Cat Schuknecht,"Officials say 15 people are dead after a landslide covered 30 homes in a village on the island of Java. On Tuesday, residents evacuated their homes while rescue workers searched for survivors.
-/AFP/Getty Images
Fifteen people have died in a landslide that buried 30 homes on Indonesia's main island, officials said Tuesday. Twenty people are still believed to be missing.
Torrential rain caused tons of mud to crash into Sirnaresmi village in West Java on Monday evening just before sunset, while New Year's Eve celebrations were underway, The Associated Press reports.
The death toll rose from initial reports as rescuers worked to recover bodies from the mud. Hundreds of residents, police and soldiers searched through debris using hand tools and their bare hands, according to AP.
The muddy conditions made it difficult for tractors and other heavy equipment to reach the disaster site to assist in the search effort. But Made Oka Astawa, head of the operations division at the National Search and Rescue Agency, told AP that two excavator vehicles were able to reach the disaster area, and helped recover several bodies that had been buried under 13 feet of mud.
Astawa also told AP that search and rescue efforts were put on hold late Tuesday local time because of darkness and heavy rains. The operation will be picked up again early Wednesday.
""Lack of equipment, bad weather and a blackout hampered our rescue efforts for those who are still missing and feared dead,"" National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told AP.
Nugroho said 60 people who lost their homes in the landslide have been moved to a temporary shelter.
The landslide is the most recent of several major disasters that hit Indonesia in 2018.
In December, a tsunami triggered by volcanic activity on another of Indonesia's islands, Anak Krakatau, killed over 400 people and wounded nearly 1,500 wounded, NPR reported.
Kathy Mueller, a communications delegate with the Red Cross, told NPR's David Greene after last month's tsunami that Indonesia is still feeling the effects of several other disasters since the summer, including earthquakes on the island of Lombok in July and again in August, and a tsunami in September that killed more than 1,700 people.
""Every disaster has its own unique context,"" Mueller told NPR. ""No response is ever perfect. So there's always the opportunity to learn and to improve.""

The Future of Scooters
Our long-time transportation and scooter aficionado Megan Rose Dickey has all the latest on where the scooter world stands today and whats in store going forward:
Data rules everything around me (D.R.E.A.M.). Cities are relatively down for this new era of transportation and operators are increasingly more willing to share their data with cities. Now, cities just have to find out what to do with this data and how to extract learnings from it.
Were able to share more data with those companies which I think is really helpful for policymaking and decision-making but it also helps us to set up rules of the road that meet the needs of everybody in San Francisco, Maguire said.
A number of startups have emerged in this space, including Populus, Passport and Ride Report.
The Future of Media
TechCrunch media columnist Eric Peckhamhas an interview with prominent media venture capitalistPär-Jörgen Pärson of Northzone. His comments on content exclusivity:
In terms of exclusive content, I do believe that the content market, and the idea of exclusivity, is flawed in many ways. And I think Spotify proved it really well. Proved that what the artists or the content owners really need is maximum distribution and distribution at a certain minimum RPU (revenue per user), of course. But the thing is when you start to restrict distribution, you can get a higher RPU, but the underlying market is still actually eyeballs. So what is ultimately fueling the interest of Man United or the Patriots is the number of people who want to watch their games. If you restrict that, then youre undermining the company. We saw that when Twitter had acquired the online rights for the NFLI think it was the Superbowl, a few years back. It was a total disaster for the NFL. They got no eyeballs for that and it really undermined their OTT business.

Shona Ghosh,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Reuters/Leah Millis The CEO of dating app Happn thinks Facebook has an ulterior motive for announcing a brand new dating service. In an interview with Business Insider, Didier Rappaport said social networking and dating were totally different — and that Facebook was trying to distract from its privacy problems. He said: ""I have been quite surprised that Facebook would launch a dating service. The DNA of a social network and dating service are totally opposite. People like to share lots of things with their friends and family, but not what concerns their private life and dates."" ""It's quite interesting to note this announcement has been done just a few weeks after the Cambridge Analytica concerns,"" Rappaport added, suggesting it was a way to make the bad news ""disappear,"" so Facebook doesn't have to ""talk about the past."" Happn is a French dating app which matches users based on their location. Happn Facebook announced at its annual F8 developer conference that it would add dating features to the existing Facebook mobile app, but hasn't given many details. The company promised it would respect people's privacy, and that it wouldn't show friends as prospective matches. Still, observers noted the irony of Facebook announcing a dating service both as it tries to move past the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, and after it fired an employee for allegedly stalking women online. IAC, the parent company of Match Group, issued a barbed response to the news on Tuesday, riffing on Russian groups using Facebook to spread misinformation. Match Group owns big dating services such as OKCupid, PlentyOfFish, and Tinder. ""Come on in,"" CEO Joey Levin said. ""The water's warm. Their product could be great for US/Russia relationships."" Nonetheless, Match Group's stock cratered on Wednesday. Happn might be a private company, but it's possible that Facebook's move into the dating space could torpedo the competition. Rappaport is, outwardly, not concerned. ""Ok, it would be one more competitor,"" he said. ""Maybe a big one — we don't know. We don't know the reaction of Facebook users, if they will agree to mix their social lives with their private lives."" He said Happn had almost 50 million registered users, and 7 million monthly active users. It recently moved into subscriptions and, while it doesn't disclose revenue, is profitable. Asked why he thought Facebook didn't acquire a dating app — like Happn or Bumble — Rappaport pointed to Facebook's decreasing app usage. ""They bought WhatsApp, they bought Instagram, that's usually the way they [approach it.] Here, it's like they need to do something inside Facebook to re-increase the usage of Facebook. And that's probably why they haven't tried to buy any other app,"" he said. When Business Insider interviewed Rappaport in April 2017, he hinted at acquisition offers for Happn. Asked on Thursday whether the firm might seek a buyer or more venture capital funding, Rappaport said: ""There are not so many dating apps out there that are at global scale and independent — in a world of... consolidation, Happn could be a target. ""Now, this is not something we have in mind, we want to continue our growth. How we will develop Happn in the next few years — in partnership with a giant — we don't know today.""",Happn is the latest dating service to pile onto Facebook after the company decided it would get into dating.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday, a hospital official told Metro TV in a report broadcast on Saturday. A tsunami up to two meters (six feet) high swept through Palu at dusk after the sleepy but growing tourist resort was rocked by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. “Bodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept by tsunami... but we are still collecting data,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman said on Saturday. Doctor Komang Adi Sujendra told Metro TV that 30 people were killed and their bodies taken to his hospital, adding another 12 injured needed orthopaedic surgery. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Nugroho declined to give an official death toll. The Palu area was hit by a lighter quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in the fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicenter, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu. On Saturday, authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts without power and communications as the area was rocked by aftershocks. Metro TV played an amateur footage which showed water remaining from the tsunami, a collapsed bridge, large cracks in roads and buildings badly damaged. Tezar Kodongan, a resident of Palu who took one of the videos, told the TV station some of the city landmarks were broken. “There is no evacuation yet in the disaster area,” Kodongan added. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu.

Jeffrey Sachs,"Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health, and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise. Trump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government's inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. Last month, Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 deaths, with more likely to come in its aftermath. This past week Hurricane Michael has claimed at least 32 lives, with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing. The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear. As the Earth warms due to the continued burning of coal, oil, and gas, climate-related disasters that include high-intensity hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme precipitation, forest fires, and heat waves, pose rising dangers to life and property. Hurricanes become more destructive as warmer ocean waters feed more energy to the storms. Warmer air also carries more moisture for devastating rainfalls, while rising sea levels lead to more flooding. Yet Trump and his minions are the loyal servants of the fossil-fuel industry, which fill Republican party campaign coffers. Trump has also stalled the fight against climate change by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. The politicians thereby deprive the people of their lives and property out of profound cynicism, greed, and willful scientific ignorance. The first job of government is to protect the public. Real protection requires climate action on several fronts: educating the public about the growing dire risks of human-induced climate change; enacting legislation and regulations to ensure that families and businesses are kept out of harm's way, for example by stopping construction in flood plains, and investing in sustainable infrastructure to counteract rising sea levels; anticipating the rising frequency of high-intensity climate-related disasters through science-based preparedness following through on properly scaled disaster-response during and after storm events; and most importantly for the future, spearheading the rapid transition to zero-carbon energy to prevent much greater calamities in the years ahead. This straightforward to-do list is the opposite of what Trump and his cronies are doing. Trump blithely disregards scientific findings about climate change and thereby exposes the nation to unprecedented risks. The officials he has appointed to the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant parts of government are industry cronies and lobbyists far more interested in self-enrichment, padding their accounts, and helping their once-and-future employers than in doing their current jobs. Trump's mishandling of last year's Puerto Rico disaster in the wake of Hurricane Maria is grounds itself for impeachment and trial. Thousands of citizens died unnecessarily on Trump's watch because the administration could not be stirred to proper action before, during, and after the hurricane. Two independent, detailed epidemiological studies, using different methodologies -- one led by researchers at Harvard University and the other by researchers at George Washington University -- have estimated that thousands died in the aftermath of Maria. While dozens died during the storm, thousands more died as a result of the residual effects of the storm. Maria downed electricity and wreaked havoc on the ability of Puerto Ricans to meet their life-sustaining needs by disrupting access to health services, safe water, and transportation. They died, in short, from the storm, and ultimately from inadequate disaster prevention, preparedness and response. Yet when the George Washington University study was released in September, the President responded by saying, ""I think we did a fantastic job"" in Puerto Rico. He brazenly denied the death count, without any attempt whatsoever to understand or learn from the findings. Recent scientific studies underscore the dire emergency ahead. Professor James Hansen, one of the world's leading climatologists, has demonstrated that the Earth's climate has moved above the temperature range that supported the entire 10,000 years of civilization. The risks of catastrophic sea level rise are upon us. A group of world-leading ecologists recently highlighted that critical Earth systems could spiral out of control. The Nobel-prize winning Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change has also just released a harrowing report showing that the world has just a few years left to move decisively towards renewable energy if it hopes to achieve the globally agreed target to limit warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average temperature of the planet. The huge bills for Hurricanes Florence and Michael will now start rolling in: funerals, suffering, sorting through debris, and perhaps $30 billion in losses that could have been reduced dramatically through science-based planning and foresight. The American people are paying a heavy cost for the cynicism and cruelty of politicians in the pocket of the fossil-fuel industry. It is time to hold these reckless politicians to account.","Jeffrey Sachs writes President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Rick Scott, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction. It’s the latest reminder that we now live in an era of fast-growing, hard-to-contain megafires. Update 8/7: Well, it happened: The Mendocino Complex fire now stands at 283,800 acres and containment remains low. It’s eclipsed the Thomas Fire and still growing. The Mendocino Complex fire, which includes the Ranch and River fires burning side by side in Lake and Mendocino counties, currently stands at a combined 274,000 acres, placing it just shy of the Thomas Fire as largest wildfire in modern state history. The fires are still growing, and state officials believe the fire complex could climb to the top of the list soon, according to the LA Times. “Look how big it got, just in a matter of days,” Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), told the LA Times. “Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn’t happen. That just doesn’t happen.” Indeed, the fires exploded into existence just 10 days ago on July 27, and have been consuming land at breakneck speed. The larger of the two—the Ranch Fire—makes the top 10 list in its own right. As of this morning, the blaze had torched 225,000 acres and was just 21 percent contained. The River Fire, meanwhile, is closing in on 50,000 acres and nearly 60 percent containment. Thousands of personnel are working to contain the fires, which together threaten thousands of structures. But with scorching temperatures and little rain on tap for the next few days, they may prove hard to stamp out. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump declared a “major disaster” in California, ordering that federal funds be made available to help the state cope with its destructive blazes and help residents affected by the Carr Fire, another enormous wildfire burning not too far away in Shasta and Trinity counties. Trump also took to Twitter to blame California’s “bad environmental laws” for the situation and to falsely assert that the state is somehow diverting water it could be using to fight fires into the ocean. So, there’s that. The truth is that mega-fires like the Mendocino Complex are increasingly becoming the norm out West thanks to a combination of more humans living at the wildland-urban interface, persistent drought, misguided policies that caused large amounts of vegetation (aka fire fuel) to build up on landscapes, and climate change. “Our contribution to climate warming has effectively made fuels 50% drier and doubled the amount of western forests that have burned since 1984,” Jennifer Balch, a fire ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Earther via email. John Abatzoglou, a climate scientist at the University of Idaho, noted several climate and weather factors that set the stage for the Mendocino Complex conflagration. There was the very wet winter of 2016-2017, which “helped created a bumper crop of grasses last summer,” as Abatzoglou put it in an email. This year’s fire season has been incredibly dry, with unusually hot nights since July that have inhibited fire-suppression activities. Abatzoglou also pointed to the long-term trend, noting that the dryness of fire fuels and frequency of hot nights have trended upwards in recent years. The rise in extreme fire activity across the West has been on display over and over in recent months, and it’s clear we need to get our shit together. A wildfire fix in the 2018 omnibus spending bill was a step in the right direction, allowing federal agencies to access disaster funds rather than tapping their normal budgets to deal with the biggest blazes. But there’s still plenty more work to do, from allocating additional resources toward removing vegetation on wildfire-prone landscapes to setting and enforcing strong building codes to holding those who start fires accountable. We could also try doing something about climate change.","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction.

Rescuers in the Turkish city of Istanbul are working into the night to search the rubble of an eight-storey apartment block which collapsed.
At least two people died and seven were injured but it is feared that others are trapped under the mound of debris in the city's Kartal district.
The building was officially home to 43 people living in 14 flats, Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said.
It is still not known what caused the disaster on Wednesday afternoon.
According to the governor, the top three storeys of the building had been added illegally.
A textile workshop on the building's lower floor was empty at the time, local official Zeki Dag told local media earlier. 
According to CNN Turk, the building collapsed at about 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT).

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A deadly tsunami that struck Indonesia unexpectedly has reportedly left hundreds of people dead and many more missing and injured.
It smashed into the beaches of Indonesias Sunda Strait on Saturday evening with no warning, as no earthquake preceded the event. CNN reported that the tsunami may have resulted from underwater landslides triggered by volcanic activity on the island of Anak Krakatoa.
Unlike tsunamis caused by earthquakes, such volcanically induced tsunamis may not trigger warning systems that are designed to alarm after large quakes, and thus may provide little warning, unless observed directly or detected by other devices such as wave buoy warning systems, Dougal Jerram of the department of geosciences at the University of Oslo told the Guardian. Particularly when the volcano in question, as with Anak Krakatau, is already active and displaying activity such that its eruption is not a new or a surprise event.
The tsunami left hundreds of buildings damaged in its wake, including hotels, homes, and other structures. At least 222 people are dead, though that figure is expected to rise. The Guardian reported that more than 800 people were injured in the incident, and dozens of people are currently missing.
Terrifying footage captured the tsunami crashing into a beachfront concert as the Indonesian pop band Seventeen performed onstage. The bands bass player and manager were reportedly killed after the stage collapsed, and other members of the band remain missing, according to CNN.
Indonesias president Joko Widodo expressed his deep condolences, tweeting that hes ordered all relevant government officials to immediately take emergency response steps, look for and find victims, and care for the injured.
Ilan Kelman, of the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction and Institute for Global Health London at the University College London, told the Guardian that the incident shows the ever-present challenges we face in developing warning systems for hazards like tsunamis.

"AP, AP","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) Christen Cunningham scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half to rally No. 16 Louisville, which hung on for a 56-55 victory over Clemson on Saturday.
The Cardinals (18-8, 9-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) led 56-49 with 17 seconds left after a free throw by Steven Enoch but then nearly lost a third straight in disastrous fashion. Louisville saw a 23-point second-half lead evaporate against No. 2 Duke on Tuesday.
A turnover and a held ball in the Tigers end led to a pair of 3-pointers by Marcquise Reed, the latter making it a one-point game with 3 seconds left. Louisville's Jordan Nwora tried to inbound the ball, but Reed got the steal. Nwora redeemed himself by blocking Reed's shot, and Clemson could not get off another shot before time ran out.
Cunningham hit 5 of 7 shots in the second half to help Louisville come back from a seven-point deficit.
Louisville was held to a season-low 19 first-half points thanks to shooting a season-worst 29.6 percent in the half. While Clemson wasn't much better at 37 percent, the Tigers took a four-point lead at the break thanks to a 3-pointer just before the buzzer by Clyde Trapp.
Elijah Thomas led the Tigers (15-10, 5-7) with 15 points. Reed had 13 points and 12 rebounds.
BIG PICTURE
Clemson: The Tigers dictated play with their physicality inside and defense. Clemson held the Cardinals to season-low 35.2-percent shooting and held Louisville to just three offensive boards. They could keep it up for a full 40 minutes, but their defense gave them a chance for an upset.
Louisville: After losing three of their previous four, the Cardinals looked anything but great on Saturday. The Cardinals' play in the closing seconds was reminiscent of how they wrapped up the Duke game on Tuesday and is something coach Chris Mack needs to address immediately.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Coping with the aftermath of such a disaster can be daunting enough at any age, but for those in their 70s and 80s, it can seem almost impossible. Half of them dont have it in them to start all over again, said Mari Stewart, the nursing supervisor for the clinic at the East Avenue Church in Chico, which has been turned into a shelter. Disasters can go on taking a heavy toll long after the initial crisis has passed, experts say. Being cut off from your medicines, being cut off from your medical care, being cut off from your social supports, the added stress of having lost things and living in an evacuation center and having to relocate studies clearly show that there are additional hospitalizations that occur, even deaths that occur, in the months afterward, said Dr. David Eisenman, the director of the UCLA Center for Public Health and Disasters. When older people are displaced, he said, for them to not be allowed to rebuild and live in their community again might produce a kind of harm thats much greater than if you or I or younger people had to rebuild and move away. By the time the Camp Fire was declared contained on Sunday, it had burned more than 153,000 acres and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, almost 14,000 of them residences, with hundreds more damaged. The death toll for the fire stood at 85. Most of the 500 evacuees who have been in and out of the East Avenue Church shelter since the fire began have been older people, said Ron Zimmer, the pastor of the church. The challenge, he said, is not just caring for them, but finding long-term answers for people who have lost everything and have little wherewithal to rebuild. Younger families tend to have larger social circles, Mr. Zimmer said, but our seniors tend to have closing social circles, so they dont have anywhere else to go.","Many who fled the flames ravaging Paradise, Calif., were retirees with health problems and few resources. “Half of them don’t have it in them to start all over again,” a nursing supervisor at a shelter said.",2018-11-25T23:25:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After a Wildfire, Rebuilding Life Can Be Hardest for the Oldest",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/california-wildfire-senior-shelter.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/us/26calfire1/26calfire1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Cory Doctorow,"Hurricanes Irma and Maria left Puerto Rico in tatters, but it would be a mistake to blame the weather for Puerto Rico's suffering; Puerto Rico was put in harm's way by corrupt governments doing the work of a corrupt finance sector, then abandoned by FEMA, and is now being left to rot without any real effort to rebuild its public services so that they can be privatized and used to extract rent from the island's residents. As Naomi Klein writes in The Intercept, this wasn't an ""Act of God."" Men -- greedy men -- laid off the skilled electrical workers who were needed after the storms; greedy men gave relief contracts to politically connected grifters who pocketed the money and did little or nothing for it; greedy men switched Puerto Rico from growing substistence crops to cash crops, leaving them starving when the island's only port closed; greedy men decided to make the island dependent on fossil fuels rather than solar, wind and waves. That is why dozens of Puerto Rican organizations, under the banner of JunteGente, are standing together to demand a different future. Not just a little bit better but radically better. Their message is a clear one: that this storm must be a wakeup call, a historic catalyst for a just recovery and just transition to the next economy. Right now. That begins with auditing and ultimately erasing an illegal debt, and firing La Junta because its very existence is an affront to the most basic principles of self-government. Only then will there be the political space to redesign the food, energy, housing, and transportation systems that failed so many — and replace them with institutions that truly serve the Puerto Rican people. This movement for a just recovery draws on local brilliance and protected knowledge to make the most of the richness of the soil, as well as the power of the sun and wind.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo made a second visit to earthquake-devastated Sulawesi island on Wednesday, saying efforts to help survivors were gearing up and he was keen to see economic activity resume. Five days after disaster struck, time is running out for anyone trapped under collapsed buildings, while aid workers warned of increasing desperation in hard-hit outlying areas that have yet to get any help at all. The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck the west coast of Sulawesi last Friday stood at 1,234, many killed by tsunami waves triggered by the quake. But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas largely cut off since Friday have yet to be determined. Underlining a growing sense of urgency, Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed Palu hotel. “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters. Asked about efforts to restore electricity, he said: “This is all a process. Most importantly, I’ve asked the governor to reopen economic centers so people start to return to daily activities, while the evacuation process continues, and later rehabilitation and reconstruction.” Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins. “We’ll continue this process so all the victims can be retrieved,” he said. At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said late on Tuesday rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but he declined to give an estimate of casualties. “We hope the death toll does not rise,” he said. “We’re continuing rescue operations but right now the team is racing against time.” ‘GOVERNMENT MISSING’ The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, about 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted early on Wednesday but there were no reports of any casualties or damage. Ash was not expected to disrupt flights. But concern is growing about conditions in remote areas, many of which have been cut off by destroyed road, landslides and downed bridges. Aid worker Lian Gogali said the situation in badly hit Donggala district was very difficult. “Everyone is desperate for food and water. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,” she said. She said her aid group had been sending in a trickle of rations into the district of some 300,000 people by motorbike. The national disaster agency has said tents, food, water and sanitation facilities for more than 60,000 displaced people are in short supply. Police have done little to stop outbreaks of looting. The government has played down the problem, saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. The government has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when two major earthquakes struck Lombok island, south of Sulawesi. U.S. President Donald Trump extended condolences in a phone call with Widodo, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters in Washington. The United States has provided initial funding, deployed government disaster experts and was working to determine what other help can be given, she said. Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike. The storm could bring hurricane force winds to the Aloha State for the first time in 26 years, along with pounding surf and torrential rain. Hawaii has only seen three hurricanes reach its shores in the historical record. That could end up being both a blessing and a curse for residents living on the island as they prepare. “Risks that feel unknown to an individual can increase someone’s risk perception, and perhaps, increase their attention to messages,” Gina Eosco, a social scientist supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Weather and Air Quality, told Earther. “On the other hand, given the rarity of such an event, some individuals may feel, ‘it won’t happen here.’ In other words, they’re using optimism bias.” As of Thursday at 2 a.m. local time, Hurricane Lane was packing winds of 130 mph, making it a very dangerous Category 4. Every island is under a hurricane watch or warning and forecasters are calling for 10-20 inches of rain over a large area. Some spots could pick up 30 inches—nearly double Honolulu’s yearly rainfall—with rainfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour. Hilo has already recorded nearly a foot of rain, and landslides have been reported. Lane is chugging along at just 7 mph, allowing it to stir up large swells, and storm surge could top out at four feet. To cap all this off, the strongest winds, rains, and surge impacts tend to occur on a hurricane’s northeast flank because of the way tropical cyclones rotate in the central Pacific. That’s right where the Hawaiian islands sit relative to Lane. This is the most dire forecast Hawaii has faced since Hurricane Iniki made landfall in Kauai in 1992. That storm caused $3.1 billion in damage and left an indelible mark on Hawaiians’ memories. Having it as a touchstone could help ensure Hawaiians take Lane seriously. “Hawaiians are pretty akamai, clued up,” John Marra, director of NOAA Pacific Regional Climate Services, told Earther. “The impacts [of Iniki] imprinted on a lot of folks.... We’re a little bit more aware than you might think.” That awareness already has Hawaiians following the same sorts of preparations you’d expect to see along the Gulf Coast: boarding up windows, filling up gas tanks, and stocking up on water and food. The state has requested and the federal government has already granted a disaster declaration, which could speed the response after the storm passes. All that being said, Karl Kim, the head of the University of Hawaii’s National Disaster Preparedness Training Center, pointed out that certain groups remain very vulnerable. “[P]oor people, homeless, persons with disabilities, seniors, and immigrant communities may be at-greater risk,” Kim told Earther. A May 2018 count estimates there are 6,530 homeless people across the islands. Police in Honolulu are canvassing tent communities urging homeless to seek shelter ahead of the storm, but there are a lot of people to reach and not a lot of time left. People living in poverty could also wind up homeless after the storm, something Houston saw in the wake of Harvey. Even the best preparations could still underestimate the impacts of Lane. Marra said the breadth of areas that will likely see massive rainfall totals could stretch resources thinner and leave people forced to fend for themselves for longer in flooded, muddy conditions. Then there’s the infrastructure on the ground. The state also upgraded its building codes in 2010 so that all new residential construction must withstand wind gusts of up to 130 mph. But older buildings don’t have to be up to that code and are at-risk from both winds and flooding. If those homes collapse or roofs rip off, the flying debris could put anyone in harm’s way. Marra also raised concerns about compound flooding from storm surge and rain that would have nowhere to go except into people’s basements. All of which is to say, Lane could test Hawaii in ways Iniki did as well as new ways.

Parts of southern Africa have been left devastated after Cyclone Idai swept through Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands more have been affected. Even though the cyclone hit Mozambique over a week ago, aid agencies are warning that the disaster is getting worse. Here are three reasons why:
1. More floods
The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday 14 March, and the subsequent flood submerged much of the city. 
But aid agencies warn that other areas continue to be at risk of becoming submerged. 
That's because it is still raining.
Two rivers, including the Buzi, burst their banks after rain in Zimbabwe and Malawi at the weekend, sending even more torrents of water into Mozambique.
And more rivers risk bursting their banks, says Rotafina Donco, Oxfam programme manager in Mozambique.
She told BBC Newsday that this rain was affecting most of the rivers in Mozambique that flow into the Indian Ocean. 
She said she expected more casualties. 
As late as Tuesday, she received information that people in Manica province, near the Zimbabwean border, much further inland from the epicentre of the crisis, Beira, were stranded on rooftops because one of the rivers had burst and the area had become submerged. 
In Mozambique waters are expected to rise by up to eight metres, putting at least 350,000 people at risk, says the Disaster Emergencies Committee (DEC).
A similar situation is playing out in Zimbabwe. 
Herve Verhoosel, spokesperson for the UN World Food Programme said in a statement that heavy rains in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces continue to cause massive destruction. 
The Marowanyati dam in Buhera, Manicaland has overflowed, raising river levels, he added.
2. Cholera
An outbreak of cholera could lead to the death toll increasing exponentially. 
Cholera is spread through human waste in the water supply. 
The flood water itself isn't the primary risk. Instead the risk comes because the existing drinking water supplies having been damaged by the flooding.

 Water supplies have been cut in Beira since the cyclone hit
This means people are finding it harder to find safe water. Larger groups of people are also sharing the same water supply, which increases the risk of cholera spreading quickly. 
""It's bound to rear its head at some point,"" says Paolo Cernuschi, Zimbabwe Country Director at the International Rescue Committee.
But that doesn't mean inevitable disaster. 
That's because cholera is relatively easy to contain when there is good healthcare available - people just need rehydration salts and to be put on an IV drip, he says. 
So, Mr Cernuschi says, there is the ""race against time"" to get the healthcare all set up before an outbreak happens.
More on Cyclone Idai: 
The worst-case scenario is that cholera breaks out in an area that is inaccessible, where there is no health care and spreads, Mr Cernuschi, said. 
Currently an area his organisation is finding it difficult to access is Zimbabwe's south-eastern town of Chimanimani - making it difficult to tell whether cholera has already begun to spread. 
Other waterborne diseases like typhoid and malaria also pose a risk, Mr Cernuschi says. 
Malaria in particular is likely to spread because the aftermath of the flood there is an increase in stagnant water - the preferred breeding ground of mosquitoes that spread malaria. 
Standing water also creates a risk of diarrheal diseases, Christian Lindmeier of the WHO told Newsday. 
Even though there is water everywhere it is not safe enough to drink.

Access to safe water is vital to prevent any further disease, says Mr Lindmeier.
Relief efforts need to deliver clean water or water purification tablets.
And that's the issue. 
""Getting there is the biggest challenge,"" he says.
The floods have cut off land routes and the only way to get to people is by air or water. 
3. Starvation
While people may make it through the next few weeks with the energy biscuits and water purification tablets that are currently being airdropped, a more long-term threat of starvation still looms.
Mr Cernuschi explains that the cyclone has compounded a crisis that was already there. 
He says drought in parts of Zimbabwe had already written off an estimated 75% of crops in the areas affected by the cyclone.
""Whatever crops that were being grown despite the drought have now been destroyed in the floods,"" he says.
He warns of a food insecurity crisis in the next six to 12 months - when people will face starvation as a result of the cyclone destroying their crops. 
As for the country that is worst hit by the cyclone, Mozambique, a total of 600,000 people are believed to be in need of help, writes Andre Vornic from the World Food Programme.

MARGARET COKER,"The current configuration of forces pits the predominantly Shiite Houthi rebels, who were long marginalized by Saudi-backed proxy groups in Yemen, against Sunni tribal and other militia groups that are backed by the Emiratis and Saudis. Diplomats involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations say that the United Arab Emirates officially warned the British government on Friday that an attack on Al Hudaydah was imminent. The Emiratis said they would give three days for humanitarian workers and nongovernmental organizations to flee the city. The International Committee for the Red Cross removed its staff from the city over the weekend. The United Nations worked out terms with the Houthi rebels on Sunday and planned to have its foreign staff evacuate from the city in multiple convoys on Monday. United Nations agencies planned to leave in place a skeleton crew of Yemenis from Al Hudaydah to try to keep their humanitarian mission going. Diplomats familiar with the situation say they believe that the Emiratis, who are leading the push for an attack, are looking to launch their planned assault while Washington’s attention is focused this week on the summit meeting between President Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The United States has backed the Arab states in the war, but Abu Dhabi has received powerful pushback from various American officials who see the idea of an urban assault on a densely populated city as an unmitigated disaster, in both military and humanitarian terms. The United States sells tens of millions of dollars of weapons to the United Arab Emirates and to Saudi Arabia every year, and the Trump administration has forged close ties with the crown princes of both nations. Those relationships with the White House — and the deep divisions in Washington — have emboldened the two Arab countries to push ahead with their own agendas. Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have threatened to push forward a bill to cut off some military aid to the Emirates and to Saudi Arabia, as a penalty for what they say are punitive and indiscriminate attacks in Yemen that are responsible for thousands of civilian deaths.","Diplomats say the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia will lead an attack on Al Hudaydah, a rebel-held port that is an entry point for humanitarian aid.",2018-06-11T12:53:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","U.N.

MICHELLE GOLDBERG,"Hurricane Maria has been the one real test of presidential leadership Trump has faced. We can see the results. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Trump was busy tweeting insults from his New Jersey golf club and campaigning in a special election in Alabama. When he did engage, he praised his administration’s response and complained that Puerto Ricans weren’t doing enough to help themselves. Experts acknowledge that Hurricane Maria would have challenged any president. “The basic model for a FEMA response is that the state and local authorities lead, and FEMA comes in to support their recovery effort,” Jeremy Konyndyk, who headed U.S.A.I.D.’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance under Barack Obama, told me. In Puerto Rico, where the whole island had been devastated, that was impossible. But it’s precisely because FEMA isn’t set up to handle situations like Puerto Rico that we needed a capable president. “When a government agency needs to do something it is not designed to do, it takes a lot of very disciplined, rigorous White House leadership” to make it happen, Konyndyk said. As an example, he mentions the Obama administration’s successful response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Neither U.S.A.I.D., the Centers for Disease Control, nor the military was equipped to address it alone. “It’s very easy in that instance for a government agency to just default to doing things the normal way,” Konyndyk said. In such circumstances, someone with a big picture view needs to figure out innovative ways to marshal America’s resources. Trump will never be that someone. And Hurricane Maria is highly unlikely to be the last grave emergency to happen on his watch. Experts are predicting another bad hurricane season this year, though not as terrible as 2017. As Konyndyk points out, every president since Ronald Reagan has had to deal with some sort of novel disease outbreak, including H.I.V., SARS and avian flu. Other, unforeseen calamities will take us by surprise. And we have a president that cannot sit through a briefing or do serious preparation of any kind, who has hollowed out the government and filled key posts with lackeys and grifters. Puerto Ricans have been the first American citizens to really feel what it means to have a president who is so wildly unable to fulfill his responsibilities. It’s hard to imagine they’ll be the last.","Shoes representing Hurricane Maria's victims on display in San Juan, Puerto Rico.",2018-06-08T10:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Price of an Incompetent President,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/opinion/trump-fema-speech.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/opinion/08goldbergWeb/08goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
"Opinion Contributor, Terry Garcia, Opinion Contributor","Fire boat crews battle the blazing remnants of Deepwater Horizon on April 21, 2010. (Photo: Coast Guard, via AFP/Getty Images) The Interior Department’s proposal to open up nearly all coastal waters to offshore drilling has been met with a striking level of opposition, even by the standards of the Trump era. When the comment period ended last month, approximately 1.35 million comments had been registered against the plan. There was bipartisan resistance from governors in all but one of the coastal states that do not currently allow offshore drilling. And 12 attorneys general signed a letter saying they intend to sue the administration if the plan goes forward. In response to this backlash, the message from the administration has been, again and again, that the risks from offshore drilling have been minimized — that now, it’s safe. I was on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, which killed 11 workers and spewed 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico eight years ago Friday. I was tapped to serve because, among other things, I led the implementation of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan. More: Drill offshore if necessary, but do it safely More: Trump administration offshore drilling move reeks of illegal political favoritism Our job on the Deepwater Horizon commission was to investigate the root causes of the tragedy and to make recommendations on how to prevent and mitigate the impact of future spills. But over the past few months, the administration has been quietly rolling back the regulations that were adopted in the wake of the disaster. The rules the commission suggested were not designed to be retributive. They are not overly restrictive. They are basic, commonsense standards to make sure that the companies we allow to profit off of our shared resources do not destroy them in the process. The next time someone insists that offshore drilling is safe, I suggest asking them three questions: ►First, the Deepwater Horizon tragedy was caused by a series of major safety oversights — from bad cement sealing the well, to multiple faulty valves, to misinterpretation of pressure tests, to a broken gas detection system on board. Can you guarantee that safety lapses and mistakes like these are now being caught before they lead to catastrophe? Our commission recommended something that, frankly, seemed fairly obvious: having independent auditors inspect safety and pollution prevention equipment. The administration has removed this rule. Instead, the industry itself will perform these checks — just like it did (and, clearly, often failed to do) before the Deepwater Horizon disaster. ►Second, the Deepwater Horizon National Commission report found that the industry’s ability to control a failed well, particularly in extreme conditions, was inadequate. Are these well-control systems now reliable? For instance, we found that before Deepwater Horizon, studies had suggested that blowout preventers — the last line of defense when it comes to maintaining control of a well — had high failure rates particularly when used in deep water. And that’s exactly what happened in Deepwater Horizon: The blowout preventer didn’t work. In the wake of our report, industry experts and regulators worked together to negotiate a Well-Control and Blowout Preventer Rule that would establish new safety procedures. The process took six years and thousands of hours of consultation. Today, because of pressure from the industry, this rule is being overhauled. Many of the requirements are being weakened — changes that, taken together, are estimated to save the industry $986 million over the next 10 years. In addition, many small, independent companies are beginning to move into deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet they often have terrible safety records, and lack the resources required to respond quickly to a spill and pay for cleanup and restoration. ►Third, currently, 97% of the oil produced from offshore drilling in the U.S. comes from the Gulf of Mexico. New environments will bring new, unexpected challenges. Have we proved that companies can navigate challenges specific to the new environments available to them? As safety procedures for offshore drilling are being weakened, the dangers are growing as it is attempted in new environments. For instance, in the Arctic — a treasure trove of oil resources that’s newly accessible because of melting ice — oil companies could face hurricane-force winds, constant darkness and temperatures below zero degrees Fahrenheit. In these environments, there's no nearby Coast Guard, no nearby cities full of engineers and supplies to fall back on. There are few requirements in place for companies to prove that they’re capable of managing new challenges such as these. More: On mpg standards, let California be California POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Add it all up, and it’s clear that we must ask these three questions, loudly and often — because if the answer to any of them is no, then chances are there will be a moment in the near future when another well blows and oil starts seeping into the sea. We’ll watch as ecosystems are destroyed, as food supplies are poisoned, as communities are devastated. Coastal cafes and fisheries will be boarded up. Community members will suffer life-altering health consequences. Beaches that were once vibrant and full, places where wildlife thrived and people came together, will be desolate. And leaders in industry and in government will paint it all as an unpredictable tragedy, a terrible mishap, a sad accident. Don’t buy it. Expanding access to drilling is incredibly risky. Weakening vital safety standards is cause for even graver concern. But doing both at the same time? That’s a near-certain recipe for disaster.

Vince Beiser,"Looking for news you can trust? Subscribe to our free newsletters. The view from the top of this windblown hill in Duolun County, in China’s Inner Mongolia region, could be described as either profoundly inspiring or deeply strange. For miles around, the earth is dun-colored and dry, stubbled with yellow grass. But the hillsides directly across from me are emblazoned with vast swaths of trees planted in geometric shapes: a square, a circle, overlapping triangles. The flatland below is striped with bands of identical young pines, standing in rigid formation like soldiers on parade. Zuo Hongfei, the deputy director of the State Forestry Admin­istration’s local “greening office,” directs my attention to a display with photos and satellite images showing how barren this place was just 15 years ago—a desert landscape dotted with spindly trees and shrubs. “See?” he says, pointing to one photo. “The houses were almost buried by sand!” One recent estimate said China had 21,000 square miles more desert than what existed in 1975. As the Tengger expands, it is merging with two other deserts to form a vast sea of sand that could become uninhabitable. Duolun, southeast of the Gobi Desert, has always been dry. But decades of overfarming and over­grazing turned vast tracts of it into pure desert. Climate change is partly to blame, but population growth is the main culprit. The number of people in Inner Mongolia has quadrupled in the last half-century, and the number of livestock has increased sixfold. With so many people cutting trees for firewood, so many farms and factories sucking up groundwater, and so many animals chomping grass, the land simply dries up. Lacking roots to anchor it and moisture to weigh it down, fertile topsoil blows away, leaving only sand and pebbles behind. By 2000, Duolun was up to 87 percent desert, fueling sandstorms that regularly engulfed Beijing to the south. The situation was so dire that then-Premier Zhu Rongji visited Duolun and declared, “It is imperative to build green barriers.” And build they did. Since Zhu’s pronouncement, millions of pines have been planted over a total of nearly 200,000 acres, with more going in every spring. According to official statistics, 31 percent of Duolun is now forested. Workers planting trees. The Duolun project is but a sliver of a titanic tree-planting effort unfolding across China. The sand lands that cover as much as 27 percent of the country have expanded rapidly—by 2006, they were devouring usable land at a rate of almost 1,000 square miles per year (nearly the area of Yosemite National Park), up from 600 square miles in the 1950s. Sand and dust regularly inundate farms and villages and shut down roads and railways. Hundreds of thousands of tons of it blow into Beijing and other cities, creating a vicious health hazard. Researchers estimate that desertification costs the Chinese economy billions of dollars per year. China’s solution is to build a “Green Great Wall.” The Communist Party has promoted tree planting as a righteous cause, even a civic duty, for decades, but the Green Great Wall is staggeringly ambitious: By 2050, the government intends to plant 88 million acres of forests in a belt nearly 3,000 miles long and up to 900 miles wide in places. The project has global relevance. According to the United Nations, desertification directly affects more than 250 million people across the world. The United States and the Soviet Union launched massive afforestation projects in the last century, and more than two dozen African nations are today working fitfully on a green barrier against the encroaching Sahara. But China’s sylvan crusade is one of the most ambitious tests to date of whether humankind can geoengineer its way out of a major environmental problem. After more than a decade of the Green Great Wall, the typical landscape in Duolun today is filled with trees and shrubs. However, expert opinion is divided as to the success of the program. The results so far have been splendid— if you believe the government. Thousands of acres of desert have been stabilized. The frequency of sandstorms nationwide fell by 20 percent between 2009 and 2014. The State Forestry Administration even claims the Green Great Wall, along with some additional planting programs it oversees, has begun to reverse the deserts’ overall expansion. But plenty of scientists remain unimpressed. Many of the trees, planted in places they don’t grow naturally, eventually die. The survivors soak up precious groundwater that native grasses and shrubs need, causing more soil degradation. Meanwhile, thousands of farmers and herders are forced off their lands to make way for the trees. China may be winning its war against nature for now, but at what cost? Wang Yue, 65, with his granddaugther at home. He was forced to move from his village to make way for tree planting projects. The Green Great Wall was launched in 1978, the same year Beijing began opening up the economy, and afforestation efforts have steadily increased since then. Rather than relying on revolutionary fervor, the government now harnesses capitalism to grow trees. Villagers are paid to plant seedlings. In some places, the government leases private land for afforestation. Entrepreneurs cultivate and sell saplings and harvest mature trees for lumber. All of this has reportedly reduced poverty in many areas. It has certainly made a few people very rich. Wang Wenbiao grew up in a family of sheep ranchers on the edge of Inner Mongolia’s vast Kubuqi Desert. “Two words were very important in my childhood,” Wang says. “Sand and poverty.” Sand is still important to Wang, but the poverty is long gone. I meet him one spring morning in the sleek Beijing headquarters of Elion Resources Group, the multibillion-dollar company he leads. A mirthless, heavyset man of 57, he sits in a white leather chair in front of a mural depicting waterfalls and forests, flanked by company PR reps. Wang got his break at age 28 when he was appointed to run a salt factory in the Kubuqi. “A jeep took me there, but it got stuck in the sand outside the gate,” he recalls. Sand and transport, he soon realized, were his biggest problems. As the crow flies, the salt fields were 37 miles from the railway station, but getting his cargo to the trains required a 205-mile detour via the only available road. With local government funding, Wang began building direct roads through the desert, with trees and shrubs planted alongside them to help keep the sand at bay. Workers clear sand off a road in the Kubuqi Desert. Elion’s salt business boomed, and the company branched out. Today, with more than 6,000 employees and reportedly $6 billion in revenue—about half from “traditional” industries, including coal power—Elion has rebranded itself as an eco-friendly enterprise. The company runs solar power fields, cultivates desert plants prized in Chinese medicine, and claims to bring thousands of ecotourists to the Kubuqi every year. Elion is also a major Green Great Wall contractor—to date, the company has planted more than 30 percent of the Kubuqi Desert (some 2,300 square miles) and has installed instant forests in several other locations, including an area northwest of Beijing that will host the 2022 Winter Olympics. “Green land and green energy,” Wang says. “That will be the direction of our future development.” Driving through a portion of the Kubuqi on an Elion-built road—an asphalt ribbon lined with upright rows of stubby young pines and slender poplars, most of them no taller than a fifth-grader—is a surreal experience. Beyond the trees, there is nothing but barren, rolling dunes. The road eventually leads to Elion’s palatial, dome-topped Seven Star Lakes Desert Hotel, which is surrounded by carefully irrigated rows of poplars, green lawns, and a fountain out front. The grounds include, improbably, a golf course. When a hotel staffer spots my photographer on the green, he demands the pictures be deleted. How can a desert sustain all this planting? “Everyone asks this question,” Wang told me. The trees use only a tiny amount of groundwater, he says. They are thriving, he insists, because Elion has literally made it rain. Increased transpiration from the greenery has made the climate more humid: “Twenty-nine years ago, there was only about 70 millimeters of rainfall. In recent years it has reached 400 millimeters,” Wang claims. “We changed the ecosystem.” Workers paint and install horse sculptures inside Kubuqi Desert Park, north of Ordos Plateau in Inner Mongolia. The desert was one of the three major sources of sandstorms that would engulf the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei areas. Kubuqi is now home to around 100 species of plants and wild animals, and the park itself attracts 200,000 visitors annually. Researchers I asked about this were skeptical. Planting an area that large might slightly increase rainfall, but to quintuple it? “I would say that’s not correct,” says Howard Diamond, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Cao Shixiong, a professor at Minzu University of China, offers an alternative explanation: “When it’s profitable, people tell lies.” “The central government gives out billions of yuan every year for tree planting,” Cao, a lean, banty guy with a roguish smile, tells me when we sit down together in a university conference room. “So there are many companies that want to take part. They’re not concerned with the environment.” Cao used to be a believer. He spent nearly 20 years working on government projects in Shaanxi province. “I thought it was a very good way to combat desertification,” he says. But many of his trees didn’t survive. “I realized it’s because of policy. We were choosing the wrong place to plant trees.” Wang Wenbiao, founder and chairman of Elion Resources Group. He and most other critics of the greening campaign acknowledge it has helped in some places, though not to the extent the government claims. It’s undeniable that some of the billions of trees are thriving. But huge numbers have succumbed to the arid environment or diseases and pests to which monocultural forests are especially vulnerable. In 2000, a beetle infestation annihilated 1 billion poplars—two decades’ worth. Cao estimates a walloping 86 percent of the Green Great Wall trees planted since 1978 haven’t made it. (Other studies have concluded that in some regions, 60 percent of trees die over time.) Lu Qi, head of the SFA’s Institute of Desertification Studies, smiles tolerantly when I ask about those figures. He and Cao disagree over the efficacy of the Green Great Wall. (“Anyone who works for the government is not a scientist,” Cao snorted when I told him I was meeting Lu.) Cao’s numbers are plain wrong, Lu says; contractors only get paid fully if at least 75 percent of their trees are still alive three years after planting. He points to the Duolun County project, which he helped design. “In 15 years,” Lu says, “we made trees grow in the desert.” Duan Feng Quan, a horse breeder, and his son at home in New Storage Village. The researchers’ biggest worry is that the trees are depleting subterranean aquifers so that eventually nothing will flourish. “For the past 1,000 years, only shrubs and grass have grown in those areas. Why would they think planting trees would be successful?” asks Sun Qingwei, a former Chinese Academy of Sciences desert researcher who now works for the National Geographic Society. “It’s not sustainable. Investing money in trees that are not supposed to be there is kind of crazy.” In any case, the Green Great Wall’s long-term ecological effects may take decades to reveal themselves. Local data on the environmental and socioeconomic changes the project has already wrought is “often not available or unreliable,” explains a 2014 study by American and Chinese scientists. Another study, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing Normal University, notes “there is surprisingly little unassailable evidence” to support claims that “the afforestation has successfully combated desertification and controlled dust storms.” A farmer working on the edge of the desert. Trees are planted in an effort to block the wind and stabilize the soil. State bureaucrats and researchers have ample motivation to hype the project. “Combating sand is the [government’s] project, so it has deep political meaning,” Lu acknowledges. “There are bureaucrats in every province and county,” adds Sun. “They get a lot of money for planting trees.” The day after admiring the view from the Duolun hilltop, I drive a short distance to a grim assemblage of squat brick homes. Called New Storage Village, this settlement was built to house some of the 10,000-plus farmers forced off their land to make way for the local tree projects—across Inner Mongolia, more than 600,000 farmers and herders have met this fate. Offic­ially, this was an effort to reduce the overgrazing that abets desertification, but many of the displaced people believe it’s just a land grab to free up resources for Han Chinese businesses; in some areas, herders have resisted with violent protests. “They would have demolished our home if we had stayed,” says Wang Yue, a sinewy 65-year-old born and raised in a now-vanished village where his family had lived for generations. Today, Wang has a house in New Storage Village—a couple of rooms with a sleeping platform, a coal stove, and a tiny courtyard out front. “Life was better in the old village,” he says. “Here, we have to buy oats to feed the animals. We used to just let them graze.” He ekes out a living doing odd jobs, but at his age it’s getting difficult. His wife is dead and his two daughters have moved away. He never received subsidies the government promised, he says—a complaint I heard from several others here. “They lied to us,” he says. “Tree planting is making some officials rich, but we lost so many things.” After we say our goodbyes, I walk down to where Wang’s dirt road meets the paved route through town. Off in the distance, I can make out a group of men with shovels. They are busy planting a line of spindly young trees.

Andrew Liszewski,"Ive never been able to quite figure out why I hate snakes, but my disdain of slithering serpents extends to the robot variety as well. Im sure part of it comes from the way they wriggle and writhe to get around; it just freaks me out. But at the same time, Im also impressed that robotics researchers have taught robo-snakes how to climb obstacles like a ladder. The simplistic design of a robot snakea long articulated tubeis also what makes them appealing for a variety of applications. Sending one slithering down a pipe to look for blockages or damage is one obvious application, but they can also be useful for traversing countless types of terrain. Two-legged robots that walk are getting better at it, but the act of balancing is computationally intensive, resulting in robots like Boston Dynamics ATLAS costing millions of dollars. Snakes are much simpler life forms than humans, and emulating how they move and locomote results in a simpler and cheaper robot, at least compared to a two-legged humanoid. And now, thanks to a joint research project at Kyoto University and the University of Electro-Communications in Japan, roboticists have improved where robot snakes can go. A newly developed gait, which has this robot snake bending and twisting its smooth body to create a series of connected shapes, allows it to slowly but securely wrap itself around each rung as it climbs a ladder. It isnt going to win any ladder-climbing races, but it means this robot can now more accurately recreate the abilities of a real snake, which include climbing trees and other obstacles. For disaster recovery situations, which robots like these are often developed for, the robo-snake could more easily traverse piles of rubble or damaged infrastructure that lay in ruins, which even humans, and human-like robots, would have trouble with.

Agustinus Beo Da Costa,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi jumped to 384 on Saturday, authorities said, with many of those killed swept away by giant waves as they played on the beach. Strong aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday morning after waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept through the scenic tourist town on Friday, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on land. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in news briefing in Jakarta. Hundreds of people were preparing for a beach festival to celebrate Palu’s anniversary. The festival was due to start Friday night. Some people climbed six meter (18 feet) trees to escape the tsunami and survived, Nugroho said. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” with thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, a bridge washed away and the main highway to Palu cut due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency has been widely criticized for not informing a tsunami had hit Palu on Saturday, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu and on Saturday authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts. The disaster mitigation agency has not been able to get any information from the fishing town of Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake 27 km (16 miles) away. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. Chief security minister Wiranto told TVOne the military had started sending in cargo planes from the capital Jakarta carrying relief aid. The city’s airport remained closed after its runway and air traffic control tower was damaged in the quake but officials said they were preparing to reopen to allow aid to come in. Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said no command center for disaster recovery has been created yet. The Palu area was hit by a less powerful quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed over 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

Saudi King Salman also replaced the heads of the ground forces and air defences. The news was published by the official Saudi Press Agency, but no reason for the sackings was given. They come as the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting rebels, is nearing the end of its third year. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is believed to be behind various recent shake-ups in the country. Last year dozens of prominent Saudi figures, including princes, ministers and billionaires, were locked up in Riyadh's five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel as the prince led a drive against corruption and abuse of power. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor This is another sweeping overhaul of Saudi institutions that has become the hallmark of the reign of King Salman, although the driving force is once again his son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudi intervention in the Yemen conflict was his initiative - one of the first indications of just how dramatically he was going to break away from the country's traditional caution. And it has so far failed, even if it has forced the Houthi rebels out of the south of Yemen and allowed the ousted government to re-establish a foothold.

"Harry Pearl, Agence France-Presse","CARITA, Indonesia - Desperately needed aid flowed into a stretch of Indonesia's tsunami-struck coastline Tuesday, but humanitarian workers warned that clean water and medicine supplies were dwindling as thousands crammed makeshift evacuation centers.
Fears about a public health crisis come as the death toll from Saturday's volcano-triggered disaster rose to nearly 400 with thousands more displaced from flattened homes.
""A lot of the children are sick with fevers, headaches and they haven't had enough water,"" said Rizal Alimin, a doctor working for NGO Aksi Cepat Tanggap, at a local school that was turned into a temporary shelter.
""We have less medicine than usual...It's not healthy here for evacuees. There isn't enough clean water. They need food and people are sleeping on the floor.""
The powerful tsunami struck at night and without warning, sweeping over popular beaches on southern Sumatra and western Java and inundated tourist hotels and coastal settlements.
The latest death toll stood at 373, with 1,459 people injured and another 128 missing.
Experts have warned that more deadly waves could slam the stricken region.
Many of the more than 5,000 evacuees are too afraid to return home, fearing another disaster.
""I've been here three days,"" said Neng Sumarni, 40, who was sleeping with her three children and husband on the school's floor with some three dozen others.
""I'm scared because my home is right near the beach.""
'CAN'T REACH THEM'
Abu Salim, with volunteer group Tagana, said aid workers were scrambling to stabilize the situation.
""Today we're focusing on helping the evacuees in shelters by setting up public kitchens and distributing logistics and more tents in suitable places,"" he told AFP on Tuesday.
""(People) still don't have access to running water...There are many evacuees who fled to higher ground and we still can't reach them.""
Aid was flowing in mainly by road while two government boats were on their way to several islands near the Sumatran coast to help dozens of marooned residents.
Officials have said the evidence suggested that an eruption at the rumbling Anak Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait -- between Java and Sumatra -- caused a section of the crater to collapse and slide into the ocean, triggering the tsunami.
Unlike those caused by earthquakes, which usually trigger alert systems, volcano-triggered tsunamis give authorities very little time to warn residents of the impending threat.
Indonesia's disaster agency initially said there was no tsunami threat at all, even as the killer wave crashed ashore.
It was later forced to issue a correction and an apology as it pointed to a lack of early warning systems for the high death toll.
Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said on Monday: ""The lack of a tsunami early warning system caused a lot of victims because people did not have the time to evacuate.""
Meanwhile, rescue teams were using their bare hands, diggers and other heavy equipment to haul debris from the stricken area and hunt for corpses, as hopes of finding more survivors dwindle.
The tsunami was Indonesia's third major natural disaster in six months, following a series of powerful earthquakes on the island of Lombok in July and August and a quake-tsunami in September that killed around 2,200 people in Palu on Sulawesi island, with thousands more missing and presumed dead.
It also came less than a week before the 14th anniversary of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, one of the deadliest disasters in history that killed some 220,000 people in countries around the Indian Ocean, including some 168,000 Indonesians.
The vast archipelago nation is one of the most disaster-hit nations on Earth due to its position straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide.

Uganda's Commissioner for Refugees Apollo Kazungu and three of his senior staff are being investigated. Investigations will also consider whether officials from UN aid agencies were involved. Uganda is said to host some 1.4 million refugees - welcoming more than any other country last year - mostly from South Sudan and DR Congo. But these allegations will cast doubts on those figures. The Ugandan Daily Monitor, which first reported the allegations, says the issue was first raised by UN country representative Rosa Malango. The newspaper says she raised three issues, including ""doubtful"" numbers of refugees, the trafficking of women and children, and fraud. One spot check in the capital Kampala found just 7,000 people when there were reported to be 26,000 needing aid, the Daily Monitor reports, leading to questions about where the money and resources for the missing 19,000 were going.

""The investigations will determine what the facts are and what action to take. These reports do not change or deter Uganda's long-held record and commitment to providing safety to refugees.""

JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS,"Photo House Budget Committee staffers delivered President Trump's Financial Year 2019 Budget to the Capitol on Monday. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday will present a budget blueprint that proposes deep cuts to domestic programs and a large increase for the military, but which has little relevance following the sweeping two-year spending plan approved last week that contained big boosts across the board. Mr. Trump, who once proclaimed himself the “king of debt,” plans to call for $200 billion over the next decade in new spending to improve the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, according to White House officials who said it would be paid with cuts elsewhere in the budget. The plan will contain increases for what Mr. Trump’s advisers call a “ready, larger, and more lethal military,” as well as $23 billion for border security and immigration enforcement. Administration officials said the budget plan would include measures to trim the deficit by $3 trillion over the next decade, though it was not clear how or whether Mr. Trump would seek to eliminate the shortfall altogether. The budget deal he signed last week, which includes increases in disaster aid and military spending, requires additional borrowing by the government, swelling annual deficits in the short term. Presidential budgets are little more than vision statements even under normal circumstances, given that Congress controls the federal purse strings and may disregard the wishes of whomever is sitting in the Oval Office. That is even more true this year, after congressional leaders in both parties essentially went around Mr. Trump to strike their own budget deal that bore little resemblance to the one he was drawing up. Lawmakers spread federal dollars around in the kind of legislative horse trading that the president has often decried as a symptom of “the swamp.” In a short statement previewing Mr. Trump’s plan, administration officials on Sunday highlighted several areas where the president was proposing more spending. It included a request for $85.5 billion in discretionary funding for veterans’ medical care and $13 billion in new spending to tackle opioid abuse through prevention, treatment and recovery support services as well as mental health programs. The officials did not specify any areas that would be cut. “As a nation, we face difficult times — challenged by a crumbling infrastructure, growing deficits, rogue nations, and irresponsible Washington spending,” Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement.

Ben Kuchera,"Sony needs to be concerned about how its handling the Fortnite disaster that continues to unfold, and it has already been more than 24 hours. Here’s the situation : If you’ve ever played Fortnite on the PlayStation 4 using your Epic Games account, that account is blocked from playing the game on the Nintendo Switch. That means your skins, your for-pay items and even your previous progress won’t be available on the PlayStation 4. The situation is just as bad moving in the other direction as well; if you play the game on the Nintendo Switch, that account will be blocked from playing on the PlayStation 4. Here’s the error message you get from the console, and it strongly implies that this is not Epic’s fault: “This Fortnite account is associated with a platform which does not allow it to operate on Switch,” the error message states. “Neither the Fortnite website nor Epic Customer Service are able to change this. To play Fortnite on Switch, please create a new account.” Sony has yet to address the blocked Fortnite accounts publicly in any way, and players are being relentless about demanding answers. Microsoft continues to dunk on the company. Remember, we still don’t know what exactly is going on or why, but popular sentiment is aligned against Sony. If you plan on playing @FortniteGame on your Switch here is how you connect your Xbox Live account to your Epic account https://t.co/djbyTNum23 And your progression &amp; items purchased in game on Xbox One will appear on your Switch after your accounts are connected — Larry Hryb @ E3 (@majornelson) June 13, 2018 What in the hell is Sony doing right now? Even a statement saying they’re looking into it and will have details soon would be helpful. But fans and competitors are beating the hell out of them and they’re staying completely silent. Sony has had to deal with the crossplay issue in the past with games like Minecraft and Rocket League, but those situations were managed and went away relatively quickly. This issue won’t go anywhere until Sony says that it will either help fix things, or that players will just have to deal with the fact they will get punished for playing Fortnite on the PlayStation 4. To give you an update: Nintendo declined to comment. Epic declined to comment. Sony has yet to return any of our communications. Sony is having trouble even posting anything during E3 right now without getting mobbed by players complaining about this account issue. For example, the responses to the company’s E3 schedule is a long string of complaints and arguments about Fortnite. It continues like this for quite awhile Twitter via Polygon “Here’s another reply telling you that your Fortnite account lockdown is utter absurdity,” gaming personality Jim Sterling wrote on Twitter. It’s the most popular response to Sony’s tweet which, again, is just about the company’s schedule. Players on Reddit are also going in on Sony. Greg Miller — who, it should be noted, hosted a long-running PlayStation fan podcast called “PS, I Love You,” — challenged the company directly:. @PlayStation, fix this. Not allowing me to sign-in to Fortnite Switch with my Epic account because it's linked to PS4 is tone deaf and points more to fear than market dominance. It does the opposite of what you want -- it makes me think about moving to Xbox for Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/D9xqv9aWdF — Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) June 12, 2018 That tweet has 19,500 retweets and over 8,200 comments. That’s a strong ratio, and it underscores how big this issue is among players. Parody accounts might as well join the NBA with these dunks: Today we revealed another big console exclusive: your Fortnite account. — Ex-CEO Kaz Hirai (@KazHiraiCEO) June 12, 2018 What is Sony doing after an entire day of being on the receiving end of this much pain? Staying silent... completely silent. No one from the company has even vaguely tweeted about the situation, and we have no communication from anyone within Sony after multiple messages. It’s exceedingly rare to have a situation this large be met with complete radio silence from company executives. Sony dominated this generation, in part, by being humble and being in touch with what players wanted. The PlayStation 4 was more powerful and less expensive than the Xbox One at launch, which certainly helped, but Sony also made it clear it was fighting back against invasive DRM and Microsoft’s proposed system that would have made it harder to sell or borrow games. Remember this from 2013? We may hear the excuse that it’s only been a day, but the above video proves how quickly Sony can move when it wants to get its message out. The Fortnite situation is one in which Sony can’t be as confident in its response. But now we seem to be dealing with a newly arrogant Sony, with a platform that is on top and doesn’t feel it needs to open the doors to let other people play. But those angry players aren’t going away, and Sony is going to have to address this, one way or the other. The question at this point is how much goodwill it’s going to lose until it does, and how satisfactory its response will be.","Sony needs to be concerned about how its handling the Fortnite disaster that continues to unfold.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","This file photo taken on Sept. 11, 2013 shows an aerial view of the island of Male, capital of the Maldives. (Photo: ROBERTO SCHMIDT, AFP/Getty Images) MALE, Maldives – The president of the Maldives said Tuesday he ordered a state of emergency to investigate “this plot, this coup” involving a Supreme Court ruling last week that ordered the release of imprisoned opposition leaders, including many of his political rivals. “This is not a state of war, epidemic or natural disaster. This is something more dangerous,” President Yameen Abdul Gayoom said on national television. “This is an obstruction of the very ability of the state to function.” Yameen, who has rolled back a series of democratic reforms during his five years in office, has said that the court overstepped its authority in ordering the politicians released, saying the order “blatantly disrupts the systems of checks and balances.” Yameen’s government has moved to assert its power since the Supreme Court ruling, announcing a 15-day state of emergency Monday night that gives officials sweeping powers, including to make arrests, search and seize property and restrict freedom of assembly. Hours after the emergency was declared, security forces arrested two Supreme Court justices and a former ruler who is now an opposition leader. “This state of emergency is the only way I can determine how deep this plot, this coup, goes,” Yameen said. Meanwhile, Yameen’s main political rival called on India to send an envoy – backed by its military – to free the imprisoned justices and opposition leaders. Exiled former President Mohammed Nasheed, who was among the opposition politicians ordered freed by the Supreme Court and is now in neighboring Sri Lanka, said in a statement that Yameen “has illegally declared martial law and overrun the state. We must remove him from power,” calling for the Indian envoy and military to be sent. “We are asking for a physical presence.” He also called on the U.S. to stop Maldives government officials from making transactions through U.S. banks. There was no immediate response from India or the United States, though both have called on Yameen to obey the Supreme Court order. Yameen has cracked down on civil liberties since coming to power in 2013, imprisoning or forcing into exile nearly every politician who opposes him. Hours after the emergency was declared, security forces in riot gear and blue camouflage stormed the Supreme Court building, arresting two of its judges, including Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed. It was not immediately clear what charges they faced, if any. The whereabouts of the court’s other two judges were not clear Tuesday. Later, former dictator and opposition politician Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was seen on cellphone video taken by his daughter being quietly escorted from his home by security forces, hugging friends and family and waving to supporters before being driven away. Shortly before his arrest he sent a message on Twitter saying a large deployment of police had surrounded his house: “To protect me or to arrest me? No idea.” His lawyer, Maumoon Hameed, said Gayoom faced charges including bribery and attempting to overthrow the government. Gayoom was president from 1978 to 2008, when the Maldives became a multiparty democracy. The Maldives is an archipelago of more than 1,000 islands with fewer than 400,000 citizens, more than one-third of them living in the crowded capital city, Male. Tourism now dominates the economy, with wealthy foreigners flown to hyper-expensive resort islands. But it remains, in many ways, a small community. Gayoom, the former dictator, is the half brother of President Yameen. The two men are now political enemies. Nasheed, the opposition leader, unseated Gayoom in the country’s first democratic elections in 2008. He and Gayoom are now political allies in an opposition alliance. Nasheed resigned during his presidential term following protests over the arrest of a judge. He lost the 2013 election to Yameen, then was convicted under Maldives’ anti-terrorism laws in a trial widely criticized by international rights groups. He was granted medical leave in 2016 and traveled to Britain where he was granted asylum. Nasheed said last week after the court ruling that he would mount a fresh challenge for the presidency this year. China, Australia, the United States, Finland and Denmark updated their travel advice during the latest unrest. China urged people to avoid travel there and the others told citizens to be cautious. While there was no immediate sign of India preparing to send troops to the Maldives, New Delhi does have a history of military involvement there. In 1988, Sri Lankan militants working for a Maldivian businessman tried to take control of the country and seized many government buildings. Then President Gayoom asked for Indian military help to drive back the militants. India dispatched 1,600 paratroopers, who quickly restored Gayoom’s control.

"Reviewed.com, Jessica Teich, Reviewed.com","At Reviewed, we’ve done a lot of research over the years. We thrive on testing products and solving the struggles and dilemmas of the day to day. However, we’re also here to help you on scarier days—when natural disasters strike. Whether it’s stocking your car with essentials that can keep you safe in a blizzard, testing flashlights in extreme conditions to see which ones will last through the worst weather, or knowing how to treat your fridge and freezer if the power goes out, we’re committed to doing the research that not only makes everyday life easier, but can help keep you safe in a crisis. No matter if it’s a hurricane or a blizzard or anything in between, it’s imperative to learn how to deal with extreme weather. Whatever elements might be heading your way, we've done the research to help you prepare as best you can. That being said, we're not weather experts—if you're in the path of a major disaster, please pay close attention to government-issued warnings and heed evacuation notices. 1. Check the state of your bug out bag Whether you call it an a bug out bag, or a go bag, or anything else, your emergency preparedness kit should be filled with over-the-counter medications like anti-inflammatories and antacids, as well as a week’s worth of any prescription drugs you, your family, or your pets take regularly. Aside from food and water, you will also need a long-lasting flashlight that can stand up to the elements, a back-stock of batteries, and first aid supplies like gauze, antibacterial ointment, and bandages. We also recommend stocking up on warm blankets if you need to shelter in place, extra toilet paper, and a good tool kit for last-minute emergencies, like boarding up windows. A full list of what you'll need in your go bag 2. Stock up on batteries If the power goes out during a storm, your life—and your connection to the outside world—will be completely battery-powered. Ready.gov, a public service campaign designed to educate citizens on how to prepare for, respond to, and mitigate emergencies, recommends you “turn on your TV/radio or check your city/county website every 30 minutes in order to get the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.” In order to do this, you’ll need to have a reliable, battery-powered radio on-hand in case of a power outage, and invest in several rechargeable batteries. These are better than single-use AAs—the good ones can run up to 11 hours at a time, and be recharged up to 1,200 times before requiring replacement. You’ll also need batteries for flashlights and emergency flares, so it’s best to buy extra—just in case 3. Keep your car well-equipped for emergencies If you need to evacuate, your car might be your saving grace—Ready.gov recommends to “keep your car in good working condition, and keep the gas tank full; stock your vehicle with emergency supplies and a change of clothes.” We also recommend in our guide for emergency roadside tools keeping your car stocked with an everyday pocket knife that’s easy to use and can get you out of a sticky situation, LED emergency flares that are bright, rugged, waterproof, and can run for up to 38 hours off of three AAA batteries, and a lightweight, durable emergency blanket that can keep you warm or patch a missing window. More items you should keep in your car in case of emergency 4. Make sure your carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are in working order If a winter storm is headed your way, Ready.gov advises that you “install and test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors with battery backups.” A good, working carbon monoxide and smoke detector is crucial during a storm—especially if you’re using a generator, which can be a leading source of death in cold winter months when used incorrectly. The Red Cross advises to keep your generator outside on a dry surface under an open canopy. “Never use a generator indoors, and keep it away from doors, windows and vents” that may lead inside. 5. Make a plan with your loved ones In the midst of a crisis, it's easy to lose your head and panic. Making a set plan with loved ones well ahead of time can help you keep your cool if things go awry. The Red Cross suggests that you ""discuss how to prepare and respond to the types of emergencies that are most likely to happen where you live, learn, work and play; identify responsibilities for each member of your household and how you will work together as a team; and practice as many elements of your plan as possible."" You can download their free template for preparedness planning. Ready.gov also suggests in its checklist for emergency preparedness that you nail down a shelter plan, as well as an evacuation plan that considers the different ages of members within your household, responsibilities for assisting others, dietary needs, and mobility restrictions. 6. Don’t rely on regular phone communication In a disaster, Ready.gov recommends communicating via text messages or social media, which “is usually reliable and faster than making phone calls, because phone lines are often overloaded.” Before and during the storm, be sure to keep your phone plugged into an outlet and fully-charged in case of a power outage. If you do lose power, use your phone sparingly and rely on a fully-charged external battery pack to recharge your devices when they run low—a good one can recharge a dead smartphone two or three times, and has multiple USB ports. Be sure to check in with your family and household members per your evacuation plan to prevent additional stress or panic. 7. Crank your fridge and freezer to their coldest settings When you still have power, turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting to keep food colder longer. The FDA recommends to keep food safe for consumption by freezing containers of drinkable water and perishable foods that you won't need right away—if you lose power, they’ll eventually thaw, buying you more time to safely eat in case of emergency. ""Take your small water bottles [and] just stuff the freezer with those,"" says James Judge, a member of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council, about safely storing food during an outage. Once the bottles of water thaw, you can use them for drinking and bathing. Frozen water bottles can also be used as ice packs for coolers, and will help keep food cold longer. 8. Rethink what you consider as storm-essential food Don’t make the rookie mistake of stocking up on milk, eggs, and bread when a storm is on the horizon—these grocery staples spoil quickly. Instead, stock up on shelf-stable essentials, like trail mix, canned goods, and jerky. Opt for low-sodium options whenever possible, and avoid alcohol and salty foods that dehydrate you. Don’t forget to get a surplus of pet food for your animals, too. And, for Fido’s sake and yours, do not forget a manual can opener. 9. Make sure all of your food is stored safely Store non-perishables and bottled water on shelves to keep it away from potential flood waters. Invest in an inexpensive fridge thermometer and float it in a glass of water to approximate the temperature of food as opposed to the air that surrounds it. Keep in mind that if the temperature in your fridge or freezer creeps above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, you'll have to toss your food. Learn more about food safety in a power outage. 10. If the power goes out, keep your fridge and freezer closed Once the power goes out, the FDA warns that your refrigerator will only stay cold for four hours and your freezer for 48 hours under ideal conditions—which means, sealed shut. Every time you open the fridge door door, you let cold air out and warm air in. During a power outage, you're better off opening your fridge sparingly, or better yet, using a cooler stuffed with frozen bottles and ice packs for storm food. Keep in mind that if the temperature in your fridge or freezer gets above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, you'll have to get rid of your perishable food. These handy charts from foodsafety.gov for fridges and freezers will tell you exactly what can be kept and what should be thrown away.

KEVIN DRAPER,"Babcocks friend Benjamin Horton, also an 18-year-old freshman, concurred, and said he hoped that the scrutiny of Marylands football program would both ensure the safety of its players going forward and perhaps that of football players at other colleges, too. It is a good wake-up call to show across the whole United States the culture behind football practices and coaches and how they treat their players, Horton said. Allison Kinzer, a 23-year-old student, said Durkins firing forestalled campus protests, and she questioned why he was reinstated in the first place. They shouldve never hired him back, she said. If they wouldve kept him, it wouldve been a disaster. Maryland opened the season with an impressive victory over then-No. 23 Texas, but as has been the norm since it joined the Big Ten five years ago, the team has struggled in conference play. Saturdays loss dropped Marylands conference record to 2-3, with games against ranked Ohio State and Penn State to come. Maryland last had a winning record in 2013, its final season in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Traditionally a basketball school, Maryland was a member of the basketball-mad A.C.C. for 60 years. Joining the football-heavy Big Ten has been blamed in part for the hard-charging culture that led to McNairs death and the reluctance of the Board of Regents to recommend that Loh fire Durkin, despite a pedestrian 10-15 record in his first two seasons. Reminders of the Big Ten are almost as ubiquitous in Maryland Stadium as the logo of Under Armour, the sports apparel manufacturer founded by an alumnus, the football booster Kevin A. Plank. The conference logo is painted on the field just yards away from two smaller 79 reminders of McNair. And over the west gate, Big Ten flags fly just below those of the state of Maryland.","Members of the University of Maryland football team surrounded the No. 79 to honor Jordan McNair before playing Michigan State on Saturday in College Park, Md.",2018-11-03T21:03:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","For Maryland Football, a Lackluster Defeat Caps a Brutal Week",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/sports/ncaafootball/maryland-football.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/sports/04maryland-1/04maryland-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1

Alanna Petroff,"""Don't use trade as a weapon,"" Ma said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It's so easy to launch a trade war, but it's so difficult to stop the disaster of this war."" Ma, who has built a massive e-commerce platform with global ambitions, made his comments just days after President Trump slapped tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines. Beijing, which expects to be hurt by the move, has said the tariffs aggravate the global trade environment. Yet more U.S. actions are expected. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told reporters in Davos on Wednesday that more trade actions are in the pipeline. Related: Team Trump talks trade in Davos Ma, who is chairman of Alibaba ( BABA ) and one of China's most prominent business leaders, acknowledged that globalization was going through some growing pains. But he said that tech advances and customer demand meant that free trade and globalization would continue. ""I think it is impossible to stop the trade,"" he said. ""The world needs trade.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"It's Monday, it's a new week, and while we won't pretend we know everything that's going to happen over the next seven days, we have some sense of what's coming up. Here's your briefing on some of the most important and interesting stories happening in the week ahead. 1) Face to face in Pyongyang Image copyright AFP What's happening? South Korea's President Moon Jae-in will meet his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang on Tuesday. Why is it important? This will be the first trip by a South Korean leader to the capital of the North (which whom it is technically still at war) in more than a decade. It follows two meetings earlier this year in which the leaders agreed to work together to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. The two Koreas' relationship has moved on since the new year after Mr Kim promised to suspend nuclear missile tests. But there are still some touchy subjects. Namely, South Korea's decision to take part in US-led sanctions and the North's human rights record. 2) The Emmy for best drama goes to... Image copyright Getty Images What's happening? The 70th annual Emmy Awards, which celebrate the best in American television, will take place in Los Angeles on Monday night. Why is it important? The glitz and glamour of a high-profile awards ceremony is admittedly a bit of fun, but the Emmys can often take a political turn. Don't just take our word for it. Two-time Emmy nominee and one-time presidential election winner Donald Trump has said so himself. ""The Emmys are all politics, that's why... The Apprentice never won,"" he tweeted in 2012. A number of stars, including host Stephen Colbert and actor Donald Glover, gave Mr Trump a bashing during last year's ceremony. Look out for the winners making any politically-charged remarks this time around ahead of November's mid-term elections. And look out for whatever the reaction to those remarks might be. 3) Nice to see EU Image copyright Getty Images What's happening? Leaders from across the European Union will hold a special meeting in Salzburg, Austria, on Thursday. Why is it important? This is seen as a key opportunity for UK Prime Minister Theresa May to lobby other EU leaders in the hope of securing a Brexit deal. Last week, her spokesman said the meeting would be a ""staging post"" in negotiations ahead of the March 2019 deadline. Both sides say progress is being made but there remains much to be agreed upon. Unresolved issues include the Irish border, data protection and the role of the European Court of Justice. 4) Maria one year on Image copyright Reuters What's happening? Thursday will mark one year since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, devastating the island which is still struggling to recover. Why is it important? The anniversary of Maria - which Puerto Rico's governor described as ""the worst natural disaster in our modern history"" - is likely to bring the US response into sharp focus again. The island, an unincorporated territory of the US, finished restoring power only last month. The hurricane is estimated to have caused $100bn (£77bn) in damage and the official death toll stands at nearly 3,000. But that toll has been disputed by President Trump, who has denied it without evidence and accused Democrats of inflating the number to make him look ""as bad as possible."" This led to a political storm that is unlikely to go away as Thursday's anniversary brings renewed attention on the disaster.",Your Monday briefing on the most important stories coming up over the next seven days.,2018-09-16T23:19:38Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Four things to know for the week ahead,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45513742,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FEDA/production/_103424256_untitled.png,bbc-news,BBC News,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionA train collided with a buffer stop and burst into flames next to a busy platform
The deadly fire at Cairo's main railway station on Wednesday happened because the train driver left the cabin without pulling the brakes, Egypt's public prosecutors believe.
They say a preliminary investigation indicates the driver stepped off the train to argue with a colleague. 
But the driver, who has been arrested, blames corroded brakes, reports say.
The train hit a buffer stop at Ramses Station, sparking a huge fire. At least 20 people were killed and 40 injured.
The collision caused the train's fuel tank to explode, setting the platform and nearby buildings alight.
Witnesses described seeing several severely burned bodies in the latest disaster to hit Egypt's rundown railways. 
What do Egypt's prosecutors say?
They say that the driver left the train to start an altercation with another driver over the right of way.
The unattended locomotive then sped off and hit the buffer stop.
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 A platform kiosk was engulfed by fire
But the driver says the train was faulty otherwise ""it would not have moved by itself"". 
""The brakes are corroded and the wheels are corroded,"" the driver is quoted as saying by Egypt's ON TV channel. 
The privately owned news website al-Shorouk has cited a source as saying the train was undergoing maintenance when it started moving at speed without a conductor.
The source ads that this is not the first incident of its kind, explaining that there had been two other cases of a train moving without a conductor that had not resulted in any deaths or injuries.
How did Egypt's authorities react?
Transport Minister Hisham Arafat resigned hours after Wednesday's disaster.
During a visit to the scene, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli vowed to severely punish anyone who was found to have been negligent.
""We will identify who is responsible for the accident and they will be held accountable,"" he said.
President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi extended his condolences to the families of those who died and pledged to ensure that the injured received the support they needed.
Local media published what they said was CCTV footage showing people on the busy platform as the train hits the buffer at high speed and explodes.
Another video, taken from a CCTV camera above a nearby subway staircase, appears to show people fleeing as a fireball engulfs the platform. 
""I saw a man pointing from the locomotive as it entered the platform, and screaming 'There are no brakes! There are no brakes!' before he jumped out of the locomotive,"" witness Ibrahim Hussein told Reuters news agency. 
""I don't know what happened to him.""

 The train's fuel tank exploded after the crash
Egypt's railway system has a poor safety record, which many observers blame on a lack of investment by successive governments and poor management.
In August 2017, 43 people were killed and more than 100 injured when two passenger trains collided outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters You may have heard about Hurricane Florence, the storm careering towards the US east coast prompting warnings of an impending disaster. But what makes Florence so different from other storms this year? From Beryl, Chris, and Debby? We've pulled together some of the key elements that explain why officials are so worried, and what damage Florence could cause. One video to watch The storm's winds may have weakened in recent days - they are now at 110mph (175km/h) - but there are fears Florence's slow-moving nature could bring different problems. Forecasters say it could slow dramatically when it nears land and then linger until Saturday, moving unpredictably along the coast and bringing torrential rain. Up to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. A further 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. So how are these people preparing? We spoke to those braced for Florence's looming arrival. Media caption People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane One striking picture Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hurricane Florence seen off the US east coast in the Atlantic Ocean This satellite image of Florence hurtling towards the east coast on Wednesday gives a sense of its massive scale. A National Weather Service forecaster has said it will be the ""storm of a lifetime"" for parts of the Carolina coast. One emergency official said it will be a ""Mike Tyson punch"" to the area. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Some forecasters have predicted it could be the most powerful storm ever to hit the region. One big number Florence could do more than $170bn (£130bn) of damage and affect nearly 759,000 homes and businesses, says analytics firm CoreLogic. Energy companies have also warned that the storm could knock out power for the foreseeable future in some areas. ""This is no ordinary storm, and people could be without power for a very long time - not days but weeks,"" a president of one energy company in North Carolina said on Wednesday. One bit of context Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina in 1999 and left floodwaters that were heavily polluted by agricultural waste If the storm lingers for a few days, the sheer amount of rainfall could lead to catastrophic flooding. But the biggest danger could be life-threatening storm surges. These could be as high as 13ft (4m) along parts of the North Carolina coast. All of this has led to fears that the state could face an environmental disaster if industrial waste - including hog manure and coal ash - is washed into people's homes. North Carolina has had this problem before. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd barrelled into the region and flooded vast areas with toxic water. Dead hogs and chickens were pictured floating in the floodwaters, which had been polluted with agricultural waste and petrol. One quote that tells a story Many people in coastal communities have followed the mandatory evacuation orders, but some are vowing to stay put and ride it out. Solange Iliou Thompson, a restaurant owner in the town of Wilmington, North Carolina, made her stance clear. ""I'm staying. The building's solid and Buddha will protect us,"" she told AFP news agency. ""What can you do? You can't stop Mother Nature."" A delicatessen owner in the same town told Reuters that he was also going to stay. ""I'm not approaching Florence from fear or panic,"" he said. ""It's going to happen.

Aman Tuleyev said stepping aside from governing Kemerovo was ""the right, conscious and only true decision"" following the disaster. He announced the move in a video address posted on the regional administration's website. Last month's fire killed more than 60 people, most of them children. Thousands of people protested in the aftermath of the tragedy over alleged safety failings at the Winter Cherry mall. Investigators say the fire alarm was broken and exits were blocked - and that security guards, who were supposed to help with any emergency evacuation, were among the first to flee when the fire broke out. Many children became victims because they were using entertainment facilities at the top of the mall, including a cinema whose doors are said to have been locked. Investigators are looking at whether the fire could have been started by an electrical short-circuit or arson in the children's play area. President Vladimir Putin - who visited Kemerovo in the wake of the fire - blamed ""criminal negligence"" for the blaze. Mr Tuleyev - whose niece was reportedly killed in the fire - had been governor of the coal-mining region since 1997, AFP news agency reports.","Aman Tuleyev said resigning was ""the only true decision"" following the disaster that killed 60 people.",2018-04-01T06:36:16Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Russia Kemerovo fire: Aman Tuleyev quits as governor,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43610306,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1138/production/_100580440_c21b4c57-ccd4-4d00-a8af-50edc0ca0fef.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1
John Biggs,"Researchers at the University of Zurich and EPFL have created a robot that shrinks to fit through gaps, a feature that could make it perfect for search and rescue missions. The researchers initially created a drone that could assess man-made gaps and squeeze through in seconds using only one camera. This extra feature – a scissor like system to shrink the drone in flight – makes it even more versatile and allows these drones to react to larger or smaller gaps in nature. “The idea came up after we worked on quadrotor flight through narrow gaps,” said PhD candidate Davide Falanga. “The goal of our lab is to develop drones which can be in the future used in the aftermath of a disaster, as for example an earthquake, in order to enter building through small cracks or apertures in a collapsed building to look for survivors. Our previous approach required a very aggressive maneuver, therefore we looked into alternative solutions to accomplish a task as passing through a very narrow gap without having to fly at high speed. The solution we came up with is the foldable drone, a quadrotor which can change its shape to adapt to the task.” The system measures the gap and changes its shape without outside processing, a feat that is quite exciting. All of the processing is done on board and it could be turned into an autonomous system if necessary. The team build the drone with off the shelf and 3D-printed parts. “The main difference between conventional drones and our foldable drone is in the way the arms are connected to the body: each arm is connected through a servo motor, which can change the relative position between the main body and the arm. This allows the robot to literally fold the arms around the body, which means that potentially any morphology can be obtained. An adaptive controller is aware of the drone’s morphology and adapts to it in order to guarantee stable flight at all times, independently of the configuration,” said Falanga.

Francesca Paris,"Indonesian soldiers search the bodies of tsunami victims at a beach resort on the island of Java on Monday. Waves swept terrified people into the sea Saturday night following an eruption on Anak Krakatau, one of the world's most infamous volcanic islands.
Achmad Ibrahim/AP
Rescue crews are helping thousands of people who were injured or displaced after a tsunami struck the coasts of Java and Sumatra in Indonesia on Saturday night. Manyresidents did not receive any warning before the tsunami, which killed hundreds. 
Volcanic activity on Indonesia's famous Anak Krakatau island triggered underwater landslides that caused the tsunami, officials say. Anak Krakatau emerged from the site of an 1883 eruption that killed tens of thousands of people, and has drawn tourists from around the world.
At least 373 people have died, with 128 missing and nearly 1,500 wounded, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency. 
Crews continue to search for survivors while retrieving bodies from the wreckage with heavy machinery and their hands, Reuters reports. 
The Red Cross has dispatched 22 ambulances and over a hundred volunteers to transport the injured. Blocked streets have hindered access to health centers in Pandeglang, on the island of Java, where Doctors Without Borders volunteers are helping to treat patients injured by the tsunami and falling rubble. 
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at the disaster zone on Monday, while military and volunteers continue to search affected areas. Authorities have warned residents to stay away from beaches because of the risk of continued volcanic activity.
The tsunami caught residents by surprise because the country's seismic activity detectors were not functioning properly, NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports. Nugroho acknowledged Indonesia's detection buoys have been dysfunctional since 2012, according to the Associated Press, a result of vandalism and budget issues.
Kathy Mueller, a communications delegate with the Red Cross, was working in Indonesia when the tsunami hit because of ongoing recovery efforts after a previous tsunami in September, which killed over 1700 people. 
She says Saturday's tsunami affected Java's entire western coastline.
""There are a lot of communities we know ... have not yet been accessed,"" she told NPR's David Greene. ""It's going to take some time before we get a fully clear picture of what the full extent of the damage is.""
The Indonesian Red Cross dispatched more than 117 volunteers to the affected area immediately after the disaster, Mueller says. They brought basic supplies, including blankets, clothes, food and water. 
The tsunami struck Indonesia's two most populous islands. Proximity to the nation's capitol, Jakarta, has facilitated the mobilization of volunteers, military and emergency personnel, compared to previous disasters.
Mueller adds that emergency respondents have become proficient at purifying drinking water since the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, which killed over 200,000 people.
But she says three major disasters since the summer massive earthquakes on the island of Lombok in July and again in August, followed by the September's tsunami and earthquake on the island of Sulawesi have taxed the country, even before the latest tsunami.
""People are a little bit tired now,"" she says.
On Sulawesi, thousands of residents still live in tented camps, according to Mueller.
Now this disaster has displaced 11,000 more people in Java and Sumatra, who are residing in government buildings and camping out in tents beside hospitals. 
""A lot of them were holidaymakers,"" Kuhn says. ""The government has tried to turn the western tip of Java into a new tourist destination to rival the island of Bali. But that effort has been suspended after this disaster.""
Several of the dead were members of the local pop-rock band Seventeen, which was performing at a year-end party in Java when the tsunami struck, sweeping away performers and concert-goers.","Warning systems failed to alert residents of danger when volcanic activity triggered a tsunami on Saturday.

Matt Novak,"The photos and video emerging from the Indonesian island of Sumatra right now are absolutely terrifying. Thankfully, no one has been hurt, but the smoke and ash bubbling from Mount Sinabung after an eruption earlier today is like watching some kind of mythical monster slowing taking over the sky. The volcano was dormant for over 400 years before awaking from its slumber in 2010 and killing two people. It killed another 16 people in 2014 and seven people lost their lives to the volcano in 2016. No one has been reported dead or injured from today’s eruption. According to Discover magazine, today’s eruption of Mount Sinabung was probably its biggest blast yet—at least vertically. But thankfully, it’s unlikely that we’ll see any impact on the climate from this explosion. From Erik Klemetti at Discover : Even with the relative size of the eruption, there is no chance this causes any climate impact. The initial estimates of sulfur released are too low to cause much atmosphere effects and the height of the plume wasn’t tall enough to reach the stratosphere. Current estimates of the ash plume are between 5-7 kilometers, so between 16,000-20,000 feet (down from the initial guesses of over 50,000 feet). We even had GIFs of what the volcano looks like from space. As Reuters reports, flight advisories have been issued for as far south as Darwin in the northern tip of Australia. The ash is covering everything in sight, again creating surreal images that seem more appropriate for mythical stories than the real world. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s Disaster Agency, has been tweeting images from the island, including this handful of small rocks that came raining down and crops covered in volcanic dust, like the plants above. If you’re in the area, authorities have advised that people should stay at least 4 miles away from the volcano. Keep you and yours safe out there, friends. The power of a volcano is obviously no joke. [ Discover Magazine and Reuters ]","The photos and video emerging from the Indonesian island of Sumatra right now are absolutely terrifying.

Tom McKay,"Daimler AG, the automaker which produces the Mercedes-Benz line of luxury vehicles, is facing growing scrutiny after US investigators reportedly found that it installed software to cheat diesel emissions tests on cars, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. The allegations closely align with a scandal that overtook Volkswagen in 2015 when it admitted to installing software on over 580,000 U.S. vehicles that, per Reuters, allowed them to emit up to 40 times the legally permitted emissions standard. Daimler has already admitted significant consequences may arise following reports in Germany’s Bild am Sonntag newspaper that ongoing US and German investigations are determining whether multiple functions in the software could be used to cheat tests, and that Daimler’s own employees questioned their legality. Daimler spokesman Joerg Howe told Bloomberg via email that the documents Bild am Sonntag based its reporting on had “selectively been released in order to harm Daimler and its 290,000 employees” and that “The authorities know about the documents and no complaint has been filed.” According to Bloomberg, available evidence indicates the company may have been playing fast and loose with the way it injected diesel exhaust fluid, which helps break down some nitrous oxide emissions in the car’s exhaust system: One was designed to help a tank of AdBlue fluid, which helps eliminate harmful exhaust gases, last for the entire period between a car’s servicing checkups. Another, called Slipguard, could recognize if a car was on a test stand and regulate the dosage of AdBlue, the newspaper reported Bloomberg added that throughout 2017, Daimler AG raised the amount it has cumulatively saved up to “cover potential obligations from sales transactions, warranties and legal proceedings” to over $17 billion (14 billion euros), an implicit recognition of the danger of the ongoing investigations into its cars as well as class action suits. Volkswagen has since surpassed a $30 billion tab for its own scandal, including fines, vehicle buybacks, and cash payouts. The incident also triggered calls throughout Germany to impose further restrictions on diesel vehicles or ban them entirely—as the disaster showed the “high-performance, low-emissions, low-polluting affordable diesel car was always an illusion,” per the New Yorker.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","I’m no expert, but I feel like our planet is trying to tell us something. In addition to every corner of the globe being on fire, doused in rain, or cooked by heat, a new volcanic eruption is adding heavy ash to the list of calamities befalling humanity. The Manaro Voui volcano popped off in Vanuatu, a small island nation in the South Pacific, prompting the evacuation of the entire island of Ambae. The eruption occurred on Thursday and sent ash flying into the sky. The plume of debris was clearly visible from space, but its impacts were equally dramatic viewed from Earth. The Vanuatu Red Cross released images showing an inky sky and cars driving with their headlights on as ash essentially blocked out the Sun. The deteriorating conditions have led the government to issue evacuation orders for the island’s 10,000 residents. A similar order was issued in September last year when the volcano rumbled to life, but Red Cross officials told ABC Australia the current eruption “is becoming more critical” compared what they’ve seen over the past year. The heavy ash has made the evacuation and response process even more difficult. “We tried to travel to the South today but we have to turn back, because trees are falling, visibility is very very poor, we cannot see far more than 2 meters,” Augustin Garae, a Vanuatu Red Cross disaster coordinator, wrote in a Facebook post. Indeed, photos show that the ash has bowed palm trees, clogged rivers, and smothered roads. Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University, likened the weight of the ash to a bucket of sand or shovel full of wet snow. “It is literally rock, pulverized rock that has been blasted apart during the eruption,” she told Earther. “When it rains and the ash gets waterlogged it is even heavier.” In addition to hampering evacuation efforts, ash also poses a huge health threat. The tiny particles and shards of volcanic glass it contains can get caught in lungs, aggravating respiratory problems. The volcano has been simmering since last year. But it seems it wanted to join the volcano frenzy of 2018. Eruptions have rocked Hawaii, the Philippines, and Guatemala, taking lives and causing extensive damages. Despite that there have been multiple high-profile eruptions over the past few months, I cannot stress enough that they are not related —nevertheless, I hold that it sure as hell seems like the Earth is trying to get rid of us.","I’m no expert, but I feel like our planet is trying to tell us something.

Eliza Relman,"White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico, a US territory whose citizens are American, ""that country"" twice during a Tuesday interview. 
 Gidley made the comments after President Donald Trump attacked Puerto Rico's leaders in a series of Tuesday morning tweets and accused the island of mismanaging disaster relief funds in the wake of the devastating Hurricane Maria in September 2017. 
 Gidley reiterated the president's argument and called claims that Trump has ""other-ized"" Puerto Ricans ""ridiculous."" 
 ""They have had a systematic mismanagement of the goods and services we've sent to them,"" Gidley told MSNBC's Hallie Jackson. ""Their governor has done a horrible job ... He's trying to find someone to take the blame off of him for not having a grid and not having a good system in that country."" 
 Gidley later said the phrasing was ""a slip of the tongue."" 
 At another point in the MSNBC interview, Jackson accused Gidley of rolling his eyes when she said that Puerto Ricans are US citizens. 
 ""The president says Puerto Ricans are taking from the USA. Puerto Rico is part of the United States,"" Jackson said, referring to the president's Tuesday tweet. ""There's a lot of confusion over why the president would say this and what he understands and how he views the people of Puerto Rico."" 
 ""That's ridiculous,"" Gidley responded. ""He's actually already traveled to Puerto Rico after this horrific hurricane — he was there.""

 Trump attacked Democrats on Tuesday morning for opposing a Republican disaster-relief bill for victims of hurricanes, wild fires, and other natural disasters across the country that Democrats argued didn't include enough food assistance for Puerto Rico. Republicans simultaneously opposed a version passed by House Democrats that included significantly more funding for Puerto Rico. 
 ""Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning, adding that Puerto Rico's governor is ""crazed and incompetent."" 
 Puerto Rico has not, in fact, received $91 billion in aid following the hurricane and the administration told the Washington Post that the figure was a high-end estimate for the total amount that will be needed over time. The island has so far received about $11 billion and a total of $41 billion in aid has been committed. 
 In comparison, the US government spent more than $120 billion on recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. 
 The president went on, ""The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted."" 
 In recent months, Trump has disputed Puerto Rico's death toll following the hurricane, falsely accused Puerto Rico of using its disaster relief funds to pay off its debt, and proposed redirecting disaster-relief funds to his border wall construction.","White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico, a US territory whose citizens are American, ""that country"" twice during a Tuesday interview.

Tom McKay,"Theranos, the beleaguered health care company that has fallen into serious financial trouble since 2016 over allegations its signature blood testing technology didn’t work and it misled investors, has found a lifeline. Per the Wall Street Journal, Theranos has secured a $100 million loan from Fortess Investment Group, though CEO Elizabeth Holmes wrote in a memo to the company’s remaining staff that it is “subject to achieving certain product and operational milestones.” The $100 million has averted doom for now, but is likely the end of the line unless Theranos manages to pull through, such as by proving that its specialized devices for running various types of blood tests can actually work. As the Journal noted, Theranos had previously raised some $900 million and achieved a valuation of $10 billion before the series of scandals nearly destroyed the company and threatened to drown it to death in lawsuits. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actually banned Holmes from operating labs in July 2016, while the company itself agreed to reduced penalties from regulators in exchange for staying out of the blood testing business for two years in April 2017. Investigators from the U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission are still looking into the company’s practices, per the Journal, while both investors and customers are seeking class-action lawsuits. The company has at least partially moved away from its original selling point—running tests on extremely tiny amounts of blood from a single pin-prick—and is instead betting all on the miniLab, a small device which it says combines the capabilities of a whole array of traditional diagnostic instruments. But scientists remain skeptical miniLab is anywhere near as revolutionary as claimed, and the prototype first revealed in 2016 didn’t contain any features not previously demonstrated by other companies’ products. miniLab’s predecessor, Edison, was a colossal disaster that saw two years of blood tests retroactively voided, risking the health of 890,000 patients who used Theranos testing services.

Hassan Hassan,"At an Ohio rally in March, President Trump announced that the United States would leave Syria “very soon.” Discussions within the administration after the remarks ultimately led Trump, by September, to commit to a broader plan to remain in the country to ensure the defeat of Islamic State. Despite that official recommitment, Trump’s words in Ohio did great damage, notably by eroding trust in and among the Kurdish-dominated forces. Before Ohio, the popularity of the U.S.-backed force was actually growing as it drove out ISIS from much of the country and created a de facto safe zone that Bashar al-Assad would not dare to bomb or attack. Widespread goodwill promised to ease the process of creating local and legitimate alternatives to the extremists and the regime in nearly one third of Syria. Trump’s decision on Wednesday to fully and rapidly withdraw troops from Syria—estimated at 2,200—should be seen against this backdrop. The White House explained that the surprise announcement does not signal the end of the global coalition’s campaign against ISIS. But even if the effort continues, the goal of keeping ISIS down just got much harder. [ Kori Schake: Trump just messed up the one thing he did better than Obama ] For a start, Trump’s claim that ISIS has been defeated is inaccurate. ISIS continues to hold a small but critical pocket of land consisting of a handful of towns along the Euphrates river and the Syrian-Iraqi borders. The campaign to expel the militants from their last stronghold is expected to take a month or two—although the announcement could mean a more aggressive effort that would increase civilian casualties. Even after the defeat of ISIS in this pocket, the fight will hardly be won. The U.S.-led campaign created new dynamics on the ground, which only the U.S. can now address. For example, U.S. reliance on the Kurdish militia known as the YPG angered Turkey, which views the group as an extension of the PKK, the insurgent group that it has been battling in-country for four decades. As the YPG expanded its influence during the fight against ISIS, Ankara shifted its priorities in Syria from backing the opposition in its fight against the regime to aligning with Russia to fight the Kurds. The timing of Trump’s decision is especially destabilizing since various parties in the conflict have positioned themselves to attack the areas under YPG control as the campaign against ISIS draws to a close. The end of the campaign means that the U.S. has to work harder, not the opposite, to ensure a peaceful settlement in eastern Syria. Such political support is a fundamental part of finishing the job against ISIS, and this cannot happen without the leverage Washington currently has by being present in Syria. So far, the U.S. presence has prevented Turkey from clashing with the YPG in eastern Syria, as it did in northwestern Syria with Russian approval. Washington does not have the luxury to limit its goal to defeating ISIS militarily and then pulling out. If it simply leaves, new wars will almost certainly be reignited between Turkey and the YPG, the Arabs and Kurds, and the opposition and the YPG. Much of the response to Trump’s decision focused on how the move could enable ISIS to return, but the immediate consequences will extend beyond ISIS : the Syrian conflict, after months of quiet, could be rekindled. The end of fighting in most of the country over the past year was possible because of delicate agreements brokered by Russia and various parties and because of the U.S. commitment to the Syrian Defense Forces (the alliance of Kurdish, Arab, and Assyrian militias led by the YPG). But the peace is still profoundly fragile. The nightmarish scenario of a return to all-out violence throughout Syria could directly undermine U.S. interests, including by provoking new waves of refugees and emboldening extremists. At this moment, the forces most active against the Syrian regime are predominantly those linked to ISIS and al-Qaeda, since the moderates have already struck deals with Damascus and Moscow. This means that hard-liners will be well-positioned to inherit what remains of the rebellion against the regime. Iraq is a likely victim of the decision too. Northern Iraq and eastern Syria could now be regarded as one security theater. Even when Syria was stable in the early 2000s, Iraq still suffered from cross-border activities and U.S. troops found it difficult to secure the borders. The situation today is far worse; borders are more porous than ever, and both countries are inter-dependent from a stability standpoint. If Iraq is important for the U.S. then eastern Syria must also be important. Americans directly involved in the fight against ISIS understand these challenges, and there has been a broad bipartisan pushback against Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria. Trump himself blamed the rise of ISIS in 2014 on Barack Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. If what Trump wants is to appeal to his base and claim victory against ISIS, there is another way forward. The next stage in the fight against ISIS requires more political management than kinetic operations; and the U.S. could benefit from a rebranding of the campaign to better define what it takes to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS in the coming years. This rebranding should involve an announcement to mark the end of one phase of the campaign, namely the territorial defeat of ISIS, and the start of a new phase, which is the long-term effort to build capacity and help locals prevent the return of extremists. The new phase should involve multi-country security support to eradicate ISIS cells and counter its insurgency tactics, a political strategy to manage the transition and resolve differences among competing forces like Turkey and the Kurds, and economic cooperation to rebuild destroyed areas. Trump loves branding, and rebranding. Someone should tell him that he can have his rhetoric, and stability too.","The president’s plan is a disaster.

Rina Raphael,"“A year ago, people would laugh at this,” howls Leslie Monroy, founder of Flowers on Flowers, which adorns its bouquets and floral creations with cannabis buds and leaves. “It would have been such a disaster.” Monroy is riffing on her unique business during this past weekend’s Cannabis Wedding Expo, as she greets couples, event planners, and venue managers at her booth. UB40’s “Red, Red Wine” wafts in the background as the entrepreneur models one of her popular creations, an ethereal flower headpiece populated with multiple weed buds. She sits alongside a 10-foot floral canopy—blossoming with roses, lilies, and marijuana leaves—that’s gathered dozens of spectators taking selfies. “This industry has gotten so much more fun,” explains Monroy. “People are more open to it.” That openness fueled business growth for the two-year-old Flowers on Flowers. Sales tripled in 2017, and the California-based company just announced it sold out for the season after recreational pot in the state became legal in January. This is just one of many success stories to be found at the expo in the ballroom of the iconic Sportsmen’s Lodge in Los Angeles. More than 30 vendors showcase how to infuse cannabis into one’s special day, be it through wedding cakes, tabletop linens, edibles, cocktails, centerpieces, or goodie bags. There’s even an all-inclusive cannabis resort in Jamaica hawking high honeymoons. [Photo: Rina Raphael] Keep It Classy Charleston native Doreen Sullivan runs My Bud Vase, a small business that repurposes vintage antiques into vases with pipes for discerning smokers. “I normalize bongs,” she explains, pointing to delicate pastel ceramics that serve as discreet centerpieces. This is her third Cannabis Wedding Expo, where she finds more brides (and mothers of the brides) looking to take a hit in a classy, understated way. Her booth is flooded with customers, many of them women oohing and aahing at the craftsmanship. “A lot of brides want them as bridal gifts,” explains Sullivan. The L.A. event was the third expo this year; there were two others—one in San Francisco and the other in Colorado—in previous months. The expos aim to serve as a blueprint for the future of wedding conferences as the legalization of recreational usage expands. The legal marijuana industry garnered $9 billion in sales in 2017, reports BDS Analytics. Combine that with the $55 billion U.S. wedding market, and the opportunities seem sky high. Philip Wolf (right) [Photo: Rina Raphael] “For 100 years, people have been stepping outside of the wedding to consume the joint,” says Cannabis Wedding Expo founder Philip Wolf. “But now, finally, you can present it with the wedding... there’s a lot of companies that are being established because it’s the emergence of two things that have never really been merged publicly.” Wolf, who also runs an elevated cannabis dining series called Cultivating Spirits, was inspired to launch the expos after finding events spaces, and the wedding industry in general, resistant to weed. “You’d be surprised how many places aren’t cannabis-friendly,” laments Wolf. [Photo: courtesy of Cannabis Wedding Expo He recounts how a fellow entrepreneur who specializes in cannabis bouquets complained that she was constantly denied a space at traditional wedding conventions. One, in fact, attempted to charge her double for a booth. “I literally was just like eff that, let’s start her own expo,” says Wolf. In 2016, Wolf presented the first Cannabis Wedding Expo in downtown Denver. Over 250 people showed up. Shortly thereafter, the event expanded to California. At the expos, attendees get a chance to see how cannabis seamlessly ties into a special event. That can range from cannabis and wine-pairing rehearsal dinners to decor accents with marijuana leaves. One of the more popular ideas is that of a “bud bar,” where guests easily order a joint much like a beer or wine. It’s an industry Wolf’s Cultivating Spirits is rather familiar with; their dining events are big on the bachelor and bachelorette party circuit. [Photo: courtesy of Cannabis Wedding Expo] “There’s a lot of creativity right now,” notes Wolf. “There’s a lot of new types of companies that are going to be emerging for the next few years.” The expo also serves as an educational tool for those who are unaware of their respective state restrictions. Up until recently in Washington State, for example, a law forbade gifting or sharing with friends–it was considered distribution of cannabis. There are little-known laws and nuances for cannabis weddings to be conducted legally in each state. As recreational cannabis grows and gains political momentum, Wolf is confident his expo will touch new areas in the next few years. He already has his eye on Las Vegas and Boston as potential host cities. “The cannabis industry is going to be growing by billions every year for the unforeseen future,” says Wolf. [Photo: courtesy of Cannabis Wedding Expo] Wedding Cake With A Kick Rachelle Harris, who runs a San Diego-based bakery called Got Sweetz, ventured into CBD oil-infused desserts less than two years ago. Although she spent nearly a decade in the traditional bakery goods space, she couldn’t ignore the significant uptick in customers who wanted a feel-good wedding cake. Her most popular varieties are chocolate Nutella and vanilla-strawberry puree. “More people are excited to have something that they can finally eat and enjoy because it tastes good,” says Harris. At the expo, she set up several tastings with cannabis-curious couples. That’s in addition to triple the amount of the inquiries. For Wolf, that’s what the expo is all about: Helping consumers discover the many creative ways cannabis can be enjoyed. “We have all these different categories represented, and you can come and be educated,” he says, adding, “in case you just want to smoke a joint before you walk down the aisle.”","As legalization of recreational weed sweeps the U.S., marijuana-infused weddings—from bud bouquets to cannabis cakes—has become a growth industry. “A year ago, people would laugh at this,” howls Leslie Monroy, founder of Flowers on Flowers, which adorns its b…",2018-03-08T06:00:26Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fastcompany.com'}",It’s High Times For Brides At Cannabis Wedding Expo,https://www.fastcompany.com/40539619/its-high-times-for-brides-at-cannabis-wedding-expo?partner=feedburner&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+fastcompany%2Fheadlines+%28Fast+Company%29,"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/03/p-1-the-cannabis-wedding-expo-will-help-light-up-your-reception.jpg",,Fastcompany.com,1
"Harry Cheadle, Matt Taylor","Arizona Senator John McCain, who has supported the tax cut bill. Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty In an alternate universe, one where you stick to your diet and the trains run on time and politics is as shiny and earnest as an episode of The West Wing, there is a tax reform debate going on where all the sides are respectful and intelligent. Republicans, in that universe as well as this one, want to reduce taxes, especially taxes on corporations, allegedly on the grounds that it will grow the economy. There is discussion of cutting some of the inefficient loopholes in the tax code primarily benefitting rich homeowners. Everyone agrees that obviously the IRS should use the information it already has to do most people's taxes for them. There are ideological disagreements between the parties, but both sides agree that if the deficit is going to be blown up, there should be good reason for it, and the primary purpose of any tax reform project should be to make life easier for as many Americans as possible. In our universe, alas, things are different. Congressional Republicans are advancing a pair of tax bills—one passed in the House already and one could pass the Senate in a matter of hours—as quickly as they can, with seemingly little regard for the impact they might have on the economy. Principally, the goal of this round of tax reform seems to be to reduce taxes on corporations and wealthy heirs (the Trump family alone would save over $1 billion, according to one analysis). Middle-class people get tax cuts too, but those cuts, unlike the giveaways to the wealthy, are set to expire as time goes on. Most people making under $75,000 will see their taxes rise by 2027 under the Senate bill because the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's mandate means a lot of them won't buy health insurance and therefore won't get subsidies and tax credits to pay for it. Thanks to a set of deduction eliminations, some middle-class households could get a tax hike next year, according to a New York Times breakdown. And selected groups, like grad students and people living in California and New York, seem to have been singled out for punishment. Even that summary glosses over many elements of the two bills. Yet this complicated legislation is being rushed through at breakneck speed. The Trump administration's Treasury department promised it would come up with a model showing that though the plan costs $1.5 trillion in revenue over ten years it would pay for itself by growing the economy. But that model hasn't appeared, and even the rosiest expert estimates say it won't come close to being revenue-neutral. On Thursday, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation released an assessment of the bill that factored in growth effects and found the Senate version would still jack up the deficit to the tune of $1 trillion over ten years. A Republican spokesperson for the Senate Finance Committee immediately responded to that assessment by saying, ""An analysis of tax provisions that do not reflect the final outcome of the evolving Senate tax bill—which will be amended on the floor this week—is incomplete."" In other words, it's impossible to judge the bill because it's still being written. And indeed it still is: After plans for a ""trigger"" that would raise taxes if certain revenue targets weren't hit got scrapped Thursday evening, Republicans were considering reducing some tax cuts in order to lower the bill's cost, though which taxes and how big the cuts would be was totally unclear. But if key elements of the bill are still undecided, voting on it seems like trying to build an airplane and fly it at the same time. And with the economy looking pretty good on paper right now (as Donald Trump loves to remind us ), there's little reason to rush it through rather than, just for example, reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is getting closer to running out of money every day. Large companies have plenty of money and borrowing is relatively easy, meaning that a big corporate tax cut is unlikely to do much to boost hiring or wages. Instead, that extra cash will likely trickle down only as far as shareholders and trust funds. Does that sound like it should be an urgent Congressional priority to you? If the Senate passes its bill, the House and Senate will need to conference in order to sort out the substantial differences between the two versions. Democrats will likely be frozen out of the process as they have been throughout this year's debates over taxes and healthcare. As the Times noted Thursday, the decisions made by Republicans in the next few days could reshape more than just taxes. Churches might have fewer constraints on political activism. States and cities could be pressured to cut their own taxes or slash services. And if the federal deficit grows, as it almost certainly will, Republicans could suddenly rediscover their deficit-hawk ways and call for reductions in government programs that provide benefits to the poor and elderly. The accelerated process seems designed to evade public scrutiny of any kind; the sad thing is, it might work. Even nominally anti-Trump Senate Republicans like Bob Corker, John McCain, and Jeff Flake are backing this bill—tax cuts for the wealthy remain a cause that unites the GOP. If the tax reform package does become law, Republicans will have gotten what they wanted: dump-trucks of money delivered to their wealthy donors' doorsteps, a set of fuck-you provisions that make life harder for Democratic constituents like student debtors, and a deficit spike that younger people, whom the GOP manifestly does not give a shit about, will have to eventually deal with. It's a cynical piece of legislation written by cynical people and endorsed by a cynical president who forgot about his populist campaign promises the same way he seems to forget about lots of things these days. The tax bill is complicated, but really it's simple—the people in charge do not care about the consequences of their actions. They also don't care about you.

Morgan Winsor,"President Donald Trump directed his outrage at Puerto Rico on Monday night, calling the U.S. territory ""a mess"" and its politicians ""incompetent or corrupt,"" after Senate Democrats clashed with their Republican counterparts over sending more disaster aid money.
Senators took test votes on two competing measures -- one drafted by Senate Republicans and another passed by Democratic-led House of Representatives earlier this year -- that would allocate billions of dollars in aid to U.S. states and territories ravaged by hurricanes, flooding, wildfires and other natural disasters in recent months. But neither piece of legislation got the support required to advance to a full floor vote. Democrats shot down the GOP legislation while Republicans rejected the House-passed bill, which proposes more aid for Puerto Rico than the Republican version.
No one can discern where hes getting that figure, which is many times higher than the actual number.
Democrats said they wanted the federal government to release the money already appropriated to Puerto Rico in a previous relief package, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars more. Republicans echoed Trump's claims that Puerto Puerto Rico has been given much more than disaster-hit states and hasn't spent the money wisely.
""The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any 'place' in history. The people of Puerto Rico,"" Trump posted on Twitter, ""are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp; Florida combined, yet their government cant do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works.""
""FEMA &amp; The Military worked emergency miracles but politicians like,"" Trump continued.

The storm struck as Puerto Ricans still were recovering from Hurricane Irma, which unleashed heavy rain and high winds just two weeks earlier.
Though 64 people died as a direct result of Hurricane Maria, an estimated 2,975 died as a result of its aftermath, according to Puerto Ricos most recent official counts based on a study, published in August of 2018, conducted by George Washington University and the University of Puerto Rico.
Jeremy Kirkland, general counsel to the Inspector Generals Office at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced last Tuesday that his office has launched an internal investigation at the request of Congress to investigate whether there was any ""interference"" in the distribution of aid money to Puerto Rico.
Over the weekend, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer penned an op-ed in The New York Daily News, saying the Trump administration ""has yet to disperse nearly $20 billion in long-term recovery and mitigation funds for Puerto Rico, more than a year after they were approved by Congress and a year-and-a-half after the historic hurricanes made landfall.""
""[The president] claims that Puerto Rico is getting $91 billion in disaster relief,"" Schumer wrote, ""but no one can discern where hes getting that figure, which is many times higher than the actual number.""

Well, turns out this is a very real risk and youll likely have to reconsider your rainy day activities. Why, exactly? Well, if lightning were to strike an electrical pole, it would unleash a surge of power that would fry everything in its path.
As CNET mentions, anything plugged into a wall in North America is designed to use 129 volts, and at their maximum, up to 169 volts. A surge would mean millions of voltsso its safe to say your flat screen or fridge will never see the light of day again.
But this begs another important question: Just how often does this actually happen? Theres not a ton of research as to the number of power surges caused by storms (though in 2014, a thunderstorm erupted in a widespread power surge in an area of Chicago, affecting some 244 residents and permanently damaging furnaces, air conditioning outlets, and furnaces in its wakeit happened again to the same neighborhood in 2018).
 Meanwhile, we do know thunderstorms are very frequent. There are some 100,000 thunderstorms a year in the U.S., and at any given moment, there are 2,000 thunderstorms taking place in the world, according to the The National Severe Storms Laboratory. And even the Department of Homeland Security recommends that you unplug unnecessary electronics when a storm comes in.

So what should you do when you hear about a thunderstorm rearing its ugly head on the weather forecast? For one, unplug electronics before a thunderstorm, not during one (otherwise, you might experience a power surge firsthand). The National Weather Service even recommends avoiding taking a bath or shower during a storm, likely so you dont risk a surge coming into contact with the water. 
You dont have to unplug all electronics, however. You can and should keep any electronics on that help you obtain weather information (of course, an unplugged laptop would be fine, too). Stay away from any plugged-in cables or wires, though. 
And as for surge protectors, these arent meant to withstand the voltage of a storm, as CNET notedso unplugging your Xbox is still your best bet so that you can play Fortnite another day.

ABC News,"The White House has sent Congress a $44 billion disaster aid request that's already under attack from lawmakers from hurricane-hit regions as way too small. The request issued Friday, President Donald Trump's third since hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria slammed the Gulf Coast and Caribbean, would bring the total appropriated for disaster relief this fall close to $100 billion — and that's before most of the money to rebuild Puerto Rico's devastated housing stock and electric grid is added in. The new installment would add $24 billion to the government's chief disaster account and establish a new $12 billion grant program for flood risk mitigation projects. Smaller amounts would go to small business loans and to aid farmers suffering crop losses. The request followed lobbying by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello, who pressed the White House for far more. There are sure to be attempts to add to the measure as it advances through the House and Senate. ""This request does not come close to what local officials say is needed,"" said New York Rep. Nita Lowey, top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. Even before the measure was delivered, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called it ""wholly inadequate."" Cornyn worked in September to nearly double Trump's initial request for Harvey aid and has been battling with the White House behind the scenes. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded, ""I don't think $44 billion is a low amount and my guess is if you asked any average citizen across this country they wouldn't feel that it's low either."" She said Texas ""should step up"" and provide state money to the rebuilding efforts. But she said damage assessments in Puerto Rico hadn't been completed yet and additional requests were expected. The measure arrives as lawmakers and the White House face numerous budget-related issues by year's end, including a deadline of Dec. 8 to avert a government shutdown. Top Capitol Hill leaders are also negotiating bipartisan spending increases for the Pentagon and domestic agencies in hopes of passing a catchall government funding bill. They are also seeking to renew a popular program that provides health care to children from low-income families. And there's a tax bill that is Republicans' top priority. GOP leaders have appeared wary of tackling other budget-related issues while the tax legislation was taking shape but time is running low and coming weeks are likely to bring a burst of activity. Talks on increasing tight ""caps"" on agency budgets have centered on a GOP plan for a two-year, $182 billion increase that still falls short of demands by both defense hawks and Democrats seeking more for domestic programs. Rossello has requested $94 billion, including $18 billion to rebuild the island's power grid and $31 billion for housing. The White House anticipates sending another request focused on the needs of the island territory but hasn't indicated when that would be. ""Because Hurricane Maria occurred more recently, damage assessments are ongoing,"" said White House budget director Mick Mulvaney. Mulvaney also asked lawmakers to consider $59 billion in spending cuts to pay for the aid, including $44 billion from benefit programs by extending automatic cuts known as sequestration over the 2025-2027 budget window. Texas and Florida officials also expressed disappointment. Abbott, the Texas governor, submitted a $61 billion request to Trump last month for Harvey-related damages, including ambitious requests for flood control and navigation projects. He called the White House request ""completely inadequate."" The Florida congressional delegation asked for $27 billion. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, said in a statement that the request ""doesn't come close to providing what is needed. People are hurting and they desperately need our help, yet this request has no money to provide housing for evacuees and barely any money for Florida's citrus growers. That's unacceptable."" ""Congress needs to pass a more robust disaster bill that actually provides the funding needed to help people recover,"" Nelson said.

"Opinion contributor, Andrew Cline, Opinion contributor","House Speaker Paul Ryan (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) During the 2012 presidential campaign, an infamous TV ad portrayed vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan murdering a grandmother. As she struggled helplessly, terror contorting her face, he coldly rolled her wheelchair to a cliff’s edge and dumped her over. Being called a murderer was Ryan’s reward for trying to keep Medicare solvent. He had proposed driving down expenses through market competition, hardly a radical concept in the United States of America. Under his plan, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by 2050, federal spending on major health care programs (Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Obamacare exchange subsidies) would fall from 5 1/2% of gross domestic product in 2010 to 4 3/4% by 2050. Not draconian. Without any changes, the CBO projected that spending on those programs would grow to an unsustainable 12 1/4% of GDP by 2050. Nobody cared about the numbers. All that mattered was the narrative. “Mitt Romney made his choice,” read the text in the 2012 attack ad. “Now you have to make yours.” More: Donald Trump and Republicans are botching health care. We need Medicare for anyone. More: Mental health crisis isn't about guns. It's about Trump &amp; GOP gutting Medicaid: Kennedy America chose. Poorly. The Romney-Ryan defeat in 2012 killed the political viability of entitlement reform. Five years later, the CBO projected that without changes to stem runaway federal health care spending, major health care programs “would account for 40% of federal noninterest spending in 2047, compared with 28% today.” Last week, the trustees for Medicare and Social Security issued their annual report on the programs’ finances. They conclude that Medicare will be insolvent by 2026, three years sooner than last projected. That’s just eight Star Wars movies from now. The trustees projected that Social Security will reach insolvency in 2034,16 years from now. The program will begin dipping into its trust fund not in some distant future when our grandchildren are in charge, but this year — right now, on our watch. It’s a similar story for the federal debt. In 2010, federal debt held by the public was 62% of GDP. At the end of 2017, it was 76.5% of GDP. This April, the CBO projected that it would reach 96.2% in 2028. Two days after the CBO made that projection, Ryan, whom the left-leaning Brookings Institution once admiringly called “the most daring budget hawk of his generation,” announced his retirement from Congress. As Romney and Ryan predicted, Medicare is headed for insolvency. They weren’t killing it. They were trying to save it from killing itself. It is still slowly killing itself, and Washington is doing nothing to save it. More: As state voters lead on Medicaid, could health care be the next gay marriage? POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Because voters prefer politicians who tell them that no hard choices need ever be made, politicians tell voters that entitlements need never be touched. Republicans only six years ago made entitlement reform and the federal debt two of their core issues. They’ve since adopted the opposition’s position: Pretend the problem doesn’t exist. Both parties sell voters a fantasy. The Republican fantasy was voiced last week by the Treasury secretary, who said economic growth will generate enough federal revenue to avoid any entitlement cuts or tax increases. The Democratic fantasy, voiced in reaction to Ryan’s proposals, is that the programs are fine and that all the talk of reform is an evil plot to hurt the poor and help the rich. In 2011, Democrats shouted that the Ryan plan would “end,” “kill,” and “terminate” Medicare. Politifact named that obviously false claim “ Lie of the Year.” Ryan and Romney said if entitlements weren’t fixed, they would drive the federal debt to unsustainable levels. They were right. They lost. No one cared. Selling fantasies gets you elected. Telling the truth gets you nowhere. That’s the lesson politicians have learned, so the new trustees report was all but ignored. Medicare will be insolvent in eight years, Social Security in 16, and the debt will soon surpass the size of the entire economy. The only politician daring enough to lead a fight to fix all of this is retiring at age 48. As the federal government rushes toward financial disaster, the president trades insults with NFL players and the opposition treats every presidential tweet as an existential threat to the republic. We delayed dealing with these crises in the hope that they would fall to some future suckers. But we’re the suckers. We believed the lies. All our delays bought us was a bigger crisis — one that’s just a few years away. Andrew Cline is president of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank in New Hampshire.

Josh Ocampo,"Fyre Festival, the infamous music festival that never actually took place, left several communities of locals in the Bahamas affected, including restaurant owner Maryann Rolle.
In Netflixs Fyre Festival documentary (one of two recent takes on the debacle; the other is a longer series on Hulu), Rolle explained how she and her staff at Exuma Point Resort catered several meals to festival staff around the clock and housed some of them at the hotel, too; They were left unpaid after its cancellation.
Rolle said she used $50,000 of her personal savings to help pay some of her costs, including employee wages. Since the films release, an outpouring of support has inundated social media and Rolle has now set up a GoFundMe campaign to recoup some of her costs.

As I make this plea its hard to believe and embarrassing to admit that I was not paid, Rolle wrote on the campaigns page. I was left in a big hole! My life was changed forever, and my credit was ruined by Fyre Fest. My only resource today is to appeal for help. There is an old saying that goes bad publicity is better than no publicity and I pray that whoever reads this plea is able to assist.
In just over a week, the campaign has already raised over $160,000, surpassing its original goal of $123,000 (though, given several weeks of preparation for the festival, it could only be a drop in the bucket of her overall expenses). The campaign is still accepting donations if you want to help Rolle out.
This has been an incredible outpouring of support for the workers affected by the Fyre festival, A GoFundMe spokesperson told Buzzfeed News. As ever, well be working with the organisers and beneficiaries to make sure the money gets to the right place.
Chris Smith, the documentarys director, has also confirmed to Buzzfeed News that he is now actively seeking to create a campaign in support of the Bahamian workers, seen throughout the film, who are owed at least $250,000 in unpaid wages.

"The Salty Waitress on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Dear Salty: Last week, my family and I were in the mood for fast food fried chicken and decided to pick up a bucket. We got an 8-piece and two sides, and it took forever for the order to arrive. I left in a huff and just wanted to be home.
But when I opened the bag, one of the sides was missing! I really wanted mashed potatoes and gravy and they forgot it. In that heated moment, in which I was hangry, I called the restaurant (a 20-minute drive away) and complained. The manager explained they cant replace it, as theres been fraud in the past and that its the customers responsibility to check their purchases before leaving the premises.
I think this is bullshit. Whats your take, Salty?
Yours,Extra Crispy
Hey Extra Crispy, 
Yeah, Salty thinks its a little bit of bullshit. 
Is there any disappointment more crushing than not getting those mashed potatoes with gravy that you wanted? Other than not getting into Mr. Palominos Beauty School after high-school graduation, nothing comes to mind. Especially if its those mashed potatoes Im thinking of, that used to come in a styrofoam cup? Yum. Nope, dont blame you for being pissed off.
But to put some responsibility on the customer: an 8-piece and two sides? It should have been pretty easy for you to check for that potato tub. I know, sometimes when I take my sisters rugrats for the afternoon and theyre screaming for Happy Meals, Im just throwing apple juices at them to shut them up and not really counting. But I should be! As a participant in the fast-food drive-thru transaction, I also have a responsibility to check what Im getting, although it may not be on top of my hangry mind to do just that. I always try to check, based on past experiences of driving away without a straw, or packets of ketchup, or any napkins (a disaster!). It takes two seconds.
On the other hand, I know its not always possible, especially for those extra large orders. Youre not gonna open every container, checking for exactly three thighs, two breasts, and four wings when a cars honking behind you. Needless to say, the onus is on the restaurant to get the dang order right. Theres this little adage we have that appears by the kitchen entrance: The customer is always right. Yes, even when they order a steak super-well-done and I know its going to taste like cheap shoe leather. So when you demanded satisfactiondid you possibly still have your receipt on you, or did you throw out of the car window?that manager for sure should have ponied up. I mean, how many time has he gotten the shaft, anyway? Im not sure how widespread mashed-potato fraud is these days.
This probably doesnt help you much, but maybe theres a few things you can do for next time. Sometimes theres a 1-800 number sign by the drive-thru window you can call to express your dissatisfaction. And if youre on the Twitters and the Facebooks, there are folks manning those accounts 24-7 and many times theyll work to right the wrong.
Bottom line, if I had to name a guilty party, Id say the restaurantbut you should also make a habit to check, just to save you a 40-minute roundtrip drive, and a missing carton of mashed potatoes, and a whole lot of frustration.","Dear Salty: Last week, my family and I were in the mood for fast food fried chicken and decided to pick up a bucket.

Christi Parsons,"The U.S. and South Korea have reached an agreement in principle to amend a decade-old free-trade pact that President Trump used to call ""horrible"" and a ""disaster"" — his first such deal and a victory, albeit a modest one, for his toughened approach to America's economic partners. Under the deal, South Korea agreed to limit its steel exports to the U.S. and made concessions on auto imports. In return, the U.S. agreed to exempt South Korea from the 25% tariff on steel that Trump announced this month. The deal removes a major point of friction between the two allies at a moment when they're preparing for negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear program. Relations between the U.S. and South Korea have been strained at several points in the last year as Trump has railed against an $18-billion trade deficit and denounced the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus. Trump has called Korus a ""horrible"" agreement that ""destroyed"" U.S. industry. A year ago, he threatened to terminate the whole agreement, which was negotiated under President George W. Bush in 2007 but not ratified until five years later under President Obama. The new amendments to the trade deal will mark modest concessions by a trading partner that is a relatively small player behind the European Union, China and Canada. The amendments do not directly address some major trade issues between the two countries, including agriculture. But Trump administration officials boasted of it as a major victory, one that ""validates President Trump's visionary approach,"" as a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday. The agreement is an example of ""the president fulfilling promises he made during the campaign,"" said one senior advisor, adding that it amounts to economic ""success across the board."" Earlier, a statement from the Blue House, the home of the South Korean president, called the deal a ""win-win,"" echoing a phrase used over the weekend by Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. Administration officials, briefing reporters on condition that they not be named, specifically predicted that the agreement would increase the number of American automobiles and auto parts sold in South Korea. The trade deficit in autos accounts for the lion's share of the overall deficit with South Korea. In addition to the agreement on autos, the South Korean trade ministry announced Monday that it would accept a new quota on steel shipped to the U.S. that equaled about 70% of its annual average over the last three years. The quota, the administration officials said, was a key part of the agreement to exempt South Korea from the steel tariff. It's designed to eliminate the problem of ""transshipment"": South Korean companies buying steel from elsewhere, especially China, and sending it to the U.S. South Korea is the third-largest exporter of steel to the U.S. Under the agreement, South Korea will begin to recognize U.S. standards for auto parts and reduce other requirements that raised the cost of U.S. cars. The changes will ""make it easier for our American companies to compete on a level playing field,"" one senior administration official said. Whether the deal will live up to that promise is uncertain, however. Currently, U.S. automakers in effect face a cap on the number of vehicles they can sell in South Korea. The deal raises that cap by requiring the South Koreans to accept U.S. safety standards rather than impose their own. But U.S. vehicle sales have run far below the existing limit, so it's unclear whether raising the cap will greatly change the picture. The deal also extends until 2041 a U.S. tariff on pickup trucks. The old trade agreement called for that tariff to be phased out in 2021. Extending the tariff reflects Trump's preference for protecting U.S. industries rather than lowering overall trade barriers. The extra 20 years of protection for U.S. manufacturers will preserve American jobs, the administration officials said. But there too the exact impact is unclear. South Korea's big automakers, Kia and Hyundai, are not major exporters of trucks to the U.S. The tariff, however, would give the two companies a powerful incentive to base production in the U.S. rather than South Korea if they decide to expand in the U.S. truck market. Trump bolstered his threat to upend trade deals early on by withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Obama negotiated with 11 Asian and Latin American nations. Trump said he would turn his attention to crafting bilateral deals. As part of those negotiations, he has used the steel and aluminum tariffs, which he announced with considerable fanfare in early March, as bargaining chips. He early on said Canada and Mexico would be exempt while the U.S. negotiates with them to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. More recently, administration officials have said that in addition to those two countries and South Korea, they would also exempt the members of the European Union, Argentina, Australia and Brazil. What concessions, if any, those countries will make in exchange remains unclear. The result has been to leave well over half of U.S. imports of both steel and aluminum clear of the new tariffs. Administration officials said South Korea would be exempt from the steel tariff, but not the new levy on aluminum. South Korea, however, is not a major exporter of aluminum to the U.S. The two countries also are closing in on a deal to limit currency manipulation, the practice of a country deliberately reducing the value of its currency to improve its trade performance. Under the agreement, being negotiated by the Treasury Department and the South Korean finance ministry, the South Koreans would commit to new rules on transparency. But the administration officials acknowledged that because the currency agreement would be a side deal, not part of the actual trade agreement, it has no real means of enforcement.","Los Angeles Times Trump closes his first trade deal, a modest step with South Korea Los Angeles Times The U.S. and South Korea have reached an agreement in principle to amend a decade-old free-trade pact that President Trump used to call ""horrible"" and a ""dis…",2018-03-28T01:01:55Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Latimes.com'}","Trump closes his first trade deal, a modest step with South Korea - Los Angeles Times",http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-trade-deal-20180327-story.html,http://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/assets/img/fallback-promo-image.png?token=false,,Latimes.com,1

It happened hours after the last boy of the soccer team was evacuated, but while professionals were still there to remove the equipment used in the rescue.

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Photo Investigators inspected the tracks at the scene of an Amtrak train derailment near Tacoma, Wash., on Monday. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times The revelation that a passenger train was speeding 50 miles per hour over the speed limit at the time of a fatal crash near Tacoma, Wash., has once again focused attention on Amtrak’s safety culture, the role of human error in rail accidents, and the need for technology that automatically slows trains that are going too fast. Late Monday night, National Transportation Safety Board officials said that the train, bound from Seattle to Portland, was traveling at 80 miles per hour, on a stretch of track with a limit of 30 miles per hour, when it jumped the tracks and careened into a busy highway and a stand of evergreens. At least three people were killed and about 100 were injured, officials said. The accident mirrored Amtrak’s worst disaster in recent years, in 2015, when a train derailed at more than 100 miles per hour in Philadelphia, on a curve posted at 50 miles per hour, killing eight people. Train 501, carrying 77 passengers and seven crew members, derailed Monday morning on the inaugural run of a new route for Amtrak’s Cascades service. It was not clear how familiar the engineer was with that stretch of track, or whether that played a role in the crash. Video Federal law requires railroads, by the end of 2018, to have positive train control, which automatically slows trains if they are exceeding speed limits or approaching dangerous conditions. In its latest progress report to the railroad administration, Amtrak said it had installed positive train control on all 603 miles of track on the Northeast Corridor, from Washington to Boston. Congress passed the law requiring positive train control in 2008, after the head-on collision of a commuter train and a freight train in Los Angeles killed 25 people. Railroads were supposed to have the system in place by 2015, but after it became clear that many of them would not meet that deadline, Congress extended it by three years.

Cory Doctorow,"Disaster capitalism depends on the idea that ""There is No Alternative"" and that the populace can only sit by passively while their infrastructure, government, homes and schools are hijacked and sold off to low-bidder corporations to financially engineer and then extract rent from. That's certainly the model that started to play out after Hurricane Maria, when Trumpist cronies were handed sweetheart deals and the people were left to die in droves while captains of industry carved up the loot. But the populace need not be a flock of sheep waiting passively for the shear: instead, they can rise up and take care of themselves, through systems of solidarity and mutual aid, and that's what's happening in Puerto Rico, where Molly Crabapple reports on the smashing success of anarchists and socialists whose collectives are filling in the humanitarian relief that has been denied to them by Trump's incompetent state and the shareholder firms who are more interested in their bottom lines than the human lives they are being paid to ease. So you've got the radical black feminists of Taller Salud, rebuilding homes in Loíza; Colectiva Feminista en Construcción, handing out ""food, supplies, and money for tarps""; there's the punks of Santurce's El Local, feeding 600 people a day from a community kitchen; and many others -- often these groups date back to the incompetent bungling of the Hurricane Irma relief, and have gone from strength to strength, forging ties with the diaspora in Miami and New York, showing people that there is an alternative. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, aid remained a bureaucratic quagmire, mismanaged by FEMA, the FBI, the US military, the laughably corrupt local government. The island looked as if it were stuck somewhere between the nineteenth century and the apocalypse. But leftists, nationalists, socialists—Louisa Capetillo’s sons and daughters—were stepping up to rebuild their communities. Natural disasters have a way of clarifying things. They sweep away once-sturdy delusions, to reveal old treasures and scars. Over the next month, Luis, Christine, and ARECMA, took over the group’s storm-ravaged hilltop center and set up the Proyecto de Apoyo Mutuo (Project for Mutual Aid). I flew back home to New York before I could see it open. They began by feeding hundreds of people a day, with rice, pork and beans, rather than the MREs and tropical-flavored skittles provided by FEMA and the military. Then they added a weekly health clinic. Classes in chess and bomba dance for bored kids (the vast majority of schools remain closed). A free meal delivery service for the elderly. Potable water. Even Wi-Fi. Their Proyecto is one of a rapidly growing network of autonomous, self-managed Centros de Apoyo Mutuos (CAMs), which now also exist in Caguas, Río Piedras, La Perla, Mayagüez, Utuado, Lares, Naranjito, and Yabucoa. Each offers a communal dining room, with delicious free food. They distribute goods donated both by locals and those abroad, and they organize brigades to clear roads with machetes and axes. The CAMs are established by and for their communities, and in the course of providing aid, they create spaces for discussion and political organization. In theory and in practice, they resemble the solidarity networks that left-wing Greek activists used to survive their country’s financial crisis. In the words of AgitArte, a radical San Juan art collective deeply involved in the CAMs, they don’t exist just to address urgent needs, but “to combat the onslaught of disaster capitalism and its henchmen.” Puerto Rico’s DIY Disaster Relief [Molly Crabapple] We live in a weaponized news-cycle, a political moment in which a cadre of ruthless looters are destroying the world, magnified by technology's design ethic that uses experimental methodologies to maximize ""engagement"" (that is, how much attention you give to a tool or application), without any regard to whether your ""engagement"" is driven by pleasure or anxiety. Threatening to sue journalists who paint you in an unflattering light has been a pretty effective tactic for the Trump crowd -- hell, Trump's special advisor Peter Thiel managed to destroy an entire media company in retaliation for their coverage of him, by secretly fronting legal fees for a clownish wrestler who had sex with […] Oklahoma Republican state Sen.

JESSE GREEN,"This is only in part so that Mr. Harrison, who now appears as a character onstage, can connect the dots between the Black Death and AIDS. The detour also allows him to delay the return trip down the mountain of plot he has spent the first half of the play climbing. What Mr. Harrison, the character, says he is avoiding is the very object of that trek: the play’s catharsis, which he doubts he can earn. In a world of endless suffering, a catharsis is “innately complacent,” he concludes. Like the rest of “The Amateurs,” this despairing contemporary interlude is frantically funny, even when it veers into an art history lecture. Playing Mr. Harrison, Michael Cyril Creighton, who in the medieval scenes is handy Gregory, paints a witty, affectionate portrait of a neurotic playwright afraid of his own tools. It can’t be a realistic portrait; Mr. Harrison could hardly wield those tools so expertly if his hands were shaking. As in his 2015 play “Marjorie Prime” — a superbly controlled exercise in speculative fiction that elicits profound feeling without appearing to solicit it — “The Amateurs” works by a kind of indirection. The magic happens, by design, wherever the playwright isn’t pointing. Photo Ms. Kim and Mr. Ryan in “The Amateurs,” a comedy about the Black Death and AIDS. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times So the postmodern gewgaws are a bit of a decoy. They might work even better if there were fewer of them, as Mr. Harrison seems to know. (“Hopefully you aren’t allergic to these sorts of shenanigans,” his stand-in says.) When Ms. Bernstine interrupts his interruption with her own take on Hollis’s story, you begin to wonder whether the material has gone a bit too deep into the theatrical weeds, too far for civilians to follow. But just as she did in Anne Washburn’s heady backstager “10 out of 12,” Ms. Bernstine, so legible and relatable and seemingly guileless, grounds even the most meta material with quiet feeling. Still, I kept thinking that a fully cooked play shouldn’t need so much exegesis and counterpoint. It didn’t seem likely that Mr. Harrison’s self-parodying seminar, however amusing, could deepen the play’s action when it returned to medieval Italy. Eventually, though, I understood that deepening wasn’t the point; distancing was. “The Amateurs” wants to be seen with a form of double vision in which the past and the present are both present. We are meant to be vigilant about the “luxury of fiction,” with its false sense of endings. Which is why these medieval actors all have names you might expect to find on a teen soap opera. At every turn, Oliver Butler’s gutsy production supports rather than tries to disguise such anachronisms. The singsong verse of the morality plays is countered by ribald cross talk delivered with naturalistic verve. And whenever the troupe’s pageant wagon — a cabinet of curiosities filled with handmade surprises — sits in the middle of the Vineyard’s modern stage (both designed by David Zinn) you see in one image the continuity of human creativity in the face of disaster. The cast, which also includes Greg Keller as a newcomer to the troupe, is a cabinet of curiosities in itself, a collection of Off Broadway treasures. Of course, all actors love to re-enact theatrical disaster stories, and Mr. Harrison loads “The Amateurs” with plenty of gags. But Ms. Bernstine and the others are seriously funny, by which I mean funny in a serious way: a good thing in a play that has so much on its mind. Among the themes that light up like fireflies here and there are the nature of sin, the purpose of art, the low status of actors and the low status of humans in general. If history has been a drama, it has consigned almost everyone throughout time to the chorus. And so it really is a thrilling, expansive, world-changing moment in a very sneaky play when Hollis, contemplating Mrs. Noah, first asks, What’s my motivation? Which is a question you can only begin to contemplate after asking, What is God’s? Category Off Broadway, Play, Comedy/Drama Runtime 1 hr. and 30 min.

JESS BIDGOOD,"• Hurricane Lane was expected to bring tropical storm and hurricane-force winds to parts of Hawaii, with up to 30 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. • President Trump issued an emergency declaration for the State of Hawaii on Thursday morning, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts. • The state’s 15 airports were set to remain open during the storm, barring infrastructure damage. As of Thursday morning, flightaware.com reported some delays at airports across the islands. The approach of Hurricane Lane is the third time in less than a year that Hawaii has braced for potential disaster. In January, an errant emergency alert about an incoming ballistic missile triggered an island-wide panic. In May, the Kilauea Volcano began to erupt, sending lava rolling over roads and homes in the same area that is now under a flash flood watch. Photo Alex Krivoulian, right, stocked up on water in Honolulu. Residents have been advised to gather supplies of food and water that could last them as long as 14 days. Credit Kat Wade/Getty Images And yet, with strong hurricanes rare in this part of the world, the threat of Hurricane Lane felt new and deeply unsettling to some residents, who heeded the National Weather Service’s advice that preparations to safeguard life and property should be “rushed to completion.” “Maui has not faced anything like this before. It’s serious,” Audrey Reed, 76, a resident of that island, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got everything we need: batteries, water, canned and dry foods, medication, first-aid kit, flashlights. It’s just a matter now of hunkering down and trying to ride it out.” Hawaii’s remote geography and mountainous terrain could pose challenges for recovery in the event of widespread damage, and Gov. Ige urged people to have a 14-day supply of food before the storm. Hurricane Lane arrives as other parts of the nation are still recovering from the megastorms of 2017. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston almost exactly one year ago, causing dozens of deaths and catastrophic flooding, and it was followed by Hurricane Irma’s wallop to Florida. Then came Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which may have killed more than 1,400 people, according to one analysis, and caused massive power outages. Some of the last customers were still getting their power back earlier this month.

M.H. MILLER,"Sports are an important touchstone for Mr. Grooms, who brought up the controversy surrounding his Marlins sculpture by saying, “Do you know about my disaster?” A spokesman for the Marlins declined to comment, but despite the backlash and the possibility that the team might remove the sculpture, Mr. Grooms is enough of a sports fan that he’s happy to be mentioned alongside the Marlins at all. “It’s exciting for me to be in the sports page, even in a negative way,” the artist said. “At least I’m there, you know?” This isn’t the first time a work by Mr. Grooms has invited controversy: His 1982 sculpture “The Shoot-Out,” a campy (or perhaps garish) showdown between cowboys and Indians, was moved from a Denver traffic island, after protests from Native Americans, and counterprotests by artists in its defense, to the roof of the Denver Art Museum. Mr. Grooms sees this kind of response as the price of public art and a wide audience. While many of his peers during his early days in New York have remained artist’s artists, Mr. Grooms has the distinction of being a populist, someone whose work has served as an introduction to contemporary art for many. In 1967, Mr. Grooms and his then-wife Mimi Gross created the first of two key sculpto-pictoramas, “ The City of Chicago, ” which includes a recreation of Michigan Avenue, with an enormous Mayor Richard Daley walking through a cavern of skyscrapers like some B-movie monster. The piece traveled to the Venice Biennale the following year, and Mr. Grooms appeared on the cover of Chicago Tribune Magazine twice in about six months. Mr. Grooms and Ms. Gross ramped up their ambitions with their signature work, “Ruckus Manhattan,” which had its debut in 1975. (A section of the enormous installation will make a rare New York appearance in Mr. Grooms’s new show.) “Ruckus Manhattan” was a more than 10,000 square-foot reproduction of the borough, from Battery Park to Times Square, that included a nearly life-size sculpture of a subway car, a metal Brooklyn Bridge that was sturdy enough to walk across and a 30-foot-high World Trade Center. It took 21 assistants (known collectively as the Ruckus Construction Co.) nine months to complete the work.","Red Grooms in his studio in TriBeCa, with “On Your Toes” (2009).

Andrew Liptak,"It looks as though Amazon is thinking about reentering the phone market. During the company’s presentation yesterday at the Television Critics Association press tour — in which Amazon released a slew of updates regarding some of its upcoming television projects — Amazon Studio head Jen Salke was asked if the company was working on a new phone, according to TheWrap. She indicated that she’s not only seen a prototype with a new interface, but that she has one in her office. Salke, who manages the company’s growing studio efforts, says that she hasn’t “felt an urgency to put a deadline on it,” and that the company “had a prototype phone that showed me the interface that they’re working on that’s about to be — that’s in the middle of being developed and coming soon.” She went on to say that she criticized some of what she saw, and says that “they actually created and sent me a prototype phone that’s in my office” and described the phone as being intuitive to use. There’s no indication of any sort of timeline or even if the company will produce such a phone, or if it’s just experimenting with one. We’ve reached out to Amazon for comment. Amazon’s first attempt, the Fire Phone, was a disaster and pulled after a year Amazon has been in the hardware business for over a decade now: its Kindle is a mainstay for readers, and its Fire tablet has found success since it was launched in 2011. In 2014, the company made a short-lived foray into the phone business with its Fire Phone, only to get axed a year later after poor reviews. There’s been other hints as well: last week, the company released its quarterly earnings report, revealing that the company turned a profit of $2.5 billion dollars in the second quarter. One line in the report, that the company wnats its “customers to be able to use Alexa wherever they are,” excited some analysts, fueling speculation that the company could be looking to reenter the phone market with a new device. One of the criticisms of the Fire Phone was its user interface — its three-pane structure was described as fun and useful, but that it was hampered by “unintuitive, convoluted navigation.” Salke’s hint that Amazon is working closely on figuring out a more intuitive interface seems like the company is learning from its previous mistakes. Given Amazon’s efforts to dominate not only the retail market, as well as its efforts to elbow its way into a prominent position in the streaming video market, having a device where a Prime member can watch its content from anywhere makes sense — provided whatever it produces can stand up against its competitors that already dominate the market.","During a Television Critics Association presentations yesterday, Amazon Studios head Jen Salke indicated that she has not only seen a prototype phone from the company, but that she has one in her office.",2018-07-29T16:54:38Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Amazon might be working on another phone,https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/29/17627314/amazon-phone-studios-jen-salke-rumor,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NNsWKlMj6D0LCGqdU5d0bkUzRuQ=/0x73:800x492/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2848250/amazon-fire-phone-009.1403114270.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,1

Laignee Barron,"Rescue teams are continuing to search through submerged villages to locate missing people after part of a newly constructed dam in southern Laos collapsed on Monday night, sending walls of water into the surrounding rural towns. The disaster has rendered nearly 7,000 people homeless in Attapeu, an agrarian province near the border with Cambodia and Vietnam, according to state media. Twenty-six people have been confirmed dead, according to the state’s official news agency, KPL. Many fear the final toll will be much higher. Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith called the disaster the worst to hit Laos in decades. When a portion of the $1 billion Xe Pien-Xe Namnoy hydroelectric project gave way on Monday, flash floods quickly swamped seven villages in the surrounding countryside. Unsuspecting villagers took refuge on rooftops and scrambled up trees as the water swallowed their town. At a press conference on Wednesday, Sisoulith said 131 villagers are on the official missing persons list. Earlier in the day, the state-run Vientiane Times reported more than 3,000 villagers, or nearly half of those affected, await rescue. District governor Bounhom Phommasane told the Times that the priority is bringing survivors to dry land. “A second step for us will [be] to recover and identify the deceased, but for now we hurry to find those who are still alive in the area,” he said. Rescue efforts have been complicated by heavy rain, which is forecast to continue for the rest of the week, exacerbating the flooding. The main South Korean company behind the development of the dam, SK Engineering &amp; Construction, said it is investigating what caused the auxiliary dam, known as Saddle D, to collapse. After reportedly noticing serious fractures on the structure on Sunday, the consortium building the dam advised 12 endangered villages to immediately evacuate. Just hours before the impending disaster, it issued a letter warning that millions of tons of water would cascade downstream if the dam failed. Advocacy group International Rivers said the disaster in Attapeu reveals the “inadequacy of warning systems to prevent loss of life.” “Communities were not given sufficient advanced warning to ensure their safety and that of their families,” the group said in a statement. “This event raises major questions about dam standards and dam safety in Laos, including their appropriateness to deal with weather conditions and risks. ” As Laos increasingly relies on tapping its network of rivers for exportable hydropower, International Rivers warned that climate change is simultaneously making unpredictable weather events more common, a combination that poses “grave safety concerns to millions who live downstream of dams.” The government has declared the flooded area a disaster zone and called for emergency aid supplies to assist the survivors. The International Red Cross, UNICEF and Save the Children are among those who have joined the response effort. “This is a terrible tragedy and we still don’t have a clear picture of its scale. Hundreds or even thousands of families are likely to have been left homeless, while some have lost loved ones. Many children are still missing and we are gravely concerned for their wellbeing,” Save the Children’s deputy country director Vilasack Viraphanh said in a statement.","Rescue efforts have been complicated by heavy rain, which is forecast to continue for the rest of the week, exacerbating the flooding.",2018-07-26T03:55:30Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",26 People Confirmed Dead as Rescuers Continue Search for Survivors of Laos Dam Disaster,http://time.com/5349355/laos-dam-disaster-rescue-efforts-death-toll/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rtx6ctlc.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,1
Joe Ciolli,"As the stock market enjoys one of the best earnings seasons in recent memory, an ominous situation is threatening to bubble up under the surface. It has to do with the market's heavy reliance on just a small handful of stocks, bringing a closely-watched measure known as "" breadth "" into potentially perilous territory. Goldman Sachs finds that the top 10 contributors have accounted for 62% of the S&amp;P 500 's 7% year-to-date return, which has has breadth hovering near the lowest level on record. And out of those 10 companies, nine are in the tech sector. This is reflected in the chart below, which shows that a breadth index maintained by Goldman — which provides readings between 0 and 100 — is currently sitting at, you guessed it, zero. Goldman Sachs So what's the big deal? Allow Goldman to explain. ""From a fundamental perspective, narrow market leadership typically reflects narrow earnings strength, which is often a symptom of a weakening operating environment,"" David Kostin, the firm's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a client note. What's more, the decline of breadth to such low levels has historically preceded meltdowns on both the market and economic fronts. The period immediately prior to the tech bubble was marked by extremely tight breadth, while similar conditions in 1990 and 2008 preceded economic recessions. Breadth was also notably low during non-recessionary economic slowdowns seen in 2011 and 2016, according to Goldman. ""Usually these narrow bull markets eventually led to large drawdowns when investors lost confidence in the increasingly expensive handful of crowded market leaders,"" said Kostin. With all of that haunting precedent to consider, Goldman still thinks the market can come out OK, at least in the near term. And that's because the conditions surrounding this particular instance aren't as troublesome as they were during past periods of turmoil. It all boils down to the current earnings landscape, which Goldman identifies as a saving grace of sorts for the market. While market returns are highly concentrated into a handful of stocks, Goldman finds that the earnings environment is surprisingly broad-based. The top 10 S&amp;P 500 stocks account for just 20% of index earnings, which is right around average for the past several years, and just below the 30-year average of 21%, according to Goldman data. Going forward, it will be up to investors to continue assessing the relationship between market breadth and its earnings-specific counterpart. If corporate profits stay widely distributed by comparison, it should alleviate some worries that a major stock selloff is imminent. It's when earnings breadth starts dipping that investors should start to worry, so keep your eyes peeled.","Goldman Sachs closely monitors a measure called ""breadth,"" which assesses the degree to which the market's returns are being driven by a small handful of stocks.

It’s a visually and emotionally engrossing fable, one that synthesizes so many of this unique filmmaker’s peculiar tastes and diverse artistic influences. It is a fairy tale, a monster movie, a Noir, a social commentary, and a valentine to the Golden Age of Hollywood, but above all else, it is a love story. Release Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018 See it on Amazon for $24.96 (Blu-ray) From our Review: The best aspects of Justice League are the chemistry between its cast and the film’s individual depiction of each superhero. Unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, these characters, Batman included, are decidedly heroic instead of unlikable and impersonal. They make an effort to save civilians and spare lives, and, ahem, come together to help each other. Justice League has some good moments and some bad ones, but it ultimately ekes out just enough entertainment value to warrant a look-see.

Like so many other classic kids movies and stories from throughout time, it all stems from the idea of a character born into a certain kind of world or family, but with the unique desire to do the complete opposite of what that world or family says they must. What happens if a rat doesn’t want to steal food, but wants to cook? Or, as in the case of Ferdinand, what if a bull doesn’t want to spend his life fighting matadors in a ring? What if, instead, he’d rather spend his days smelling flowers and rolling through hills?

Assuming you were around in the 1990s and actually remember who Tonya Harding is, you can probably only recall a handful of the major bullet points. Tonya Harding was an Olympic figure skater. She was at least partially responsible for a violent assault on one of her competitors, Nancy Kerrigan. She was all anyone could talk about in 1994, before fading into relative obscurity. (You might also recall that she co-starred in the 1996 low budget action movie Breakaway, but let’s be honest, you probably don’t.)

James Franco’s new film The Disaster Artist reveals the strange but (apparently) true story of how the worst movie ever made actually got made, and it’s an unusually heartwarming ode to outsider art.

Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests -- Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each member of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.

"Fred Kaplan, Fred Kaplan","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un meets members of the special delegation of South Korea’s president in this photo released by North Korea’s Korean Central News Agency on Tuesday. Peace is not at hand with North Korea, but talks are, and President Donald Trump needs to get ready for them if he doesn’t want to foment a diplomatic disaster. The big news (and it is big news) came Tuesday morning, when South Korean envoys said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had told them he was willing to hold nuclear talks with the United States—and suspend its tests of ballistic missiles and nuclear explosives while the talks continue. Kim also reportedly said that he would be open to giving up his nuclear weapons, in exchange for assurances of his country’s security. How Kim, whose government has not yet confirmed the overture, defines that last point—just what he considers vital for his country’s security—could be the deal-killer. If he demands the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from South Korea or even the suspension of joint military exercises in the region, Trump (or any American president) couldn’t go along. But the door is now wide open, for the first time in a dozen years, to begin talks. An unconditional moratorium on North Korean missile and nuclear tests is a genuine sweetener. And if Trump refuses the offer—if he demands, as he did as recently as Saturday, that Kim “de-nuke” before talks even begin—then he will only strengthen the North Korean regime and weaken America’s position in all of East Asia. To the extent that Trump did cause this shift to happen, his success will be measured by how deftly he now pivots to exploit the opening South Korean President Moon Jae-in is properly skeptical of Kim’s overtures, but he and his Democratic Party ultimately want peace and harmony with North Korea. If Trump proves unwilling to give that goal the slightest chance—if it seems that he’s been imposing new sanctions and threatening war, not in order to push Kim to the bargaining table but simply to push him out of power or destroy his regime—then he will drive a wedge in U.S.–South Korean relations, and Moon will feel compelled to forge his own ties to the North. China will also feel less obligated to abide by U.N. trade sanctions. Japan will view this growing alignment of China and the two Koreas with alarm and—equally troubled by America’s declining influence in the region—will ratchet up its own military power, possibly even start developing its own nuclear arsenal On the other hand, if Trump sends a delegation, he will shore up U.S. standing as a strong power and good ally. He could also take credit—and he might be, to some extent, correct—for making the talks happen through his threats to use force if Kim didn’t back down. To the extent that Trump did cause this shift to happen, his success will be measured by how deftly he now pivots to exploit the opening. Sanctions and threats don’t often work; but when they do, they have to be put on the table along with the bad behavior that provoked them. To the extent Kim backs off from the bad behavior, Trump has to be ready to back off the sanctions or threats—or these talks will go nowhere. The talks may go nowhere anyway, but they’re worth holding, for our own national-security interests, if just to keep North Korea from conducting more nuclear and missile tests. Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum, suggests, “as a goodwill gesture,” that Trump and Moon announce that their next joint military exercises—scheduled for April—will not include any scenarios that involve killing the enemy’s leader. “This,” he writes, “would demonstrate US sensitivity toward genuine [North Korean] concerns while also demonstrating continued [U.S.] resolve to defend” South Korea. But Trump must do more than send a delegation to talks. If the negotiations are to have any chance of success, or even if he simply wants to demonstrate that he stepped up threats and sanctions for peaceful aims and not just for their own sake, he needs to embark on a full-court diplomatic press in the region. This should involve sending emissaries to Japan and South Korea in particular, coordinating common negotiating positions and assuring them that he’s not hellbent on war but that he won’t sacrifice their security interests either. Two questions raise their heads at this point: First, is Trump inclined to do all this? Second, is his administration able to follow through? As to the first question, I doubt he’s given it much thought, but if enough of his advisers and enablers persuade him that he could be a historic peacemaker, who knows where he might be swayed? The second question is, in a way, tougher: Let’s say Trump can be maneuvered to send someone to the talks— who would that be? I’ve written this many times, but it’s still true and more pertinent than ever: Our government has no ambassador to South Korea; the State Department’s back-channel contact with North Korea recently resigned over Trump’s belligerent policies; and Trump’s top three foreign policy officials—Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and (still, for the moment) National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster—have little to no experience in Asia. He does, finally, have an assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, Randall Schriver, though his background is more in monitoring China and Taiwan. And Trump’s nominated a very capable assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, Susan Thornton, who is meanwhile serving as acting assistant secretary. (Another point in Thornton’s favor: Steve Bannon, when he was in the White House, declared war on Thornton, trying to oust her from the State Department; he failed.) Still, there are no medium-to-high-level officials who have had experience in negotiating with North Koreans, and this is a serious problem. Kim’s father and grandfather were maddening to deal with, but they had a negotiating style. American diplomats who cracked the code were able to hammer out an accord, if there was one to be had; those who didn’t know there was a code generally failed. The successful diplomats knew when to ease up and when to push back. For example, toward the end of the talks leading to the Agreed Framework, the 1994 agreement under which Kim Jong-il’s regime agreed to suspend its plutonium-weapons program, the North Koreans announced that a signing ceremony would take place the following day. The U.S. diplomats were puzzled; there were still five outstanding issues to resolve. The North Koreans dismissed the objection, saying the deal would incorporate their positions. These were minor issues, but the Americans walked away, said they were flying home. The North Koreans backtracked, and the issues were resolved, to mutual satisfaction. (This story and a discussion of the Kims’ diplomatic style comes from Scott Snyder’s excellent book, Negotiating on the Edge, which should be required reading for anyone who does join the U.S. delegation, if there is one.) Tillerson would probably head this delegation. He did, after all, pursue back-channel talks with North Koreans a few months ago, until Trump publicly undermined him. He should bring along Thornton and the handful of midlevel officials at State and the National Security Council who have at least studied the issues. He should also consult with the dozen or so former officials who have actually conducted negotiations with North Koreans, though he would probably have to keep such discussions private, as most of them are Democrats who worked for President Clinton or Obama and are, therefore, blacklisted from contact lists. (A few worked for George W. Bush, though, once they leaped to hold talks, after six years of resolute refusal to do so, the North Koreans took them to the cleaners.) This could be a genuine turning point. In any case, it’s a test—the first, really—of what Trump can accomplish on the world stage when faced with an opportunity that is, perhaps in part, of his own making.","Peace is not at hand with North Korea, but talks are, and President Donald Trump needs to get ready for them if he doesn’t want to foment a diplomatic disaster.",2018-03-06T20:15:18Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Let’s Talk About Nukes,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/trump-now-has-an-opportunity-for-a-diplomatic-breakthrough-with-north-korea-if-he-doesnt-blow-it.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/829e17f3-c861-4565-9c75-74a3d7e39e68.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=2199x1466&offset=1x0,,Slate.com,1

 Of the 270 containers that fell off the MSC Zoe well over 200 were still unaccounted for on Thursday
Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm.
As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers.
The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west.
Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches.
But officials said three missing containers carried a toxic powder of organic peroxide, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them.
What happened to the MSC Zoe?
The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. 
As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship and into the Wadden Sea. 
Image copyrightDutch coastguardImage caption
 An aerial view of the ship showed the disarray on board the MSC Zoe
By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and coastguards were scouring the sea for the others.
There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-based MSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment to help retrieve the missing containers.
Overnight into Thursday, the MSC Zoe docked at Bremerhaven. Several containers were spotted in German waters and a further 11 were seen by the Dutch coastguard floating between the islands of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog.
How bad is the pollution?
By Thursday five Dutch islands in the Wadden Sea had seen debris from the MSC Zoe wash up on its beaches. 
On Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog volunteers were helping on Thursday to clear up the mess spilt the previous day.
Among the rubbish found on Terschelling's long, sandy beaches were shoes, bags, cushions, chairs and plastic cups. Children found pink toys among the rubbish.
Volunteers had to scoop polystyrene packaging from the dunes.
Further to the east, on Schiermonnikoog, a trail of plastic rubbish, shoes and light bulbs was found on the beaches. ""This is truly a disaster. How are we going to clean this up?"" said local environmentalist Cynthia Borras. ""We were prepared for an oil disaster but not this.""
Terschelling mayor Bert Wassink feared the clean-up could take a long time. 
""We've never seen this before. It's becoming more common to see containers falling in the water but never before on this scale,"" he told public broadcaster NOS.
When the MSC Napoli ran aground off the south-west coast of England in 2007, 80 containers washed ashore. Police had to shut a local beach as people scoured the debris for motorbikes and other merchandise.
Police had to use old laws on scavenging that require people to return goods from the stricken ship.
Although some flat screen TVs were found in the debris on Wednesday, most concerns on the Dutch islands focused on the environmental damage to the area.",A big clean-up starts on five Dutch islands after a storm sweeps cargo into the sea.,2019-01-03T12:31:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",MSC Zoe: Islands hit as 270 containers fall off ship,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46746312,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B972/production/_105047474_051413288-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,1
Tom McKay,"Authorities evacuated tens of thousands of people from 224 points on the Indonesian island of Bali this weekend after the eruption of Mount Agung, which spewed gigantic clouds of potentially life-threatening ash into the atmosphere, CNN reported. Up to 7,000 air passengers are stranded on the island at the main Bali airport of Ngurah Rai, while Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised its aviation alert status from orange to its highest possible red status, signifying extreme hazards to aircraft. According to CNN, the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency estimates the cloud was at least 4,000 meters (13,120 feet) tall, though the Australian Bureau of Meteorology later estimated a height of 7,600 meters (2,9430 feet). According to the BBC, increased volcanic activity this year sparked fears of an imminent full-scale eruption involving magma flows, costing “at least $110m in tourism and productivity during the major evacuation.” Per NPR, volcanologist Gede Suantika told Reuters “The activity of Mount Agung has entered the magmatic eruption phase, it is still spewing ash at the moment, but we need to monitor and be cautious over the possibility of a strong, explosive eruption.” The New York Times estimated about 75,000 people have been evacuated so far in total, while residents and visitors have been instructed to stay at least four miles away from the volcano. Government officials are insistent that the island remains safe for now outside of the area immediately surrounding Mount Agung. The last recorded eruption of Mount Agung in 1963 happened to coincide with a Balinese Hindu ritual performed once every hundred years, according to Oregon State University. When the volcano began to erupt just days after the ritual, an estimated 50 million cubic meters of magma flowed from the peak. Pressure continued build until weeks later, when a massive explosion occurred: The sub-plinian eruption was so strong, it was estimated that the top 100 m had been blown off, creating an eruption column almost 10 km high, which collapsed to form devastating pyroclastic flows. These pyroclastic flows travelled east and south at over 60 km/hr, wiping out several villages and causing the death of over 1000 people. Many Balinese believed the eruption, and particularly the survival of the temple where the ritual was performed, was a bad omen. However, according to Phys.org, while scientists believe Mount Agung will continue to smoke for up to a month or more, a similar eruption is not considered particularly likely now.

"Reviewed, Seamus Bellamy, Reviewed","The Emergency Zone Urban Bug Bag is the best emergency preparedness kit we tested.
Supplies found inside the Emergency Zone Bug Out Bag.
How We Tested
The Tester
My names Seamus Bellamy. Before I moved into my career as a journalist, I spent years working as an industrial first-aid practitioner, writing and enforcing workplace safety policy and helping corporations plan for emergencies that, thankfully, never came to pass. Ive used this knowledge to write about travel and roadside safety for Reviewed. Now, Im here to help you keep yourself and your family safe at home.
The Tests
Before we could research or test anything, we made a decision to focus on emergency kits designed for when you need to leave home. This is because, in many emergency situations, where staying at home is an option, you can still rely upon the goods in your freezer, fridge, and pantry. The supplies in a portable emergency kit can be used at home, as well as at times when youre forced to evacuate. There are kits out there that are designed for groups of four people or more, often packed into duffel bags or wheeled containers. They look like they could be a smart buy for someone trying to protect all of the people in their home, but we dont like them. These kits can be heavy and awkward to haul around. If leaving home means having to traverse uneven terrain, flood waters, heavy snow or mud, you could be forced to leave an awkward, family-sized kit behind. With each person carrying their own supplies, the going will be easier. With this in mind, we decided that a backpack-sized kit was the way to go.
Next, we turned our attention to what should be inside of each bag. For hydration and nutrition, we looked to the guidelines suggested by FEMA and other government agencies for what a healthy individual, between the ages of 36 and 40 years old, who are engaging in vigorous activity, requires to stay relatively healthy over a three-day period. This age group requires a lot of calories (2,600 for men and 2000 women, per day) compared to individuals at other stages of their life. Keep folks from this group from losing weight over 72 hours and you can do the same for most everyone else as well. For this purpose, shelf-stable, calorie-rich food and pre-packaged drinking water with expiry dates that span years into the future, are best. When someone is cold, sick or injured, they tend to burn through calories faster and need more liquids in order to stay hydrated. As such, we made sure to hunt down kits that contained mylar blankets or sleeping bags and the materials that one might need to hang a shelter and keep warm in bad weather or if theyre under the weather if theyre forced to spend a night out in the elements. Because some emergencies, such as an earthquake where ruptured gas lines could pose a hazard, make lighting a fire a bad idea, we noted when the materials to start a fire were included in a kit, but gave extra appreciation to go-bags that came packing extras like chemical hand warmers and warm gloves.
During an emergency, you can expect that the first responders may not be able help us when were injuredthe number of calls for assistance they receive could be overwhelming. Infrastructure, such as highways and public transit may make driving to the a hospital temporarily impossible. Calling 911? That might be out of the question as well if cellphone and landline services fail. So ensuring these kits included a first-aid kit was a must. We also put a priority on finding kits that ship with an AM/FM radio that, ideally, can tune in broadcasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to stay on top of breaking news. We looked for kits that provide important extras related to hygiene, like hand sanitizer, sunscreen, wet wipes, toilet paper or tissues, a toothbrush, toothpaste and feminine hygiene products. Finally, we wanted to ensure that the kits we called in came with important extras, such as N95 filtration masks, work gloves for cleaning debris, knives, and tools for the thousand things you might require them for and other thoughtful add-ons that could make a harrowing experience a little bit easier to deal with.
All of this, of course, needs to fit into a backpack. Its our belief that, since youll very likely be using this kit in adverse conditions, the backpack that comes with a portable emergency preparedness kit should be rugged and, if not waterproof, highly water-resistant. We looked for bags that appeared to fit this description that we thought would still have additional space left over to pack extras, such as prescription medication or a change of clothing or even a reliable hatchet for gathering fire-making materials and clearing debris. into. Additionally, we gave bonus points to packs that dont advertise that theyre full of supplies which, during an emergency, could be in short supply.
Once we had the kits on hand, we tested each to see how comfortable the backpacks were to wear, whether they were durable and easy to organize. We tried samples of each of the emergency food rations inside to see if they were at all palatableall were. None will knock you off of your feetand whether there was enough food and water to suffice for three days. All other supplies, and lack thereof, were scrutinized for quality and usability.
Not all pre-packed emergency kits include all the essentials. Consider supplementing these packs with additional gear.
What You Should Know About 72-Hour Survival Kits
Because some emergencies may require you leave your home in order to remain safe, owning a pre-packed cache of supplies, sometimes called a go bag, that can easily be transported on foot could mean the difference between being comfortable or miserable in an emergency. 
Where should I keep my go-bag?
Before investing, consider where you might need one and where youll have the space to store it. You might want to keep one in the trunk of your car if you drive to work, every day. If you commute on public transit, keeping one under your desk and having another at home could be a good solution. For remote workers, like me, having a single bag that you can grab at home and hit the road with when things get hairy is the way to go.
Who should own an emergency preparedness kit?
Everyone. Unfortunately, during a major emergency, such as an earthquake, the aftermath of a tornado or civil unrest, first responders, utility personnel and other essential services workers cant be everywhere at once. By ensuring that everyone in your household has their own emergency bag, in addition to the preparations that youve made at home, you and yours will be better prepared to take care of one another when no one else can.
These kits are designed for one person, what about the rest of my family?
We recommend purchasing a kit for each member of your family capable of carrying their own supplies. For those with young children or other individuals in their care that might have difficulty carrying their own kits, adding the food and water and extras required to see them through three days is a great way to maintain mobility. When you run out of room in your kit bag, consider investing in a larger, backpack. Allowing kids to carry some of their own supplies in a pack that's sized for them is also a fine way to share the burden.
Where there are multiple bags in play for your family group, develop a plan to ensure that everyone is carrying what they need before leaving your home in an emergency.
I bought the survival kit you recommend, is there anything else I need?
None of the kits we found online are perfect. In fact, we uncovered many deficiencies among the very best survial kits. To help shore up whats missing from your 72-hour survival kit, augment it with some useful extras or build your own survival kit instead. If you feel that a larger backpack to carry all of your supplies is in order, dont worry, we have your back there as well.
On top of all of this, you should consider including these personal items:
Prescription medications
Non-prescription medications you use on a regular basis
A complete change of clothing, appropriate to your environment
Printed or electronic copies of important documents, such as copies of your government ID, bank account records and insurance policies
A list of contact information for friends and loved ones
Feminine hygiene supplies, if required
Prescription glasses, contact lenses, and lens solution, if required
A minimum of $20 to $100 in small bills (if theres no power, there are no ATMs or credit card readers) to make emergency purchases 
If youve taken responsibility for someone thats unable to pack and carry their own supplies, youll also need food, water, and other basic supplies that theyll need. Babies need baby food. The infirm require medication and, in some cases, additional batteries to run medical devices. 
We also strongly recommend taking the most comprehensive first aid course that you have the time and money to afford. Additionally, if the city or county you live in offers emergency management training courses, take the time to enroll in one and learn what you can. The more knowledge you have, the better youll be prepared when things go wrong. 
The best emergency preparedness bags are water resistant and don't call extra attention to themselves. Among the bags we tested, only a few passed the test.
Other Emergency Go-Bags We Tested
Almost all the kits we tested for this guide suffer from similar deficiencies: For example, they dont include enough water, and often add unhelpful tools. The following reviews only draw attention to the most glaring issues discovered in each.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice and John Bacon, USA TODAY","Officials say recent flooding in parts of Nebraska has caused nearly $1.4 billion in estimated losses and damage. (March 20)
 AP, AP
Flooding that has overwhelmed levees and swamped a wide swath of the Midwest since last week's bomb cyclone storm is creating a ""slow-moving natural disaster"" with damages that total at least $3 billion.
Friday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said the damage cost in her state is an estimated $1.6 billion, so far. Earlier this week, Nebraska's damage total was reported to be over $1.4 billion.
Damage costs from other flooded states, such as Missouri, Kansas, South Dakota, Minnesota and Illinois, have yet to be tabulated. 
At least 3 people have been killed due to the flooding. 
On Thursday, Iowa Gov. Reynolds sent a request to President Donald Trump seeking an expedited Presidential major disaster declaration for 57 counties severely impacted by floods along the Missouri River and across the state. Across the state, water has inundated homes and businesses, destroyed crops, and forced evacuations.
Nebraska's cleanup is also a mammoth task. Damage to roads, levees and other structures in the state has reached almost $450 million. Crop losses were at $440 million and cattle losses totaled $400 million.
""I don't think there's ever been a disaster this widespread in Nebraska,"" he said.

While rivers are receding for now across parts of Nebraska, Wisconsin and Iowa, water draining downstream is causing the Missouri River to rise across northeastern Kansas and Missouri, AccuWeather said. The river's water levels are forecast to challenge the crest record of 31.63 feet at Atchison, Kansas, by the weekend.
As of late Friday, at least 100 river gauges in the central U.S. were listed at ""major"" or ""moderate"" flood stage, the National Weather Service said. 
Then there is the Mississippi River to contend with. The river is forecast to reach major flood stage in St. Paul, Minnesota, by the end of March, AccuWeather says.
""It is possible that many parts of the Mississippi River will remain above flood stage ... into the first part of the summer in the slow-moving natural disaster,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.

The bomb cyclone hammered more than a dozen states with heavy snow and/or rain along with high winds. Much of the region was already saturated or the ground frozen, meaning the water could not be absorbed. The result: More than a dozen states have dealt with flooding, flood watches and flood warnings.
In Minnesota, 35 of the state's 87 counties are already battling flooding or ice jams, city emergency management officials said.
Last SlideNext Slide
""Significant winter snowpack, deep frost, increased soil moisture, late thaw, recent precipitation and above normal streamflows are all contributing to a higher risk of flooding throughout Minnesota,"" the agency warned.
More: The waters are rising, the floods are coming. What can we do?
While Missouri River levels are on a downward trend, they will start to rise again when snow in South Dakota begins to melt, warned David Pearson, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Omaha, Nebraska.  He expects to see that secondary rise of an additional 1 to 2 feet by April 1.
I think we should be vigilant to that for the next month, possibly more,"" he said.
In Wisconsin, rivers have been receding since early in the week. But the National Weather Service warned that the reprieve may not last long.
""There is still 10-25 inches of snow across northern WI,"" the officer tweeted. ""This will continue to melt over the next several days, and could cause rivers to start rising as it does.""
In Missouri, the town of Craig, 100 miles north of Kansas City, was underwater. A mandatory evacuation was ordered for the  250 residents.
""Darkness has settled over town, and all you can hear is the sound of rushing water and the damn railroad signals going off,"" the town tweeted. ""@BNSFRailway no trains coming but plenty of water on the tracks. Sleep tight River Rats tomorrow is a new day.""

Neksa Mumbi Moody/AP,"NEW YORK — Mariah Carey is determined to have a better New Year’s Eve than in 2016 — she is returning to “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest” after last year’s debacle. The Grammy-winning singer’s live performance in Times Square on New Year’s Eve 2016 was marked by problems. She was visibly upset and at points stopped singing, despite a pre-recorded track playing in the background. The performance went viral for all the wrong reasons. Afterward, Carey posted a meme of herself on social media with the message “(expletive happens).” But it also led to a public spat between the best-selling singer and Dick Clark Productions as to who was at fault, with Carey’s camp charging sabotage with technical glitches, including faulty ear piece, and dick clark productions denying the claims and charging she hadn’t rehearsed enough. Now, both sides have kissed and made up. “We can all agree that last year didn’t go exactly as planned and we are thrilled to move forward together to provide America with an incredible night of music and celebration on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2018,” a joint statement released to The Associated Press said. “See you in Times Square!” Other performers already announced for the live Times Square performances include Camila Cabello, Nick Jonas and Sugarland.

"Gwen Ihnat on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","In Pie Curious, The Takeout solicits the help of pastry chefs to teach all-thumbs baker Gwen Ihnat how to master the mighty pie. As I’ve mentioned, I am an aspirational baker, but not a very successful one in practice. Anything more complicated than the Toll House recipe on the back of the chocolate-chip package is bound to throw me for an absolute loop. One of the many baking hurdles I’ve never been able to clear: a basic pie crust. Whenever I try, I usually wind up piecing the whole thing together in the pan, rather than laying the crust over the pie plate an in an impressive flourish. There seem to be so many different variables—Temperature! Ice water! Butter! Lard! Food processors! Mixing by hand!—that I was at a loss as to discern the best possible method. Continuing my 2018 theme of self-improvement, I was able to arrange private tutoring sessions with some of Chicago’s finest pastry chefs. These people kindly and warmly welcomed me, a baking dunce, into their professional kitchens in the hopes of teaching me how to make a pie crust I could proud of. First up: Ashley Danello of El Che Bar. The Massachusetts native moved to Chicago a few years ago, working under pastry chef Mindy Segal at Chicago’s beloved Mindy’s Hot Chocolate. At El Che, she draws on her love of South American desserts to creating an after-dinner menu of amazing puddings, pies, dough pastries, and frozen confections using El Che’s live-fire hearth. The first thing you notice about Ashley is the giant rolling pin atop her kitchen worktable. It’s a gift from her grandmother, who used it to make ravioli, ultimately inspiring Ashley to her pastry career. For our lesson, Ashley had prepped like a Martha Stewart morning show, pulling out pre-chilled butter and pre-formed dough at various steps along the way. Best of all, she was unfailingly patient with her lummox student: Too bad somebody had to be first, Ashley. You deserved better. The important thing to remember here is that Rome wasn’t built in a day. In fact, it took several thousand years. Hopefully my pie timetable will be quicker than that, but my head was spinning as Ashley rattled off the various intricacies related to pie crust. With all that attention to temperature, to say nothing of civil engineering, it’s no wonder that my previous pie efforts wound up with my sad dough scrapbooking in the pan. There was a lot of talk about the horror of gluten development, which sounded like it should just send your pie straight into the bin. Ashley started out with a pound of 83-percent fat butter, carefully cut into equal 1/2-inch cubes. She suggested chilling it for about an hour. “Temperature is super important,” she stressed. If that horror of gluten development happens, it results in a “tight and dense dough” that’s “too tough.” This can also happen if you overwork the dough. That’s me, I totally tend to overwork things. We talked about the advantages of unpasteurized milk and vanilla straight from the bean (which she also scraped into the crust) as Ashley broke down all those cubes of butter into the flour and sugar, using her thumb and index finger. Eventually, the mixture became more granulated, like a very thick sand, with various “pistachio-sized” pieces of butter. Ashley then made a well in the pastry sand dune, adding the eggs and milk to the center, and kneading and pushing with her hands until the dough was formed. She favored a nice rectangular shape to enable an easy rollout. She used wax paper instead of flour, to help prevent too much flour making the pie crust tough—a brilliant move, I thought. She definitely had that pie crust flourish down that I so envy, carefully laying the crust into the pan and adding some lovely fluted accents around the rim (spoiler: this is where I should have paid more attention). She then gave me an extra pound of dough to take home, and sent me on my way, my head spinning with new phrases like “marbled butter” and “gluten development.” My homework was to make my own pie, which I decided would be pumpkin: the easiest filling imaginable (basically a can of milk, a can of pumpkin), since I would be focusing all my attention on the crust. Like Ashley, I cubed and chilled my butter, and integrated it into the flour/sugar/salt/mixture. Somehow my fingers’ muscle memory remembered the technique she showed me, and I got that same beachy texture. Not gonna lie, I was pretty excited. I then made the sand well and kneaded in the milk and eggs, and scraped my first vanilla bean. I was so anxious to get that nice vanilla marbling that I was afraid I was overworking it. But like Ashley described, the dough had a nice play-dough feel when I was done with it. Where my pie fell apart was in the aesthetics. Ashley chills her pie dough in a nice, compact rectangular shape, which makes it easier for her to roll out. I attempted her perfect form, but it was late at night, and my pack was kind of lumpy. The next morning when I tried to roll it out, I realized why that was so very terrible. Instead of a recognizable shape rolling out, my crust dough resembled a state that hadn’t been annexed to the union yet. After all that effort, I feared that I would once again be piecing my pie crust into the pan like an asshole. But fortunately for me, this recipe was for a double-crust, so I had enough pie carpet to lay into the pan. It didn’t have Ashley’s elegance, though, and I worried that it was too thick/tough. This next part reads like a chapter out of Bridget Jones’s Diary ; this is how things like blue soup get invented. My pie filling as I’d hoped, was pretty simple—just egg, pumpkin, milk, and spices—but I was unfortunately out of ginger. I poured the filling in anyway, and made the absolute rookie error of cutting the crust too close to the edge. I crimped the sides with a fork (I didn’t have enough room for Ashley’s pretty detailing), to no avail. I put the pie in the oven. As I cleaned up the kitchen, I found a hunk of ginger root staring me right in the face. I foolishly decided to shave the ginger over the top of the pie. This is why I’m a better cooker than a baker; I can’t stop tweaking. Tweaking in baking usually leads to disaster. Sure enough, a clump of ginger landed on the top of the pie and I scooped it out. This left an unsightly hole in the top of the pie. I had plenty of pie crust left over, so I dug out some cookie cutters and crated some crust cut-outs on top of the pie. I then also made some crust cookies, the better for Ashley to taste and my kids to eat for breakfast. So, actually, the ginger disaster ended up enhancing the pie a little bit. Good thing, too, because my lack of outside crust caused the edges to nearly slip underneath the pumpkin filling completely. The part that remained got a bit singed. I was pretty disappointed. My son tried to cheer me up: “I like a lot of filling. It’s like you created a whole new kind of pie!” My daughter methodically began whipping whatever heavy cream we had left in the fridge as a topping, the better to augment my pie abomination. I set out for my return to Ashley’s kitchen, even though I was a bit embarrassed about my presentation. Unsurprisingly, she was super-nice about it. I gave her a few crust cookies first. She said my crust “falls apart nicely,” with “a good crumb” and “nice layering.” Since my structure was solid, the crust had a “good chew, not tough… nice in-between.” We dove into the pie proper for breakfast. Somehow I had “creased” the crust properly into the pie plate, so that we had no dreaded “soggy bottom” like those Great British Baking Show types are always talking about. In fact, she noted that the crust was golden brown all the way around. Except on the top: She suggested that in addition to not cutting the pie crust edges off too closely, I could have added foil around the edge to keep it from browning too much. But as with many (most) of the things I prepare, the pie tasted better than it looked. I asked Ashley to grade me: She gave me a B+, which was definitely on a curve. Still, I’ll take it. This pie is leagues above any other pie crust I’ve ever made in my life. And I can hardly wait to apply all of these hard-earned lessons to pie number two next week. 1 lb. butter 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar 1/2 tsp. salt 4 egg yolks 7 Tbsp. whole milk 1 vanilla bean pod (remove if pie is savory) 2 tsp. lemon zest (remove if cream-based pie) Cube the butter into uniform 1/2-inch cubes. Chill for an hour. Combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the chilled butter and combine slowly, pinching the butter cubes between thumb and index finger, until the mixture resembles a sort of thick sand, with some pistachio-sized hunks of butter throughout. Make a well in the mixture and add the egg yolks, milk, and lemon zest. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod and add that as well. Then knead the dough together until the butter and vanilla is marbled throughout. It should have a consistency similar to play-dough. Form the dough into a rectangular shape and chill for a few hours. Then roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness and place in pie plate. Add whatever filling you like; back at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes, taking care to note that the crust doesn’t get too brown. Makes enough for one double-crust pie.

"Associated Press, Marcelo Silva De Sousa and Peter Prengaman, Associated Press","Aerial and ground footage shows the aftermath of the Dam collapse in Brazil that killed dozens of people.
 USA TODAY
BRUMADINHO, Brazil Firefighters are carefully moving over treacherous mud, sometimes walking, sometimes crawling, in search of survivors or bodies left by a dam collapse that buried mine buildings and surrounding neighborhoods with iron ore waste.
The confirmed death toll rose to 58, with up to 300 people still missing, authorities said. In an ominous sign, nobody was recovered alive Sunday, a stark difference from the first two days of the disaster, when helicopters were whisking people from the mud.
The slow speed of search efforts was due to the treacherous sea of reddish-brown mud that surged out when the mine dam breached Friday afternoon. It is up 24 feet (8 meters) deep in some places, and to avoid the danger of sinking and drowning searchers had to carefully walk around the edges or slowly crawl out onto the muck.
Even those efforts were suspended about 10 hours Sunday because of fears that a second mine dam in the southeastern city of Brumadinho was at risk of failing. An estimated 24,000 people were told to get to higher ground, but by afternoon civil engineers said the second dam was no longer at risk.
Areas of water-soaked mud appeared to be drying out, which could help firefighters get to areas previously unreachable. Still, it was slow going for the search teams, and residents were on edge.
Get out searching! a woman yelled at firefighters near a refuge set up in the center of Brumadinho. They could be out there in the bush.
Brazilian searchers got reinforcements late Sunday, when more than 100 Israeli soldiers and other personnel arrived with plans to join recovery efforts.
Throughout the weekend, there was mounting anger at the giant Vale mining company, which operated the mine, and questions rose about an apparent lack of an alarm system Friday.
Last SlideNext Slide
Caroline Steifeld said she heard warning sirens Sunday, but there was no alert when the dam collapsed Friday.
I only heard shouting, people saying to get out. I had to run with my family to get to higher ground, but there was no siren, she said, adding that a cousin was still unaccounted for.
In an email, Vale told The Associated Press that the area has eight sirens, but the speed in which the event happened made sounding an alarm impossible when the dam burst.
People in Brumadinho desperately awaited word on their loved ones. Romeu Zema, the governor of Minas Gerais state, said that by now most recovery efforts would entail pulling out bodies.
The flow of waste reached the nearby community of Vila Ferteco and an occupied Vale administrative office. It buried buildings to their rooftops and an extensive field of the mud cut off roads.
Some residents barely escaped with their lives.
I saw all the mud coming down the hill, snapping the trees as it descended. It was a tremendous noise, said a tearful Simone Pedrosa, from the neighborhood of Parque Cachoeira, 5 miles (8 kilometers) from where the dam collapsed.

For many, hope was evaporating.
I dont think he is alive, Joao Bosco said of his cousin Jorge Luis Ferreira, who worked for Vale. Right now, I can only hope for a miracle.
The carpet of mining waste also raised fears of widespread environmental contamination and degradation.
According to Vales website, the waste is composed mostly of sand and is non-toxic. However, a U.N. report found that the waste from a similar disaster in 2015 contained high levels of toxic heavy metals.
Over the weekend, courts froze about $3 billion from Vale assets for state emergency services and told the company to report on how they would help the victims.
Neither the company nor authorities had reported why the dam failed, but Attorney General Raquel Dodge promised to investigate. Someone is definitely at fault, she said.
Dodge noted there are 600 mines in Minas Gerais alone that are classified as being at risk of rupture.
Another dam administered by Vale and Australian mining company BHP Billiton collapsed in 2015 in the city of Mariana in Minas Gerais, resulting in 19 deaths and forcing hundreds from their homes.
Considered the worst environmental disaster in Brazilian history, that disaster left 250,000 people without drinking water and killed thousands of fish. An estimated 60 million cubic meters of waste flooded nearby rivers and eventually flowed into the Atlantic Ocean.
Sueli de Oliveira Costa, who hadnt heard from her husband since Friday, had harsh words for the mining company.
Vale destroyed Mariana and now theyve destroyed Brumadinho, she said.
Other residents quietly noted that Vale was the main employer in the area.
The company is responsible for a new tragedy, but its the principal employer, said Diego Aparecido, who has missing friends who worked at Vale. What will happen if it closes?
Environmental groups and activists said the latest spill underscored the lack of environmental regulation in Brazil, and many promised to fight any further deregulation.
Marina Silva, a former environmental minister and presidential candidate, toured the area Sunday. She said Congress should bear part of the blame for not toughening regulations and enforcement.
All the warnings have been given. We are repeating history with this tragedy, she told the AP. Brazil cant become a specialist in rescuing victims and consoling widows. Measures need to be taken to avoid prevent this from happening again.
Associated Press writer Marcelo Silva de Sousa reported this story in Brumadinho and AP writer Peter Prengaman reported from Arraial do Cabo, Brazil. AP photographer Leo Correa in Brumadinho contributed to this report.

You grab your keys, smartphone and wallet when you leave the house. Would it be such a disaster if you left that last one behind?
In the not too distant future, it may not be. Your physical wallet is on borrowed time. 
Your phone, after all, increasingly provides the utility in digital form for the many reasons you schlep a Costanza-sized billfold in the first place, from showing off pictures to making mobile payments.
Think about it. At the airport, you hand your iPhone or Android handset, rather than a paper document, to the TSA agent who inspects and scans your boarding pass. 
You scan your phone entering ballparks, movie theaters and concert halls, too.
Most states will accept an electronic copy of your automobile's insurance ID card during a traffic stop.
Students at Duke, University of Alabama, University of Oklahoma, Temple, Johns Hopkins and Santa Clara can or will soon be able to use the Wallet app inside iPhones as contactless student IDs. Other colleges are presumably to follow.

It may not be long before you can use your phone as your corporate ID as well, something Apple employees already do at the companys Apple Park headquarters.
And yes, more and more of you are letting your smartphone sub for cash, debit and credit cards, through the likes of Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Cash App, Venmo, PayPal and other payment services. 
Were nearing the point where that pendulum is shifting to the preference for digital forms of payment (and) identity, says Tiffany Conway, director of field marketing for government programs at Gemalto, a global digital security company that produces digital driver's licenses.
Concerns about security
For sure, the demise of the physical wallet is not imminent. Consumer habits are tough to crack, and the use of some version of a ""wallet"" to cart money and other possessions dates at least as far back as ancient Greece. 
For all the talk of a cashless society, paper currency isn't going away anytime soon.
Still, 68 percent of 1,218 smartphone owners surveyed by SurveyMonkey Audience on USA TODAYs behalf last month, say it is likely that smartphones will eventually replace the need for wallets entirely. Nearly half (45 percent) think wallets will be obsolete in five years or less. 
Such an eventually remains a ways off for Seth Buchwalter, a PR manager at Sparkloft Media in Portland, Ore. Buchwalter uses Venmo and Apple Pay on his iPhone, but he also epitomizes the consumer who remains reluctant to send the wallet out to pasture.
People are very accustomed to losing or breaking their phone or running out of battery, he says. Having that backup plan with cash or cards in their wallet is kind of a safety net?
Concerns about security are one key reason people dont feel comfortable ditching their wallets. Fifty-eight percent of SurveyMonkey respondents want to make sure they have better phone security before they stop using their physical wallet altogether.
Mobile payments: Target stores to accept mobile payment including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay
Cash free stadium: No cash accepted for tickets, concessions at Atlanta stadium
Unlock car doors: You won't need a car key anymore with Hyundai's new 'digital key' technology
Smartphones have one big advantage convenience and one big weakness security and consumers clearly see a tradeoff between the two, says Laura Wronski, the senior research scientist at SurveyMonkey who conducted the survey.
Of course, the concern about security may be an unfounded matter of perception. 
If I hand you my phone, and you hand me your physical credit card, who is going to have better luck running up some charges? says Elias Guerra, CEO of Popwallet, a B2B mobile wallet company in New York. Youre not going to unlock my phone and go make payments with it. But if I have physical possession of your credit card, until you actually call and cancel that, Im running rampant.
Driver's licenses and transit cards
Theres other resistance to retiring the wallet. Forty-three percent of the smartphone owners in the SurveyMonkey survey want to see longer battery life before they stop using their physical wallet altogether.
Just under half said they wanted the ability to store their passports, drivers license or other forms of ID on the phone. These might include digital versions of hunting and fishing licenses or other credentials issued by the state.
The early stages of making this happen are underway, though challenges remain. IDEMIA began testing a Mobile Driver's License (mDL) with the state of Iowa in 2015. A test with Delaware came later and another will soon start up in Oklahoma.
Also in 2016, Gemalto received a two-year grant from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to pilot smartphone-based digital drivers licenses in Colorado, Idaho, Maryland, Wyoming, and Washington, D.C.

With IDs in particular, long gone are the days where a physical drivers license was truly just a physical drivers license, Conway says. The physical license is just a format of that digital record that already exists today. But now you are able to access it through the convenience of your smartphone or potentially in the future a smartwatch or smart piece of jewelry.
Gemaltos digital drivers license, or DDL, was issued by the department of motor vehicles in the pilot states. Among the benefits is the fact that DDLs can more easily and quickly be updated with address changes. If the phone is lost or stolen, the license can be wiped remotely before a new digital version is issued. Gemalto says such credentials are more resistant to fraud and hacking.
Whats more, consumers with a DDL can choose to share only the personalized ID data needed for the situation at hand, whether presenting credentials to a police officer, at an airport checkpoint, or even to prove you are of drinking age; the bartender would only be able to see your picture with an indication that you are over 21 or under 18 
IDEMIA's mobile license aims to protect privacy in a similar manner.  ""When I go to show my (physical) driver's license today I'm basically disclosing my name, my address, my full date of birth, a lot of personally identifiable information that isn't needed to enable that transaction,"" says Matt Thompson, a senior vice president for identity solutions at IDEMIA. ""A mobile driver's license only discloses the information that's necessary for the transaction you're trying to conduct.""
Another privacy precaution: The DMV that issues the digital license cannot track you as you drive around.
Moreover, if you are pulled over by law enforcement on the highway, youll remain in possession of the phone since the officer can access your credentials wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy.
Of course, since motorists drive from one state to another, any digital license that is issued must ultimately be interoperable elsewhere. The technical specifications are still being hammered out.
Transit cards present another opportunity for the digital wallet, but it is slow going so far, especially in the U.S. For now, you can use Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay on your phone to ride buses and trains in Chicago and Portland, Ore. 
In May, New Yorks MTA system will start phasing in a system that will accept mobile wallets on buses and subway turnstiles, even as the MTA is committed to keeping the current MetroCard system in place until 2023.
But last spring, the UTA system in Utah pulled support for Apple Pay, Google Pay, as well as contactless credit cards, over extremely low usage, and the millions of dollars it would cost to upgrade the system to accept such payments.
UTA will no longer accept Apple Pay, Google Pay or contactless credit cards starting 4/8/18. For payment alternatives, consider a FAREPAY card (you'll receive 40 percent off bus/20 percent off rail fare) or downloading the UTA GoRide mobile payment app. https://t.co/a0DxX1gfWppic.twitter.com/sJPnryT9nQ

For all its versatility as a potential full-time replacement for the physical wallet, your phone in some cases can also unlock your front door and car door. Maybe theres no reason to panic if you leave your keys behind, too.

"FactCheck.org, Robert Farley, FactCheck.org","President Donald Trump claims that Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane and that it received more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before. Neither of those statements is true.
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as of the end of last year, Puerto Rico had actually received about $11.2 billion in disaster relief payments since 2017.
In all, the federal government has allocated nearly $41 billion, and has obligated about half of it via binding agreements, but as we said, so far just a portion of that  $11.2 billion  has been distributed in Puerto Rico.
To get to the $91 billion figure, a senior administration official told us Trump is including the total allocation for Puerto Rico  $41 billion  plus an estimated $50 billion in future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster, which can stretch decades.
It is accurate to say that $41 billion has been allocated and there will likely be billions more, Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us via email. But to just add up actual appropriations (most of which has not actually [been] obligated, much less cash on the ground) to some future cost estimates seems inaccurate to me.

The president is also wrong to say Puerto Rico got more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before. The federal government spent more on Hurricane Katrina aid.
Trumps claim  which he made via a tweet  came as Republicans and Democrats butt heads on disaster aid proposals, with Democrats seeking more aid for Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA....

....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019
Trump has used this $91 billion figure before. He cited it in a meeting with Republican senators on March 26, and again on March 28, telling reporters, Ive taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever. We have $91 billion going to Puerto Rico. We have $29 billion to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricanes.
We asked the White House how Trump arrived at the $91 billion figure, and a senior administration official broke it down to us like this: $14 billion in FEMA allocations to date, plus $26 billion in non-FEMA allocations  for a total of $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico disaster relief.
For more details, the official pointed us to FEMAs Spending Explorer website, which allows users to track disaster aid by state appropriated in 2017 and 2018. It tracks spending in three categories: allocated (which means Congress has appropriated the funds), obligated (which means the government has entered a binding agreement to award funding), and outlayed (which means the money has actually been paid).
As we said, the FEMA calculator shows only $11.2 billion of the $41 billion allocated for Puerto Rico disaster relief has been paid so far. (We should note that not all disaster relief going to Puerto Rico is directly tied to Hurricane Maria. The appropriations also include relief from Hurricane Irma, which was much less severe for Puerto Rico, but which also caused some damage.)
But to get to $91 billion, the senior administration official told us, the president is also adding $50 billion, the estimated future FEMA costs over the life of the disaster. The official referred us to a report from the Washington Post Fact Checker that said the $50 billion was an internal Office of Management and Budget estimate of the potential liabilities over the life of the disaster that would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, which governs federal disaster response in the U.S. The Post added that the estimate was described as a high-end estimate subject to change year by year.
Stafford Act claims can be paid out for decades, and future claims are very difficult to quantify, a House Appropriations Committee spokesperson told us.
Post-disaster federal funding comes from two main sources, the Disaster Relief Fund and supplemental appropriations, according to Ellis. By the end of 2019, FEMA estimates that a little less than $21 billion will have gone to Puerto Rico from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of Maria (with another $3.6 billion going to the Virgin Islands).
By comparison, FEMA to date has spent more than $50 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, including $32.6 billion to Louisiana. Ellis notes that nearly $200 million in Katrina-related disaster aid will come from the relief fund this year, which gives you an idea of how long these funds trickle in.
The appropriated funds are harder to track, Ellis said. In addition to Katrina, there were two other major storms in the U.S. in 2005, Rita and Wilma. And in addition to Maria, Hurricane Irma made landfall the same year in 2017. The funds for multiple storms can go into the same accounts, making it hard to track aid for particular storms.
The Congressional Research Service estimates that, in all, Congress provided roughly $120 billion for Hurricane Katrina. So even if the presidents long-term cost estimate for Puerto Rico pans out, it would still be less than what was spent by the federal government on Katrina.
Comparing money allocated after storms also needs to account for the severity of the storms, and how much damage they cause.
Although the federal spending for disaster relief in Florida and Texas has been lower, as the president noted, those storms also caused less damage than Maria did in Puerto Rico.
According to a study published in the journal BMJ Global Health on Jan. 18, the federal government responded on a larger scale and much more quickly across measures of federal money and staffing to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida, compared with Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The variation in the responses was not commensurate with storm severity and need after landfall in the case of Puerto Rico compared with Texas and Florida.

Merrit Kennedy,"Rescue workers watch as a heavy machine dig through rubble searching for earthquake victims on Thursday in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Dita Alangkara/AP Indonesia is winding down its search and rescue operations, with thousands of people believed to be still missing after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck last month on the island of Sulawesi. The official death toll for the disasters stands at 2,073. But the national disaster agency says that the number of those still missing could be as high as 5,000, after the strength of the quake caused the ground to liquefy and swallow up buildings and people. Search efforts had been set to end Thursday, but were extended to Friday. ""Because of the demands of the residents to lengthen the search for victims, we have extended the search and evacuation process for one day,"" said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, according to The Associated Press. There are prayers set to take place in hard-hit areas, the wire service added, as search efforts continue. The rescue efforts are winding down due to fears about the spread of disease, Reuters reported. ""Heavy equipment hasn't been able to operate in neighborhoods where the earth turned to mud, hampering the search effort, and many bodies have decomposed beyond recognition due to the tropical heat,"" AP reported. The death toll has steadily risen since the double disaster hit on Sept. 28. NPR's Julie McCarthy recently visited the neighborhood of Petobo, where "" the ground has a wobbly consistency not quite jello that is anything but solid,"" and ""in the air, is the pungent scent of dead bodies."" There, she says, major portions of the area have been destroyed. Homes were swept away by liquefaction as McCarthy describes, it's caused by ""soil mixing with water to create a quicksand effect."" In nearby Balaroa on Thursday, relatives of the missing stood waiting for news as rescue crews searched through debris. ""I don't have any tears left, all I want is to find them,"" 43-year-old Ahmad, a farmer, told Reuters. He said his wife and two daughters are missing. Rescue workers are trying to warn families that it's unlikely anyone will be found alive now. ""We hope the families understand that there's very little hope at this point,"" search volunteer Hadrianos Poliamar told Reuters. ""At the same time, if they ask us to help, if they're pointing 'please look here, my family is under here', of course, we can't say 'no', we have to dig. We want to help as many as we can."" Many of the missing are children. And the children that survived are likely to have trouble returning to normalcy according to Save the Children, more than 2,700 schools were ""severely damaged or destroyed in the disaster."" That's going to impact at least 180,000 kids, according to the aid organization. It's likely that many of the dead will never be found, and the true toll of the disasters will never be known. According to The Guardian, Indonesia's disaster agency is planning to clear some of the worst-hit areas and turn them into memorials and parks.","The official death toll for the disasters stands at 2,073.

Andrew Liszewski,"Stretch a Slinky toy too far, and eventually the metal coil will be warped so much it won’t be able to return to its original spring shape. That’s a problem also faced by the metal spring tires designed to roll across our Moon, and other planets our rovers are exploring. But NASA has created an alternative, made from titanium, that can tackle any terrain and always return to its original tire shape. Because puncturing an inflatable tire while driving around the surface of the Moon would have been a disaster, the Lunar Rover, delivered by Apollo 15, instead featured airless tires made of hollow metal springs. They absorb bumps like a rubber air-filled tire does, but over time, those metal springs get warped and deformed until they’re misshapen and don’t roll as efficiently. What’s happening is that over time, the bonds between the atomic structures that make up the materials in a metal spring tire are stretched to the point where they can’t return to their original arrangement, which is a problem when repair technicians are millions of miles away from a vehicle. The solution to the problem is a new type of metal spring tire made from a nickel titanium alloy whose atomic bonds are instead re-arranged as the tire deforms and stretches when rolling over uneven terrain. Known as “shape memory alloys” the metals are assembled in what looks like a tire made from chain mail whose structure can be compressed right to the hub and still spring back to its original shape afterwards. A routine check performed by NASA has uncovered two tears on the treads of the Mars Curiosity… Read more Read The advantage to using a tire like this here on Earth is immediately obvious, especially if you’ve ever had to change a flat tire on the side of the road in the cold of night. But having a tire that can last for years with minimal maintenance is even more important when sending rovers to the other planets in our Solar System. The tires used for the Curiosity Rover deteriorated faster than expected, and when you’re spending hundreds of millions of dollars to send an autonomous explorer to another world, the last thing you want to derail your experiment is a damaged tire.

Lory Gil,"I live about 95 miles from Paradise, CA, the town that literally burned to the ground within the past week. The Camp Fire, named for Camp Creek Road, where the fire started, is California's most destructive on record (currently burning 113,000 acres) and deadliest on record (at 29 and rising). Then, there are the Woolsey and Hills fires in Southern California, which have collectively destroyed more than 96,000 acres across L.A. and Ventura counties. If you check Cal Fire's fire tracking map, there are more than a dozen active fires across California right now. The devastation can be seen literally across the state. The skies 170 miles south of Paradise are blanketed in smoke and tinted orange. Everything reminds us of the terrible disaster that is still in full effect for our friends to the North. If you have some extra money, please consider sending it to local organizations across California to help aid victims of these fires. Local aid In northern California, the San Francisco Chronicle recommends sending monetary donations to the North Valley Community Foundation. If you live near Butte County (where Paradise is located), you can also drop of warm clothes, shoes and socks, and other necessities at the Hope Center in Oroville (1950 Kitrick Ave A). In Southern California, KTLA is recommending United Way's L.A. and Ventura chapter and the Entertainment Industry Foundation for local aid. Animal aid Fires, especially ones that ravage homes and send families away without warning, often leave pets lost and separated from their owners. Local animal shelters and foundations need lots of monetary help, as well as supplies like crates and bowls for the massive influx of new patients. In Northern California, the best place to start is the North Valley Animal Disaster Group for monetary donations. From there, you can also learn how to volunteer and where you can send much-needed supplies. In Southern California, you can donate to the Los Angeles County Animal Care Foundation and the Ventura County Humane Society. You can also visit the L.A. County Department of Animal Care to adopt a pet or drop off some of those needed supplies at their Castaic animal care center (31044 N. Charlie Canyon Road). National aid Of course, many national organizations are helping across the state with pop up shelters, emergency medical attention, and whatever they can provide. Your donations will help the victims of the California fires, as well as across the U.S. The American Red Cross is currently providing shelters for displaced families across California and are always on the scene of any disaster with as much help as they can give. The CCF Wildfire Relief Foundation works to help victims in the aftermath of a fire with finding new homes, getting their lives back together, and emotional support.

"Charlotte Edwards, Digital Science and Technology Reporter","Chernobyl could still be 'killing us' according to a new book which suggests the disaster may be responsible for the global rise in cancers and diseases.
MIT historian Kate Brown has been investigating the impact of radiation from the worst nuclear disaster in human history and thinks the real death toll has been covered up.
Brown alleges in her book that scientists and representatives of the United Nations, the Red Cross, and the World Health Organization hid evidence of hundreds of thousands of people who have died as a result of the 1986 nuclear explosion.
CLICK ON THE SUN FOR MORE
We have reached out to these institutions for comment and will update this story with any response.
At the time, it was widely agreed and underestimated by scientists that the accident would result in a total of 200 deaths over an 80 year time period.
Brown disputes this in her book when she writes: ""International scientists suppressed evidence of a cancer epidemic among children.""
According to Cancer Research UK, cancer rates and cancer risk overall are rising, but this is largely blamed on people living longer – as well as a move towards diets high in red and processed meats, increasing obesity in the west, and a culture of sunbathing and sunbeds.
This has led to the calculation that one in three people will get cancer recently being amended to ""one in two people"" being likely to develop the disease.
But Brown believes an increase in cancer rates may be linked to Chernobyl, and that governments and senior officials in the nuclear industry did not want to take responsibility or be investigated for other radiation incidents.
She also theorizes that academics who were not willing to cover up the facts were 'sidelined' because many influential scientists ""had much larger radioactive skeletons in the closet from nuclear bomb tests"".
She added: ""Minimising both the number of deaths so far and the on-going health consequences of the Chernobyl disaster provided cover for nuclear powers to dodge lawsuits and uncomfortable investigations in the 1990s.""
Brown has criticized a lot of senior figures, both past and present, for not admitting that nuclear radiation is really poisonous and therefore not providing adequate protection or support for people who may still be affected.
The book details how the threshold for the amount of radiation legally allowed in produce exported for consumption in the US is surprisingly high and could be dangerous.
It also vividly describes what the nuclear plant workers and local residents saw and experience when the explosion occurred.
One part reveals how workers who were told to clean up the nuclear waste were advised by Soviet doctors to drink vodka throughout the day because they claimed it would stimulate the liver and cleanse the body of radiation.
Brown conducted her research over four years and relied on 27 archives of information from Europe, the US and the former Soviet Union.
She estimates that the actual death toll could be as high as 150,000 for Ukraine alone over the past three decades.
The book ends with Brown calling for the impact of nuclear radiation on human health and the facts and figures surrounding Chernobyl to be reassessed.

Chaim Gartenberg,"Dongles are, as a general rule, terrible. Using them is bad, losing them is bad, from a design perspective they look bad — even the word “dongle” just sounds bad. But for the past few weeks, I’ve been trying out Elecjet’s AnyWatt dongle — and it might just be good. What is it? The AnyWatt was a Kickstarter from earlier this year, but it’s actually shipping now for anyone who missed the campaign. It’s a dongle, designed (like many dongles are) for users who have made the jump to a USB-C device but still want to use their old cables. But the Anywatt isn’t for USB cables — it converts older laptop chargers into a spare charger for your newer devices. The final version is a little more streamlined than the original, chunkier plastic one promised on the site and it comes in two models: one designed for Windows chargers (with an array of, you guessed it, more swappable dongles to make the various plugs match up) and one for Macs — specifically, one with Apple’s MagSafe adapter. The good The AnyWatt has a solid metal case that feels remarkably sturdy for a dongle. It also does what it says on the can, which is charge stuff, and none of my gadgets have burst into flames or exploded yet, so we’ll call that a win. None of my gadgets have burst into flames or exploded yet It outputs at a maximum of 60W, automatically adapts the voltage and current to offer the best charging experience, and it even supports USB-C PD. In theory, you plug in your MacBook charger and you get a USB-C charger that can charge basically anything. If you’re someone who’s made the jump to a newer MacBook Pro or other USB-C laptop and still have your old charger around, it’s a good way to get a spare on the cheap. Plus, if you’re someone who dislikes the fact that USB-C doesn’t automatically disconnect like MagSafe does, it’s also a hacky workaround to get that functionality back. But the AnyWatt is just as appealing for someone like me, who doesn’t have a USB-C laptop but does have a bunch of USB-C gadgets I want to be able to charge. Crucially, the AnyWatt let me continue to play Mario Odyssey when I was visiting home for Thanksgiving weekend and forgot my Switch charger, which is also pretty large and bulky. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The bad Remember that part where Apple doesn’t let people make licensed MagSafe charging things ? Well, this is an unlicensed MagSafe charging thing. Add into that concerns over bad USB-C chargers, and it’s entirely possible that using the AnyWatt is a recipe for the kind of disaster I usually spend a lot of time warning you all to avoid when I write about this stuff. Again, nothing bad has happened yet, but I can’t say that possibility hasn’t occurred to me. Should you buy it? Look, I really like the idea of the AnyWatt, especially when it comes to the MagSafe part of things. And at $23.99, it’s relatively cheap for the benefits it gives. But the lack of any official sign off does have me a little concerned, especially with the already significant potential of things going wrong with USB-C. But if you’re willing to take the gamble, it’s definitely the best dongle I’ve used all year, at least conceptually.","Dongles are, as a general rule, terrible.

James Rogers,"A storied gold cigarette case that once belonged to a controversial wealthy couple that survived the Titanic disaster is up for auction. The extremely rare artifact, which belonged to Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, comes “with a hint of scandal,” according to Hansons Auctioneers. The Duff-Gordons were accused of bribing their way off the doomed liner, although the allegation was never proven. Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912, and sank just over two hours later with the loss of more than 1,500 lives. TITANIC TREASURES SOLD AT UK AUCTION “This cigarette case in its own right is a wonderful object but its provenance sends its importance soaring to titanic heights,” said Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons Auctioneers, in a statement. “The sinking of the Titanic has fascinated the world for more than 100 years and such was the Duff-Gordons’ impact on events their roles are played in 1997 movie ‘Titanic’.” The gold cigarette case that once belonged to Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon (Hansons Auctioneers) A prominent landowner and highly accomplished fencer, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, his fashion designer wife, and her secretary, were among 12 people who escaped the sinking ship on Titanic’s Lifeboat Number 1. The lifeboat, which was dubbed the ""millionaires’ boat,"" by the British press, had a capacity of 40 people. In addition to the Duff-Gordons and Lady Duff-Gordon’s secretary, two other First Class passengers were aboard Lifeboat Number 1. The remaining seven people on the lifeboat were members of Titanic’s crew. “As the Titanic sank, it was claimed Lucy Duff-Gordon said to her secretary, ‘There is your beautiful nightdress gone’,” Hanson said. “A fireman, allegedly annoyed by her comment, replied that while the couple could replace their property, he and the other crew members had lost everything. Sir Cosmo then offered each of the men £5 (equivalent to £454 [$579]) to aid them.” DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC? The wealthy landowner kept his promise when they reached the rescue ship RMS Carpathia, according to Encyclopedia Titanica. “In the aftermath of the tragedy, the couple were accused of buying their way off the boat, a story inflamed by the tabloid press. But at a British Board of Trade inquiry into the disaster, where the couple testified, Sir Cosmo was adamant he’d given the money as a gesture of goodwill to help the men. However, mud sticks and they were tainted by the incident for the rest of their lives,” Hanson added. On board the Carpathia, the Duff-Gordons were helped by the ship’s purser Ernest Brown, who was later awarded a medal for his crucial role in the Titanic rescue operation. TITANIC TREASURES SOLD AT UK AUCTION In appreciation of Brown’s kindness toward them, the Duff-Gordons gave him the Asprey gold cigarette case. The case is inscribed with the message: “Ernest G F Brown RNR, in remembrance of kindness. SS Carpathia. From Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon.” On the front, features the initials “EB.” The cigarette case, which will be sold at Hanson’s on Sept. 28, has a pre-sale estimate of $51,073 to $76,609. In 2016, the sextant used by Carpathia's captain sold for just under $97,000. Three photos and a handwritten note detailing the grisly discovery of Titanic’s last lifeboat were sold for $6,800.

Sarah Perez,"Hulu outbid major players in cable and streaming to obtain the rights to develop “Little Fires Everywhere,” a new limited series produced by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, producer of the Emmy-winning “Big Little Lies” on HBO. The show is based on Celeste Ng’s 2017 bestselling book by the same name, and will star both Witherspoon and Kerry Washington. The series recently hit the marketplace, and was soon the subject of a bidding war between major players industry-wide, according to reports. The Hollywood Reporter also said several outlets attempted to take the package off the table, but Witherspoon and others involved in the project insisted on letting everyone hear the pitch before deciding on the right home for the project. It’s notable, then, that Witherspoon opted for Hulu, given Hello Sunshine’s recent projects have sold to Apple. That list includes a comedy series starring Kristen Wiig; a Jennifer Aniston and Witherspoon drama, focused on a fictional version of the morning TV show world, and a thriller starring Octavia Spencer called “Are You Sleeping.” The new project will be produced by Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, Washington’s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. Liz Tigelaar (“Casual”) will write and serve as showrunner and exec producer. This is Hello Sunshine’s first venture as a studio. It will serve as studio co-production partners with ABC Signature, the cable and streaming division of ABC Studios, on the project. Hello Sunshine will also lead creative. ABC Signature is already working with Hulu on “Marvel’s Runaways,” and had worked with Washington on the HBO film “Confirmation.” Its credits also include Showtime’s “SMILF,” Freeform’s Marvel series “Cloak and Dagger,” and others. The New York Times Best Seller which the new Hulu series is based on will tell the story of the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and an enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives over the course of eight episodes. The story, explains Hulu, “explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, the ferocious pull of motherhood – and the danger in believing that following the rules can avert disaster.” These themes – of motherhood, women’s lives, and identity – are similar to those explored in the Hello Sunshine-backed Emmy winner, “Big Little Lies,” indicating the potential for “Little Fires Everywhere” to follow in its footsteps as the next critically acclaimed success. “Celeste wove a beautiful, riveting story that spoke to all of us, and when we heard the vision Reese, Kerry and Liz have for the series, we knew immediately that we had to bring it to Hulu,” said Hulu Chief Content Officer Joel Stillerman, in a statement. “We’re honored to bring this powerful story to the screen with Hello Sunshine, in their first studio project. This is exactly the type of compelling and culturally relevant content that embodies our Hulu Originals brand.” “At Hello Sunshine, we strive to shine a light on female-driven stories that are rooted in inspiration, emotion and truth – all of which form the bedrock of Celeste Ng’s ingenious work,” added Witherspoon. “Hulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class, and what it means to be a mother.” Hulu made a name for itself in streaming with its Emmy and Golden Globe Award-winning series “The Handmaid’s Tale,” but is still looking for its next big hit. “Little Fires Everywhere” will join the slate of Hulu originals that includes the George Clooney limited series “Catch-22,” “The Looming Tower,” “Castle Rock,” “The First,” “Marvel’s Runaways,” and others.","Hulu outbid major players in cable and streaming to obtain the rights to develop “Little Fires Everywhere,” a new limited series produced by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, producer of the Emmy-winning “Big Little Lies” on HBO.

If you buy something, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission. LuminAID, which we've covered in the past, is an inflatable lantern company that's bringing a little light into the world by doing good. You might remember founders Andrea Sreshta and Anna Stork from season six of ABC's Shark Tank back in 2015. Though their idea was simple enough — an easy, efficient way to provide light during emergencies — their product was anything but ordinary. LuminAID's inflatable lanterns use solar panels to convert natural sun rays into bright light, plus they can float, so they're the perfect tool for first responders after natural disasters. Check out the video: But while LuminAID's lanterns could be great for lengthy camping trips and fun pool parties, Sreshta and Stork have always put philanthropy at the forefront of their business. When disaster struck Nepal in 2015, LumindAID provided over 3,000 lanterns as part of its Give Light Nepal campaign. Then, when a string of hurricanes hit Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and more two years late, leaving many without food, shelter, water, or power, LuminAID was once again ready to rise to the occasion. Sreshta and Stork traveled to Puerto Rico with Convoy of Hope to provide relief to those impacted. Convoy of Hope served over 2.5 million meals and 215,000 families, while LuminAID pledged an unprecedented 50,000 solar lights and chargers for those in need. SEE ALSO: Aromatherapy and phone charging? Get you a night light that can do both. Since their launch, LuminAID has expanded their product offerings and updated their designs. So whether you want to follow the Boy Scouts' code of ethics and ""always be prepared"" or simply support a brand that's doing some good in the world, LuminAID's PackLite Spectra Solar Inflatable &amp; USB Lantern is worth the buy. Once you charge the lantern via solar panels or USB, it can illuminate nine different colored lights for up to 12 hours. Each lamp comes with an adjustable strap so you can hook it to a tent or carry it around with ease. As a bonus, it's made of environmentally friendly, weather resistant materials. At $25 a pop, these lanterns are more expensive than a standard flashlight, but when you think about how much money you'll spend on batteries, it'll pay for itself. And when it comes to helping others, isn't it about time we put our money where our mouth is?","Heads up: All products featured here are selected by Mashable's commerce team and meet our rigorous standards for awesomeness.

Associated Press,"One of Central America's most active volcanos erupted in fiery explosions of ash and molten rock Sunday, killing at least seven people and injuring 20 while a towering cloud of smoke blanketed nearby villages in heavy ash. An undetermined number were missing, and authorities feared the toll could rise. Guatemala's Volcan de Fuego, or “volcano of fire,” exploded shortly before noon. About 4 p.m., lava began flowing down the side of the mountain. Eddy Sanchez, director of the country's seismology and volcanology institute, said the flows reached temperatures of about 1,300 degrees. Video images on Sacatepequez television showed a charred landscape where a lava flow came into contact with homes. Three bodies lay partially buried in ash-colored debris from the volcano, which is about 25 miles from Guatemala City. Other videos from local media showed residents walking barefoot and covered in muddy residue. “Not everyone was able to get out. I think they ended up buried,” Consuelo Hernandez, a resident of the village of El Rodeo, told the newspaper Diario de Centroamerica. “Where we saw the lava fall, we ran to a hillside” to escape, she added. Hundreds of rescue workers, including firefighters, police and soldiers, worked to recover bodies from the still-smoking lava. National Disaster Coordinator Sergio Cabanas said seven people were confirmed dead and an unknown number were unaccounted for. Among the fatalities were four people, including a disaster agency official, killed when lava set a house on fire in El Rodeo village, Cabanas said. Two children burned to death as they watched from a bridge the volcano's second eruption this year, he added. One more victim was found in the streets of El Rodeo by volunteer firefighters, but the person died in an ambulance. Guatemala's disaster agency said 3,100 people had evacuated nearby communities, and falling ash was affecting about 1.7 million of the country’s 15 million residents. Shelters were opened for those forced to flee. “Currently the volcano continues to erupt and there exists a high potential for (pyroclastic) avalanches of debris,” the disaster agency said via Twitter, quoting Sanchez, the director of the seismology and volcanology institute. It added that he said authorities began to send bulletins on the situation starting at 11:30 a.m. ""A partir de las 11:30 horas se comenzaron a generar los boletines para informar la situación del volcán de Fuego"" Eddy Sánchez, Director de INSIVUMEH pic.twitter.com/Zoc1CImz4B — CONRED (@ConredGuatemala) June 4, 2018 Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said he would issue a declaration of a state of emergency to be approved by Congress and urged people to heed warnings from emergency officials. Ash was falling on the Guatemala City area as well as the departments of Sacatepequez, Chimaltenango and Escuintla, which are in south-central Guatemala around the volcano. Streets and houses were covered in the colonial town of Antigua, a popular tourist destination. Aviation authorities closed the capital's international airport because of the danger posed to planes by the ash. The conical Volcan de Fuego reaches an altitude of 12,346 feet above sea level at its peak.","Los Angeles Times Volcano erupts in Guatemala, killing at least 7 Los Angeles Times One of Central America's most active volcanos erupted in fiery explosions of ash and molten rock Sunday, killing at least seven people and injuring 20 while a towering cloud o…",2018-06-04T02:20:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Latimes.com'}","Volcano erupts in Guatemala, killing at least 7 - Los Angeles Times",http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-guatemala-volcano-20180603-story.html,http://www.latimes.com/resizer/cEYcVZvXisoWqs8oZ91wOQAVdv4=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X42QGJSTXJEDVBWSO3UOEO3FJU.jpg,,Latimes.com,1
Pete Hammond,"Whenever a studio’s marketing department resorts to commercials calling a film “the year’s most original movie,” you know they don’t quite know how to sell it. Such is the case with Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis’ Welcome to Marwen, an odd duck of a movie about a unique human being named Mark Hogancamp. While I am throwing the word “odd” around here, let me add I also found it oddly affecting in ways that are hard to describe.
You can see why Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future, Castaway) might have been attracted to this project. Before returning to more traditional narrative films like Flight and The Walk (both excellent), he spent about 12 years of his career trying to entice audiences to embrace his performance-capture movies (The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol), a grand experiment in which actors work in tights with dots in front of greenscreens to come off as a somewhat photo-real animated facsimile of themselves. In sort of a compromise with his own creative instincts, he gets to blend the live-action form he was known for with the performance-capture process he has been so fond of, and that becomes Welcome to Marwen, perhaps the strangest, if not “most original,” film to come from a major studio this year.
For taking this kind of swing I applaud him even if many critics and audiences won’t quite know what to make of Hogancamp’s story. Of course, what makes it intriguing is that it is a 100% true tale and in fact was the subject of Jeff Malmberg’s 2010 documentary Marwencol. I confess not to having seen the docu, so I approached this take with fresh eyes, and in this version it is a tonally uneven but harrowing and ultimately hopeful story indeed. As a holiday entry it is likely to get buried at the box office, but it is worth finding if you are looking for something, yes, “original” in a crop of sequels and superhero fare on display this season. You either go with this man’s story or you don’t.
Hogancamp (Steve Carell, giving it all he’s got) had a very different kind of life, career and onetime marriage before a drunken outburst in a bar, where he admitted to a guy that he enjoyed wearing women’s heels about town, led to a horrific incident upon leaving that bar when the guy summoned his other homophobic friends and beat Hogancamp to a bloody pulp in a hate crime, leaving him for dead in the middle of the road. A woman saves him and gets him to the hospital, where he went through months of recovery but lost his memory. Eventually getting back to some semblance of a life, he pours the negative and ugliness of this crime into art by creating the mythical Belgian town of Marwen in World War II, populated by life-sized dolls he invents including his alter ego Captain Hogie, a WWII fighter pilot chased by Nazis and embraced by a variety of women. This is where the performance capture comes in as Carell and the other actors are transformed into these doll-like figures.
Zemeckis and Caroline Thompson’s screenplay darts back and forth between the fantasy world Mark creates with the current facts of his life in the real world post-attack. His plight is embraced by a number of women including Leslie Mann, as Nicol, a new neighbor he falls for; Merritt Wever as Roberta, who runs the hobby store where he shops for materials to use for Marwen; Eiza Gonzalez as Carlala, a co-worker; and others including Janelle Monáe as GI Julie and Leslie Zemeckis as Suzette. They all turn up also as the women of Marwen, and that includes Diane Kruger who is really off the wall as Deja Thoris.
It is an art installation in real life that Hogancamp photographs and creates gallery shows around.  Zemeckis has now made this hobby and art show into one half of this movie, a private fantasy world up on the big screen. The tone is challenging as the story darts back and forth and can get pretty dark, but the actors give it their all to be sure.  It is a game try, and certainly a unique story ultimately about a man who did not let the most horrific attack on his humanity make him give up on life when he might have had every right to do just that. Instead, he turned it into art.
Producers are Zemeckis Jack Rapke, Steve Starkey,and Cherylanne Martin. Universal puts it into release today. Check out my video review above which features scenes from the film.

Jonathan Shieber,"President Donald Trump just fired his embattled Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, via Twitter this morning; replacing him with former Tea Party Congressman and current Central Intelligence Agency chief Mike Pompeo. Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018 Apparently, it’s completely normal (under the current administration) to announce major policy decisions and staffing changes that impact national security and international diplomacy alongside exhortations to “get out the vote” and lavish self-praise for the state of the economy. The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018 That tweet immediately preceded Tillerson’s ignominious departure from government service. And the announcement of Tillerson’s ouster was followed by a return to the regularly scheduled publicity tour to showcase the Mexican border wall boondoggle. Tillerson, who has had a rocky tenure as Secretary of State nearly from the outset, was first informed of is imminent ouster with a heads up call from White House chief of staff John Kelly (also on shaky ground). The New York Times is reporting that Kelly asked Tillerson to cut short his trip to Africa and advised him last Friday that he “may get a tweet.” It seems that Twitter is now the preferred medium of communication among all White House and Cabinet-level staff these days. The undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and affairs took to the service to issue what is, so far, Tillerson’s only response. The Secretary did not speak to the President this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted. We wish Secretary-Designate Pompeo well — Steve Goldstein (@UnderSecPD) March 13, 2018 Statement from Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein: The Secretary had every intention of remaining because of the tangible progress made on critical national security issues. He established and enjoyed relationships with his counterparts. — Steve Goldstein (@UnderSecPD) March 13, 2018 By any measure Tillerson’s turn at the helm of the State Department was an unmitigated disaster, according to most observers. His policy positions on everything from nuclear proliferation to dealing with Syria, Qatar, and the Kremlin were undermined or overturned by the White House. Here’s a good synopsis from Vox: The US bombed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in early April — just days after Tillerson suggested the administration would be fine with Assad staying in power. On June 9, Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and its allies to end their isolation of Qatar; less than two hours later, Trump sided with the Saudis by labeling Qatar “a funder of terrorism at a very high level.” On July 20, after a meeting in which the president reportedly asked for a major expansion of America’s nuclear arsenal, Tillerson told aides that the president was a moron — or, according to some reports, a “ fucking moron.” One time, Tillerson tried to open the door to negotiations with North Korea — and Trump slapped him down in a tweet. Under Tillerson’s tenure, the State Department was also hollowed out. Political appointees were never approved to leadership roles and the rank and file staffers fled the increasingly hamstrung department.

Andrew Freedman,"A devastating flash flood event in mid-April caused widespread damage on the lush Hawaiian island of Kauai. Now comes word that during the 24-hour period between April 14 and 15, a staggering 49.69 inches of rain fell at a rain gauge about 1 mile west of Hanalei. If this amount is verified by the National Climatic Extremes Committee, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and serves as a sort of Guinness Book of World Records for weather and climate, it would be the heaviest 24-hour rainfall total ever recorded in the U.S. SEE ALSO: The National Weather Service had to add a new color to its maps to show Harvey's rainfall The current record is 43 inches, set on July 25-26, 1979, in Alvin, Texas. It would also crush the state record of 38 inches, which was also set in Kauai, back in 1956. The committee members will review the rain gage to determine if it was functioning properly at the time of the rainstorm. This particular gage is operated by a nonprofit organization called the WAIPA Foundation. It's possible that the committee will conclude that the amount of rain was actually less than recorded, or conversely, that it underestimated the rainfall total. It's not surprising that a national rainfall record would come from Kauai, since it's rugged terrain contains some of the wettest landscapes on Earth. Mt. Waialeale, for example, receives about 460 inches of rain per year, and is the wettest place in the country. The April rains, though, were unusually intense and widespread, causing flash flooding throughout the island and forcing thousands to evacuate. Homes, businesses, and infrastructure was damaged or destroyed in a disaster that few in the continental U.S. heard of. This rainstorm is in keeping with climate change trends, as global warming is already making extreme precipitation events both more frequent and intense. No studies have yet been done on this particular event to see how climate change affected it, but other research has shown that global warming has made heavy rainfall events, including Hurricane Harvey, which was the most extreme rainstorm on record in the U.S., much more likely.","A devastating flash flood event in mid-April caused widespread damage on the lush Hawaiian island of Kauai.

"Matt Taylor, Matt Taylor, Lia Kantrowitz","It's a good time to be a banker in America. Tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the rich passed last year, making it way easier for the top 1 percent—many of whom are in the financial sector—to spend big on luxury travel or new houses or just stash cash in offshore accounts. Banks just enjoyed their most profitable quarter in history. And the Trump administration has been corroding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the agency set up after the last financial crisis to guard regular people against abusive behavior from banks and other institutions. But on Tuesday, Congress apparently decided that Wall Street needed a helping hand, passing a significant rollback of post-financial crisis banking regulations imposed under Barack Obama. By doing so, experts on financial regulation said, lawmakers of both parties made another crisis that much more likely—while making it harder to see disaster coming until it's too late. The proposed law has now passed both chambers of Congress and is expected to be signed by Trump. Tellingly, it had the support of moderate Democrats who have taken plenty of money from the banking industry like US senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Tim Kaine of Virginia (a.k.a. Hillary Clinton's running mate). It was framed by backers as a sensible measure easing the ""burden"" of regulations on small- and medium-sized banks that don't pose a massive danger to the economy—or at least aren't as worrisome as the JP Morgan Chases of the world. Specifically, it cuts the frequency of stress tests—basically, check-ups by the feds to see how ready the banks would be to sustain huge losses like they did during the financial crisis—for medium-sized banks, and eliminates them entirely for the smallest ones. But as the New York Times reported, even the biggest banks are now slated to get less oversight from the feds about their own internal accounting and debt loads. Basically, the incentives are being aligned here for bankers of all stripes to be more reckless about loading up on shady assets. Those assets could be subprime mortgages like the ones at the heart of the last crisis, increasingly popular green-energy home improvement schemes that put borrowers on the path to foreclosure, or some new ""innovative"" financial product that has yet to catch regulators' attention. The bill also guts the ""living will"" requirement that banks have detailed plans for how to fold in the event they teeter on the brink of collapse, as so many did in 2008. This is a big deal. Remember when a bunch of the biggest lenders in the country either disappeared or had to get bought up to avoid a total stock market crash? The 2010 Dodd-Frank bill forced banks to at least attempt to be ready to prevent that kind of too-big-to-fail madness. And while the killing of that rule only applies to banks with under $250 billion in assets, in 2007 and 2008 that threshold included some of the notorious meltdown institutions, like Countrywide and IndyMac. ""One of the lessons from the financial crisis and the housing crisis is we really did not have much forewarning that it was going to get very ugly very quickly,"" Brad Miller, a former Democratic congressman from North Carolina who helped write the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, said in an interview. ""The next crisis may come from practices that we're being told not to worry about. We were certainly told not to worry about much of anything a decade ago."" It's not just liberals or bank haters or populists who are pissed off or even downright worried about this stuff either. When the Senate version of this bill was about to pass in March, none other than the Wall Street Journal editorial page, hardly a bastion of left-wing sentiment, warned that while softening regulations on little banks made sense, easing ""capital and liquidity standards for the giants will make the financial system more vulnerable in a panic."" ""This is part of a broader trend,"" Sheila Bair, the former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), told me, referring to a ""slippery slope"" of letting banks load up on debt. ""This coming absolutely at the wrong time,"" Bair added, noting that student debt, credit card debt, and other kinds of exposure were entering worrisome territory. ""There is no reason to do this. Banks are fat and happy. There's no evidence of any kind of credit shortage—on the contrary, credit standards are loosening. That typically happens toward the end of the cycle [of growth]. Lending standards start to loosen.... They should be preparing for the next downturn."" The bill will also, as the Times reported, make it easier for shady lenders to operate without scrutiny from the feds. This matters because America has a long and storied tradition of banks and other financial institutions discriminating against people of color. Most notoriously, this consisted of "" redlining,"" or refusing (or just complicating) the issuance of loans to people in suspect—read: nonwhite—neighborhoods. It's not shocking that President Trump, who along with his father has been accused of housing discrimination in his buildings, would support such a measure, but that Democrats would be on board with such a throwback policy is stunning when they are simultaneously trying to seize the mantle of reform in government ahead of the 2018 midterms. ""It was just an extinction event for the African American middle class,"" Miller, the former Congressman, told me of the housing market's collapse between 2006 and 2008. ""When you have a home, when you own your own home, you're in the middle class. When you lose your home to foreclosure, you really lose your membership in the middle class. The effect on the African American middle class, and a somewhat lesser extent on the Latino middle class, was catastrophic. And a lot of those provisions to get at, to identify racial disparities—those requirements have been eliminated."" So even when they aren't being bilked by fake accounts set up in their name or charged phony and excessive overdraft fees, consumers will face the prospect of doing business with unchecked predators preying on people of color. And while it's old news that the American legal and financial systems are set up to make the rich richer at the expense of everyone else, the risk to everyone from another crash is growing—fast. ""It's 2006 all over again,"" Bair, the former FDIC chair, told me, adding, ""It wasn't that long ago and people already want to forget. I guess the campaign donations trump memories.""

"USATODAY, USATODAY","Get ready for a major price hike for orange juice thanks to Hurricane Irma decimating much of Florida's orange crop. Experts say OJ prices could jump by as much as $2.30 per gallon. Wochit Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla., whose district suffered massive citrus damage from Hurricane Irma. (Photo: File) WASHINGTON ­— Florida’s citrus growers can nearly taste the orange aid for which they’ve been thirsting. The latest $81 billion disaster relief bill House leaders have crafted would include $2.6 billion for hurricane-related agriculture relief. It's the third — and largest — funding request for the widespread damage inflicted since August on the Gulf Coast and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The measure needs approval by both houses of Congress and lawmakers Tuesday were still working to include it in a catch-all spending bill Congress is expected to approve before members leave at the end of this week for their holiday recess, But Sunshine State lawmakers are optimistic that Washington finally will deliver on its promise to help cover the $761 million in hurricane damage that Florida’s nationally iconic and economically substantial citrus industry suffered at the winds and rains of Irma. If the bill passes ""our growers can finally go get the help that they need to get them at least to next year,"" said Rep. Tom Rooney whose southern Florida district suffered massive citrus damage from Irma. ""Before yesterday, they were getting nothing."" If the House passes disaster relief, it moves on to the Senate where Florida's two senators — Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Marco Rubio — are pushing for citrus relief. Two previous rounds of disaster aid did not include any money for Florida's citrus crop, which was decimated by flooding and wind damage from Hurricane Irma in September. More than 421,000 acres of citrus groves across a state that produces about 70% of the nation's orange juice was destroyed. U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasters are predicting the 2017-18 crop will be the lowest in decades. Last month, the Trump administration proposed a third round of $44 billion in aid with no promise of citrus aide and only $1 billion for agriculture overall. But Florida and Texas lawmakers have been pressuring congressional leaders for more help for farmers and ranchers. When the bill was unveiled Monday night by House appropriators, it had grown to $81 billion and included $2.6 billion for agriculture that could be used to help Florida's citrus industry. The announcement was cheered by Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, whose office has estimated total hurricane-related losses to Florida's agriculture, including beef, dairy and aquaculture, at $2.5 billion. More: White House requests $44 billion in disaster relief for victims of hurricanes, wildfires More: Citrus growers turn to Congress for help after administration request leaves them out “Florida's farmers, ranchers and growers suffered unprecedented damage from Hurricane Irma, and today's announcement of proposed emergency funding for Florida agriculture is the first bit of good news we've heard in months,"" he said in a news release. Rooney said one of the stumbling blocks was trying to convince lawmakers in other parts of the country to rescue citrus farmers, many of whom did not buy crop insurance. He said those colleagues didn't understand that insurance for citrus was relatively meager, often covering no more than a quarter of losses, compared to other crops. So as part of the bill, citrus growers who apply for federal disaster aid must purchase at least two years of crop insurance, he said. In addition, lawmakers are committed to improving the program so farmers whose orange and grapefruit groves suffer damage from a future catastrophe get more back in return.

Tom McKay,"Earlier this year, remotely piloted robots transmitted what officials believe was a direct view of melted radioactive fuel inside Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant’s destroyed reactors—a major discovery, but one that took a long and painful six years to achieve. In the meantime, the program to clean up the destroyed reactors has seen numerous setbacks and concerns, including delays on Japanese electrical utility Tepco’s timetable to begin removing the highly radioactive fuel and continued leakage of small amounts of radioactive substances. Japanese officials are now hoping that they can convince a skeptical public that the worst of the disaster is over, the New York Times reported, but it’s not clear whether it’s too late despite the deployment of 7,000 workers and massive resources to return the region to something approaching normal. Per the Times, officials admit the recovery plan—involving the complete destruction of the plant, rather than simply building a concrete sarcophagus around it as the Russians did in Chernobyl—will take decades and tens of billions of dollars. Currently, Tepco plans to begin removing waste from one of the three contaminated reactors at the plant by 2021, “though they have yet to choose which one.” “Until now, we didn’t know exactly where the fuel was, or what it looked like,” Tepco manager Takahiro Kimoto told the Times. “Now that we have seen it, we can make plans to retrieve it.” “They are being very methodical—too slow, some would say—in making a careful effort to avoid any missteps or nasty surprises,” Union of Concerned Scientists nuclear safety director David Lochbaum added. “They want to regain trust. They have learned that trust can be lost much quicker than it can be recovered.” Currently, radiation levels are so high in the ruined facility that it fries robots sent in within a matter of hours, which will necessitate developing a new generation of droids with even higher radiation tolerances. Authorities have built a crane on the roof of one melted-down reactor, unit No. 3, to remove fuel, Phys.org reported, though it will not actually be in use until at least April 2018. Disposal of low level waste such as “rice straw, sludge and ash from waste incineration” has only just begun, the Japan Times wrote. The eventual disposal of more dangerous waste will be much more difficult. At the same time, criticism of the government’s approach is also mounting with concerns it is pressuring residents to return to an area where radiation exposure remains many times the international standard.

Rebecca Ruiz,"If you've ever tried to choose between supporting similar campaigns for the same worthy cause on GoFundMe, you know it can be challenging to pick just one. 
That's why the crowdfunding site launched GoFundMe.org Causes on Thursday. The initiative allows donors to support several campaigns related to one of six causes: animal rescue, mental health, environment, kindergarten through high school classrooms, veterans, and kid heroes. 
The company knows its donors are passionate about these issues, said Raquel Rozas, chief marketing officer of GoFundMe. New topics will be added in the future. 
A single donation to one cause will be distributed to multiple individuals and nonprofit organizations vetted in part by the new GoFundMe.org, an independent public charity working with GoFundMe. 
SEE ALSO: Everything to consider before donating to a cause
The goal is to reach people who perhaps wouldn't have otherwise learned about the campaigns as well as to engage high-profile influencers who prefer to back a broad cause instead of a single fundraiser. 
""Our hope is to bring new donors and new communities to these existing campaigns,"" said Rozas. 
The initiative is an evolution of fundraising GoFundMe was already doing with the Direct Impact Fund, a nonprofit organization that helped fund time-sensitive campaigns for multiple groups working on issues like disaster relief and political crises. That has included support for California wildfire survivors and those affected by the Trump administration's family separation policy. GoFundMe.org Causes will still include campaigns for urgent campaigns, Rozas said.

TIM ARANGO,"Even though this community is only beginning to mourn its dead — a candlelight vigil was held Saturday night, and another was planned for Sunday — there is a growing worry that there may be more to come. Last week’s rains, which were so deadly because the fires had left the earth bare, and susceptible to sudden flooding and mudslides, were just the start of California’s rainy season. “This was just the very first storm,” Larry Collins, an officer with the state’s emergency service, said on Saturday, surrounded by the devastation. “We don’t know what’s coming.” Photo Highway 101, shown in the lower part of the frame and an important artery that connects Los Angeles to coastal communities, is closed indefinitely. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Bill Brown, sheriff of Santa Barbara County, said meteorologists were predicting new rains on Thursday, raising fears of more floods and difficult questions about possible evacuations in a wide coastal area of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties that were part of the wildfire zone. Mr. Collins said that up to 300,000 people across the region could be in jeopardy if more rains come. Inevitably, given the scale of the tragedy in Montecito, townspeople are also questioning whether or not authorities should have evacuated more people. In the days before the rain, authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for about 7,000 residents, and voluntary evacuations for an additional 23,000 people. Many residents, though, having just returned to their homes after being displaced from the wildfires, chose to stay put. But officials say they did all they could. Officers went door to door asking people to leave. Rescue workers were brought up from Long Beach, and positioned nearby. On the day before the storm, firefighters were driving around Montecito, clearing obstacles from creeks. In one area, three homes that had sat close together vanished, leaving just pieces of the foundation, and a resident walked around with a plastic bin looking for items he lost. Other homes were only partly damaged; one white mansion had just a wall ripped off, revealing a library of neatly stacked books. Photo Crews searched the debris in Montecito. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Peeking from the mud were ordinary objects — a single white sneaker, a child’s red wagon. All around it looked like a war zone, but a narrower focus revealed there was still beauty, with herb and flower gardens — rosemary, lantana, magnolia — left untouched in some places. Montecito, a secluded community in Santa Barbara County of about 10,000 people, has long drawn the fabulously rich and the merely wealthy. The attractions are obvious: stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains, a Mediterranean climate, proximity to Los Angeles, and privacy. Up in the hills, there is the San Ysidro Ranch, a cluster of luxury cottages where John and Jacqueline Kennedy spent their honeymoon in 1953. Oprah Winfrey, perhaps the community’s most famous resident, owns a 23-acre estate with horse stalls and a koi pond. “In general, when the movie stars come to Santa Barbara, to Montecito, they don’t want to be bothered,” said Erin Graffy, a local historian and writer who has lived in the area for more than 50 years. She arrived as a young girl when her father took a job nearby as a test pilot in California’s then-growing aerospace industry. “And they know Santa Barbara won’t bother them. It would be considered beneath us to go up and fawn over a movie star.” Photo A rescue worker lifting his dog out of the Montecito Creek. The creek was one of several waterways that flooded with mud, debris and large boulders. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times And besides, she said, “the pecking order here is length of residence,” not money or fame. A marker of social cachet, she said, is to refer to oneself as a descendiente, or descendant, of the Spanish settlers who built the Presidio of Santa Barbara in 1782 — not unlike those on the East Coast who trace their ancestry to the Mayflower. Montecito is a community that is accustomed to natural disasters as a cost of living in such a beautiful place, but not tragedy on this scale. “Clearly, nothing of this magnitude was imagined,” said Bill Macfadyen, who has lived in Montecito for decades and is the publisher of the local news site, Noozhawk. “We have had floods before, but nothing like this.” On Sunday Mike Eliason, the public information officer for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, drove his white truck through the mud-choked streets, navigating narrow lanes and the high hedges that still surrounded some of the mansions. Photo A rescue worker inspecting a pile of debris. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times “Oprah is down the street,” he said, pointing left. He then ticked off a list of other famous names: Ellen DeGeneres, Jeff Bridges, Al Gore, Robert Zemeckis. “For a town that is full of movie stars and producers and celebrities, you could not have written a worse disaster movie for this area,” he said. But Montecito isn’t only a place for the fabulously wealthy. “There’s a lot of people that aren’t rich, who are staying with friends or family or in a hotel,” he said. “There are everyday people who work hard and have homes and they’ve lost everything, too.” Every time a disaster strikes in paradise there are the inevitable questions of whether living there is worth the dangers. “It’s Montecito,” said Mr. Macfadyen. “It’s Santa Barbara. People will always want to live there.” Either way, the tragedy will resonate for years. “It will be months before any semblance of normalcy returns,” said Mr. Brown, the sheriff. “And years before the whole community is rebuilt.” Continue reading the main story","Mansions in Montecito, Calif., were destroyed in last week’s mudslides.

David Murphy,"iOS / Android: Get excited. The classic Lemmings experience is finally (and officially) available for your smartphone. Having spent many an hour cursing out the stupidity of the these digital creatures, I cant wait to tackle their many logistical challenges while commuting, standing around, or sitting in bed.
For those who missed this incredible early-1990s puzzle game, the premise is simple. You have a small army of creaturesthe green-haired lemmingswho have to get from point A to point B without falling victim some horrible disaster. Your goal is to prevent them from doing things they shouldnt, like walking off a cliff, by tasking lemmings with special tasks. Some might block your lemmings from going a certain way (to their doom); some might build staircases to get your constantly walking army to a destination.
Lemmings is, and has always been, the perfect mix of frustrating and fun. The Lemmings game for iOS and Android is more the former than the latter, since Sony went overkill with its free-to-play mechanics. You cant purchase the game outright. As Engadget notes, playing through the games levels expends energy, and you have to wait for that to build back up to play more Lemmings. You can always pay to refresh your energy, of course, but the best youll be able to do is an unlimited in-app purchase for $7, which only lets you play as much as you want for a mere two hours. Lame.
For those irritated by Sonys cash grab, there are a few Lemmings alternatives worth slapping on your smartphone:
Caveman (iOS, Android)
(for iOS in normal, lite, HD, and HD lite versions, as well as Android. Lite versions are free, normal is $3, and HD is $5.)
This game is a faithful recreation of Lemmings gameplay, and I love that you can try it out without having to pay a penny.
Zombiez! (iOS, free)
Lemmings are kind of like mindless zombies, in a way, so this theming makes perfect sense. And nobody cares if something undead dies, right?
This game looks gorgeous, and Im already intrigued by the first review that pops up for this game on the App Store: Lemmings for short attention spans. The fact that you can use your tiny creature as bridges, instead of constructing bridges, is delightful.
Spirits (iOS, $3)
In this title, your lemmings are actually spirits that rise from fallen leaves, and you can only assign them one of four tasks to help the others make it to their destination: build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents. The visuals for this puzzler are stunning, to put it mildly.
Bunny Mania 2 (Android, $1)

"Fred Kaplan, Fred Kaplan","U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, descend from Air Force One on their arrival to Buenos Aires, Argentina, for the G-20 Leaders Summit, at Ministro Pistarini International Airport on Thursday. Trump Loves the Militarys Pomp and Power. But Service and Sacrifice Make Him Uncomfortable. Trumps Performance in Paris Was a Stunning Abdication of Global Leadership House Democrats Could Cancel the Pentagons Blank Check The Trump Administration Calls for End to War in Yemen, Wont Actually Do the Thing Necessary to Stop It President Trump arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Thursday night for the annual G-20 summit, which is likely to be something between a waste of time and a disaster. In part, this stems from the ramshackle nature of the organizationthe leaders of 20 nations (or, actually, 19 nations plus the European Union ) assembled to discuss a mishmash agenda, with no binding resolutions attached. But to the extent that things turn disastrous, the problem lies with Trump. Even something as unwieldy as the G-20 can be molded to good ends through shrewd strategy and adroit diplomacy, neither of which Trump possesses in the slightest measure. Quite the contrary: hence the anticipatory shudders no doubt reverberating through the bones of all the other attending leaders and several of Trumps own aides. Other, smaller summits of this sort once served a concrete purpose. For instance, the Group of Seven (G-7), which consists of the worlds seven largest economic powers, was created in 1973 to manage global finances after fixed exchange rates fell apart. Now, though, we live in a G-Zero world, as political scientist Ian Bremmer puts ita world of collapsed power blocs, where no one state (or alliance of states) is able to shape events globally across a wide range of issues. International politics has become a more complex game. Even large nations are rarely able to assert their power; they have to wrangle for dominance or influence with smaller or less-powerful nations that may have special skills or intense interests in a specific region (such as the Middle East or Asia-Pacific) or a specific endeavor (such as trade). There are few more dangerous people than a powerful idiot who thinks hes a genius. In this setting, precisely because of its looseness, the G-20 can be a forum where leaders do this wranglingprobe possibilities, form coalitions, offer deals, make threats. Sometimes this is done in the formal sessions; more often, its done at informal bilaterals, one-on-one meetings behind closed doors. Engaging in this wrangling requires a few things: some cards to play, a firm awareness of your own interests, and a deep knowledge of the other leaders interests. Trump has cards to play, but he knows nothing about interestsneither his own countrys nor the other countries, or how those might collide or converge. Worse still, he doesnt think he needs to know about them. When asked at press conference at Mar-a-Lago last week whether hes been preparing to meet the leaders, especially Chinese President Xi Jinping, with whom hes been waging a trade war, Trump replied that he didnt need to prepare. I have been preparing for it all my life, he said. I know every ingredient, every stat. I know it better than everybody knows it. My gut is always right. A few things are worth noting about these remarks. First, in his prior career as a real estate magnate, Trump had some crafty dealings with contractors, tenants, unions, and the New York City Buildings Department, but negotiating with the president of China is something very different. In short, he has not been preparing for this all his life. Second, its not clear just what ingredients and statistics Trump thinks he knows, or needs to know, that give him a leg up at the G-20, but even if theres something to his claim, its irrelevant. Oscar Wilde once defined a cynic as a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Thats Trump, though cynic barely begins to hint at the depths of his shallowness. Third, anyone who thinks he knows something better than everybody knows it is either a genius or an idiot, and there are few more dangerous people than a powerful idiot who thinks hes a genius. Finally, anyone who not only trusts his gut but believes its always right should be disqualified from making judgments that affect the lives of millions. Many talented people, from all walks of life, have well-honed instincts, and yes, some of them feel the rumblings of those instincts in their guts, but their instincts have been formed and sharpened by education and experience. Trumps gut is just a gut. Trump makes judgments about one issue or one country at a time, with no assessment of how they affect his positions with other issues or other countries. As a result, in almost all of his dealings, he has alienated every leader who might have been a useful ally in some other context. For instance, Syria is a complicated conflict; it might be impervious to settlement by anyone. But if there were a diplomatic solution, it would have to involve a consortium of nationsincluding Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Syria itselfand Trump has either annoyed or sent puzzlingly mixed messages to all of them. Another example: Trump wants to isolate Iran; to do that effectively, he would need the cooperation of its trading partners (actual or potential) in Europe, Russia, and Chinaand he has angered all of them. He wants to play trade-war games with China; to do that well, he would need to form a common front with Canada and the Europeansyet he has also slapped tariffs on them. He wants to sign a nuclear-disarmament deal with North Korea; to do that, he needs the active help of China and South Koreayet hes you get the idea. Even with leaders whom he has tried to befriend, he hasnt done so in ways that give him leverage. Russian President Vladimir Putin has corrupted U.S. elections, poisoned exiles in allied nations, and abetted mass killings in Syriaall to no objection from Trump. But now that Trump has an opportunity to exert some pressure over Russias recent naval aggression against Ukraine, hes backed away; he canceled a one-on-one meeting he and Putin were scheduled to hold at the G-20. He canceled the session ostensibly as a protest against Russias actions. But a protest would have been more potent if he had held the meeting and made the U.S. position clear, especially since our position on Russia isnt clear at all. Trumps Cabinet secretaries and U.N. ambassador denounce Putin for one thing or another, but Trump says little, often contradicting his experts, leaving Putin with the sense that he might get away with whatever he wants to do. One likely explanation is that Trump didnt want to have a meeting where he would have to criticize Putin. And here, special counsel Robert Muellers investigation comes into play. Just before the summit, Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen revealed that his client was angling to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, even offering Putin the $50 million penthouse apartment, at the same time that he was running for president, promising to restore good relations with Russia if elected and telling his crowds that he had no business deals in that country. This is the blackmail that Putin may have been holding over Trump all along. Quite aside from the scuzzy (and possibly impeachable) nature of this relationship, it precludes Trumpand prevents the United Statesfrom having a coherent policy toward Russia, from dealing with any threats (or opportunities) that Putin poses. The same may be true of Saudi Arabia, where Trump has also pursued investments. Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salmanwho is also at the G-20ordered the brutal murder of journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi), but Trump has firmly stood by him, no strings attached, even waving away the CIAs assessment that MBS was involved. The one thing Trump might accomplish this weekend is averting a trade war with China. This could be the summits banner headline, depending on the outcome of a one-on-one meeting, scheduled for Saturday, with Xi. If the meeting goes well and Trump assents to holding additional talks, rather than imposing steeper tariffs on Chinese goods, he will only be averting a crisis that he created. Of course, the outcome could go the other way: Trump may decide against further talks, thinking he could squeeze more out of Xi by piling on more tariffs or threatening to do soa risky tactic, as Xi might not scream but rather escalate the conflict. Either way, Trump is going into these talks awfully nonchalantly. China wants to make a deal, he said at the same Mar-a-Lago press conference where he touted the wisdom of his gut. After all, he and Xi have a great relationship, he boasted. I like him a lot. I think he likes me. Trump doesnt get it. First, the two of them dont have a great relationship. Second, friendship among leaders can boost the prospects of a deal if they share interests, but not if they dont, and its unclear which interests either Trump or Xi is willing to compromise in order to get a deal at the moment. The decisive factor may be whether Trump takes the advice of his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, his trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, or his director of trade policy (and author of Death by China ), Peter Navarro. The three disagree over tariffs, and, as Trump boarded Air Force One for the 11-hour flight to Buenos Aires, he hadnt yet taken sides. Theres the nub of the matter: Trump is going into high-level talks that may determine U.S.-China relations, the jobs and fortunes of millions of Americans, and the shape of the world economy for the next few yearsand he doesnt have a grasp of what U.S. policy should be or even what U.S. interests are. He doesnt satisfy the most basic definition of a national leader, much less a world leader. Support our work: become a Slate Plus member.

Tracy Rucinski,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The family of an American woman killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the airline, Boeing Co and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, the manufacturer of a part of the aircraft that is the focus of investigators. 
The complaint was filed in U.S. federal court in Chicago by the parents of Samya Stumo, who lawyers said was on a work trip when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on March 10 soon after taking off from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 on board. 
It was the first lawsuit filed on behalf of a U.S. victim of the Ethiopian disaster and the first to target the airline and parts manufacturer Rosemount, in addition to Boeing. 
The complaint accuses Boeing of putting “profits over safety” and said the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration must also be held accountable for certifying the 737 MAX. 
The 737 MAX planes were grounded worldwide following the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, which came five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people. 
The doomed Ethiopian flight repeatedly nosedived as the pilots battled to control the nearly full aircraft before it crashed, Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday, while urging Boeing to review its flight control technology on the MAX. 
In a statement following Ethiopia’s preliminary report, Boeing said flight data recorder information indicates the airplane had an erroneous angle of attack sensor input that activated a system known as MCAS, similar to the Lion Air incident. 
Rosemount makes the angle of attack sensor. 
Chicago-based Boeing, which is also the target of lawsuits over the Oct. 29 Indonesia crash, has been working on a software fix and new training guidelines for the MAX. 
Lawyers for Stumo’s family said it had also filed a federal tort claim against the FAA over the Ethiopian crash. 
Stumo, originally from Massachusetts, is the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader.

Christian Kinnear,"Your company just promoted you, and you’re a newly minted manager. After a well-deserved celebration and many congratulatory messages, you come face-to-face with one harsh truth that comes with your new role–the lack of empty time slots in your calendar. In my experience, new managers tend to make one crucial mistake–trying to do it all. They attempt to keep up with their own workload while making themselves constantly available to their team. As noble as those intentions may be, working 15-hour days won’t make you a better leader. After all, no one does their best work when they’re overly stressed. I learned this the hard way. As soon as I realized that my round-the-clock hours were neither conducive to my work nor my growing family, I made time management a priority. To prevent burnout, I implemented the following five strategies. It’s something that I still live by today, and as a manager, I can attest that they go a long way in keeping you productive (and sane). Learn how to say no I get it, saying no to a colleague feels terrible. But if you keep saying yes to requests, you’ll end up with an ever-growing to-do list of work that isn’t mission-critical for you or your team. You’ll feel better about saying “no” when you realize that as a result, you’ll have more time to do work that’s highly important, but not urgent. Sure, it might feel good to send those emails and cross those “simple” requests off your list–but are those tasks really going to have a meaningful impact on your team or business? Probably not. So the next time a project, request, or opportunity comes your way, picture where it would land in the table below. If it’s of low urgency and low importance, say “no.” It’s not worth your time. [Image: courtesy of Hubspot] Be super selective with meetings You know that too many meetings can kill your productivity, but earlier in your career, you probably felt obliged to say yes to all of them. As a manager, you can’t afford to do this if you want to get any work done. Before RSVPing, ask yourself–is there a clear agenda of what this meeting needs to accomplish? Are you the best person to add value in this meeting? Is this something you can’t resolve quickly via email or messenger? If the answer is no, then the meeting is probably not the best use of your time. If the answer is yes, focus the conversation by setting the meeting objective ahead of time. This way, you’ll avoid going into pointless tangents. If you need to decide on something in the meeting, make that clear in the agenda. Related: 3 creative meeting formats to make your whole team more effective Do a regular calendar audit Every now and then, it can be helpful to push the reset button on your schedule. There may be standing meetings that are no longer relevant or nonessential “check-ins” that take up your day-to-day. Do a bird’s eye view analysis to figure out which one of those activities are truly the best use of your time, and whether they’re something others in your team can handle. You should also think about blocking out time for certain projects that don’t require a meeting–whether that be recruitment or catching up on company updates. Without scheduling those tasks in your calendar, you might find it difficult to make progress. Don’t use your inbox as your to-do list Chances are, you’ll get more emails, not less, when you become a manager. So if you’ve been using your inbox as your to-do list, now is the time to put a stop to that practice. Organizing your “priorities” trains your brain to be “always on” and look for the next task to knock off the list. It does not train you to think about how those lists relate to your big-picture goals and responsibilities. I use Trello and have separate horizontal lists for “People,” “Culture,” “Product,” “Sales,” and “Performance.” The lists are side-by-side, which allows me to think holistically about my output in a given day or week without the urge to cross off what’s at the “top” of the list. Related: These to-do list methods will help you finally get organized Delegate objectives, not tasks Delegating work should save you time, but you can waste a ton of it if you don’t do it right. For starters, delegating to-dos without providing full context results in a lot of hand holding, and as a result, employees don’t feel ownership over the work. This makes them more likely to check in with you and ask unnecessary questions like whether they are doing it “right.” On the other hand, if you delegate an objective or mission (and provide a few guardrails), they won’t expect a step-by-step instruction manual from you along the way. They’ll write their own, and might even come up with creative solutions as a result. You’ll probably get a better output, and you’ll find yourself with more time to tackle essential items. Time is our most coveted resource, and that becomes even more of a reality when you move into a management role. By following these methods, you’ll be able to succeed in your new job while maintaining a healthy personal life at the same time.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption The UN estimates that 260,000 Afghans have fled their homes this year due to drought A deadly drought in Afghanistan is causing a humanitarian crisis that has displaced more people this year than the war between the government and the Taliban. The BBC's Secunder Kermani reports from Herat. Shadi Mohammed, 70, wells up with tears as he walks through the makeshift camp on the outskirts of the western city of Herat, where he lives with his family. ""We are thirsty and hungry. We took what little we could with us, but lost most of it on the way. Now we have nothing. Eight of us live in this small tent,"" he says. ""My wife and my brother died. Half of our children are here. The other half were left behind."" Mr Mohammed is one of an estimated 260,000 people who have been forced from their homes in northern and western Afghanistan because of a severe drought in the region. The drought is adding to the misery in the country where levels of violence have been increasing since 2014 when international forces formally ended their combat mission. The Taliban are now reported to control more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the US led invasion which drove them from power in 2001. But the UN says that this year, the drought has displaced more Afghans than even the conflict between the Taliban and the government. Image copyright AFP Image caption The drought is adding to the misery of Afghans who are already suffering in the war Qadir Assemy from the United Nations World Food Programme (UNWFP) is helping co-ordinate the relief effort in Herat, which has seen an influx of people fleeing their homes. ""It's very challenging because of the scale of the disaster,"" he tells the BBC. The UN is allocating $34.6m to help the 2.2 million people who are estimated to have been affected by the drought. At present, the UNWFP is distributing money for people to buy food. Image copyright AFP Image caption Many Afghans believe their political leaders are too detached from the issues facing them Outside a registration centre, many seem desperate. One woman sitting with four young children tells me she has recently arrived from the northern province of Faryab. ""If we had any money we would have never come here. Our bad luck brought us here,"" she says. ""There was no rain for more than a year. Everything dried up. We didn't even have water to give to our children. On top of that there was fighting between the Taliban and the army. It was chaos."" Others described being forced to sell their livestock or borrow money simply to survive. Agriculture is one of the country's main sources of income.

But many Afghans complain that their political leaders are too detached from the issues facing them. The hundreds of thousands of people in Herat certainly have a more pressing concern at hand - the impending arrival of the cold winter months. Mr Assemy believes the cold weather is ""a major concern"" as it seems unlikely that the displaced people will be able to return to their homes in the coming months. ""The weather will be very harsh. This population will not be able to survive in tents,"" he says.

ALAN BLINDER,"A spokesman for the House Speaker, Tim Moore, did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Moore, a Republican who has toured disaster areas in recent weeks, has said that lawmakers were prepared to ensure that relief money actually gets out to where its supposed to be a sign that Raleigh was already raw with hurricane politics even before Florence. Mr. Coopers administration has faced heavy pressure, and no small amount of outrage, over how it managed the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which struck in 2016. Frustrated Republicans set up a special legislative subcommittee in August to conduct further examination of the issues concerning the administration and management of Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts. Democrats, furious, saw the move as a nakedly partisan attack on Mr. Cooper, who did not take office until nearly three months after the storm ravaged the state. It is my hope that the executive branch has learned some lessons from how things were handled in the aftermath of Matthew, Mr. Berger, the Senate leader, said. A lot of the difficulties weve had with the executive branch have been differences of philosophy. It is my hope that we all share the same philosophy with reference to trying to get peoples lives back to normal. South Carolina, the other state hardest hit by Florence, is almost guaranteed to have an easier time politically with its recovery efforts. Gov. Henry McMaster and the lawmakers who control the State Legislature are all Republicans and do not seem to wake up each morning with their knives already sharpened, as their counterparts appear to in Raleigh. Mr. McMaster is on the November ballot, but Mr. Coopers term in North Carolina runs another two years, and there are few marquee state races this year. The main prizes at stake in November are the supermajorities the Republicans hope to retain in the Legislative Building.","Political leaders say they hope for a cooperative effort on storm relief measures, but there are already signs of tooth-and-claw partisanship rearing up again.",2018-09-29T13:19:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Florence Silenced North Carolina’s Political Rancor.

Michael Archambault,"Updating your machine to the latest version of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system only to discover that your files have been permanently deleted is nothing short of a nightmare. Unfortunately, the Redmond, Washington tech giant has been consistently running into such problems when deploying critical updates; from quality control issues to delays, Windows 10 hasn’t been basking in a positive light. A recent post from Michael Fortin, corporate vice president of Windows, notes the complexity of updating an operating system on such a large scale, in addition to quality control markers that are already set in place. The massive rollout that was the October 2018 Update for Windows 10 was nothing short of a blunder for a company as sweeping as Microsoft. With reports of severe data loss by users who downloaded the fall update, Microsoft paused the rollout after only two days. Windows users who had adjusted the location of specific folders found their data completely wiped from their drives. Without a proper backup, the information was lost a grave failure for a critical update. Fortin has been reassuring users that Microsoft takes every bit of feedback from its customer base seriously — even if an issue has only been reported by a single user. Testing in Redmond is partially achieved by implementing what the company calls a “self-host” culture in which employees who are working on Windows are required to run the latest version of the operating system to seek out bugs and other issues first-hand. Additionally, Microsoft notes that testing goes far beyond the walls of the company itself — new updates undergo external testing at labs as well. As new updates continue to roll out, Microsoft uses its systems and feedback from the customer service team to keep an eye on the latest information from users in the field. Microsoft also notes that customer incidents have been steadily declining over time since Windows 10’s initial launch. While Fortin provided an overview of Microsoft’s Windows 10 update, he didn’t necessarily outline how the company will prevent such issues from popping up again. All of the quality systems that Fortin notes have apparently been in place and yet failed to capture Windows 10’s issues.","After a string of Windows 10 update issues, including severe data loss for a number of users, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Windows, Michael Fortin, has spoken out out about quality control surrounding Windows development at Microsoft.

 Queensland's northern cattle region was devastated by floods in February
Like many other Australian graziers, Matt Bennetto could only start to count the dead after the rain had stopped.
Flying in a helicopter over his sodden cattle station, he was confronted by the ""nightmare"" of mass cattle losses.
Animals were strewn across pastures which had turned into water and mud.
""We probably flew over 10,000 carcasses that day, just going over my place and the neighbours',"" he told the BBC.
His cattle at Julia Creek were among an estimated 500,000 livestock wiped out when a flood disaster hit northern Queensland earlier this month.
Image copyrightCOWAN DOWNS STATION/REUTERSImage caption
 Animals seek higher ground to escape the waters
""To see them all dead along the fence lines and in the corners - can you imagine that scene?"" he said.
""You spend your whole life trying to breed beautiful animals and then you see something like that. It's beyond heartbreaking.""
Massive rainfall
Queensland's cattle industry, worth A$8.6bn (£4.7bn; $6bn), is reeling after the losses in the state's north.
Rain pummelled 13 million hectares of dedicated farming land - an area about the size of England - killing a third of cattle there. The bulk of flooding stretched, in rough terms, between towns Normanton and Winton.
Some areas received three times their average annual rainfall in a week. 
At first the deluge was welcomed by farmers, who had sustained their cattle through years of drought. 
But as waters rose, the situation quickly turned and led to animals drowning. Many more died from exposure to the elements.
""These cattle are bred in hot, dry conditions,"" Mr Bennetto said. ""Right before the rain they had gone through a week of over 40-degree [Celsius] temperatures.
""For an animal who can live in such extreme heat, they're not good at surviving in that cold rain.""
Logistical challenges
The Queensland floods have come in an Australian summer that has been marked by natural disasters.
A number of other mass wildlife deaths have been recorded amid record-breaking heatwaves, and bushfires have destroyed homes in three states.
In the coastal Queensland city of Townsville, floodwaters led to two deaths.
Media captionThe coastal city of Townsville, east of the cattle regions, was also flooded
Further west, in the region of the mass cattle deaths, the floodwaters have receded but a crisis remains.
""Producers are attempting to save as many cattle as possible, getting them out of mud and water, and providing them with fodder and medical attention,"" said Michael Guerin, head of AgForce, the industry's peak body in Queensland.
The army has helped bury carcasses and fly hay bales to surviving animals.
Image copyrightRURAL AIDImage caption
 The army has assisted the recovery effort
Charles Adler from Rural Aid, a charity which organised drop-offs, described it as a logistical challenge.
""Some of these stations are 150km long, so finding alive cattle was a very difficult exercise. And then they're scattered everywhere in small mobs, so we're ferrying bales by chopper one at a time,"" he said.
He said animals stuck in mud were starving, while others were dying from shock, pneumonia and Three Day Sickness - a bovine fever spread by mosquitoes. 
Another grazier, Rachael Anderson, has lost at least 2,000 animals - about half of her herd - at her station in Julia Creek. She said the numbers were continuing to rise.
""We had lots of mothers birth just after the rain, but then die from exhaustion. So I'm hand-rearing 12 calves but there will be more,"" she said.
""Lots of people are in the same boat. We are just saving whatever lives we can.""
'Rebuilding from scratch'
The estimated half a million deaths represent only a portion of Australia's total cattle industry, which numbers about 27 million. 
But for northern Queensland, the toll is immense.
Image copyrightAGFORCEImage caption
 An area the size of England was flooded, authorities say
Authorities have put the combined financial loss for about 800 graziers at more than A$5bn. Some farms will not have cash flow for up to three years, AgForce warns.
The region's industry now has to ""rebuild itself almost from scratch"", according to Mr Guerin. He said restocking may take years, while replacing prized ""bloodlines"" could take decades.
Some graziers find it almost too hard to contemplate. As Mr Adler said: ""They've struggled for seven years to keep their animals alive in the drought, and now they're left with the futility of all that.""
Mr Bennetto, who lost more than 70% of his livestock, said he had chosen to suspend operations at his station for now.
""We're just not in a position to come back right now,"" he said. ""Maybe in a couple of months, we can get back on our feet and keep going. But I've already started a new job this week just so we can afford to pay our bills.""

"Gavin Butler, Julian Morgans","This article originally appeared on VICE Australia. A would-be drug thief was forced to call emergency services after getting stuck in the chimney of a pharmacy he was allegedly trying to rob. The 22-year-old anti-Santa was prowling around on the roof of the dispensary in Lancefield, Victoria, about 70 kilometers [43 miles] north of Melbourne on Monday night when his evening took a tragic turn. Whether by way of climbing or falling, he ended up going down the chimney chute and had to call for emergency services to come and get him. Police first attended the pharmacy at about 10:30 PM on Monday when an alarm was triggered at the shop, Fairfax reports, but left shortly thereafter. Before long, they were called back to the scene to retrieve a man who was trapped at the premises. Its alleged that he attempted to break into the pharmacy by scaling down through the small chimney cavity, and he subsequently became stuck. ""He waited for the police and while he waited, the fire brigade and ambulances came and he thought I can call them... to rescue me because I'm stuck,"" one of the pharmacists told Nine News. ""The police asked him what he was doing and he said he was taking photos from the roofbut he didn't bring his camera."" The alleged burglar reportedly left a balaclava ski mask and a backpack behind at the scene. He was assessed for minor injuries before being taken back to a police station for interviewing. He (was) covered head-to-toe in soot. He looked like a 1700s chimney sweep from the UK, said store owner Greg Gibson. The ambulance worker said to him, Dude, are you practicing to be Santa?' The man was ultimately charged with burglary, and was bailed to appear at the Kyneton Magistrates Court on February 4. But he probably got off lucky. In 2015, VICE penned a brief history of people getting stuck in chimneys and dying. One such case a few years ago saw an attempted burglar getting lodged in a chimney and dying a torturous death when the homeowner unwittingly lit a fire beneath him.

BENJAMIN NORMAN and MATTHEW SEDACCA,"Despite being crammed alongside 27,000 others per square mile, New Yorkers have a surprisingly hard time meeting people living less than 10 feet from their doormats. Benjamin Norman knows this well because he is one of them.
Youre pretty much moving every year or two, Mr. Norman, 31, a photographer who has moved within the city eight times in the past 13 years, said. It makes it hard to develop new relationships with your neighbors or anything like that.
For Mr. Norman, change followed from disaster: This past summer, over a year after moving to Bushwick, Mr. Norman injured his back and wound up spending a month cooped up in his apartment. During these weeks of isolation, Mr. Norman missed seeing his neighbors outside the Mr. Kiwis grocery store or grabbing coffee from the deli on his way to the Myrtle-Broadway subway stop. He resolved to connect with them after he had healed.
Somehow, bringing a camera to capture the community made his mission more convincing, at least to some people.
A largely working-class Latino neighborhood, Bushwick has earned a reputation lately as ground zero for hipsterdom and gentrification, said Mr. Norman, who grew up in the New Jersey suburbs. But most people were happy to be photographed, he said, and were not people that looked like me.
There is silver-haired Evelyn Rueda, zooming down Troutman Street on her cherry red scooter, bagged groceries in tow; and Helena, known around the block as the candy lady, who might stop you to swap a red-and-white peppermint from the doctors office in exchange for 25 cents, no further questions asked.
The social scene is wherever you look. At Enriques Unisex Hair Salon, you can find Celeste Ramos and Wendy Sanchez and the rest of staff, who will cut your hair while regulars wolf down their sandwiches from across the street; and dont forget the M train platforms, where packed crowds and groans tend to follow delay announcements.","Benjamin Norman has moved in New York 8 times in the past 13 years, never knowing his neighbors.

MICHAEL TACKETT,"Mr. Long said Peter Gaynor, the deputy administrator, would serve as acting administrator.
Mr. Long earned plaudits for FEMAs response to Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana in 2017. Assessing the damage in Texas, President Trump praised Mr. Long as a man who really has become very famous on television in the last couple of days.
But he came under withering criticism for FEMAs handling of relief efforts after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico later that year, including a call last month from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a candidate for president, for Mr. Long to resign.
Hurricane Maria eventually caused almost 3,000 deaths and left thousands without electricity for months, and Hurricane Harvey killed nearly 70 people. Those storms combined with others in 2017 caused an estimated $300 billion in damage.
Mr. Long came to Washington with a strong reputation for skilled handling of disaster management, and White House officials often praised his professionalism. But that standing was undercut by the inspector generals report, which noted that Mr. Long had also used a government vehicle for personal purposes while on a family vacation in Hawaii.
The FEMA administrator is supposed to be focused on preparing for disasters like the devastating hurricanes that killed thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands not using government vehicles to shuttle his family around Hawaii at taxpayer expense, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who was the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and is now its chairman, said when the report was released.","Brock Long, right, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, in South Carolina after Hurricane Florence last year with President Trump and Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary.",2019-02-14T00:02:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Brock Long, FEMA Administrator, Resigns After Two Turbulent Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/brock-long-fema.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/arts/14DC-FEMA/14DC-FEMA-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
GLENN THRUSH and MAGGIE HABERMAN,"By midmorning, Mr. Trump was said to be weighing his options about how to proceed with the deal the conference committee came up with. One person familiar with his thinking described him as frustrated by months of Republicans not doing what he hoped to see done at the border.
Mr. Trump was weighing whether to sign the current deal, and then take either an executive action to reprogram dollars or even declare a national emergency, knowing both will end up in court, or ask for a yearlong stopgap spending bill that might not even clear the Senate.
One person close to the president said conservatives saw the conference committee deal as a capitulation by the Republican leadership, one that has put Mr. Trump in a difficult spot.
A few weeks ago, in a meeting with restrictionist immigration group leaders, Mr. Trump faulted the former Speaker Paul D. Ryan for not repeatedly deferring action on the wall, with promises of doing it down the road. Now hes out fishing! Mr. Trump declared, according to an attendee.
Under the complex funding formula in the agreement, officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the parent department of ICE, would have reprogramming authority to transfer as much as $750 million from other Homeland Security programs into the detention program.
In short, there is more than enough flexibility for ICE to respond to any forthcoming surges in illegal immigrations and apprehensions, the documents authors wrote.
Two Democratic aides with direct knowledge of the deal said the Republican memo was accurate in theory, but added that such a dramatic expansion in the number of beds was unlikely because it would require taking funds from other important D.H.S. programs, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agencys disaster relief funds.","Democrats claimed victory on Monday in their push to constrain immigrant roundups, but details of the tentative agreement appear to give the Trump administration leeway on detentions.",2019-02-12T17:12:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Democrats Lose on Detention Beds as Trump Mulls Options on Border Deal,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/politics/shutdown-border-wall-deal.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/13/us/politics/13dc-trump/13dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
MICHELLE GOLDBERG,"As Roe is weakened, conservative states are becoming more conservative, liberal states more liberal. Mutual antagonism is increasing around abortion, as it is around nearly everything else. If Roe is overturned altogether, it wont just be a disaster for womens health care and autonomy. It will further rip America apart.
Seeing Roe endangered, the anti-abortion movement has become more legislatively audacious. So-called heartbeat bills, which ban abortion at around six weeks gestation, before some women know theyre pregnant, used to be a rarity. Before this year, only two states had tried to enact six-week abortion bans, North Dakota in 2013 and Iowa in 2018. (Courts struck both laws down.) But in the first weeks of 2019, Mississippi and Kentucky passed such laws, and in addition to Georgia, six-week bans are moving forward in Missouri, Tennessee and Ohio.
Any of these laws could give the Supreme Court a chance to overturn Roe. As that possibility comes into view, anti-abortion lawmakers are showing us what a post-Roe world might look like. Another bill introduced in Georgia, also supported by Governor Kemp, would ban abortion if Roe were overturned, and make the offense of criminal abortion punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bills language appears to apply to pregnant women as well as doctors. 
So-called trigger laws, abortion bans that would go into effect if Roe is struck down, arent new. But according to Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion-rights group Naral, proposals laying out prison terms for women who terminate their pregnancies are unusual.
This is not your grandmothers anti-choice movement, which was bad enough, Hogue said. This is Trumps anti-choice movement. The bills have a sort of Trumpy cruelty to them that is relatively new.",Members of the Handmaid Coalition of Georgia protesting legislation that would ban most abortions after six weeks.,2019-03-29T10:00:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Abortion Divide Gets Deeper,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/opinion/abortion-heartbeat-ban-georgia.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/opinion/29goldWeb/29goldWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
Alexis R. Santos-Lozada,"A woman tries to walks out from her house after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Salinas, Puerto Rico, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins The official death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is 64, but transparency organizations estimate the real total is much higher. One estimate puts the count at 1,085. The discrepancy may be a result of how local officials tally deaths. ""If you don't get away from those areas, you are going to die."" That phrase concluded Puerto Rico Secretary of Public Safety Héctor Pesquera's press conference before Hurricane Maria. Three months after the storm, he is one of the fiercest protectors of the official death count. As of Dec. 29, the Department of Public Safety had certified 64 deaths due to Hurricane Maria. However, estimates reported by CNN, The New York Times and others tell a very different story. I was part of the team of demographers that developed the first independent estimates of excess deaths, with the objective of informing the public. Like the estimates published by those media outlets, our numbers contrasted significantly with the official figure. The most shocking results from our study suggest that deaths in September and October were 25 percent above the historical patterns – with about 1,085 added deaths following the hurricane. Determining the number of excess deaths after a natural disaster is not only a mathematical exercise. Undercounting deaths reduces the attention to the crisis Puerto Ricans live day by day. It can also delay international recovery efforts and the approval of policies to help those who need it the most. The Conversation Causes of death Our study compared preliminary data from the Department of Public Safety with historical patterns for the same months in the past decade. In other words, we compared the number of deaths in September and October last year with data from the same period of time in 2010 to 2016. This is how we concluded that there were 1,085 extra deaths, in excess of historical ranges. So why are more than 1,000 deaths missing from the official count? My colleagues and I suspect it may come down to how deaths are recorded by government officials. In Puerto Rico, deaths are recorded using international classifications. This system doesn't capture all of the circumstances surrounding a death that happens following a natural disaster. The death may have been accelerated by some conditions – like difficulty communicating during the emergency. Deaths associated with a particular natural disaster can be classified as direct or indirect deaths. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, direct deaths are those ""directly attributable to the forces of the disaster or by the direct consequences of these forces, such as structural collapse, flying debris or radiation exposure."" ""Indirect deaths"" may be associated with any unsafe or unhealthy conditions before, during and after the natural disaster. For example, Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. So, someone whose life depended on a dialysis machine would no longer be able to use one. In official certificates, their death would be classified as kidney-related and not attributed to the hurricane – even though the death was accelerated by lack of resources required by the patient to stay alive. The same would happen to someone whose life depended on respiratory aid. Their death would be classified as pulmonary-related. Or, say a person feels chest pain and suspects a heart attack. Their immediate reaction might be to call 911. A working communications structure may be able to get help in time and save a life. But in the days following Hurricane Maria, only 25 percent of the cellphone towers were working. Communication was virtually impossible. Under the international system, a death resulting from these circumstances would be classified as a result of a cardiovascular conditions, and would not be attributed to the hurricane either. Revising the death count Ruby Rodriguez, 8, looks back at her mother as she wades across the San Lorenzo Morovis river with her family, since the bridge was swept away by Hurricane Maria, in Morovis, Puerto Rico. Gerald Herbert/AP In light of the mounting evidence, Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rosselló has ordered a review of the causes of death for those who died after Hurricane Maria. The review is a step in the right direction. But will the official count change? Probably not. As of today, the government is requiring families to visit the Department of Public Safety and to report if a death was related to Hurricane Maria. But merely revising the causes of death is not enough to determine whether that death was indirectly related to Hurricane Maria. Those in charge of the death count review will need to interview families and ask them about the conditions surrounding the tragedy. Following the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the CDC published guidelines that state and territorial governments should follow to determine if a death is related or not to a specific event. Following these guidelines could provide the government of Puerto Rico with a more realistic death count. It remains to be seen if the new count will follow this protocol. An accurate death count could be used to inform policies, supplement requests for aid in the national and international context and inform local governments as they prepare for future natural disasters that may impact Puerto Rico, particularly extreme weather events now that climate change is expected to worsen. Hurricane Maria was the first storm to destroy the power grid in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is six months away from the next hurricane season and experts predict it will be an active one. Finally, minimized figures could weaken efforts to provide relief to communities affected by the hurricane at the local and international level. Given that Puerto Rico does not hold political power in Congress, and that the only representative does not vote, it's crucial to convey the reality to all elected officials, so that their votes align with the necessities of those who are still in Puerto Rico.","REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins The official death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is 64, but transparency organizations estimate the real total is much higher.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionRescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide
Senior Brazilian politicians have called for Vale SA to be held to account for last week's dam disaster, as anger grows towards the mining firm.
Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said those to blame should be punished, and a top prosecutor said executives could be held personally responsible.
Vale, which owns the complex, says safety procedures were followed. 
Firefighters say 60 people are now confirmed dead after a sea of mud engulfed a canteen and nearby houses.
Nearly 300 are still missing, and rescuers say they are very unlikely to find more survivors.
No-one was rescued alive on Sunday near the south-eastern town of Brumadinho.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 In some areas the mud is up to 15m deep
The cause of the dam burst remains unclear. 
Shares in Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer, fell by more than 20% on the Sao Paulo stock exchange on Monday.
Search operations were suspended for hours on Sunday amid fears that a separate dam, also owned by Vale, was at risk of giving way in the area.
What is being said about Vale?
Vice-President Hamilton Mourao, who is standing in for President Jair Bolsonaro as he undergoes surgery, said the government would need to investigate and punish those found responsible for the disaster.
He added that the government would set up a working group to look at the company's management.
""If there was malpractice, recklessness or negligence on the part of someone inside the company, that person has to answer criminally,"" O Globo website quoted him as saying.
Meanwhile top prosecutor Raquel Dodge said it was important to hold the company ""strongly responsible"".
The comments came after state prosecutors said they had frozen a total of 11bn reais ($2.9bn; £2.2bn) of assets belonging to Vale.
Brumadinho Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos has also criticised authorities in the state of Minas Gerais, which he blamed for poor oversight.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Rescue efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to areas hit
What does the company say?
In a television interview, Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the disaster had happened even after the company followed safety recommendations by international experts.
""I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,"" he said. 
Mr Schvartsman promised ""to go above and beyond any national or international standards... We'll create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again.""
On Sunday the company suspended payouts to shareholders and executive bonuses.
What is the latest on the search effort?
Firefighters said 292 employees, contractors and residents were still missing. Some 192 people have been rescued alive.
So far 19 of the 60 dead have been identified.
""After 48 hours of work, the chance of finding [someone] alive is very low,"" Col Eduardo Angelo, who is leading the search operation, told relatives of the missing.
""[But] we're working with the possibility that we'll find people alive.""
The dam break caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads.
Access to the areas is difficult - in some places, the mud is up to 15m (49ft) deep. Search teams have been using helicopters and earth-moving machinery. 
""I still have hope,"" Nélia Mary Fonseca told the BBC as she waited for details about her husband, Adriano, who worked as a contractor at the site.
An Israeli group of engineers, doctors and members of the navy's underwater missions unit has joined the efforts. 
Has this kind of thing happened before?
Unlike dams used for water, tailings dams - like that in Brumadinho - are used to store by-products from mining operations. 
There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailings dams in recent years - and there have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations around them. 
In November 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 19 people in what was considered Brazil's worst environmental disaster at the time. 
After a lengthy court case, the companies reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage The presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey are holding a key summit in Tehran that could decide the fate of Syria's last major rebel stronghold. There are fears of a humanitarian disaster if, as expected, a large-scale battle breaks out in Idlib. Earlier, the new US envoy for Syria said there was ""evidence"" that Syrian government forces were preparing to use chemical weapons. Fresh air strikes on rebel positions were reported on Friday morning. Iran, Russia and Turkey have played central roles in the Syrian conflict. Turkey - which has long backed rebel groups - fears an all-out assault will trigger another huge refugee crisis on its southern border. Russia and Iran - which have provided vital support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - believe the rebels in Idlib must be wiped out. Russian planes have bombed rebel areas in the north-western region as Syrian government troops mass for the expected offensive. The US envoy, Jim Jeffrey, said the anticipated conflict would be a ""reckless escalation"", Reuters reported. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Improvised gas masks are being tried out in Idlib ahead of the expected offensive ""I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings,"" Mr Jeffrey said in his first interview since being appointed. ""Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation. There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied ever using chemical weapons. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies. Despite Syrian denials, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said they are confident government forces were behind an attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017 that killed more than 80 people. Image copyright AFP Image caption The population of Idlib has been swollen by refugees from other parts of Syria Mr Jeffrey said a ""major diplomatic initiative"" was now needed to end the seven-year civil war. He said there was ""a new commitment"" by President Donald Trump to remain involved in Syria until the Islamic State group (IS) was defeated and to ensure that Iranian fighters - who are supporting the Syrian authorities in the conflict - leave the country. Mr Jeffrey said President Assad had ""no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not Washington's job to oust him. He said the US would work with Russia on a political transition. There are believed to be up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters in Idlib. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go.

But the debate over Open Casket and a subsequent controversy over the Walker Art Centers handling of Scaffold, by the artist Sam Durant, which evoked in part the hanging of 38 Dakota Indian men in Minnesota in 1862 raised challenging questions for the exhibition of art in museums and elsewhere: Who has the right to tell certain stories, empathetically or not? Is it appropriate when a white artist recasts one of the most influential images of all time Tills mutilated body or is it cultural appropriation?
(Ms. Schutz said her painting was not of the historic photograph but has more to do with other paintings, including Ben Shahns The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti, a work of social protest from 1931-32.)
Even Ms. Schutzs ardent fans, including Gary Garrels, the senior curator for painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art who called her an exceptional colorist said the debate was a wake-up call for the art world, adding that the salient question for an artist now was, To what degree do you take for granted your own perspective?","Dana Schutz at her art studio in Brooklyn in December with “Treadmill,” left, and “Boatman,” right.

NICHOLAS FANDOS,"Congress did not originally intend to give the president this recourse when it enacted the law during the post-Watergate reform era that has governed how and when presidents may invoke emergency-power statutes. 
But the Supreme Court struck down what it calls legislative vetoes in 1983, ruling that for a congressional act to take legal effect, it must be presented to the president for signature or veto. Because it takes two-thirds of both chambers to override a veto, the ruling made it substantially harder for Congress to stop a presidents declaration.
This is the crucial question. Half a dozen or so Republicans made their disapproval of an emergency declaration clear on Thursday.
I dont believe that the National Emergencies Act contemplated a president repurposing billions of dollars outside the normal appropriations process, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. I also believe it will be challenged in court and is of dubious constitutionality.
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and an ally to the president on other issues, said a national emergency declaration of this sort ran counter to the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, agreed.
My view is that this is better to be resolved through the legislative process, he said.
Still, it is highly unlikely that Democrats can pick up enough Republican supporters in the House or the Senate to override Mr. Trumps likely veto. The best case for the presidents opponents is that they show deep fissures among Republicans over the wall. 
They could also try to build bipartisan support for legislation preventing Mr. Trump from drawing money for the wall from funds allocated by Congress for disaster relief.","Congress has tools to override the president’s declaration, but opponents most likely do not have the votes to overcome a veto.",2019-02-15T01:48:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Will Declare a National Emergency.

Jeffrey Toobin,"Al Green cuts a distinctive figure around the Capitol. He is, for starters, the only male member of the House of Representatives with a ponytail. He expresses himself with a kind of baroque humility; to the question “How are you?” he invariably responds, “Better than I deserve.” (Elaborating, if asked, he says that he is a “recovering sinner.”) He is unusual, too, because, while most politicians call attention to their triumphs and hide their failures, Green reserves a place of honor in his congressional office for two reminders of crushing, if perhaps temporary, legislative defeats. Last year, Green—who, since 2005, has represented a district centered on Houston—sponsored the first vote in the House of Representatives on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. On December 6th, the House rejected Green’s initiative to bring impeachment up for debate by a vote of 364–58. The following month, the House rejected a similar attempt by Green, this time by a vote of 355–66. Notwithstanding the lopsided results, Green has placed copies of each of the resolutions in portfolios embossed with the gold seal of the House. The December resolution is paired with a list of the members who voted for it—they are called “ THE FIRST 58.” The January resolution faces a page containing the names of its supporters, who are called “ THE HISTORIC 66.” Green sent identical copies of the portfolios to all the congressmen who voted with him. Green, a Democrat, never supported Trump, although he also never imagined that he would be advocating his forced removal from office. “I didn’t come to Congress to impeach a President,” he told me. “I came to Congress to negotiate the issues that I grew up with—poverty, housing—for the least, the last, and the lost.” But Green began contemplating Trump’s removal when the President fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director, in May, 2017. Three months later, when Trump equated white-supremacist protesters in Charlottesville with those who had rallied against them, Green decided to take formal action: “That’s when I realized he was unfit to be President. He was converting his bigotry into American policy.” When the resolution came up for a vote, he said, “I did not lobby anyone, because, quite frankly, it’s a question of conscience.” He pressed for the second vote after Trump referred to Haiti and other predominantly black nations as “shithole countries.” Green understood that his call for impeachment was symbolic, but he expressed satisfaction with the number of votes he received—nearly a third of the Democratic members of the House. “I concluded if but one person voted for this article, this would be the right thing,” he said. “And we are not finished.” Today, the impeachment of Donald Trump exists on the brink of plausibility. The sine qua non of an impeachment investigation, to say nothing of actual votes to charge and remove the President, is a Democratic takeover of the House in the November elections. Such a change now looks better than possible, maybe even probable. At the same time, the President appears to be in ever-greater legal peril from dual investigations, one led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, and the other by federal prosecutors in New York. In April, F.B.I. agents raided the offices of Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, and removed telephones and business records. Cohen has not been charged with a crime, but the prospect of a case against him, with the chance that he might plead guilty and reveal everything he knows, represents a substantial risk for the President. In Washington, Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national-security adviser, and Rick Gates, who worked on Trump’s campaign and in his White House, have both already pleaded guilty to charges brought by Mueller and agreed to coöperate with his investigation. The full extent of Mueller’s findings is not known, raising the possibility that more legal and political damage to the President is yet to come. While Rudolph Giuliani, Trump’s attorney, may or may not be correct that Mueller believes he lacks the legal authority to indict the President, the possibility of impeachment clearly exists—if Congress has the evidence, and the will, to proceed. Trump supporters seem to welcome a fight over the issue. “If the Democrats move for impeachment, I think they are playing right into the hands of the President,” Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s former White House communications director, told me. “He doesn’t have Richard Nixon’s attention span or his O.C.D. about record-keeping. There are no e-mails or tapes. He didn’t do anything wrong on Russia, so he’ll be exonerated.” Scaramucci added, “You are dealing with a human Pac-Man. He’s the toughest son of a bitch I’ve ever met in my life.” Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the Newsmax Web site, who sees the President regularly at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, told me, “The guy loves a fight and will see this one as easily winnable.” Republicans believe a push for impeachment would likely be a disaster for the Democrats in the midterms. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former top strategist, told me, “Anger and fear drive off-year elections, and we are going to talk about how the Democrats want to shut us up by impeaching Trump when they couldn’t beat him in 2016. People are talking about the Republicans losing forty seats in the House, but if we make the election a referendum on impeachment we could break even or pick up a few.” Opposition to impeachment seems to be a rare point of agreement between Trump’s followers and the leadership of the Democratic Party. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, told me, “I don’t like to talk about impeachment.” She explained, “Impeachment is not a political tool. It has to be based on just the law and the facts. When I was Speaker, people wanted me to impeach George Bush for the war in Iraq because it was based on false information, but you can’t just go from one impeachment to the next. When we are in the majority, we are going to try to be unifying, and there is no way to do impeachment in a bipartisan way right now.” The numbers back up Pelosi’s wariness. According to a Quinnipiac University poll taken in April, fifty-two per cent of American voters oppose impeachment. Another poll from around the same time reported that forty-seven per cent would definitely vote against a candidate who wanted to remove Trump from office. (In a sign of how divided the country is, forty-two per cent would definitely vote for a candidate who made such a promise.) Still, a powerful grassroots movement has formed in support of impeachment, a political cousin of sorts to the recent pushes for women’s rights and gun control. According to Quinnipiac, seventy-one per cent of Democrats already favor impeachment. To proponents, a nearly fifty-fifty split among the voting public at this early date, before Mueller has reported his findings, is significant. In primaries for the 2018 elections, some prominent Democrats, such as Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, who is running for governor, made support for impeachment a major part of their platforms. Tom Steyer, a San Francisco billionaire, has since last year been running television advertisements supporting impeachment, and has generated a mailing list of more than 5.2 million people. Steyer is now on a thirty-city speaking tour. For the moment, he and his followers are outcasts from the Washington consensus. But their passion, and the mounting evidence against the President, raises the question of whether the drive for impeachment is more likely to result in Trump’s removal from office or in a Democratic civil war. For roughly the first two centuries of the American republic, there was an informal taboo on advocating for impeachment, even among a President’s most outspoken critics. Only one Presidential impeachment proceeding occurred during this period: in 1868, Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House but remained in office after being acquitted in the Senate by a single vote. The nominal ground for impeachment involved his dismissal of a member of his Cabinet, but impeachment cases are always about the politics of the moment as much as the evidence before Congress. Johnson’s case represented a final act of the Civil War. Though he was Abraham Lincoln’s Vice-President and successor, Johnson was a Democrat, and he resisted the Republican Reconstruction in the South. Republicans used impeachment as a form of revenge, which only reinforced the taboo. Today, that taboo has faded. An investigation of Trump would follow Richard Nixon’s forced resignation, on the brink of impeachment, in 1974, and Bill Clinton’s impeachment and acquittal, in 1998-99. “The reason we are seeing more demands for impeachment is the rise in partisanship. Our partisan divisions now are not just sharp but among the sharpest in American history,” Michael Gerhardt, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law and the author of “The Federal Impeachment Process,” the leading treatise on the subject, said. “These divisions are then taken out on the President with calls for impeachment, which is an extreme measure and appeals to people who have extreme positions.” In Congress, there’s a surprisingly vigorous impeachment lobby expanding on the work that Al Green began. Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee and the ranking member of the Constitution and Civil Justice subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, has fleshed Green’s bare-bones proposal out into a full impeachment resolution. Cohen’s indictment has five counts. The first charges Trump with obstruction of justice, based largely on Comey’s account of how the President tried to restrain the Russia investigation and then fired Comey when he would not oblige. The second count, referring to Trump’s business interests, including his hotels, asserts that he violated the foreign-emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officeholders from receiving payments from foreign governments. In a similar vein, the third count asserts that Trump directed federal money to his businesses and hotels domestically. The fourth count charges him with abuse of power for his criticisms of federal judges and for his pardon of Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, in Arizona. The final count claims that Trump undermined the First Amendment by repeatedly attacking the news media. Like Green, Cohen is aware that there is not yet a consensus in favor of impeachment, even among Democrats, but he is determined to plow ahead. “It’s a moral decision to do the right thing, regardless of the politics,” he told me. “Sometimes going on the record against evil may not make you effective at first in stopping evil, but it can still contribute in ways you don’t know.” Jamie Raskin, a first-term Democrat from Maryland who was recently named vice-chair of the Judiciary Committee, told me, “It’s hard to think of a more impeachable President in American history.” As the only constitutional-law professor who is a voting member of Congress—he teaches at the law school of American University—Raskin has been adding intellectual heft to the impeachment effort. “By firing Comey and waging war on the special counsel, Trump has become the master of obstructing justice,” he told me. “I have a thick notebook of obstruction-of-justice episodes.” He listed, among other things, Trump’s threats against Attorney General Jeff Sessions; Rod Rosenstein, Sessions’s deputy; and Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the F.B.I. Raskin said, “It’s only because we’re waist-deep in the Trump era that we forget how completely radical and beyond the pale it is to have the President directly threatening the people who are involved in a criminal investigation of him.” Raskin told me that the foreign-emoluments clause “doesn’t get enough play, because it’s unfamiliar, and it’s unfamiliar because no other President ever came close to violating it before. But Trump has turned the federal government into a money-making operation, which is just what the Framers feared.” Raskin cited the many foreign guests with business interests before the Administration who have stayed at the Trump International Hotel, in Washington, as well as the business deals conducted by the President’s sons overseas. He also pointed to a prohibition in the domestic-emoluments clause against government payments to Presidents beyond their salaries. “We’ve had the Secret Service and other agencies spend millions of dollars at Trump hotels and resorts already,” he said. But Raskin also injected a note of caution. “Most of my constituents regard impeachment in a very practical way,” he told me. “They all see Trump as eminently deserving of impeachment, but they don’t want it to become a fetish if it’s not going anywhere.” Any initial investigation of impeachment would fall to the House Judiciary Committee, and its chairman, in a Democratic Congress, would be Jerrold Nadler, from New York. Donald Trump and Jerry Nadler represent contrasting New York archetypes—the rapacious developer and the woolly-headed liberal. Not surprisingly, the two men have a history. They first clashed more than three decades ago, when Trump proposed a vast development on an old rail yard on Manhattan’s West Side. Nadler was born in Brooklyn in 1947 and educated at Stuyvesant, the selective public high school, where his campaign for student-council president was managed by Dick Morris, the future Clinton-era political Svengali. After graduating from Columbia, Nadler thrived in the political hothouse that was the West Side in those days. In his twenties, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, and he attended Fordham’s law school at night. Nadler’s district included the site of a Trump project, which was originally called Television City because the centerpiece would be a hundred-and-fifty-story building that would serve as a new headquarters for NBC. As a courtesy, Trump invited Nadler to his office in Trump Tower to show him the plans. “I thought it was grotesque,” Nadler recalled recently. Trump told Nadler that the tower would be residential above the first forty floors, and mentioned the Hancock Center, in Chicago, which is a hundred stories tall. “He says, ‘Do you know that the people on the top floors of the Hancock Center, before they go out in the morning, they call the concierge desk to ask what the weather is, because they’re above the clouds, they can’t really see it?’ I’m thinking, What a drag, but he’s getting excited about this,” Nadler said. Nadler asked whether Trump intended to live on the hundred-and-fiftieth floor of the new building, and Trump replied that he did. “And I realized what this was all about,” Nadler said. “He wanted to be the highest man in the world.” The battle over Television City— later renamed Trump City and finally known as Riverside South—became a multi-decade epic, even after the hundred-and-fifty-story building was scrapped. (NBC decided to keep its headquarters at Rockefeller Center.) Nadler helped lead the opposition, and continued to do so after he was elected to Congress, in 1992. He made sure that Trump did not receive federal mortgage guarantees for the project, costing the developer millions, and he also stopped the removal of an elevated highway, which would have increased the value of Trump’s condominiums. Riverside South is now mostly completed, on a much diminished scale. Trump’s interest was sold in 2005. But the dynamic of Trump and Nadler’s relationship was set. In his book “The America We Deserve,” published in 2000, Trump called Nadler “one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.” Nadler turned seventy last June, and his political views, while emphatically liberal, now hew closer to Pelosi’s than to Al Green’s. This is particularly true on the question of an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi told me that Nadler is “a champion for civil liberties and civil rights. He will have a long agenda as chairman, and impeachment is the least of it—despite what his constituents, and my constituents, probably want.” Nadler voted against both of Green’s impeachment resolutions. “If you’re going to remove the President from office, you are in effect in one sense nullifying the last election,” he told me. “What you don’t want are recriminations for the next twenty years—‘We won the election,’ ‘You stole it.’ And to do that you have to have a situation where some appreciable fraction—not a majority, but an appreciable fraction—of the people on the other side will grudgingly admit by the end of the proceedings that ‘Yeah, they really had to do it.’ ” As Nadler acknowledges, there is not only an absence of an appreciable fraction of Republicans in the House supporting impeachment, there isn’t a single Republican who does. He believes that any chance of bipartisan impeachment is extremely remote in the current political environment, at least barring the discovery of overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing. “The fact that someone has committed an impeachable offense doesn’t always mean that you should impeach him,” he said. I asked Nadler if he meant that the House should impeach only if two-thirds of the Senate was going to vote to remove the President. Not necessarily, he said: “An impeachment, even if it’s not successful in the sense of removing the President from office, may in fact be necessary and successful at saying, in effect, ‘You have violated the constitutional order, you are threatening the constitutional order, you will stop threatening the constitutional order. You will stop threatening the rule of law.’ ” Nadler was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the Clinton impeachment hearings, in 1998. He emerged as an outspoken opponent of impeachment, and several of the arguments he deployed are eerily similar to those which Trump’s defenders have used. Nadler was a strident critic of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, and he demanded audits of what he regarded as Starr’s excessive spending in the course of the investigation. Nadler described the case against Clinton as based on the Republicans’ general distaste for the President rather than on any specific acts of wrongdoing. “It showed that a determined majority in the House could impeach a President without legitimate reason,” Nadler said. The experience also taught him that the public can exact a cost on the party that brings a failed or unjustified impeachment. The Judiciary Committee held its impeachment hearings in the weeks just before the 1998 midterms, and on Election Day the Democrats reversed the usual fate of a party in its sixth year of control of the Presidency by gaining five seats. Nadler said that the Republicans “lost seats with the impeachment pending, and they lost seats because people disapproved of it and they went ahead with it anyway.” The purported lessons of the Clinton impeachment haunt the Trump investigation, even though the cast of characters in Congress has almost completely turned over in the two intervening decades. Of the thirty-seven members of the Judiciary Committee in 1998, just seven remain—four Republicans (Bob Goodlatte, the current chairman, Jim Sensenbrenner, Lamar Smith, and Steve Chabot) and three Democrats (Nadler, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Zoe Lofgren). Goodlatte and Smith are retiring at the end of their current terms. (Abbe Lowell, who was the lead lawyer for Judiciary Committee Democrats in the Clinton inquiry, is now in private practice and represents Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law.) The Clinton impeachment also played a role in Nadler’s campaign, last year, to become the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Democrats generally choose their committee leaders based on seniority. Even though Nadler was the longest-tenured Democrat, he was challenged for the leadership by Zoe Lofgren, who represents a district in Silicon Valley. Part of Lofgren’s pitch was her experience on the impeachment question. Not only did Lofgren, like Nadler, serve on the committee in 1998; she was also a young staffer for Representative Don Edwards in 1974, when she worked on the impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon. For Lofgren, the Nixon example looms large. “The American people at some kind of gut level understand the constitutional system,” she told me. “When a President lied about having an affair with a young woman, that was gross behavior, and the lie was arguably unlawful, but it had nothing to do with government. With Nixon, having an enemies list and using the elements of the federal government to destroy your enemies was about the abuse of government power. People got that. By the time the committee voted to impeach, in 1974, the country was on board.” In the nineteen-seventies there was also a core of moderate Republicans open to considering the evidence against Nixon. Seven of the seventeen Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted for at least one article of impeachment. Not a single Democrat on the committee voted in favor of Clinton’s impeachment. Even Republicans who voted for Clinton’s impeachment now regard it as, at best, a mixed success. Steve Chabot, who represents a district in Cincinnati, said, “If the Democrats go in that direction, they are likely to learn a lesson that we learned in 1998. Even if the country starts out with you, they get sick of the process pretty quickly.” Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who was a member of the Judiciary Committee in 1998, has an even more negative view. “It blew up in our faces and helped President Clinton,” he said. “If Democrats keep up what they’re doing, the whole thing will just be shirts and skins—Democrats versus Republicans—and that’s a no-win when it comes to impeachment. It has to be bipartisan, or it’s going to be a failure.” Indeed, the fervor for impeachment among some on the left is nearly matched by the passion against it on the right—an ardor that conservatives are more than happy to exploit, especially leading up to the midterm elections. Trump has taken up the cause, telling a rally in Michigan, in April, “We have to keep the House, because if we listen to Maxine Waters she’s going around saying, ‘We will impeach him.’ ” (Waters, a California congresswoman and a favorite target of Trump’s, voted in favor of Al Green’s resolutions.) Republicans in competitive races are also raising the alarm. “There is no doubt that impeachment will be a critical issue in November for Democrats and for Republicans,” Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, who is facing an unexpectedly serious challenge from Beto O’Rourke, a Democratic congressman, told me. “There is right now enormous energy on the far left. They hate the President. They are consumed with Trump derangement syndrome.” He continued, “For many on the right, and many in the middle, not having the country consumed by impeachment proceedings and not seeing us lose the progress the country has made under President Trump is also a powerful motivator.” Cruz doesn’t believe Pelosi’s statements that she does not currently support impeachment. “If the Democrats take over the House, on the day Nancy Pelosi is sworn in to office, that’s the day impeachment proceedings begin,” he said. “The passion on the left is too great.” The Democratic leadership continues to insist otherwise. Nadler eventually defeated Lofgren in a vote by the full Democratic caucus in the House, 118–72. Their differences haven’t proven especially divisive, and they are by and large in accord on the issue of impeachment. As Lofgren put it, “We have a sense of history and obligation, though that might not be exciting to the liberal base.” On a pleasant Tuesday night in May, the liberal base in Des Moines showed up early at an event space near downtown. An hour before Tom Steyer was to conduct what he called a town meeting in support of Trump’s impeachment, more than a hundred people had lined up outside, waiting to be admitted. “This President has failed his most important responsibility—protecting our country,” Steyer says in one of his cable-news commercials. “The first question is Why? What is in his and his family’s business dealings with Russia that he is so determined to hide that he would betray our country? And the second question is Why is he still President?” Thanks to the advertisements, as well as appeals on Facebook, Steyer’s self-funded operation, called NeedToImpeach.com, has drawn millions of supporters. In Des Moines, more than four hundred people turned up, filling the room to overflowing. “I go to political events in Iowa all the time,” Pat Rynard, who runs a Web site on local politics called Iowa Starting Line, said as he watched the crowd stream in. “The people here are not the people who usually go to political events in Iowa. This is more people than the Democratic candidates for governor draw for their rallies. He’s mobilizing a whole new group.” Through sheer force of personality—and about forty million dollars of his own money—Steyer has become the public face of the movement to impeach Trump. He has forty full-time staffers, and on his national tour he conducts town meetings, talks to local news media, and raises his own profile. (By political standards, the town halls are lavish affairs, with top-notch production values. The Des Moines event featured what caterers call “heavy” hors d’œuvres for everyone.) Steyer’s town halls, which last about an hour, begin with a presentation of one of the latest impeachment commercials, after which Steyer gives brief remarks—lasting about ten minutes—and then takes questions from the audience. The curious thing about his event in Des Moines was that it didn’t have much to do with impeachment. In his opening comments, he mentioned that he had eight grounds for impeachment, though he didn’t identify them. (They are spelled out on his Web site, and are basically an expanded version of the five counts in Representative Cohen’s resolution.) He also mentioned, but didn’t name, a group of legal scholars who support his campaign, and he did the same for a group of psychiatrists who asserted, in a panel discussion he hosted, that Trump is unfit for the Presidency, as well as a “dangerous, unstable, and deteriorating person.” Steyer, who is sixty, made his name in politics raising money for John Kerry and Barack Obama, and then became a climate-change activist. He has now positioned himself outside traditional political categories. It’s a strategy, albeit with very different goals, that Trump pursued in his political career. Bannon, expressing admiration for Steyer’s tactics, told me, “Steyer is a little bit the Steve Bannon of the left. The Democratic Party has not yet had its civil war. The populist movement on the left has not happened yet, but Steyer sees it coming, sees the anger behind it.” In Steyer’s remarks in Des Moines, he attacked both parties. “The political establishment does not like what we have to say here,” he told the crowd. “They say we are normalizing impeachment. We are not normalizing impeachment. If we ignore what Donald Trump has done, what we’re doing is normalizing his behavior.” Asked at one point about the last election, Steyer said, “Two people won the 2016 election: Bernie Sanders, who is not a Democrat, and Donald Trump, who is not a Republican.” Steyer also funds, to the tune of thirty-two million dollars, a voter-registration project aimed at young people, called NextGen America, that is ostensibly nonpartisan. Steyer is using impeachment much the same way Trump used issues like immigration: to show that he’s with the Party’s base, not with its elders. In our conversations, Steyer showed that he had mastered the politician’s art of ducking the question of whether he’s running for President. “I believe that we are on a disastrous path,” he replied when I asked. “There is an absolute void of explaining to Americans what the real stakes are.” A question from the audience in Des Moines about Steyer’s Presidential ambitions drew a loud cheer from the attendees and a non-denial denial from Steyer. The only state where Steyer’s tour has conducted three events is Iowa, the site of the nation’s first caucuses. Steyer professes to understand the difference between political opposition to a President and support for a President’s removal from office. “We are not impeaching him because we don’t like his tax policy,” Steyer told me. “He is reckless, dangerous, and lawless.” But people at the town hall didn’t worry too much about the fine distinctions, and neither, for the most part, does Steyer. Attendees told me that they wanted Trump removed because he’s racist, because he’s surrounded by unsavory characters, because he doesn’t care about the poor. Jennifer Spradling, a retired preschool teacher, had travelled two hundred and forty miles, from the town of Alton, to hear Steyer speak. Trump “doesn’t seem to have the moral principles and ideals that Presidents have,” she said. “He’s done nothing on health care, on infrastructure.” Several audience members mentioned, as a ground for impeachment, the Washington Post’s running tally of more than three thousand falsehoods that Trump has told since the Inauguration. The one phrase I never heard during the evening in Des Moines was “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Ultimately, every consideration of impeachment returns to the standard established in the Constitution. The words are among the most familiar in the nation’s founding document, even if their meaning has been the subject of two hundred years of debate. Article II states, “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” As in the nineteen-seventies and the nineteen-nineties, the prospect of a Presidential impeachment has spurred renewed academic interest in the subject, resulting in two recent volumes by well-known Harvard law professors. Last year, Cass Sunstein, who served in the Obama Administration, released “Impeachment: A Citizen’s Guide,” and Laurence Tribe, the noted liberal academic and litigator, has just published “To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment,” written with Joshua Matz. Michael Gerhardt is also producing a third edition of his treatise “The Federal Impeachment Process.” The historical record on impeachment, including at the framing of the Constitution, is meagre. There were a few references to it at the Constitutional Convention, and in the debates in the states over ratification the subject came up in a limited way. The Framers recognized that the power to impeach was as much a political issue as a legal one. As Alexander Hamilton put it, in Federalist No. 65, impeachment should apply to “the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.” Hamilton said that high crimes and misdemeanors “are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.” (This quotation was a favorite of Clinton’s defenders in 1998 because it suggested that purely personal misconduct, like lying about an extramarital affair, should not be the basis for impeachment.) Hamilton also anticipated the partisan divisions that impeachment would engender, writing that the process “will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.” In modern terms, one pole in the debate over impeachment was defined by Gerald Ford, during his days as a congressman, when he led a failed attempt to impeach the Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, in 1970, for purportedly improper financial dealings. “An impeachable offense,” Ford said, “is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” At the other extreme from Ford’s almost tautological approach is the claim that only proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a President committed criminal offenses can justify an impeachment. To some, the best distillation of the standard is a report produced by the Judiciary Committee in 1974, on the eve of its debate about the Nixon impeachment. (One of the committee’s staffers was a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham.) The report states clearly that impeachable offenses do not necessarily have to be crimes. Instead, it argues, impeachment should be “a remedy for usurpation or abuse of power or serious breach of trust,” such as “offenses against the government, and especially abuses of constitutional duties.” The emphasis, the authors wrote, “has been on the significant effects of the conduct—undermining the integrity of office, disregard of constitutional duties and oath of office, arrogation of power, abuse of the governmental process, adverse impact on the system of government.” The challenge is to apply these abstract standards to Trump’s alleged misconduct. Any attempt to do so requires an accurate determination of exactly what Trump did, and many are hoping that Mueller will provide that accounting. As Pelosi told me, “Impeachment doesn’t fit into the equation until we hear what Robert Mueller says.” But even some impeachment skeptics are willing to establish markers for Trump’s behavior that would not require findings from Mueller. The most common of these appears to be the firing of Mueller or of Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who supervises Mueller’s work. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, told me that he opposes impeachment at this point, but that if the President deposes either man, it would be grounds for starting proceedings: “That would be encroaching on the independence of the Justice Department.” Barney Frank, the former congressman from Massachusetts who was a key figure in the Clinton debate in 1998, said that he can imagine a scenario in which he would support impeachment. “The President has the power to issue pardons,” Frank told me. “But if it could be proved that Trump promised people pardons in order to persuade them not to coöperate with Mueller, that offer would be an obstruction of justice, and it would be impeachable.” Laurence Tribe told me that he would regard some forms of misbehavior as impeachable, such as “a pattern of abusing the bully pulpit of the Presidency, one of its most potent if informal powers—especially when amplified by social media—to stir division within the electorate to the point of violence, to give permission to white supremacists to weaponize their hatred, and otherwise to undermine the foundations of our republic.” As it happens, in recent years Congress has embraced broad definitions of what constitutes impeachable conduct, albeit in low-profile cases. Applying the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, the House of Representatives has impeached two federal judges. President George H. W. Bush appointed Samuel Kent to the federal bench in Galveston, Texas, in 1990. There, female court employees complained that Kent groped and harassed them. In 2008, a federal grand jury indicted the judge for abusive sexual contact, and he was convicted the following year. The House moved to impeach Kent, and added charges in addition to those for which he had been convicted, including lying about sexual harassment he had committed before he became a judge. The House voted unanimously in favor of three articles of impeachment, and Kent resigned his judgeship before his trial in the Senate. Michael Gerhardt told me, “To the extent that there’s a question about whether Trump actually engaged in sexual assault or has lied about it during the campaign, Kent arguably provides a precedent supporting a congressional judgment that sexual assault may constitute a legitimate basis for impeachment.” The following year, Congress impeached Thomas Porteous, whom Bill Clinton had appointed to the federal bench in Louisiana, in 1994. Porteous had declared personal bankruptcy in 2001, and during that process revealed that he had close ties to a local bail bondsman who was caught up in a federal corruption investigation. Porteous was never charged with a crime, but the disclosures about his situation led to an investigation by the federal judicial administrative office, which determined that Porteous had lied on the financial-disclosure forms he had filed in connection with his nomination. The House voted unanimously to impeach him for “engaging in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a federal judge,” and the Senate removed him from office. As Gerhardt observes, “The gist of the case against Porteous was that he lied about his background in order to get the job. The idea was that he defrauded the Senate, by providing false information, in order to get confirmed for his judgeship.” Although Congress is under no obligation to apply the same definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors” in every impeachment, Gerhardt told me that “the collusion charge against Trump is based on the same idea of a direct connection—that he engaged in misconduct in order to get the job he holds.” Nadler, for his part, declines to set markers for what might trigger an impeachment investigation if he assumes the House Judiciary Committee chairmanship in 2019, although he continues to express indignation at each new disclosure about Trump. He denounced the President’s threats against Mueller and introduced legislation to protect the investigation by the special counsel. He criticized the firing of Andrew McCabe. He sought an investigation of Cambridge Analytica for violating U.S. election regulations. He called for a formal resolution of censure against Trump for his remarks about Charlottesville. None of these proposals went anywhere in the Republican-controlled House. Instead of planning for impeachment, Nadler is thinking about the kinds of oversight investigations he might conduct if he is in control of the committee. “We would want oversight on what the Administration is doing to civil liberties, to institutions, to discredit the courts, to discredit the special prosecutor, to attack the press, all of these things,” he told me. “What are you doing about staffing levels of different places? What are you doing about the things that affect the ability of agencies to do their jobs independent of the political direction of the current Administration?” Still, the chance for Nadler to define his legacy can never be far from his thoughts. For decades, he and his family have been regulars at a diner a few blocks from their apartment on the Upper West Side. When he is in New York, Nadler stops in a few times a week. Each time he does, the owner greets him with the admonition “You gotta impeach the bastard.” ♦","Jeffrey Toobin on the push to remove Donald Trump from office, which may lead to disaster in the midterms.",2018-05-21T09:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newyorker.com'}",Will the Fervor for Impeachment Start a Democratic Civil War?,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/28/will-the-fervor-for-impeachment-start-a-democratic-civil-war,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5afdf527ea55d1047a3d0bb1/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/180528_r32132.gif",,Newyorker.com,1
"Catherine Lucey, Lisa Mascaro and Zeke Miller","WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is considering using billions in unspent disaster relief funds earmarked for areas including hurricane-pounded Puerto Rico and Texas to pay for U.S. President Donald Trump's border wall as he weighs signing a national emergency declaration to get it built without Congress.
The White House has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to comb through its budget, including $13.9 billion in emergency funds that Congress earmarked last year, to see what money could be diverted to the wall as part of a declaration. That's according to a congressional aide and administration official familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
It is the latest sign that the administration is laying the groundwork for a possible emergency order as negotiations between Trump and congressional Democrats to reopen the partially shuttered government have ground to a halt. Trump is demanding billions for his wall that Democrats won't give him. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are missing paychecks Friday.
Trump on Thursday gave his strongest public indication yet that he is leaning toward an emergency declaration as he travelled to the Texas border to continue to press his case for the wall.
Trump told reporters as he left the White House that he was still holding out hope for a deal, but that if it ""doesn't work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.""
The wall was the central promise of Trump's presidential campaign, and supporters of the declaration strategy have been arguing to the president that an emergency declaration is his best option available to end the shutdown, giving him political cover to re-open the government without appearing to cave on the wall. Trump, they argue, then would be able to tell his supporters that he did all he could to fight for the wall, even if his order is stalled or blocked by the courts.
Nearly $14 billion in emergency disaster relief funds have been allocated but not yet obligated through contracts for a variety of projects in states including California, Florida and Texas and in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico that have been ravaged by recent hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, according to the aide familiar with the matter.
The money funds a variety of projects, mostly flood control to prevent future disasters.
A second official with knowledge of the proposal said it would fund construction of about 315 miles (500 kilometres) of border barrier. Right now, barriers blanket about one-third of the 1,954-mile (3,145-kilometre) border with Mexico.
An emergency declaration would draw immediate legal challenge from Democrats, who have accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis at the southern border to justify his wall. Critics have said the move would be an unconstitutional abuse of emergency powers. Trump said Thursday that his lawyers have told him he has the ""absolute right.""
Republican and Democratic lawmakers raised immediate concerns over shifting funds that have already been approved by Congress for projects in states across the nation.
But even some Republican lawmakers uneasy about the idea of pulling money from Army Corps projects saw few alternate options. One said the phone calls coming into his office were overwhelmingly in favour of Trump's border wall.
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has been in conversations with the White House on a trio of legislative alternatives. But he said those options seem less likely now without Democratic backing for some money for Trump's border plan.
Unless Republicans and Democrats compromise, he said, ""I fully expect him to declare a national emergency.""
Meadows, who speaks frequently with Trump, sees the emergency declaration as the ""last tool"" the president has.
""Most conservatives want it to be the last resort he would use,"" Meadows said. ""But those same conservatives, I'm sure, if it's deployed, would embrace him as having done all he could do to negotiate with Democrats.""

AFP,"New York: Boeing announced on Friday it would cut the production schedule of its 737 aircraft line following the two recent crashes that have seen the 737 MAX grounded worldwide.The aerospace giant plans to trim production to 42 planes per month, down from 52 per month, starting in mid-April. 
Boeing shares tumbled after the disclosure, which was released just after the closing bell on Wall Street. 
 Boeing also announced it was establishing an advisory panel to review its company-wide policies for designing and developing planes. 
The Federal Aviation Administration earlier this week said more work was needed before the aerospace giant could even submit a proposed fix that is believed to be a factor in the disasters.Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg described the production cut as temporary and said it would not affect current employment levels for the 737 and related programs.
""We are coordinating closely with our customers as we work through plans to mitigate the impact of this adjustment,"" Muilenburg said in a statement. ""We will also work directly with our suppliers on their production plans to minimise operational disruption and financial impact of the production rate change."" 
Boeing has continued to manufacture 737s since the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash killed 157 people, the second deadly crash in five months after an October 2018 Lion Air crash killed 189 people.
However, Boeing has been unable to make deliveries of the planes to customers, a key stoppage that will dent revenues. Boeing is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 24.
On Thursday, an initial report by the Ethiopia Transport Ministry found that the crew of the doomed plane repeatedly followed procedures recommended by Boeing, confirming concerns about the flight control system on the plane.
Scrutiny has centred on the plane's anti-stall system, Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to be at least partly at fault.
The Washington Post on Thursday that US regulators had ordered Boeing to fix a second flight-control problem, not related to MCAS, but which officials nevertheless deemed critical to flight safety.
The head of the FAA faced tough questioning from a Senate panel last month. Top Boeing officials are expected at a follow-up hearing that could also be contentious.
Boeing said the new advisory panel will be led by retired US Navy Admiral Edmund Giambastiani, former vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.
""The committee will confirm the effectiveness of our policies and processes for assuring the highest level of safety on the 737 MAX program, as well as our other airplane programs, and recommend improvements to our policies and procedures,"" Muilenburg said. ""Safety is our responsibility and we own it.""

Reuters,"Ethiopian Airlines' doomed 737 MAX jet hit excessive speed and was forced downwards by a wrongly-triggered automation system as pilots wrestled to regain control, a preliminary report into the crash that has shaken the aviation world showed on Thursday. Three times the captain, Yared Getachew, cried ""pull up"", before the Boeing Co plane plunged into a field six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew, said the report by Ethiopian investigators.The March 10 disaster, and parallels with another 737 MAX crash in Indonesia last October in which 189 people died, has led to the worldwide grounding of Boeing's flagship model.
It has also brought uncomfortable scrutiny over new software, pilot training and regulatory rigour.The report leaves unanswered questions, aviation experts said, over whether crew followed guidance not to restore power to a troublesome anti-stall system following sensor damage, possibly caused by a bird strike. The plane was also left at unusually high thrust throughout the flight, data suggested.
While the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority's Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau had a remit to investigate rather than blame, it implicitly pointed the finger at Boeing by defending the pilots, recommending the U.S. company fix its control systems, and saying regulators must be certain before allowing the MAX back in the air.""The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft,"" Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference.""Since repetitive uncommanded aircraft nose down conditions are noticed ... it is recommended that the aircraft control system shall be reviewed by the manufacturer.""
Boeing, the world's biggest planemaker and one of the United States' most important exporters with a $500 billion order book for the MAX, says a new software fix for its MCAS anti-stall system will enable pilots to always override if necessary.
Responding to the preliminary report, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said: ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment.""
""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it,"" Muilenburg said in a statement.
FRAGMENTS IN A CRATER
According to the preliminary report, an alarm indicating excess speed was heard on the cockpit voice reporter as the jet reached 500 knots (575 miles per hour) - well above operational limits.The plane had faulty ""angle of attack"" sensor readings, its nose was pushed down automatically, and the crew lost control despite following recommended instructions, it said.
""Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground,"" the report said, indicating the strength of the impact on an arid field in an agricultural zone. No bodies were recovered, only charred fragments among the debris in a crater.
A final report by Ethiopian authorities aided by air-safety experts from the United States and Europe is due to be published within a year.
Boeing has seen billions wiped off its market value since the crash, but its shares rose 2.9 percent on Thursday. Morgan Stanley said the report of flight control problems, whichBoeing was already trying to fix, meant a ""worst case scenario"" of a new cause was probably off the table.
The software update ""along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents, will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS-related accident from ever happening again,"" Muilenburg's statement said.
Families of the victims, regulators and travellers around the world have been waiting to find out to what extent Boeing technology or the pilots' actions played a role.
The preliminary report into the crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX in Indonesia suggested pilots also lost control after grappling with the MCAS software, a new automated anti-stall feature that repeatedly lowered the nose based on faulty sensor data.
""Whatever the issues were, they better be 110 percent sure about their resolution, otherwise the 157 lives lost would have been for nothing if something like this happens again,"" said one woman, who lost her father in the Ethiopian crash, asking not to be identified. ""This is a lesson to not take shortcuts in order to try and save bucks.""
'PROFITS OVER SAFETY'?
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration regulator, under fire for its certification of the MAX, cautioned the inquiry was not over. ""As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action,"" it said.
Boeing may press to know more about how crew members responded to problems triggered by the faulty data. The New York Times quoted the Ethiopian government's Dagmawit as saying pilots turned MCAS off and on, which is not the step recommended in procedures telling crew to leave it off once disabled.
With bereaved families angry and confused, relatives of an American woman killed in the Ethiopian crash, Samya Stumo, filed the first lawsuit on behalf of a U.S. victim in Chicago. The complaint named Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, the manufacturer of the angle of attack sensor, as defendants.
Stumo is the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader, who called for a boycott of the 737 MAX on Thursday.
Pilots around the world were watching closely.
""If the preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities is accurate, the pilots quickly identified the malfunction and applied the manufacturer's checklist,"" said Captain Jason Goldberg, spokesman for Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines pilots.
""Following this checklist did not appear to allow the pilots to regain control of the aircraft.""
But a former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigator questioned the aircraft's speed, which according to data in the report was left on a higher than usual setting. Aviation experts say the sensor fault should have required the crew to take manual control of the power since it would disrupt accurate speed readings in the cockpit.
""The report does not address information about unreliable airspeed procedures which should be considered,"" said Greg Feith, a former NTSB air safety investigator.","Ethiopian Airlines Pilot Cried 'Pull Up' Before 737 Max Crash, Preliminary Report Blames Boeing News18 Ethiopian Airlines CEO Says ""Very Proud"" Of Pilots' Effort To Save Flight NDTV News Ethiopian Airlines crash: Preliminary report shows Boeing MAX hurtling u…",2019-04-05T02:25:08Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'News18.com'}","Ethiopian Airlines Pilot Cried 'Pull Up' Before 737 Max Crash, Preliminary Report Blames Boeing - News18",https://www.news18.com/news/auto/ethiopian-airlines-pilot-cried-pull-up-before-737-max-crash-preliminary-report-blames-boeing-2089675.html,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2019/03/Untitled-design-561.png,,News18.com,1
