Emily Long,"If you love fonts or National Parks (or both), youre in luckyou can download the typeface found on park signs for free.
The iconic all-caps lettering used by the National Park Service wasnt originally a typeface, reports Fast Company. Signs are made using a router that chisels directly into the wood.
Designer and University of Kansas professor Jeremy Shellhorn was working in Rocky Mountain National Park in 2013, where he had students in his Design Outside Studio class make rubbings of the signs to create a digital typeface. 
To download the typeface, visit the projects website. The .zip folder includes four .otf files in different weights: thin, regular, outline, and heavy. Each font weight has capital letters, lowercase letters, and numerals.
To install on MacOS, double-click each file. When your font installer opens, hit the Install Font button, which will add the font to your font book. On Windows, right-click on the font file and click Install or drag and drop into your Fonts folder in your Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization.
The download is free, but the website accepts small donations for future projects.","If you love fonts or National Parks (or both), you’re in luck—you can download the typeface found on park signs for free.

JENNIFER A. HILLMAN,"This is dangerous. It provides all countries with a “get out of jail free” card that can be played just by saying the magic words “national security.” Blurring the line between economic and national security also invites retaliation. The United States agreed to eliminate steel tariffs and lower aluminum tariffs to below 5 percent in 1995 in exchange for tariff cuts by others. Now, by imposing 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, the United States has broken that commitment. And by imposing the tariffs on some but not all trading partners (South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil are exempt), the United States has also broken its commitment not to discriminate among W.T.O. members. Already our partners are reacting. China has placed tariffs on American exports of nuts, fruits, wine, pork and some steel pipes. Canada, the European Union, Mexico, Japan, India, Turkey and Russia may impose their own retaliatory tariffs. This adds tremendous chaos to the trading system and may signal the start of a global trade war. Moreover, the Trump administration is sacrificing real national security concerns for short-term economic gains. How else to describe a decision to dispose of the Commerce Department’s settlement with ZTE? It followed a multiyear investigation finding 380 alleged and admitted violations of American law by the Chinese telecomm giant. These included conspiracies, false statements and deceptions to obtain contracts to supply, build, and operate telecommunications networks in Iran, and to illegally ship telecommunications equipment to North Korea. If we impose tariffs on steel and cars based on a claim that those imports threaten our national security, what will we do if and when our national security is really threatened? Auto production in the United States has more than doubled since 2009, and imports of Chinese steel have fallen by nearly 75 percent since their 2014 peak. Why attack imports from longstanding allies now? Especially when it does nothing to target China’s massive subsidies, intellectual property theft, and unfair takeovers of technology — actions that truly threaten our national security. Erasing the line dividing national security from economic security threatens both. Congress needs to recognize the danger and limit the president’s authority to raise the specter of national security at every turn. At the same time, Congress must ensure that genuine concerns are not traded away for limited economic gains. Cavalier use of rarely invoked laws will only undermine their purpose and put the trading system at risk.",The Trump administration is sacrificing real national security concerns for short-term economic gains.,2018-06-01T10:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump’s ‘National Security’ Tariffs Hurt National Security,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/opinion/trump-national-security-tariffs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/01/opinion/sunday/01Hillman2/01Hillman2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1

Emily Price,"The past few years have brought us a number of exciting new food-based holidays ranging from National National Pizza Day (February 9th) to National Beer Day (coming up April 7th!). While we can all (hopefully) agree that these arent exactly real holidays they do often equal real savings on whatever the day is celebrating, and today is National Burrito Day.
To celebrate everyones favorite tortilla-wrapped meal, a number of national chains are offering deals to enhance those celebrations. Here are the ones weve found. Keep in mind your favorite non-chain local establishment might be offering a bargain today as well, so if these dont strike your fancy consider giving them a call to see if they have a promotion as well.
Baja Fresh
Baja Fresh is offering $5 burritos all day as long as you show the cashier a bar code thats on the companys Instagram and Facebook page. The chain is also holding a National Burrito Day Sweepstakes where you can potentially win a $50 gift card.
El Pollo Loco
El Pollo Loco is offering BOGO burritos on Thursday. To score the deal youll need the coupon posted on the restaurants website.
Chipotle
Chipotle is celebrating the big day by teaming up with YouTuber David Dobrik to offer a National Burrito Day burrito called the Dobrik Burrito. Presumably what Dobrik himself enjoys eating, the burrito is brown rice, black beans, chicken, mild salsa, two scoops of corn salsa, a sprinkle of cheese and a side of guac for dipping.
Chipotle notes that the burrito is only available for digital orders, although you could probably just figure out how to order this one at the counter yourself. It will be on the menu through Sunday. Today you can get $0 delivery fees on the Dobrik or any other Chipotle burrito of your choosing through DoorDash as long as you spend $10 or more.

Josh Ocampo,"Today in the upside down, President Trump declared a national emergency in an effort to fund the U.S.-Mexico border. In doing so, hell effectively bypass Congress and gain access to billions of dollars, among other capacities, which include the ability to declare curfews and even limit our actual movements (yep). Its a scary amount of power for any president to have, but what exactly does this declaration, well, declare? Heres what you need to know:
What is a declaration of a national emergency?
Good question! Before we define an emergency, youll need some context: President Gerald Ford is the man responsible for first instituting the National Emergencies Act of 1976.
This act granted the ability of any president to declare a national crisis which threatens the country and its security (a crisis, however, is vaguely defined and very much up to the discretion of the president).
 In declaring a national emergency, a president gains a number of powers, including the ability to freeze bank accounts, seize commodities, seize and control all communication, assign military forces, and limit travel, according to a 2007 Congressional Research Service Report. As the Atlantic notes, any obtained power doesnt even have to relate to the emergency in question, either. In other words, the president is fucking powerful.
In his announcement, Trump explained his plans to divert funds from the Department of Defense military construction budget to building the wall. We have so much money we dont know what to do with it, Trump said. I dont know what to do with all the money theyre giving us.
Can he be stopped?
Sort of. Citizens cant stop a president from declaring an emergency. As part of the National Emergencies Act, however, Congress is granted the right to terminate an emergency status (as NPR reports, Congress must also be informed of a national emergency and every single power invoked).
A few years ago I stopped drinking beer I really liked because I discovered that its owners were

Congress can choose to terminate a declaration if both the House and Senate vote for it. To date, however, this check has never been used in U.S. history. This is also very unlikely to take place with Republicans controlling the Senate (though there are a number of Republicans who have expressed disapproval).
Has this power ever been used before?
Yes, and pretty frequently (more than 50 times, in fact, and usually a number of times during each presidency). Most notably, Bush used it shortly after 9/11, in an attempt to gain power over the military. Obama used the power in 2010 in reaction to threats by Somali pirates. 
And Trumps already used it three times in his term alone (two times in response to threats posed by international affairs, and once in response to Russian interference in the election).
What happens next?
Jesus take the wheel! No, really, your guess is as good as mine. 
A recent op-ed in the New York Times claims Trump cant unlock funds for the wall, arguing that its a federal crime. Currently, House Democratic leaders are planning to block the declaration.
In his announcement, Trump said he is also expecting to be sued over the declaration and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has expressed that Democrats may take legal action. 
This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process, Pelosi and Senator Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a joint-statement after the announcement.
For now, the situation is ongoing.

Weve seen thousands of people lining up behind Kavanaugh because they know that theres this vicious thing called the Left, which hates them. This is a complete pulverization of the actual individuals involved in this case a retreat from complex particularity to simplistic group prejudice. The core problem behind all of this is a complete breakdown in the legitimacy of our public institutions. The Supreme Court is no longer a place where justices dispassionately rule on the Constitution. Its a place where they cast predictable party-line votes. Therefore, senators no longer deliberate on nominees. They cast predictable party-line votes. The members of the public no longer reason with one another. They fall into predictable party-line formation and then invent post-hoc, bad-faith rationalizations to give cover to their ideologically driven positions (Drank too much! Bad temperament! Bad yearbook entry!). Its clear that we need a new sort of environmental movement, a movement to police our civic environment. That environment isnt polluted by a vague condition called polarization. It is polluted by the specific toxic emissions we all produce in our low moments. Those emissions have to be precisely identified, classified, called out as shameful. Its also clear we have to set up more forums for personal encounters between different kinds of people. You detoxify disputes when you personalize them. People who dont have regular contact with people they disagree with become intellectually dishonest quickly. Finally, the good trends have to be fenced off from poisonous politics. American society is taking concrete action to make sexual assault intolerable. But this movement will not succeed if it becomes a pinball in the partisan politics of personal destruction.

Saqib Shah,"GM says the move would potentially place more than seven million long-range EVs on the road by 2030, resulting in a reduction of 375 million tons of CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, in a USA Today op-ed, CEO Mary Barra called for investing in charging infrastructure, renewing and expanding federal tax credit incentives, and providing regulatory incentives for US battery suppliers. Starting in 2021, the program urges a 7 percent ZEV requirement, increasing 2 percent each year until 2030. Taking into consideration GM's existing zero emissions commitment -- and the fact that it already has an all-electric Chevrolet Bolt and the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt -- the company naturally stands to benefit from ZEV credits over its trailing rivals.

Josh Ocampo,"This week, the U.S. government reopened after 35 days in shutdown limbo. Its effects on our national parks have been devastating, ruining public lands and compromising the livelihood of federal workers everywhere. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to help one park that was hit especially hard.
According to some conservationists, places like Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California will take centuries to regrow, the result of furloughed workers and unmonitored vandalism. Photos of cut down trees, garbage, and illegal camping at the park have made the rounds on social media since the beginning of the shutdown.
At Joshua Tree National Park, champagne bottles were left strewn on the desert floor on New Years morning, along with a prom dress, the Los Angeles Times wrote. Someone had kicked one of the iconic trees, perhaps to see how sturdy it was. Human waste was piling up.
 A non-profit group, Friends of Joshua Tree, has devoted themselves to volunteer cleanup efforts to curb the problems affecting the park, though theres a good chance the park will be put in a similar position (or maybe worse) if the government shuts down again in February.
What can you do to help Joshua Tree National Park? Here are a few tips:
Volunteer
If youre a California local, you can sign up to volunteer for a cleanup effort with the National Parks Conservation Association and help pick up trash and other waste strewn throughout the park. 
Donate 
If you want to make an impact from across the country, you can donate directly to the Joshua Tree National Park by way of the National Park Service. You can designate where youd like your donation to be spent, so be sure to specify cleanup and conservation efforts. Heres information on where you can send a check.
Want to help the Joshua Trees furloughed workers impacted by the shutdown? Friends of Joshua Tree launched a zero-interest, small loans program. By lending a few dollars as a loan, workers will have temporary reprieve from the shutdown. If the government shuts down again in February, this program is going to become more necessary than ever.

Dont off-road
And how can you help if youre planning a visit to the park? Dont off-road. Exploring the park may seem like a good idea at the time, but visitors are banned from driving into areas where vegetation can be compromised (or accidentally cut down altogether). 
If you spot any trash, do your part to pick it upand be conscious of your own waste. National parks are a communal space and we should all be aware of our individual impact, no matter how small.

Emily Dreyfuss,"Fire doesn’t heed history. It doesn’t care about posterity or culture or memory. Fire consumes everything and anything, even if that thing is the last of its kind. On Sunday night, it came for the National Museum of Brazil, burning for six hours and leaving behind ashes where there had been dinosaur fossils, the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas, and audio recordings and documents of indigenous languages. Many of those languages, already extinct, may now be lost forever. It’s the kind of loss that’s almost impossible to quantify. For the researchers who worked in the museum, the conflagration sent their life’s work up in smoke. “It is very difficult to react to reality and try to return to life,” linguist Bruna Franchetta, whose office burned down in the fire, told WIRED in an email. “At the moment we do not know the extent of the destruction of the Documentation Center of Indigenous Languages in the National Museum. We have to wait a long time for a survey of what is left in the middle of the rubble. At the moment I can say nothing about what has not turned to ashes, but I hear colleagues saying that it was all lost.” It didn’t have to be this way. All of these artifacts could have been systematically backed up over the years with photographs, scans, audio files. The failure to do so speaks to a vital truth about the limits of technology: Just because the means to do something exists technologically doesn’t mean it will be done. And it underscores that the academic community has not yet fully embraced the importance of archiving importance of archiving—not just in Brazil, but around the world. Though Franchetta says work had begun recently to digitalize the CELIN archive, she has no idea how far it had gotten, and it focused on only a part of the collection. “The loss is immense, and much of what has been destroyed by the flames can never be recovered,” she says. In 2018, when an iPhone automatically backs up every photo you take, you might think knowledge is safer today than it was in the days of the Library at Alexandria. The fire in Brazil puts the lie to that assumption. To undertake the archiving of so vast a collection—the National Museum of Brazil reportedly lost 20 million artifacts in all—requires time, money, and a sense of urgency. As museum staff and researchers try to pick up their lives, find a new offices to work in, and figure out how to continue their work, there's plenty of blame to go around. Much of it belongs at the feet of the Brazilian government, which had slashed the budget for the National Museum and the University of Rio De Janeiro, which runs it. The museum was so strapped for money that last year, after termites destroyed a wooden base holding a 42-foot dinosaur skeleton, it started a crowdfunding campaign to raise $15,000 to replace it. The building had no sprinkler system. Government cuts are also why, when firefighters arrived to fight the flames Sunday night, they reportedly found no water in the hydrants, having instead to get water from a nearby lake. 'It is very difficult to react to reality and try to return to life.' Bruna Franchetta, Linguist All this austerity—fallout, reports say, from the vast spending on the World Cup in 2016—both made the fire more likely and made it burn more fiercely and longer than it needed to. Brazil’s cultural minister said that before the fire struck the museum, it had been poised to receive $5 million from the government for upgrades, including adding a fire suppression system. But the lack of a backup archive goes beyond governments. Certainly funding played a huge part, but even scholars who spend their lives studying history and loss, researching how cultures end, can fall for the notion that there will always be more time. “I think people just had the idea that, well it can be done someday, what’s the urgency?” says Andrew Nevins, a linguist affiliated with the National Museum. “The idea of digitizing as an urgent priority wasn’t in the air...Instead there was lots of funding and sources for going into the field and finding the last speakers right now of [a given language].” That’s obviously important work, but without a plan for how to safely back up and keep those records, much of it is now lost. That loss is not merely to science, or to future museum visitors, but to those cultures who entrusted their histories to the museum. An estimated 500 indigenous tribes currently live in the Amazon, speaking around 330 languages, about 50 of which are estimated to be endangered—but before colonization there were likely as many as 2,000 tribes. The CELIN archive contained research into roughly 160 of these languages, estimates Franchetta. Linguist Colleen Fitzgerald, who heads the United States’ National Science Foundation’s project on protecting endangered languages, notes that field work of the type that created the collection in Brazil involves deep collaboration with the communities being studied. Often over the course of many years, researchers gain access to people’s lives, stories, and customs. The responsibility to protect what they share is a solemn one. “Brazil [does not have] a diffuse culture of file safeguarding, especially through scanning and storing in various backups and in different secure locations,” says Franchetta. She notes that their academic community rarely discusses best practices in how to create digital archives. Nevins agrees. Though students and professors labor to collect everything they can about endangered languages, he sees far less emphasis on protecting what they gather. “The first reaction that many of us had was indignation: How could this happen, how could there be no sprinkler system? But I think as the dust started to settle there’s also some indignation at the state of library science in Brazil,"" says Nevins. ""Why isn't library science in Brazil at a place where digitizing existing materials is as important as going out and collecting stuff?” Brazil is no outlier. Troves of important linguistic and anthropological collections exist in museums small and large, in institutes and universities in every nation, each with different budgets and practices around digital archiving. In fact, so many collections are at risk of loss due to catastrophes like fire or floods that just last month the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property held a simulation to train people in how to save precious artifacts after a crisis. Though the ephemerality of material knowledge concerned researchers for years, only recently have international standards for digital archiving emerged. Fitzgerald notes that the NSF, the biggest funding agency for science in the US, only instituted archiving data management requirements for work it funds in 2011. An international consortium dedicated to digitizing endangered languages, The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, in Nijmegen, Germany, created a group that runs a central digital archive in 2000 into which researchers can upload their linguistic field work. The group also funds archival work around the world; Franchetta says the National Museum in Brazil had received funding from them for some of its digitization work. And in 2003, different linguistic groups concerned with endangered languages formed the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network, a consortium dedicated to digitizing the diffuse linguistics archives around the world. Though it has a handful of member organizations across the world, none are in South America. 'I think people just had the idea that, well it can be done someday, what’s the urgency?' Andrew Nevins, Linguist Even when the decision does get made to archive a language, it comes at a tremendous cost. Just this year, the Archive for Indigenous Languages of Latin America, a DELAMAN member run by the University of Texas at Austin, finally digitized a collection of proto-languages from Latin America—among them Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, and Uto-Aztecan—based on more than 100,000 documents, 900 CDs of audio recordings, and hundreds of boxes of field notes taken by renowned Mesoamericanist Terrence Kaufman. The project took six years, with full time work from professors and graduate students, and specialized equipment. It was only possible through a $302,627.00 NSF grant awarded in 2012. That figure is more than twice the reported annual maintenance budget of the entire National Museum, which was reportedly $128,000—though this year it only had received $13,000, total, according to National Geographic. The collection in the linguistics wing of the museum alone was far larger than 100,000 documents. To digitize it all properly would have required not just buy-in from the powers that be, but also expensive specialized tools, like noninvasive scanners than can salvage audio recordings from the wax cylinders used a century ago to gather interviews. And that's just the equipment. Someone has to watch the tape to make sure it doesn’t skip. Someone has to mark the metadata that makes it possible to search through a digital archive. “Someone’s got to sit there while it’s being digitized. There’s human labor just in that process.” says Fitzgerald. That can be a graduate student or undergrad, notes Nevins, though some specialized equipment requires technicians with specific skills. Fitzgerald recently awarded a grant to a team in Hawaii that will work to make more advanced automated archival tools that might make this process easier—and, crucially, cheaper. Much of the work digitizing cultural artifacts has always been a labor of love undertaken by dedicated individuals in their free time. A group like this had worked for years scanning small parts of the most important collection that burned on Sunday, known as the Curt Nimuendajú collection. Nimuendaju was a German linguist at the turn of the 20th century who recorded hundred of hours of Amazonian languages that are now extinct. Two linguists in Brazil run the group Etnolinguistica as an homage to his work. Though their website contains some scans of his documents, it is far from a comprehensive archive of his primary sources. ""They’re an impressive group that scans stuff all the time but it’s not institutional at all,"" says Nevins. ""It’s just a bunch of people, a bunch of web denizens who go scanning stuff."" In the aftermath of the fire, many crowdsourced campaigns have sprung up. Franchetta says the CELIN department has put out a call to any researchers and students who ever photocopied anything from the collection to please send copies back to the National Museum. “But that's a drop in the ocean,” she says. Academics from all over the world have been amplifying calls to share any photographs or recordings taken inside the museum in an effort to rebuild. Wikipedia put out a similar call. The spirit of collaboration and a sense of the community coming together in a time of crisis is palpable. But it can’t replace what’s been lost. “My will, with the anger that we are all feeling, is to leave that ruin as memento mori, as memory of the dead, of the dead things, of the dead people, of the archives, destroyed in that fire,” Brazil’s most famous anthropologist, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, who was affiliated with the museum, told a newspaper in Portugal this week. The global academic community, and the researchers in Brazil, hope that memento mori provokes an awakening about the urgent need to digitize the world’s knowledge. If fire comes for another historically important collection, maybe then it won’t take the world’s knowledge with it.

After that, I slid down the visor and prepared to launch into virtual space.

Nathan Proctor,"""Right to repair just basically says, Hey guys, you got to make the information and the parts available."" U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, appearing on All In with Chris Hayes, Wednesday March, 27.
Our work to help people fix their stuff reached a milestone last week, when Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called for Right to Repair to support farmers struggling with growing antitrust issues in agriculture.
WIRED OPINION
ABOUT
Nathan Proctor (@nProctor) is director of the Right to Repair Campaign for U.S. PIRG, an advocacy organization.
Warren has raised Right to Repair to a new level of national prominence. Its a big moment for those of us who have been sounding the alarm on how companies have been placing obstacles in the way of repair, and the resulting hassle, cost and environmental damage.
I would like to claim that somehow our organizing efforts (led by iFixit, Repair.org and U.S. PIRG) brought us to this moment, but the best organizing done to support Right to Repair is done by our opponents. When they put their customers through the wringer to get stuff fixed, it creates an enthusiasm beyond what even the most compelling opinion column could produce.
Frankly, if you hear the stories from people struggling to deal with the deluge of unfixable products, you understand why there have been 20 states with active Right to Repair bills so far in 2019. If you ask me, these stories are why the issue has entered the national policy debate.
Stories like what happened to Nebraska farmer Kyle Schwarting, whose John Deere combine malfunctioned and couldnt be fixed by Schwarting himself because the equipment was designed with a software lock that only an authorized John Deere service technician could access. Schwarting could have taken the machine to an official John Deere shop, but that would mean paying thousands of dollars to load the tractor on a flatbed truck and haul it to the dealership, all while the window for harvest was closing.
So yeah, Kyle Schwarting wants a right to repair his combine. To save his livelihood, he had to hack the software, something the U.S. Office of Copyright decided he had every right to do.
In a move that further frustrated its customers, John Deere argued to the Copyright Office against that right, claiming that people like Schwarting dont fully own the tractors they have bought; they use the equipment under an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle.
Tom Schwarz, fifth-generation farmer and Right to Repair advocate, laughed at this suggestion, saying in an On Point radio segment where we appeared together: We pay personal property taxes on all our equipment, so when my wife sits down and writes those checks out, I havent noticed John Deere putting any money into that.
So yeah, having a company you purchased a $500,000 piece of equipment from argue that you dont really own the equipment has the effect of recruiting a few new Right to Repair supporters.
Not only farmers have repair horror stories. Many of us know the story of BatteryGate or ThrottleGatewhich resulted in quite a few Right to Repair converts. In December of 2017, at the height of holiday shopping season, Apple users discovered that a software update was throttling phones processors if it detected the battery was worn down. After some public blowback, Apple offered to replace those older batteries at a reduced price at Apple stores. But with such high demand, long waitlists formed. Some customers faced an additional obstacle: they live hours away from the nearest Apple store.
Meanwhile, Apple does not make its original replacement batteries available to anyone but their small number of authorized locations. If you didnt want to wait a few months to get a phone that wasnt slow and buggy, you would have to swap the battery out with a replacement part not made by Apple.
Until Apple reversed its policy just a few weeks ago, replacing the battery with a third-party substitute would result in Apple refusing to service the phone entirely. Our report, Recharge Repair, found that third party shops still saw a 37 percent increase in battery replacements in the five weeks after the scandal brokebecause people just wanted their phones fixed.
After that mess, Right to Repair saw a pretty big surge in support.
Every day, I hear stories about a dishwasher that died right after the warranty ended, or people getting quoted a repair cost thats more than replacing the whole appliance or device. Device after device, hassle after hassle. (Got your own story? You can share it here.)
All that unfixable stuff doesnt disappear when we are forced to replace it. It piles up. Electronic waste is the fastest growing part of our waste stream. It is often toxic, and poses grave health risks. The increase in this kind of waste is fed both by the growing number of products with electronics in them and the shrinking lifespan of those products. A 2015 study found that the proportion of all units sold to replace a defective appliance grew from 3.5% in 2004 to 8.3% in 2012, in what [researchers] deemed a remarkable increase.
Im excited to see Right to Repair become a national issue and part of a major candidates platform. And its resonance for consumers wont go away until companies stop selling us easily breakable stuffand then trying to block us from fixing it.
Hey guys, just give us the parts and information so we can fix stuff. If it seems like too much to ask, we can stick to demanding it.

Emily Dreyfuss,"In a move that has shocked career national security officials, President Trump stripped former CIA Director John Brennan of his security clearance this week, and announced he was considering doing so for a host of others. The move so enraged retired Navy Admiral William McRaven—the man who oversaw the killing of Osama Bin Laden—that he wrote an op-ed telling Trump to revoke his clearance too, in solidarity with Brennan. But what the general public might not realize is that cutting off Brennan and others has more than just symbolic cost. It actively weakens national security. Fascinating a subject as it is, the public has little occasion to worry about the intricacies of security clearances. For starters, having them outside of government is more common than you might think: The New York Times reports that 4.1 million people outside the government have a clearance, and 1.3 million private sector employees have top secret clearance. 'The reason why you have a John Brennan who has a security clearance is because you may want his help in thinking that through.' Derek Chollet, Former Assistant Secretary of Defense That's for good reason, especially in the case of someone like Brennan, who has operational knowledge of a lot of ongoing and highly sensitive national security issues that he dealt with in his 25 years at the CIA. Newly appointed CIA Director Gina Haspel would likely have relied on Brennan for his insights into many of those ongoing operations, says Derek Chollet, former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. “My guess is that this is not a happy time for her, because John Brennan is someone she would very much want to lean on,” Chollet says. In other words, Brennan’s case matters not because it will have any practical impact on his retired life, but because it’s potentially deleterious to the safety of the United States. “Let’s say... there’s a major terrorist attack on the United States and we’re trying to figure out what happened and what to do,” Chollet posits. “The reason why you have a John Brennan who has a security clearance is because you may want his help in thinking that through.” Stripping Brennan of his clearance for overtly political reasons also breaks with the national security community's perceived inoculation from just that. “The fact that John Brennan continues to have a clearance reflects a longstanding tradition that national security goes beyond politics. And the tight knit community of national security transcends politics and policy,” says R. David Edelman, former director for international cyber policy on the National Security Council. “That has been core to the identity of a lot of us who have worked in this space, and that’s why I think you hear such concern from so many about the political weaponization of this tool.” People have had their security clearance stripped before, but only if they violated their commitment to it, by leaking confidential information. No one has accused Brennan of that. His demerit was simply speaking out against the Trump administration. That could further have chilling effects for junior officers, who now have to worry they could lose their clearance for speaking their minds. Though that punitive action may not have a meaningful impact on Brennan’s income or retired life, it would be devastating for the intelligence community's rank and file. Maintaining a security clearance qualifies former government staffers for more and higher paying jobs in the private sector. It's also by no means automatic; a superior needs to recommend that they can keep it to the Department of Defense. Usually that happens if they have some kind of ongoing advisory or consulting relationship with the government that requires clearance. And even that approval doesn't mean access to a firehose of classified information. Security clearances work on a need-to-know basis. All they indicate is that a person has permission to view information they are cleared for if they need to for their job; there's no all-encompassing database for ex-spies to tap into. Even Brennan would only have been brought in when people needed his input. 'For the past 20 years we have been almost pathologically outsourcing the national security establishment to private companies.' R. David Edelman, Former National Security Council Cyber Policy Director Moreover, most of those 4.1 million people who have clearances in the private sector never worked for the government in the first place. Rather, they're contractors who work with the government—sometimes side by side in a government office, other times at private companies like Rand or Northrop Grumman. They need security clearances to do their jobs. There’s an entire website dedicated to careers only open to those with security clearances. “For the past 20 years we have been almost pathologically outsourcing the national security establishment to private companies,” says Edelman. On Friday, President Trump said he planned to strip career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr of his clearance next. Trump called Ohr ""a disgrace"" for having had contact in 2016 with Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who compiled the infamous dossier about Trump's ties to Russia. To Chollet, revoking these security clearances for personal retribution is just another instance of the Trump administration bailing on important precedent. “It’s a norm that may feel good to break in the moment,” he says, “but it may not be a smart one. Because guess what? All those guys sitting in the administration may not be there forever. Mike Pompeo may be interested in maintaining a clearance once he leaves.” More Great WIRED Stories","When Trump strips a former CIA director's security clearance, the impact is more than just symbolic.",2018-08-17T20:00:49Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Taking Away John Brennan's Clearance Threatens National Security,https://www.wired.com/story/john-brennan-security-clearance-trump/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b770a8fe9a10423496fab6a/191:100/pass/JohnBrennan-Security-687284824.jpg,wired,Wired,National,1
MICHELLE GOLDBERG,"Theres no permanent attorney general or secretary of defense. (The acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, is alleged to have helped a company currently under federal investigation for fraud intimidate its critics.) The national security adviser is John Bolton, and he seems to be trying to provoke a war with Iran. An Associated Press story contains this deadpan line: White House aides expressed regret that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host.
To be clear, were very far from a worst-case scenario version of a Trump administration. Last year the president sent nearly 6,000 active-duty American troops to the border based on racist propaganda about a migrant caravan, but there havent been tanks in the streets. The administration winks at foreign governments who kill journalists, but its own threats against the media are mostly empty. I feared, at the beginning of this administration, that Trump would try to exploit American intelligence capabilities against his personal enemies, but instead he gets his intelligence from Fox News. The fact that so many high-level Trump associates have pleaded guilty to crimes is a sign of his corruption, but it also shows he hasnt corrupted our entire system.
Trump has turned out to be the Norma Desmond of authoritarians, a senescent has-been whose delusions are propped up by obsequious retainers. From his fantasy world in the White House, he barks dictatorial and often illegal orders, floats conspiracy theories, tweets insults and lies unceasingly. But much of the time hes not fully in charge. He has the instincts of a fascist but lacks both the discipline and the loyal lieutenants hed need to create true autocracy.
That doesnt mean, however, that the country isnt coming undone. Trumps bumbling incoherence, coupled with his declining political fortunes since the midterms, makes him seem less frightening than he once did. But, two years in, the jaded weariness many of us have developed might obscure how bad things are. Were living through an unprecedented breakdown in Americas ability to function like a normal country.

Like most national holidays some businesses will be closed for the day to celebrate, but others should be up and running. In general, the best advice for the day is to give a business a call before you head out to just to make sure it’s open. That bagel place you like might be closed this morning, but the coffee shop next door could very well be open for business.

Mail If you’re waiting for the greeting card from mom to arrive via USPS you’re going to have to wait until Thursday. The U.S. postal service is closed all day, as is UPS. FedEx offices are open today, but with limited hours. Government Offices and Banks Since July 4th is a federal holiday, all of these are closed for business today. That means the IRS, social security office, courthouse and other such spots will be closed for the day. Banks are also closed for the day, but you should still be able to use the ATM to withdraw cash and make deposits. The stock exchange also closed early on July 3rd and will remain closed on July 4th. National Parks National Parks are technically run by the government, but they’re a big exception to the “everything is closed” rule. All 400 National Parks will be open on July 4th, and a number of them will have special events going on to celebrate America’s 235th birthday. Grocery Stores Grocery stores are one of those places you’re going to want to call first. In general, most of them should be open early in the day on July 4th, but many chains, including Whole Foods, will close early so their employees can go celebrate. You’ll want to make sure your location is still open (or open in the first place) before you head out. Walmart and Target will both be open today, so those can also work in a pinch if you run out of hot dog buns. Restaurants This is another one you probably want to check out before you go. Most chain restaurants are going to be open for regular hours on July 4th, but local eateries might be closed. You also have to watch out for franchises and chains.

Kate Clark,"National Grid, the Northeast’s natural gas and electricity company, is planting a flag in Silicon Valley with the launch of National Grid Partners. Led by former Intel Capital vice president and managing director Lisa Lambert, NGP has $250 million to invest in growth-stage technology startups over the next two to three years. Based in Las Gatos, NGP plans to invest in 10 to 15 startups per year. “We want to disrupt ourselves before we are disrupted,” Lambert told TechCrunch. “That’s the only way to protect yourself in a world where really nobody is safe.” Deal size will vary, according to Lambert. NGP plans to back cleantech companies across sectors such as artificial intelligence, smart assets, enterprise SaaS, security and blockchain. The purpose of the in-house venture fund is to bring a much-needed infusion of innovation into the utility industry. “You can’t be satisfied with the status quo,” Lambert added. “If the telecom sector could do it all over again when mobile broke out — I think they would have done it differently. We don’t want to be in the same situation where we are resting on the strength of our asset profile or the fact that we are regulated; other industries had that same profile, it was hard for startups to break in and still, they got disrupted — massively disrupted.” NGP has deployed capital to five startups so far, including big data analytics startup AutoGrid, which aims to help with predictive maintenance and commercial industrial demand response in the U.S.; weather forecasting startup ClimaCell; distributed energy resources marketplace Leap; Omnidian, a provider of protection plans for investments in residential and commercial solar energy systems; and Sitetracker, a SaaS platform focused on utilities and telecom.

Bijan Stephen,"Last night on Laura Ingraham’s show, The Ingraham Angle, a strange thing happened. (Stranger than usual, I mean.) Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) stopped by for an interview, ostensibly to talk about Representative Adam Schiff’s latest actions regarding the ongoing Russia probe. “This is clearly an investigation again, without a crime. We’ve looked for two years — didn’t find anything, at all,” he said, which is misleading at best. He went on to speak about the “cottage industry” of press people who are following the case and reporting it, so the public has an idea of what goes on behind closed doors. Nunes sounded offended when he reported to the Capitol for what was, in his words, a routine meeting, and he saw many camera people waiting for him there. “I don’t know what these people are going to do — this cottage industry of press people. They’re going to have to go learn code or something, which was Obama’s plan. Because they’re not going to have a job after this!” Did you catch it? This is where it gets odd. While the rest of Nunes’ appearance was boilerplate Fox outrage bait, that sentence — “They’re going to have to go learn code or something” — was the congressman signaling, knowingly or not, that he understood the priorities of a certain group online. When Nunes said “learn to code,” he was amplifying a mass harassment campaign that started on 4chan’s politics board, which was meant to target journalists. The last few weeks of the year have not been kind to media professionals. More than a thousand jobs have been lost after layoffs at HuffPost, BuzzFeed, Verizon, and Gannett, and the general mood across the industry can be best described as anxious and depressed. Over those same weeks, journalists who had been laid off have been told to “learn to code” because 4chan’s crypto-fascist politics board /pol/ had noticed the layoffs and had formulated a plan to increase the distress of anyone who’d been let go. “In a thread entitled “HAPPENING - Huffpo / Buzzfeed / other MSM garbage (((journalists))) FIRED,” which discussed the extant and impending layoffs, there were dozens of responses laying out the “learn to code” plan, wrote Talia Lavin in The New Republic. Lavin is a freelance journalist whose column at HuffPost had been cut as a result of the layoffs at that company. In the piece, Lavin points out that “learn to code” was another targeted mass harassment campaign dreamed up at 4chan. On its face, 4chan is a forum: it was started in 2003 by Christopher Poole, then a teenager, as a place to post about anime. However, since then, the culture of the board has shifted. Its users were always trollish, playing pranks on the wider internet (remember Rickrolling?), but in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, they’ve become openly political. Today, 4chan is a home of the far right. They seed memes and ideas there that have ended up in President Trump’s speeches and tweets, laundered through the various blogs and websites that make up the right-wing media ecosystem. Last night, by saying “learn to code,” Nunes — again, wittingly or unwittingly — parroted one of those ideas. While that message may seem innocuous, the nature of 4chan meant that anyone receiving messages saying “learn to code” online was shot through with anti-Semitism, racism, and general hate. When Fox News’ Tucker Carlson ran a segment on “learn to code,” the meme was legitimized by a seemingly reliable source. “The experience of the ‘learn to code’ campaign was being bombarded with harassment that others stridently claimed wasn’t harassment; being told death threats were a joke; having my name broadcast mockingly on Fox News—all for the temerity of tweeting about losing a column,” wrote Lavin. “It was an experience of being mugged by gaslight.” It’s possible that Nunes didn’t know any of this when he was speaking with Laura Ingraham. After all, useful idiots have been part of information operations since information operations became a widely practiced mode of warfare. Donald Trump broke the Republican Party — and the rest of the right — in so many ways, but his election also reshaped how information spreads across conservative groups. The people making the memes are now the right’s main intellectual organ: the rest are either useful idiots or deluded. Nunes’ office did not respond to a request for comment.","While the rest of Nunes’ appearance was boilerplate Fox outrage bait, that sentence — “They’re going to have to go learn code or something” — was the congressman signaling, knowingly or not, that he understood the priorities of a certain group online.",2019-02-08T21:50:15Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Rep.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire. The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

Dell Cameron,"Earlier this week, someone attempted to infiltrate the system housing the Democratic Party’s voter file using a fake login page, Democratic officials and a leading cloud service provider told Gizmodo on Wednesday. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) was notified on Tuesday of an effort to collect the usernames and passwords of Democratic officials using a fake login page. The fake page was created in an apparent attempt to infiltrate Votebuilder, the DNC’s primary voter file system. DigitalOcean, the cloud service provider, said it notified the DNC after becoming aware of the threat early Tuesday morning. The threat was also assessed by Lookout, a San Francisco-based security company. The DNC contacted law enforcement immediately after being alerted to the threat, said a Democratic official, who added there’s no indication so far that Votebuilder or any other system has been compromised. “We are continuing to partner with the DNC and appropriate law enforcement agencies on this issue,” said Josh Fienblum, DigitalOcean’s chief security officer. DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord characterized the incident as “further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections,” adding: “we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.” Word of the attempt on the DNC comes one day after Microsoft disclosed that it had seized control of six internet domains allegedly created used by Russian hackers, two of which mimicked major conservative organizations, including the International Republican Institute. Lord also called on the Trump administration to take “more aggressive steps” to protect voting systems. “These threats are serious,” he said, “and that’s why it’s critical that we all work together...” More than two years ago at the height of the 2016 election, hackers gained access to the DNC network using credentials stolen from an employee of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Within months, more than two dozen computers were compromised and thousands of emails were stolen. The documents, which the hackers shared with WikiLeaks that summer, upended the Democratic Party, eventually leading to the resignation of DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In January 2017, U.S. intelligence assessed with high confidence that the hackers were supported by the Russian government, which had displayed a clear preference for then-candidate Donald Trump in the election.","Earlier this week, someone attempted to infiltrate the system housing the Democratic Party’s voter file using a fake login page, Democratic officials and a leading cloud services provider told Gizmodo on Wednesday.

I’m a citizen of Anywhere, but reside Somewhere with you, and share none of your affections and loyalties. I don’t understand the difficulties of ordinary life. Most of all, you resent my sneering contempt. You suspect I think you’re a racist rube, the worst thing a person can be in our society. I’m not wild about you either, though not because you’re a hick who won’t do as I say. I concede your right to pursue your own good in your own way, but I dispute that your negative liberty to make choices for yourself constitutes a positive liberty to determine who may marry whom or deny preventive health care, including contraceptives, to women (to give two examples). I have my own resentments, too: There are big problems I want to help solve, such as replacing fossil fuels, curing intractable diseases, and creating meaningful work that pays real wages, and you insist on voting for leaders whose policies make solutions less likely.

Pontin does not write about Flagship’s portfolio companies nor about their competitors. It’s no way to form a more perfect union. The great political question of the day is “How can we all get along?” All democratic nations want an answer, but the need feels pressing in the United States, where the citizens of a large and historically divided nation have been further alienated by social media, cable news, and modern political strategies. What social scientists call “ affective polarization,” the measure of how much political tribes dislike one another, is as heated as it’s been since polling began: A 2016 study by the Pew Research Center found “that sizable shares of both Democrats and Republicans say the other party stirs feelings of not just frustration, but fear and anger.” Almost half of Republicans complained that Democrats were lazier than other Americans, more dishonest, closed-minded, and immoral. Democrats disparaged Republicans similarly, but in larger numbers. We’d even prefer not to shop or work in the same places, although it costs us. Within the great red and blue tribes, there are yet more genera. We are lonely gamers and radical vegans, men’s rights advocates angry at the pussification of the culture, and women who have a hashtag to describe their harassment. But we no longer communicate. Every controversy has become part of America’s endless culture wars. When politics is so contested, and the two parties that represent reactionary and progressive attitudes are more or less evenly matched, inertia becomes normal. But the time is short, and our common challenges are urgent. Complete triumph is impossible in our constitutional republic; we are not going to fight another bloody civil war; no one is going anywhere. Somehow, we have to find a way to compromise. Recently, I’ve been asking myself how I should speak and act at work, in my writing, on social media, and in my private life to make mutual understanding possible and compromises more likely. What can I do to be less irritating and provocative, more aware of my biases and the limits of my own reason ? I could act with more humility, and clearly distinguish between statements for which I have evidence and pronouncements that merely express my preferences and rancors. I don’t pretend that I will always or often achieve this standard, but I should try, and I might be a good example to others, and especially to my own tribe. Here’s how to speak in a polity where we loathe each other. Let this be the Law of Parsimonious Claims: 1. Say nothing you know to be untrue, whether to deceive, confuse, or, worst of all, encourage a wearied cynicism. 2. Make mostly falsifiable assertions or offer prescriptions whose outcomes could be measured, always explaining how your assertion or prescription could be tested. 3. Whereof you have no evidence but possess only moral intuitions, say so candidly, and accept you must coexist with people who have different intuitions. 1 4. When evidence proves you wrong, admit it cheerfully, pleased that your mistake has contributed to the general progress. Finally, as you listen, assume the good faith of your opponents, unless you have proof otherwise. Judge their assertions and prescriptions based on the plain meaning of their words, rather on than what you guess to be their motives. Often, people will tell you about experiences they found significant. If they are earnest, hear them sympathetically. Taken together, the rules suggest a narrow, demilitarized zone for future conduct. All of life is problem-solving, but most problems have no current solution, because we do not know enough about the problem, or they have no conclusive solution, because the problem is not amenable to evidence. The first category of problems, which include all scientific and technological questions, can be provisionally answered. In The Logic of Scientific Discovery, first published in German in 1934, the philosopher Karl Popper suggested a plausible demarcation between scientific and other statements: “It must be possible for an empirical system to be refuted by experience.” However, many of the problems we care about most, including a very large number political and metaphysical questions, are meaningful yet fall into the second, more resistant category. They must be renegotiated by every generation. In democratic societies no one gets everything they want, but they can compromise about anything except personal rights, which are enjoyed by everyone. In practical life, the two sorts of problems are related: If we can negotiate a compromise for a political problem, we can pose the outcome as a technical problem whose solution can be falsified. Inevitably, the solution is never entirely satisfactory to anyone, because a perfectly happy wolf requires a mob of dead sheep, but a good outcome makes it possible for us to coexist. In a letter written in 1650, in an era more contentious than our own, the English parliamentary general Oliver Cromwell begged the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland to reconsider its alliance with Charles II: ""You have censured others, and established yourselves 'upon the Word of God.' Is it therefore infallibly agreeable to the Word of God, all that you say? I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken."" The only escape from the prison of our mutual disregard is to welcome mistakes as useful. It’s not much, but it’s a start upon which to build a truce. We have to find a way to begin to forgive each other. 1 In fact, most of this column falls under this rule.

Jack Stewart,"For all the hype, electric cars still make up a tiny percentage of global vehicle sales. Like, less than one percent tiny. But there's a growing movement around the world to put a deadline on the life of the internal combustion engine. This year India, the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, and France, amongst other states and cities, have said they want to phase out gas and diesel vehicles within the next few decades. The planet's largest car market, China, is moving in the same direction. Government incentives influence car buyers attitudes, as evidenced by Norway, where EV sales now account for around 30 percent of sales. With the longterm future of the fossil fuel-powered car under threat, automakers have no choice but to adapt. General Motors says it's working towards a fully electric future. All of Britain's Jaguar Land Rover cars and SUVs will have an electric option by 2020. Sweden's Volvo is doing the same, by 2019. All that means that if you're looking to buy an electric car in 2018, you have more options than ever. (And despite early threats to do so, the newly passed tax bill didn't touch the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying an electric car.) Tesla's Model 3, the ""affordable"" sedan, should finally be available in large enough numbers to start filling some of the 400,000 back orders, if Elon Musk can pull it out of ""production hell."". Nissan's 2018 Leaf, an update to the original electric car for the masses, has some new tech tricks, and at the high end Jaguar's I-Pace will give Tesla a run for its money.

He told The New York Times that his top priorities would be to unify the company’s security team, which is split between groups focused on online threats and real-world threats against riders and drivers, and increasing transparency. “I think they understand the need to be transparent and ethical, and vigilant in complying not just with the laws and regulations that apply, but the norms and standards that Uber customers and stakeholders expect of the company,” Olsen told the Times.","Matt Olsen, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency and director of the National Counterterrorism Center, has been selected to head up Uber’s troubled security team, the company’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced on Tuesday.",2018-08-14T16:36:31Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Uber hires NSA veteran to head up its security team,https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17688784/uber-hires-nsa-veteran-security-team-data-breach,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f1X5DXywvQSOky10ixHSLNLJFU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11423433/acastro_180524_1777_uber_0003.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,National,1
Zack Whittaker,"It’s now 18 days since the U.S. government unceremoniously shut down because Congress couldn’t agree on a bill to fund a quarter of all federal departments including paying their employees.
But federal workers are starting to feel the pinch after not getting paid for two weeks, and this will have a knock-on effect to U.S. national security. The longer the shutdown goes on, the greater the damage will be.
The “too long, didn’t read” version is that before Christmas, President Trump wanted $5 billion for a wall on the southern border with Mexico to fulfill a campaign promise. Despite the Republicans having a majority in both houses of Congress, they didn’t have the votes to pass the spending bill in the Senate, which would’ve kept the government going when existing funding expired on midnight on December 22. No vote was held, even after a successful vote in the House, and the government shut down. When the Democrats took the majority in the House last week following their midterm wins, they were ready to pass a funding bill without the $5 billion (because they think it’s a gigantic waste of money) and get the government going again. But Trump has said he won’t sign any bill that doesn’t have the border wall funding.
More than two weeks later, some 800,000 federal workers are still at home yet, about half were told to stay and work without pay. Worse, there’s no guarantee that federal workers will get paid for the time the government was shut down unless lawmakers intervene.
Unless the Democrats get a veto-proof majority, the impasse looks set to continue.

Government shutdowns don’t happen very often usually or really at all outside the U.S., and yet this is the first time in four decades that the government has been closed three times in one year. That doesn’t mean cyber or national security threats conveniently stop. Granted, most of the government is functioning and ticking over. There are still boots on the ground, cops on the street, NSA analysts fighting hackers in cyberspace and criminals still facing justice.
But while most of the core government departments State, Treasury, Justice and Defense are still operational, others like Homeland Security, which takes the bulk of the government’s cybersecurity responsibility  are suffering the most.
And the longer the shutdown goes on, the greater chance of tighter budgets and that more staff could be furloughed.
Here’s a breakdown:
Homeland Security’s new cybersecurity unit got off to a rough start: The newly established Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a division of Homeland Security, has only been operational since November 16, but about more than half of its staff have been furloughed, according to Homeland Security. The division is designed to lead the national effort to defend critical national infrastructure from current, ongoing threats. By our count at the time of writing, the CISA has been shut down for one in 10 days of its two-month tenure.
Threat intelligence sharing will take a hit: A little-known program inside Homeland Security, known as the Automated Indicator Sharing, has also sent home more than 80 percent of it staff, according to Duo Security. AIS allows private industry and government agencies to share threat intelligence, which is shared with Homeland Security’s government partners, to ensure that any detected attack can only ever be used once. The shutdown is going to heavily impact the data exchange program.
New NIST standards to face delays: More than 85 percent of National Institute of Standards and Technology employees have been sent home without pay, leaving just a handful of essential staff to keep NIST’s new advice and guidance work going. NIST is responsible for giving all government departments necessary and up-to-date security advice. It also means that FIPS testing, used to grant devices and new technologies security certifications to run on government networks, has completely stopped during the shutdown.
Underpaid TSA agents are now entirely unpaid: The TSA, found at every U.S. airport security screening area, is still working despite the shutdown. More than 90 percent of the TSA’s workforce of 60,078 employees will go unpaid on top of already low pay, which has resulted in a high turnover rate. Despite Trump’s remarks to the contrary, several news agencies say TSA workers are calling out sick in droves. And that’s going to harm airport security. Many worry that the already low morale could put airline security at risk. One traveler/passenger at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport tweeted this week: “I asked TSA agent if I should take out my laptop out of its case and she said, ‘I dont care, Im not getting paid’.”
Secret Service staff are working unpaid: And, whether you like them or not, keeping the president and senior lawmakers and politicians alive is a paramount national security concern, yet the vast majority of front-line and back office Secret Service agents currently protecting senior administration staff are going unpaid during the shutdown.
And that’s just some of the larger departments.
The shutdown isn’t only hampering short-term efforts, but could result in long-lasting damage.
“Cyber threats dont operate on Washingtons political timetable, and they dont stop because of a shutdown,” Lisa Monaco, former homeland security advisor to the president, told Axios on Wednesday. And security firm Duo said that trying to keep all of the cyber-plates spinning at once while not at full-strength is “risky,” especially given nobody knows how long the shutdown will last.
All this for a border wall that Trump says will prevent terrorists from pouring into the U.S.
Critics say that the cost-benefit to building the wall vis-à-vis the shutdown doesn’t add up. Experts say that there hasn’t been a single case of a known terrorist to have crossed illegally into the U.S. from the Mexican border. In fact, since the September 11 attacks, more than three-quarters of all designated acts of terror were carried out by far-right extremists and not Islamic violent extremists, according to a government watchdog. The vast majority of terrorist incidents were U.S. citizens or green card holders.
A border wall might keep some terrorists out, but it’s not going to stop the terrorists who are already in the U.S. Yet, right now it seems the White House wants the appearance of security rather than the security from a quarter of what the government already has at its disposal.",It’s now 18 days since the U.S. government unceremoniously shut down because Congress couldn’t agree on a bill to fund a quarter of all federal departments — including paying their employees.

PATRICK ADAMS,"We all know the origin story of national parks in Africa, Mr. Carr told me one afternoon during a game drive through the park, where he spends roughly half of every year. They were created by colonial regimes and they were essentially fortresses: open to white, Western tourists but closed to the people whose natural heritage they were meant to protect. It was President Chissanos idea, he said, to take that legacy of colonial rule and turn it on its head to put the national park at the service of its neighbors.
Mr. Carr and his team more than 98 percent of the parks permanent employees are Mozambicans, and 85 percent are local hires have endeavored to do just that. Of Gorongosas $15 million budget for 2018, $5 million went to conservation. The rest was spent outside the park, much of it on a suite of social programs serving local villages: after-school girls clubs aimed at preventing early marriage and nurturing an interest in the sciences; training and assistance in sustainable agriculture; and mobile medical clinics through which the park implements Mozambiques national rural health care strategy.
Speaking at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in 2017, Mr. Carr said people often ask him what should be done to protect African wildlife. And every time I say, Girls in school, he said. Its the No. 1 thing we will do for this planet. To that end, he added, Gorongosa supports girls clubs in approximately 50 local schools, trains female scientists through a new masters program in conservation biology and employs women as scientists, administrators and park rangers.
As a young girl in Beira, a port city just north of the park, Dominique Gonçalves grew up hearing her fathers stories of Gorongosa. At that time, if you were black, you had to be assimilado to get in, she said, using the old Portuguese term for those subjects of the colonial empire with social standing or money. Ms. Gonçalves family had neither.
Today, local people make up the single largest demographic of visitors to Gorongosa, and Ms. Gonçalves, now a research fellow working in the park, says that when she meets young girls, they want to hear my stories.

Zack Whittaker,"It’s Huawei vs. the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe and Japan.
It’s almost as if the world’s biggest surveillance superpowers don’t want Huawei cell tower and networking router equipment inside critical networks in their countries, amid concerns of the company’s links to the Chinese military.
Huawei, they say, could be spying for the Chinese and that presents a national security risk.
But there’s a problem. Years of congressional hearings and “inconclusive” hardware inspections have presented a mixed picture on the threat that Huawei may, or may not pose. Despite the fact that the company’s founder and president is a former officer in China’s People’s Liberation Army and the company remains heavily funded by the Chinese government, there’s also no public, direct evidence that Huawei is using its equipment to spy on network traffic inside the U.S. or any other country. In any case, Huawei can’t prove a negative, so all it can do is allow governments to assess its devices which has so far found some issues but nothing conclusive to tie it to Chinese espionage actors.
That’s the crux of the argument: nobody thinks Huawei is spying now. To get caught would be too dangerous. But nobody knows that it won’t spy in the future.
The worst case nightmare scenario is that telcos will snap up Huawei’s technology and install its equipment in every nook, cranny and corner of their networks. Why wouldn’t they? The technology is cheap, said to be reliable, and is necessary for the impending 5G expansion. Then years later China exploits a hidden vulnerability that either lets its hackers steal economic secrets from businesses.
At that point, it would be too late. The network operators can’t just rip out their routers and switches. The damage is done.
Telcos need Huawei as much as Huawei needs them. But the North American and European telcos are finding it increasingly difficult to navigate pressures from their governments, which treat them as critical national infrastructure and a constant national security concern.
The reality is that China is no more a national security threat than the U.S. is to China, which has its own burgeoning networking equipment business. Just as much as the U.S. and Canada might not want to use Huawei or ZTE equipment in their networks for fear of a surprise cyberattack ten years down the line, why should China, Russia, or any other “frenemy” state choose HPE or Cisco technologies?
Companies have an option: Is the enemy you know better than the one you don’t?

Ren, the billionaire telecom mogul, broke years of public silence to dismiss U.S. accusations the telecoms giant helps Beijing spy on Western governments and to praise Donald Trump for his tax cuts.

The U.S. government has persisted across administrations with its fiery rhetoric over Huawei’s links to the Chinese government, since a House Intelligence Committee report in 2012 pushed for a domestic ban on equipment built by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese electronics maker, and even warning against using their consumer phones. Noticeably absent from the House’s report was any specific proof of Chinese spying.
Core to the panel’s claim that a router that turns on in the middle of the night, starts sending back large data packs, and it happens to be sent back to China,” said former congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI). Huawei, which has always denied the claims, has long called for evidence. Only this week, the U.S. said it doesn’t need to show proof, citing the company’s ability to be “leveraged by the Chinese government.”
The report contained claims of bribery and corruption, copyright infringement and more, but there was no smoking gun that proved that the company was spying only that it could at the request of Beijing.
China’s authoritarian rule notwithstanding, the country says that it doesn’t have a single law that can compel a company to spy on its behalf or put backdoors in its products. Westerners are rightfully skeptical: in China, the government doesn’t need a law to say it can or can’t do something.
Yet ironically, it’s the U.S. and the U.K. and more recently Australia that have laws in place that can in fact compel a company to turn over data, or force a company to install backdoors. After the Edward Snowden disclosures that revealed the scope of U.S. surveillance, China retaliated by dropping U.S. technology from its networks and systems. That was no bother for China; it has its own booming tech industry, and just started using its own homegrown equipment instead.
Other countries aren’t so lucky, and more often than not are stuck between buying their tech from the two spying giants.
Western nations would rather trust U.S. technology with its powerful surveillance laws, while the rest of the world either trusts Chinese technology or simply doesn’t care.
Any technology can be a national security risk. It’s less selecting the right gear, and more picking your poison.","It’s Huawei vs. the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe and Japan.

Jordan Crook,"In the wake of FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb’s abrupt resignation, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar III announced that Dr. Ned Sharpless will serve as interim commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
Since October 2017, Dr. Sharpless served as Director of the National Cancer Institute and, before that, worked as a researcher and hematologist-oncologist at the University of North Carolina. He is also a cofounder of G1 Therapeutics, a biotech firm focused on cancer treatment therapies that went public in May of 2017.
Dr. Sharpless is a temporary appointment, with Secretary Azar saying that the search is on for a permanent candidate for the position, according to the NYT.

The change comes at a tumultuous time for the e-cigarette industry in particular, which has been a focal point for Commissioner Gottlieb. As vaping continues to grow in popularity among teens, Gottlieb has enforced new rules for the industry and promised to keep a close watch on youth use of these products and the companies that sell them.
Gottlieb praised the appointment:

CHRISTOPHER ALI,"I recently traveled to the Midwest to find out where and how federal broadband policies have failed rural America. I spoke with residents, business owners, broadband providers, farmers and officials, and they all told me about the need for high-speed connectivity and a renewed federal strategy.
On the trip, I learned how high-speed broadband keeps professionals living and working in rural America, like the insurance agent I met in Rock County, Minn., who no longer has to lease a second office to digitally file paperwork. It keeps rural businesses competitive, like the radio station in Rock County that no longer needs to subscribe to two Verizon accounts, paying over $1,000 per month for internet service. And it keeps rural students studying, since around 70 percent of teachers assign homework that requires an internet connection. Rock County is one example of how communities in rural America can take advantage of the opportunities afforded by broadband. 
Almost every state has a broadband deployment plan, Minnesota foremost among them. With so many plans, however, come as many definitions of broadband, target speeds, eligibility requirements for grants and a host of unique priorities. To ensure that high-speed broadband is available for all rural Americans, regardless of state, we need a national rural broadband plan. Standardizing state rural broadband policies isnt enough: We need a plan to identify and galvanize stakeholders not just the major telecommunications companies to inspire change in our current policy approach and democratize the funding process, and to champion the cause of rural broadband across the country. President Franklin Roosevelt and the Rural Electrification Administration did it in 1936 with electricity. We can do the same today.
A national rural broadband plan would designate a single agency preferably the Rural Utilities Service, with its century-long relationship with rural communities and offices in every state as the primary coordinator for rural broadband. Today we have two agencies the F.C.C. and the Rural Utilities Service with two different, and sometimes conflicting, agendas controlling a lot of money. A designated point agency is crucial to coordinate federal expenditures and to encourage more data sharing, collaboration and coordination between the F.C.C. and the Rural Utilities Service.
This plan would mandate the creation of a new national broadband map, using granular and testable data rather than what we have now, where broadband providers report advertised rather than actual speeds to the F.C.C., and where broadband deployment is calculated by census block rather than by household. The F.C.C., which manages the current national broadband map, has grossly overestimated broadband deployment throughout the country because when a single building in a census block is reported to have broadband, the entire block is considered served.",The government has given a lot of money to major telecommunications companies without much regulatory accountability.,2019-02-07T00:34:15Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",We Need a National Rural Broadband Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/rural-broadband-fcc.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/opinion/06ali/06ali-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1
Nick Douglas,"Since 1950 the National Book Foundation has awarded the National Book Award to authors such as Colson Whitehead, William Faulkner, Beverly Cleary, and Jesmyn Ward. The Foundation also runs several programs for readers and writers, including the BookUp after-school reading program. In March 2016 the Foundation hired Guernica publisher Lisa Lucas as executive director. We talked to Lucas about how she runs the Foundation day to day. Location: New York City Current Gig: Executive Director, National Book Foundation One word that best describes how you work: Intensely Current mobile device: iPhone 6 Plus Current computer: iMac, who knows what model? Not me. First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. It was kind of a wacky path here, although once I left college, I’ve almost always worked for nonprofits. I started at Steppenwolf Theatre Company, where I worked in Development. Then I moved back to the East Coast and worked in development and marketing at a youth theater (called TADA!) before landing at the Tribeca Film Institute, where I was the Director of Education for years. In the end, I loved books most of all and so I ended up taking all of that fundraising, marketing, and program experience and dedicating it to the written word. Changing careers (or disciplines) at 32 was slightly daunting, and I started through volunteer work at the Brooklyn Book Festival and Guernica Magazine. Eventually, Guernica turned into a proper, paying job and I did that for 3.5 years. Its proximity to the book industry taught me so much and during that time I fell stone cold in love with it. And that landed me here. Take us through a recent workday. No day is the same here. Yesterday, we had an office cleaning day, because books pile up. So it was all boxes, tape, loud music, pizza and Marie Kondo around here. Otherwise, there are a lot of meetings. You’d think that with such a small staff there wouldn’t be so many meetings, but we’re always working together and it just ends up happening. We’re also a national organization, so many of our partners are outside of New York City and so we love a good conference call. Small organizations get a lot done with very few people, so we all wear a lot of hats. On any given day we are discussing potential judges for the National Book Awards, paying the bills, writing/approving copy for our website or newsletter, writing grant proposals, throwing parties, prepping for board meetings, you name it. We also end up doing arts &amp; crafts projects far more often than you might guess. What apps, gadgets, or tools can’t you live without? My phone. My little brother calls it “Lisa’s mobile command center.” What’s your workspace setup like? Pretty generic, I suppose. Computer, phone, desk, lamp, pen, mug, water bottle. My office does have a number of bookshelves, which is necessary! I also have this big old wooden table that I inherited from the director before me and I love it so much I’m going to try to sneak it out with me if I ever leave. What’s your best shortcut or life hack? I’m very bad at shortcuts. I like longhand, paper copies of things, phone calls. I need to read this site more and learn some! Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them? Team Book, comprised of my 6 patient and wonderful colleagues, are superheroes. Nothing would get done without them. They are the bedrock of this place. Gabrielle, my assistant, is very good at making sure that things aren’t burning to flames because I’ve forgotten something. How do you keep track of what you have to do? I’m a big fan of Google Calendar. At the Foundation, we keep all of our meetings and schedules on one big shared one so we all know who is where, when, since we are all moving around so much! What’s your least favorite thing to do, and how do you deal with it? Nonprofits above a certain size have to get audited every year. It is the worst. I eat more snacks when we are doing our audit. How do you recharge? What do you do when you want to forget about work? I walk a lot. I find that if I leave my phone at home and go for a big, long wander, eventually the work thoughts drop away and the landscape, people-watching, and general to-ing and fro-ing of city life takes over. What’s your favorite side project? Sleeping. What are you currently reading, or what’s something you’d recommend? I’m currently reading Wolf Hall, which is my holiday reading. (I always try to read something I’ve been meaning to read for years or a classic.) It’s extraordinary. [Lisa gave these answers in December, we just run with a big backlog.—Ed.] Fill in the blank: I’d love to see _________ answer these same questions. Kevin Young. What’s the best advice you’ve ever received? If you know that you can do something better, do it that way. Otherwise you have no excuse when things go wrong.

Nick Douglas,"“The important thing to know about spelling is that it’s not just rote memorization,” says Ananya Vinay, champion of the 2017 Scripps National Spelling Bee, who will ceremonially open this year’s bee next week. While Vinay uses flashcards to study specific words, she says the real trick is learning where different words come from. English spelling is mostly ambiguous because it borrows words from so many other languages. Each of those languages has more reliable spelling rules. So to spell a word, you want to know its origin. (In the bee, contestants may request a word’s origin, as well as its definition, part of speech, and use in a sentence.) Most of the time that origin is Latin or Greek. Those two languages make up 60% of English, says Vinay. When you know a word is Latinate, you know to look out for doubled consonants near the beginning of the word. Italian, the modern language closest to Latin, also uses double letters; Vinay loves the word cappuccino. French comes with surprising silent letters, like the t in escargot, or the z in assoilzie, a word meaning “absolve or acquit” that went from French to Scottish to English while still sounding like a French word: “ah-soil-ee.” German has its own quirks: A sh sound in a germanic word might be spelled sch, and German is behind English’s infuriating “I before E” rules: In German, ie and ei always mean two different sounds. One helpful mnemonic (which we didn’t get from 13-year-old Vinay) is that wein rhymes with wine, and bier is just like beer. English words with Asian origins are mercifully phonetic, as are Spanish words. Some anglicized vowel sounds might trip you up, but you’re less likely to run into silent letters. Vinay uses study app Quizlet (whose representative put us in touch with Vinay) to go through her flashcards. She’s released two study sets for beginners and for advanced spellers on the site. (Previous Scripps champions can’t compete again, so now Vinay coaches her school’s team.) She likes sorting her words into lists of specific language origins. The app tracks her mistakes so she can come back to problem words. “I could do 600 words in an hour if I wanted to,” she tells us. Why learn spelling when your computer can do it for you with dotted red lines? Because learning about words and languages means learning history and mythology: Vinay excitedly tells Lifehacker about Latinate words like “narcissist,” named after the tragic son of a nymph and a river god who fell in love with his own reflection and drowned. Vinay says spelling has helped her in other studies and academic competitions, like debate and history classes. In the Science Bowl, she can identify names of minerals, chemicals, or species by recognizing the root words. She can see the connections between concepts, and how those concepts spread and evolved. Spelling isn’t trivia—it’s a record of human history.","“The important thing to know about spelling is that it’s not just rote memorization,” says Ananya Vinay, champion of the 2017 Scripps National Spelling Bee, who will ceremonially open this year’s bee next week.

Taylor Hatmaker,"With one fell swoop, President Trump just swapped out the “ warrior scholar ” for the warmonger. I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 22, 2018 Today Trump tweeted that General H.R. McMaster will step down as John Bolton, a deeply controversial former U.S. ambassador, steps into the role of national security advisor. Bolton will move into the high-ranking foreign policy advisor position just as the U.S. is approaching talks with North Korea, an extremely delicate diplomatic maneuver between two volatile leaders. Last month, Bolton argued the legal case for a pre-emptive strike on North Korea — an extreme position in which even the best case scenario could result in broad carnage for the U.S. and its allies. Bolton established his extreme and hawkish reputation during his tenure as the undersecretary of state for arms control during the Bush administration. In that advisory position, Bolton argued strongly in favor of the Iraq war, tying his justification to the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. If most people could agree that McMaster was a respectable choice for national security advisor, just as many seem to oppose Bolton becoming a prominent figure in shaping Trump’s foreign policy. When Bolton’s name was floated just after the election, Republican Senator Rand Paul penned an op-ed denouncing Bolton as “hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the US has made in the last 15 years.” While McMaster was sometimes characterized as a cautious futurist, Bolton’s record on tech is less clear. We’re sure to learn more about the new advisor’s various postures quickly, as Bolton stirs up bipartisan anxiety around U.S. foreign policy, particularly in Iran and North Korea. After the swift fall of Michael Flynn in early 2017 and the quick appointment of McMaster, Bolton will become Trump’s third national security advisor in less than two years.","With one fell swoop, President Trump just swapped out the “warrior scholar” for the warmonger.

Taylor Hatmaker,"Trump’s third national security advisor John Bolton shares at least one thing in common with his first one, Michael Flynn: both men have ties to Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm at the center of a new Facebook privacy firestorm. In a new story, The New York Times reports that John Bolton’s political action committee The John Bolton Super PAC hired Cambridge Analytica in August 2014, “months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data.” In Cambridge Analytica’s early days, Bolton’s PAC funneled $1.2 million toward polling and “behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging” over the course of two years. “To do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work,” The New York Times reports. That research supported candidates on the right, including Republican Thom Tillis’s 2014 bid for the Senate. According to the report, Bolton’s PAC was aware that the data came from Facebook users, though it’s not clear if Bolton knew that the data was obtained through a Facebook developer without consent. Cambridge Analytica continues to challenge reports that it held onto data improperly obtained. In a new statement, the company’s acting CEO Alexander Tayler maintains the company’s ignorance about the apparently unlawfully obtained data its parent company licensed from a Facebook developer. “The company believed that the data had been obtained in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws… I became Chief Data Officer for Cambridge Analytica in October 2015. Shortly after, Facebook requested that we delete the data. We immediately deleted the raw data from our file server, and began the process of searching for and removing any of its derivatives in our system. When Facebook sought further assurances a year ago, we carried out an internal audit to make sure that all the data, all derivatives and backups had been deleted, and gave Facebook a certificate to this effect. Please can I be absolutely clear: we did not use any GSR data in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.” Like Cambridge Analytica, Bolton’s PAC was a financial beneficiary of Robert Mercer, a conservative financier with considerable influence in the Trump administration.","Trump’s third national security advisor John Bolton shares at least one thing in common with his first one, Michael Flynn: both men have ties to Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm at the center of a new Facebook privacy firestorm.

Erin Griffith,"Last year’s national conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace began in the tech industry. In the months that followed Susan J. Fowler’s February blog post about sexual harassment at Uber, a number of well-known tech executives—particularly, venture capitalists and startup executives—were ousted from positions of power after allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct. But with the October downfall of Harvey Weinstein, Hollywood took the lead on the conversation. In the wake of the many reports of harassment in entertainment, the industry launched initiatives, held high-profile protests, and grabbed headlines. Earlier this month, 300 women in Hollywood created Times Up, an anti-harassment initiative that includes a legal-defense fund for victims of harassment. They donned black dresses and pins supporting the effort at the Golden Globes ceremony while speaking out in their acceptance speeches. Comparatively, calls for reform in tech have faded into the background, leading some to wonder whether techies are hoping the problem quietly disappears. Limited partners (the investors in venture funds) remain interested in backing certain ousted investors, according to TechCrunch. “I’m not doing [my job as an institutional investor] for social justice. I do that in my philanthropy,” one investor told TechCrunch. Accused harassers like former Binary Capital partner Justin Caldbeck have already re-emerged. Caldbeck spoke to Duke University students about the dangers of “bro culture” in November and has been sending nearly identical apology messages to his public critics. Andy Rubin, the entrepreneur accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate at Google, returned to his job at smartphone startup Essential after a two-week leave of absence. Industry leaders are proceeding cautiously. The National Venture Capital Association spent the better part of last year working with law firms, HR specialists and venture partners to create a suggested list of HR policies and best practices for venture firms, including detailed sections defining harassment and discrimination and guidelines for handling it. The group also plans to offer suggested ways firms can facilitate education and training around harassment and discrimination. But it has not yet released the results. “We’ve been careful to be deliberate rather than quick,” says NVCA CEO Bobby Franklin. Firms will not have to adopt NVCA’s proposals, and the group isn’t planning to track the industry’s progress, Franklin says. Many venture firms are small partnerships, which means some employment laws may not apply. Franklin says many firms quietly adopted education programs and updated their HR policies after the wave of harassment allegations, but they are skittish about advertising their efforts because “they know on the overall diversity stuff they’re not where they need to be.” He adds, “Not many firms can claim they have a nice balance of diversity, so they’re just afraid that if they try to put their best foot forward, someone will point out a wart they have somewhere else.” Venture capital is a tricky business for employment law. Many of the harassment charges leveled at venture capitalists happen in informal situations—in a gray area between personal and professional."" Entrepreneurs pitching their startups don’t have a formal business relationship with a venture capitalist; even when a VC firm invests, no employment laws or company policies cover such interactions. “The firms that [adopt policies] probably don’t have that problem to begin with,” says Patrick Quinlan, CEO of HR analytics company Convercent. “You’re not going to get the bad actor to volunteer for that.” In September, California State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson proposed changing state employment law to offer legal protections to entrepreneurs. Yet plenty of techies remain hopeful about efforts underway to fix the industry’s problems. If anything, companies are motivated by the business damage they risk by not addressing toxic workplace cultures that enable harassment. A year ago Uber, the world’s most-valuable privately held startup, felt untouchable. But the company’s 2017 troubles—from executive turnover to a messy board fight over the ouster of CEO Travis Kalanick—have shown all startups how ugly things can get. Convercent’s Quinlan says he’s noticed a shift in how tech companies are addressing the problem. Previously, “companies wanted to have the ostrich view of ethics, which is, ‘If I don’t hear it and see it, it’s not happening,’” he says. “A big change we have seen is that companies realize you’re much better off identifying the problem and working to solve it. That evolution is happening fast.” In 2017, the number of sexual harassment reports across Convercent’s clients (including non-tech companies) in the second half of the year jumped 67% compared to the same period in 2016. Quinlan says companies are addressing harassment more proactively, reiterating values in every employee meeting, as opposed to sharing codes of conduct once a year. “What we are seeing and hearing is the desire to have very continuous conversations,” he says. “One of the big trends is ‘tone from the top.’ How do you make sure you’re saying the right things, and consistently?” Convercent and others are trying to apply artificial intelligence to the problem. Typically, agents on HR hotlines must follow a script, which doesn’t allow for flexible conversations and may not generate a full understanding of what happened. Further, hotlines make it difficult to follow up on anonymous tips that may not provide all the necessary information. In October, Convercent introduced a product that uses text messages and a chatbot to gather information through a “conversation” with people reporting harassment. (The reporters can remain anonymous if they prefer.) For the venture industry’s unique set of problems, one solution might look like the services of Callisto, a technology nonprofit that’s used on 12 college campuses and two locations of the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy school. Callisto provides a neutral third-party system for victims to report harassment. In the reports, victims are asked whether they would want to be connected to other victims of the same assailant if there is a match in the system. CEO Jessica Ladd says 15% of the victims who have opted into this service have matched other victims of the same assailant. The #MeToo movement and the stories of harassment in tech have shown the world what Ladd already knows—the power of numbers. When victims speak together, they’re more likely to be believed, and less likely to be sued. Callisto’s system is designed to help victims in those situations, and to increase their choices. Not all victims want to sue for damages, which would mean going public with their accusations. Some want to see their assailant removed from campus or face criminal charges. Some merely seek to avoid personal interactions with that person. Others want to change the person’s behavior, using the Callisto database to monitor for future incidents. Applying such a system to venture capital would pose a key problem: Who would have access to the central database. Ladd suggests the industry appoint an independent ombudsperson to review the submissions. She notes that lawyers are trained to steer victims toward lawsuits, when that’s not what many victims want. “A lot of victims... don’t want to be the face of this in the New York Times. If we can create other options, we would prefer that, as would the limited partners and the other partners,” Ladd says. “They’d rather know about this before it ends up in the press.” Ladd acknowledges that such a system may result in less transparency and awareness about instances of harassment, but believes it’s more important to settle situations in the way the victims want. “True change from this is not going to be coming from a never ending #MeToo movement of an endless media frenzy. People are going to get bored and we need to have other ways to dealing with it,” she says. In the meantime, women in venture, who comprise just 6 percent of the industry’s investing partners, are taking initiatives. Led by Sequoia Capital Partner Jess Lee, a group of venture investors has created Female Founder Office Hours, a series of events aimed at connecting female founders with female investors. One hundred female founders attended each of the group’s first two events, held in San Francisco and New York, with plans for more events in more cities. Upfront Ventures Partner Kara Nortman says the initiative is meant to help founders but has had the side effect of increased communication among the small community of female venture investors. Now they discuss everything from deals to the latest news about sexual harassment over a WhatsApp group, which Nortman says is necessary in an industry where venture firms and startup boards of directors rarely have more than one woman. She says there have been “a lot of positive side benefits like camaraderie and inclusiveness that hasn’t happened before.” Few expect sweeping changes to happen overnight. “I think it’s going take a long, long time with methodical, consistent effort,” Nortman says. “It’s great that we’re shining a spotlight on the worst behavior, but the hardest thing is going to be creating a space for women to shine and get the promotions they deserve and hired as CEOs and venture partners.” Improper Behavior","The national conversation about harassment started in tech, but other industries, like Hollywood, have leapt to the forefront.",2018-01-22T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",What Has Tech Done to Fix Its Harassment Problem?,https://www.wired.com/story/what-has-tech-done-to-fix-its-harassment-problem/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a5ea8be578ad833ef6878d6/191:100/pass/GoogleEntrance-Art.jpg,wired,Wired,National,1
Laura Mallonee,"Typical aerial photographs of the Amazon rainforest show a green expanse of trees so thick you can’t see ground. But the ones Ernesto Benavides captures are almost entirely brown, revealing a wasteland pocked by muddy, gaping holes where trees once fought for light. Benavides’s images depict illegal gold mining camps inside the Tambopata National Reserve, a 1,061-square-mile park where more than 12,000 species of plants, insects, and animals make their home. Benavides photographs them from the open doors of helicopters manned by armed police. ""From the air, you can see the whole ecosystem has been affected,"" he says. ""It's sick."" Illegal gold mining is a multibillion dollar industry in Peru more lucrative than cocaine. Tens of thousands of miners operate thousands of small-scale settlements. They raze trees and create pit mines, using dredgers, pumps, and other machinery to extract the riches beneath the soil. The consequences have been devastating: The Madre de Dios region of Peru, which includes Tambopata, has lost an estimated 148,000 acres of forest. Liquid mercury from the mining process also makes its way into the Madre de Dios River, poisoning tens of thousands of people living along it. The rate of forest loss has more than quadrupled since 1999. Experts blame the soaring gold prices that followed the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the construction of the Interoceanic Highway, which allows prospectors to transport heavy equipment into the heart of the jungle. The government does what it can to fight it. Since 2012, police have carried out hundreds of raids on the mining camps— more than 200 last year alone. They burn buildings and blow up millions of dollars worth of equipment, but the miners return. ""This cancer is still growing, and the Amazon is really threatened by these gold fields,"" Benavides says. Benavides lives in Lima, Peru's arid desert capital. He started visiting Madre de Dios a decade ago for various photographic assignments. But he never dared visit a gold mining camp until 2015, when Agence France-Presse sent him on a helicopter spin arranged by the Ministry of the Interior. It shocked him. ""At the beginning you see a huge field of green,"" he says, ""then suddenly it begins to appear: holes and mud, a man-made desert."" He has shadowed the police three more times on raids to La Pampa, the area inside Tambopata where the camps are located, and plans to go back. Benavides shoots out the helicopter’s open door, a strap holding him tight as he cranes his upper body far enough out to point his Nikon D4 straight down. It's loud and windy, requiring a shutter speed of 1/5000 to counter the camera shake. The scene below is often deserted, as the miners, on a tip, cleared out before they arrived. His jaw-dropping images make the extent of the destruction clear. But it’s on the ground, when the wind from the chopper dies down and the heat of the place envelops him, that Benavides says he feels it most. ""The jungle is hot, but you always have the shade of trees,"" he says. In this jungle, there are none.

LAURA M. HOLSON,"Ann Coulter found her voice as a Cassandra for the right in the early 2000s. In the Trump era, Ms. Loesch has found hers as a telegenic warrior for the N.R.A. She shares some characteristics with President Trump, said Megyn Kelly, the NBC talk show host who used to have her on as a guest on Fox News when Ms. Kelly had a show there. “She is compelling television,” she said. Even Ms. Kelly, a friend, has noticed that Ms. Loesch has embraced a more barbed tone the past year. “On my show, she was never a bomb thrower,” Ms. Kelly said. “We tried to veer away from that.” But public conversation has grown more cacophonous since Mr. Trump’s election. And unlike Ms. Coulter in her heyday, Ms. Loesch faces an ever-expanding field of conservative pundits willing to do anything to entertain followers on Twitter, in their jostle for the seats at Fox’s table. “I’ve been told I’m a whore for the N.R.A.,” Ms. Loesch said. “I’m a prostitute for the N.R.A. But I believe so strongly in the natural right to bear arms. I feel so passionately about that.” Photo Ms. Loesch on her show in 2014, broadcasting from CPAC, an annual conference for American conservatives. Credit Michael Mathes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Dismissal only firms her resolve. “I’m feeling like I am doing what I want to do,” she said, “and what I feel fulfilled in doing.” Wonder Woman For as long as Ms. Loesch can remember, the world has been a scary place. She was born Dana Eaton in 1978 in Hematite, Mo., a small community about 40 miles south of St. Louis. Her parents divorced when she was in kindergarten and she has not spoken to her father in more than a decade. Her mother worked three jobs after they moved to nearby Festus, Mo., bringing home bags of granola bars after her shift at a local granola factory. Ms. Loesch said she spent school-day afternoons at home alone or with an aunt. “Now, you could say it was like a meth ’hood,” Ms. Loesch said of her old neighborhood. “People were fighting. It was kind of crazy. It wasn’t the most stable of childhoods.” Ms. Loesch mostly found refuge at her grandparents’ home in Annapolis, Mo., a town of about 450 people nestled in the rural Ozarks. Her family voted for Democrats. Her grandfather hunted deer and raccoon. Despite episodes of violence, Ms. Loesch idealized summers in Annapolis in “Flyover Country.” In the book, she recalled her grandfather standing on the porch one night with a shotgun in his hands. Ms. Loesch’s aunt had just arrived; her estranged husband had threatened to kill her. “Looking back,” Ms. Loesch said, “I think I always wanted to know that I was safe.” In the late 1990s, Ms. Loesch attended Webster University in suburban St. Louis, studying journalism, but dropped out after she got pregnant. In 2000, she married Chris Loesch, the baby’s father: a musician and son of a preacher who now manages her career. They attend weekly services at the Church of Christ. And on Halloween they give a party that harks back to more pleasant childhood memories. “Halloween was big with her mom,” said Leigh Wambsganns, a friend. Last October Ms. Loesch said she dressed as Wonder Woman. Photo Ms. Loesch and her husband, Chris, listen to basic firearm safety instructions. Credit Allison V. Smith for The New York Times As a new parent in St. Louis, she blogged about motherhood and began her long-running radio program, “The Dana Show.” She became disillusioned with Democratic politics, though, in the wake of President Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. She helped found the St. Louis Tea Party, organizing protests and speaking at rallies. And, in 2010, she joined Andrew Breitbart at his website, one of several new voices railing against establishment politics and media bias. After Mr. Breitbart died in 2012, Ms. Loesch clashed with Steve Bannon, the former Trump ally who had been named executive chair of Breitbart News. She sued to get out of her contract. In 2014, she moved to Dallas to work for The Blaze. Ms. Loesch’s particular brand of attack proved unpalatable to mainstream audiences. In 2012, CNN, which had hired her as a political commentator, distanced itself from comments she made on her radio show supporting a group of Marines who urinated on dead Taliban soldiers. She claims the reporting of her comments was “disingenuous.” A year later, she was banned from the now defunct “Piers Morgan Live” after getting into a Twitter fight with the host. “I thought we made up,” she said. “But then we started fighting again.” And, in 2016, Ms. Loesch expressed personal ire at Kayleigh McEnany, now the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. Ms. McEnany had chided a friend of Ms. Loesch’s for not supporting Mr. Trump, then a Republican candidate, during a CNN segment. “Babycakes, this was more than just going on television and flashing your pearly whites and your flat chest, red dress, over-sprayed bleach blond hair,” Ms. Loesch told radio listeners. This time, it seemed, she had gone too far. Ms. McEnany was undergoing treatment for a genetic predisposition to breast cancer. Both Ms. Loesch and Ms. McEnany declined to discuss the matter. Home on the Range Ms. Loesch’s performance for the N.R.A. has had more polish. Last April, she was featured in a recruiting ad for the organization called “ Violence of Lies.” Scenes of street violence and protests flashed onscreen as Ms. Loesch called for citizens to fight media bias and liberal politicians with the “clenched fist of truth.” (The N.R.A. also released an ad in 2017 aimed at The New York Times, claiming media bias.) According to Andrew Arulanandam, the N.R.A.’s managing director of public affairs, the message was “inspired” by the chief executive, Wayne LaPierre Jr., whose association donated $30 million in campaign support to Mr. Trump. According to news reports, the N.R.A. may have a connection to the investigation of Russia’s involvement in the election. “Violence of Lies” has been viewed nearly three million times on YouTube alone. “Dana comes across clearly to our members and gun owners,” Mr. Arulanandam said. But even some in those groups found the video unnecessarily, even dangerously, incendiary. An online petition was circulated, demanding Facebook remove it. On Twitter, DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist, called the video “an open call to violence to protect white supremacy.” In response, Ms. Loesch challenged him to come on her show and “tell me to my face I’m a racist.” He didn’t, saying Ms. Loesch seeks to use opponents as a foil. “I don’t believe that she was really talking to me,” he said in an interview. “She was using me to rile up the base.” Last week Ms. Loesch said she had no interest in speaking with Mr. Mckesson. Ms. Loesch’s boss, Mr. LaPierre, has a history of inflammatory rhetoric at the N.R.A., which has five million members. In 1995, he was forced to apologize after President George H. W. Bush canceled his N.R.A. membership in protest. The N.R.A. had sent out a fund-raising letter calling law enforcement “ jackbooted government thugs ” who threatened to hurt Americans. “That is what they do,” said Representative Kathleen Rice, a Democrat of New York, who has sparred with Ms. Loesch, also on Twitter. “The N.R.A says their members are under attack.” Continue reading the main story","Dana Loesch, a conservative political commentator, at a gun range at Crossfire Defense Academy & Range in Flower Mound, Tex.",2018-01-20T11:00:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The National Rifle Association’s Telegenic Warrior,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/style/dana-loesch-national-rifle-association.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/21/fashion/21LOESCH1/21LOESCH1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1

Antonio García Martínez,"Find yourself a map of the world's major shipping routes (or just click here ) and compare it to a map of the world's undersea internet cables (…and here ): They are strikingly similar, a thick band of traffic across the Atlantic between Europe and North America; a sizable swath from Asia to the US Pacific Coast; a longer haul from Europe to Asia across Africa; and a few thinner connections between the northern and southern hemispheres. Both sets of routes have their origins in a 400-year-old world trading system that dates back to the Age of Sail, yet while the movement of goods over oceans is highly regulated by centuries of law and custom, the movement of data via fiber-optic cables is very much not. Data can now be stored in whatever corner of the world best serves the interests of cost and convenience, and it can be retrieved at the literal speed of light or secreted away in the dark. This digital version of mare liberum (“free seas,” the guiding legal notion coined by 17th-century Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius) is only now being subject to real legal scrutiny, and it’s a once-in-an-era opportunity to define how we regulate the global trade of information and intellectual property. Unfortunately, bureaucrats are busy writing data localization laws that stem from the age of ink-stained vellum paper rather than our current Dropbox reality. Consider this instructive legal quiz: If US authorities have a warrant to obtain data from a US company about a US citizen, but that data happens to live abroad because of whatever cloud caching particulars, must the US company hand over the data to US authorities? Antonio García Martínez ( @antoniogm ) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Before turning to writing, he dropped out of a doctoral program in physics to work on Goldman Sachs’ credit trading desk, then joined the Silicon Valley startup world, where he founded his own startup (acquired by Twitter in 2011), and finally joined Facebook’s early monetization team, where he headed their targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year, and his writing has appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian, and The Washington Post. He splits his time between a sailboat on the SF Bay and a yurt in Washington’s San Juan Islands. The answer, incredibly, isn’t at all clear. In the US, right now, there are two completely contradictory court judgements in effect. In 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals judged that Microsoft need not comply with a US warrant requesting data stored overseas (even though the parties in question are subject to US law). Then last year, in another unrelated case, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. completely contravened the earlier ruling, ordering Google to turn over user data to federal investigators, even though the data was stored overseas. The story only gets more complex as US and European governments try to carve out digital free-trade zones in the face of competing local and state laws. For example, the Trump administration, as part of its NAFTA renegotiation bid, wants total data openness among the US, Canada, and Mexico. However, such a deal would violate laws in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Nova Scotia that mandate local storage for any personal data. Similarly, the European Union is pitching a Digital Single Market to its members that would unify all European data, whether government or commercial, and allow its use and physical storage anywhere within the EU. However, many European countries possess detailed legislation around where public records are stored. France (of course) has gone so far as to build a local cloud and call it le cloud souverein, which French businesses are encouraged to adopt over any regional or global cloud services. Quel shitshow, and it begs the question: Can a global cloud system peacefully coexist with national sovereignty? All this data is ultimately the magnetization state of a thin patch of cobalt alloy on a hard drive, and where that hard drive lives should be immaterial, in both senses of the word. In the same way the designer of a mobile app interface doesn't much think of how the app's data will be saved and retrieved from memory—that being the job of the language compiler and operating system—the managers of our legal and economic systems shouldn't care too much where a document or piece of user data happens to physically live. To use the dismissive charge leveled by software engineers when someone reaches way down the programming language or technological stack into the murky depths where they’re not welcome nor knowledgeable, our politicians and regulators are “violating the abstraction layer” by trying to dictate where data is physically stored. For the purposes of obtaining that data through a search warrant, how that data is stored should be about as relevant as the ink color a contractual signatory used to seal their business deal. This is not to say that “information wants to be free,” nor is it the recipe for anarchy it might seem. Personal privacy concerns and intellectual property rights must remain paramount, and the leviathan of the state, with its coercive power, should still reign supreme inside its own borders. Tangible goods (and digital bits) can transit the deep, blue sea, but they need to be subject to the laws of the land when they cross into the land. (Even Facebook, which formerly countenanced no local restrictions, is now bending over backwards to comply with local German election laws or Israeli hate speech legislation.) It’s the tradeoff between free movement and national sovereignty, as always, that’s tricky. Even a suddenly-contrite Facebook will have trouble managing the data laws of almost two hundred nation-states. Instead of this ugly patchwork of local, national, and regional laws, regulators need to come together to create new trade agreements (and strengthen existing ones) that treat data like so much oil or grain or any other tradable good. In facilitating and safeguarding the lawful exchange of data between independent countries, whether in the name of commerce or the rule of law, these digital trade agreements would help lay the groundwork for the global, digital infrastructure that our future selves deserve. Before long, talking about data somehow possessing a physical location, out of reach to some and too easily hidden by others, will become one of those quaint throwbacks we’ll completely forget.

Josh Ocampo,"After declaring a national emergency on Friday in a desperate attempt to fund a U.S.-Mexico border, President Trump did what any president does after a national crisis: He golfed all weekend at his club in West Palm, Florida (where membership fees start at $250,000 a pop). And if this weeks news is any indication, hell have a lot of reason to golf over the coming days.
Sixteen states (for now), including California, New York, and New Jersey, are suing the president over his misuse of the declaration of a national emergency, which would divert several billion dollars to the construction of the wall. But is it even possible to sue a president while hes still in office? Better yet, can a private citizen, like you or I, sue the president? Turns out, its a resounding yes (though it wont always be that simple).
Is it possible to sue a president while hes in office?
Yes, sort of. But first, theres a ton of legal jargon involved (as well as unchartered territory), so lets provide some context:

For one, a president cannot be sued for things done in a personal capacity while hes in office (this is referred to as absolute immunity). If you do plan to sue the president while hes in office, you would technically sue the United States, according to Vice. However, you can sue a president for any actions that occurred before that president took office.
Recently, things have gotten even murkier with Trump in office. Many state courts have argued that though Trump is immune from federal lawsuits, he isnt immune from those on the state level (which explains the case in question). 
Putting that aside, in order to sue the president, youd have to prove legal standing. In other words, you have to show proof that youve been harmed or injured by an act of the president. Unfortunately, this is where cases tend to fall apart.
Does this mean *I* can sue the president?
Yes! But it will be a long, winding road ahead. A private citizen can absolutely sue a president for things done prior to their position in office.
Treason, the act of betraying ones country, is a serious charge. Under US law, its defined so

In order to sue the president personally in a federal court, you cant live in the same state as any other plaintiff and your damages would have to exceed $75,000, according to Vice News. Anything less and youd sue on the state level. To reiterate, the problem becomes that many cases are dismissed and youd have to prove legal standing.
Has a president ever been sued before?
Yesmany, in fact. Presidents and lawsuits seem to go hand in hand (which is only mildly terrifying).
First, there are two landmark lawsuits which have laid out the groundwork for the presidents immunity.
In 1982, a former Air Force employee attempted to sue former President Richard Nixon for an unlawful firing (an alleged retaliation for giving testimony about costs and difficulties while working on a particular project). The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nixon, forever solidifying presidential immunity.
Last night, BuzzFeed News published evidence that Donald Trump actively instructed his ex-personal

Later, in 1997, this immunity was tested during the sexual harassment case by Paula Jones brought against President Bill Clinton. Clinton argued the case would become a burdensome distraction to his duties as president. The Supreme Court, however, ruled against him, leading to his impeachment and stipulating that immunity isnt granted to a president for actions taken before his presidency. 
How about Trump? Well, in the first few months of his presidency, he was sued 134 times aloneand that number has kept on growing. Heres a brief list of people and organizations who have sued (or are suing) the president:
Well, what happens next?
If you havent figured it out already, its tough to sue the president (although not impossible). Most cases are dismissed, or otherwise, delayed infinitely. 
Its also just a big game of unknowns. Given that the circumstances constituting a national emergency are vague, this could only benefit Trump, whos using the declaration as a last-ditch effort at producing a wall. However, states could very well set a new precedentif theyre successful in court. 
And if you want to personally sue the president, well, youll have to have a lot of time and money on your hands and one hell of a case.

Kate Clark,"SpaceX successfully launched the United States Air Forces first Global Positioning System  (GPS) III satellite, nicknamed Vespucci, from Cape Canaveral, Florida this morning in what was the aerospace company’s first U.S. national security mission to date.
The company had planned to complete the launch, its last of the year, earlier this week but heavy winds imposed delays.
SpaceX won the National Security Space (NSS) contract with the Air Force in 2016 and intends to launch an additional four GPS III missions on Falcon 9, a two-stage rocket manufactured by the company.
The GPS is owned by the U.S. military and operated by the Air Force. Built during the Cold War, it’s been used for commercial purposes since the mid-2000s. The new GPS satellites, built by Lockheed Martin, will provide three-times better accuracy than the current system of GPS and will be eight times better at anti-jamming, according to SpaceX.
“This newest generation of GPS satellites is designed and built to deliver positioning, navigation, and timing information,” the company wrote. “GPS is used by over four billion users and supports critical missions worldwide.”
SpaceX has completed 21 launches in 2018, up from 18 last year, in what’s been a banner year for the company. Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, it’s also said to be raising $500 million at a valuation of $30.5 billion to help fund its Starlink internet service project, which will see the company launching 11,000 satellites to improve internet connectivity around the globe. The new round of capital would bring its total raised to date to more than $2.5 billion.

The government signed a deal with Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, who worked with late husband Doug for decades to protect areas of Patagonia. Mr Tompkins, founder of the North Face clothing label, died in a kayaking accident in Chile in 2015. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet called the signing an ""unprecedented preservation effort"". Tompkins Conservation, the not-for-profit organisation set up by the couple, said the area being protected was roughly the size of Switzerland. Their donation is thought to be the largest of land by private owners to a country. The move will create five new national parks, and expand three others. In total it adds about 10 million acres of land, about one tenth of which was donated by the Tompkins.

Mrs Tompkins was formerly the CEO of outdoor brand Patagonia, and her husband was one of the founders of outdoor brands The North Face and Espirit. They relocated to Chile in 1994 to work on conservation, buying up land to ecologically preserve as wilderness. Their motives were viewed with suspicion locally, and right-wing Chilean politicians accused the US couple of land grabbing. Kristine Tompkins signed an agreement with the national government in March 2017, following her husband's accidental death. ""I am proud of my husband Doug and his vision which continues to guide us, in addition to our entire team, for completing these two national parks and the broader network, a major milestone of our first 25 years of work,"" she said.

Steven Levy,"We’re standing on the edge of a cliff on a remote Texas ranch, a long patch of rocky desert stretching out below to the verdant banks of the Rio Grande, a silver ribbon 2 miles distant. On the horizon, a light haze shrouds the mountains of northern Mexico. The whistle of a stiff and constant wind cuts through a silence that gives no hint of the hostilities, both physical and political, that animate these borderlands. Palmer Luckey—yes, that Palmer Luckey, the 25-year-old entrepreneur who founded the virtual reality company Oculus, sold it to Facebook, and then left Facebook in a haze of political controversy—hands me a Samsung Gear VR headset. Slipping it over my eyes, I am instantly immersed in a digital world that simulates the exact view I had just been enjoying in real life. In the virtual valley below is a glowing green square with text that reads PERSON 98%. Luckey directs me to tilt my head downward, toward the box, and suddenly an image pops up over the VR rendering. A human is making his way through the rugged sagebrush, a scene captured by cameras on a tower behind me. To his right I see another green box, this one labeled ANIMAL 86%. Zooming in on it brings up a photo of a calf, grazing a bit outside its usual range. The system I’m trying out is Luckey’s solution to how the US should detect unauthorized border crossings. It merges VR with surveillance tools to create a digital wall that is not a barrier so much as a web of all-seeing eyes, with intelligence to know what it sees. Luckey’s company, Anduril Industries, is pitching its technology to the Department of Homeland Security as a complement to—or substitute for—much of President Trump’s promised physical wall along the border with Mexico. Anduril is barely a year old, and the trespassing I’d witnessed was part of an informal test on a rancher’s private land. The company has installed three portable, 32-foot towers packed with radar, communications antennae, and a laser-­enhanced camera—the first implementation of a system Anduril is calling Lattice. It can detect and identify motion within about a 2-mile radius. The person I saw in my headset was an Anduril technician dispatched to the valley via ATV to demonstrate how the system works; he was about a mile away. As Luckey and his team see it, Lattice will become not just a system for securing the border but a general platform for geographic near-omniscience. With the aid of artificial intelligence, it aims to synthesize data from potentially thousands of sensors and local databases, displaying the most relevant data in phone apps, on laptop screens, and in mixed-reality headsets. Anduril’s goal is to become a major tech startup that builds hardware and software specifically for the defense industry, a venture-capital-infused outsider challenging the likes of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman with their multibillion-dollar government contracts and strong establishment ties. The idea of the nimble maverick overthrowing lead-footed incumbents is, of course, the favorite startup narrative. But the people behind Anduril are not untested newbies; they have significant experience in tech and politics. Besides Luckey, who gave money to an alt-right group and donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, the team includes former executives from the secretive data-crunching company Palantir, whose work for many government agencies has raised alarms about intrusive surveillance. And Anduril’s lead investor is Founders Fund, the VC firm headed by Peter Thiel, a prominent Trump supporter and the guy who shut down Gawker. The politics of Anduril’s founders may not be popular in liberal Silicon Valley, but they need to please a different audience: members of Congress and government bureaucrats. To win big border contracts, Anduril must beat out other companies peddling visions of an electronic border wall, including an Israeli firm called Elbit Systems, as well as traditional defense giants. Its advantages are operating cheaply and moving quickly. In a little over a year the company not only built and deployed its prototype in Texas, it has also launched a government-funded evaluation project under way outside of San Diego. It promises a system that would cost a small fraction of a physical wall and is cheaper than its digital competitors. Of course, Anduril still has to prove its technology works in a more extensive test. But early signs look good. According to US Customs and Border Protection, in a 10-week period, Lattice’s test in Texas helped customs agents catch 55 unauthorized border crossers, a notable figure for a system still in development. If Luckey has his way, the border wall of the future will be Anduril’s. At Anduril’s headquarters in Orange County, Palmer Luckey has been hands-on in building the company’s technology. Luckey grew up in Long Beach, California; his dad was a car salesman, and his mother homeschooled him and his three sisters. “I was a PC gamer,” he told me in 2015, “and I was always upgrading my PC, getting the best monitors, the newest graphics cards.” He wanted to feel as if he were “actually in the game, like the game is actually real.” By collecting and sublimely tweaking the technology available, Luckey created a homegrown VR system. He called his system Oculus and described it on a Kickstarter page in August 2012 as “designed by gamers, for gamers.” But when Mark Zuckerberg tried it out in 2014, the Facebook CEO saw it as the social computing platform of the future. Facebook bought Luckey’s company for $2 billion. In June of that year, a newly enriched Luckey attended a retreat hosted by Founders Fund, which had been an early Oculus investor, on Sonora Island in British Columbia. There he met an employee at the fund named Trae Stephens, then age 30. Earlier in his career, Stephens had worked at a government intelligence agency that he will not publicly identify; in 2008, he joined Palantir. In 2014, Thiel convinced Stephens to join Founders Fund and specialize in investments involving the government. Stephens found it ridiculous that almost no venture-backed companies worked closely with the government, with its billions of dollars to spend. “After Palantir and SpaceX, there’s nothing,” he says. Founders Fund also was an early SpaceX investor, and Stephens’ goal was to fund a company to join that duo. He was coming up empty. The Valley, it seemed, didn’t do government. Over meals at the Canadian eco-resort, Luckey and Stephens bonded over a shared passion for defense tech. Luckey had once worked on a program that used VR to treat PTSD, which led him to think about how military tech worked—and how it didn’t. During his Oculus years, he had read up on projects like the troubled F-35 fighter, which had a problematic head-up display, and realized that applying lessons from the consumer world could improve its design and lower costs. After the Sonora Island trip, Luckey and Stephens kept in touch, and in 2016 the pair began speculating about starting a company together. They threw around a lot of ideas, some of them straight out of comic books— What if we built a force field ? As that year ended, Stephens was making regular trips to Washington, DC, from San Francisco. Donald Trump was the president-elect, and Thiel, who was on the presidential transition team, brought Stephens on to focus on the Department of Defense. It was a useful post for someone thinking about a defense business. Meanwhile, Luckey’s political activities had made him the object of tech-press scorn. News reports claimed that Luckey was involved in an alt-right group called Nimble America, paying for billboards ripping Hillary Clinton as “Too Big to Jail” and allegedly penning vicious Reddit posts for the group. On his public Facebook page, he denied many of the allegations but confirmed that he donated $10,000 to Nimble America because he “thought the organization had fresh ideas on how to communicate with young voters.” He apologized for “negatively impacting the perception of Oculus and its partners.” When asked about this now, the normally buoyant Luckey drops his smile and chooses his words carefully, claiming that his politics are misunderstood. “The alt-right, as it exists, as it’s defined, I do not support, never have,” he says. He describes himself as “fiscally conservative, pro-freedom, little- L libertarian, and big- R Republican.” On the last day of March 2017, Luckey was ousted from Facebook. Neither party is sharing the details of his exit. (The issue even came up at Zuckerberg’s April 2018 Senate hearing, when Republican senator Ted Cruz, who has received $5,400 in political donations from Luckey, demanded, “Why was Palmer Luckey fired?” Zuckerberg said only that it wasn’t because of his politics.) And what did Luckey learn from his experience at Facebook and Oculus? “Be careful who you trust,” he says. “Be careful who has control.” On his first day as a free agent, Luckey connected with Stephens, ready to start building the company they’d discussed. Stephens didn’t hesitate. Their guiding vision was something like Stark Industries—the mind-blowing font of matériel in the Iron Man movies. (Luckey is a voracious consumer of popcorn flicks; one of his favorites is Pacific Rim.) And it would probably involve VR. A collector's version of Anduril, the enchanted blade from Lord of the Rings, hangs on Luckey's wall. They began recruiting a team. Stephens suggested Matt Grimm, a former Palantir colleague. Luckey proposed a fourth cofounder, Joe Chen, an engineer who had worked at Oculus before joining a Hollywood VR startup. Chen had also served in the National Guard. Both men signed on. “I’d been an end user on some very, very bad VR military simulation systems,” Chen says. “Once Palmer said ‘Hey, we gotta fix this,’ I was like, ‘All right, cool.’ ” On April 7, exactly a week after Luckey left Facebook, the four invited around half a dozen potential recruits to Luckey’s Orange County home. As the guests ate Chick-fil-A, the founders presented a pitch deck. By attracting “disruptive talent with a Silicon Valley vision, Anduril will be the next great defense company,” it promised. They would need “crazy mad scientists,” political connections, and lots of capital. “Almost every single person that was at that initial dinner is here right now,” Stephens says. Luckey secured warehouse space in an industrial area of Orange County. When the team approached Founders Fund, Brian Singerman, a partner who was also the first Oculus investor, agreed to lead the fund’s $17.5 million seed round. “Palmer is an insanely brilliant technologist,” he says. “A little bit … out there. But most brilliant people are.” (This May, Founders Fund led a $41 million Series A round.) Luckey, Stephens, and Grimm also made their pitch to Palantir’s directors. In attendance was Brian Schimpf, Palantir’s head of engineering. After the session, Schimpf told them he wanted in. He became the fifth cofounder and CEO, with Grimm as COO and Luckey as CTO. Stephens chairs the board (he never left Founders Fund). The company’s name also has a Palantir connection. Middle-earth buffs will recognize Anduril as the enchanted blade that was Aragorn’s go-to lethal weapon; a palantir is a magical crystal ball from the same Tolkien universe. “All of us are Lord of the Rings fans, so it was a pretty fun name,” Luckey says. “Also, I have Anduril the sword hanging on my wall.” (Luckey procured a collector’s version, not the original movie prop.) They had a name and an executive team. But what was the product? “The DOD has been asking for what some people describe as Call of Duty goggles,” Luckey says. “Like, you put on the glasses, and the headset display tells you where the good guys are, where the bad guys are, where your air support is, where you’re going, where you were.” (Pause to consider this Escher-esque scenario of soldiers clamoring for gear inspired by a game that mimics their combat experience.) But tiny Anduril—with no experience or history—couldn’t just barge into the Pentagon and demand to build battlefield tech. “We needed a quick win,” Schimpf says. Anduril’s pitch deck offered a sci-fi fantasia, including autonomous long-range bombers, attack-drone swarms, and something they called “perimeter security on a pole.” The team zeroed in on this last notion. They figured they could build a surveillance tower using off-the-shelf sensors and cameras, connect them in a network, and make something in the spirit of Google Maps and Pokémon Go. By using AI, the system would identify what data was important. Stephens thought the Pentagon might see its value in securing forward operating bases—outposts in hostile territory. But Luckey had another idea: border security. A system to monitor America’s southern perimeter would require components similar to those in a combat awareness platform. What’s more, it was clear Mexico wasn’t paying for that big, beautiful wall that Trump had promised. The government, they realized, might be receptive to their budget-friendly pitch. Silicon Valley, meet the US-Mexico border. The border towers include radar, communications antennae­, and a camera enhanced by a laser from a hair-removal device. Screens show information about Anduril’s towers. To find their way to the border, Anduril executives started by approaching a California office of the Department of Homeland Security in June 2017. “They said they could provide broader border security for a lower cost. We were intrigued by that,” says Melissa Ho, managing director of Silicon Valley’s DHS office. The DHS introduced Anduril’s executives to border patrol officials, and a border patrol team near San Diego was happy to brief them. “They saw us as their own SpaceX,” Schimpf says—that is, a nimble private entity that could provide specialized technology. Later, when the San Diego office of Customs and Border Protection was setting up tests of new border systems, it selected Anduril for a pilot project. Anduril is suggesting a new way to secure the border electronically, but it is far from the first. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on comically ineffective systems (in one of them the radars would get activated by rain). In the mid-2000s, Homeland Security initiated a competition to create SBInet, a comprehensive virtual wall. In September 2006, Boeing won a contract to start building a system that was estimated to cost $7.6 billion. It began constructing 80-foot-high towers loaded with equipment. In January 2011, after a series of cost overruns, late deliveries, and a basic failure to catch people crossing the border, then Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano pulled the plug. With massive understatement, a DHS report said that SBInet “does not meet current standards for viability and cost effectiveness.” SBInet was a case of government contracting run amok. “You learn lessons from failure,” says CBP commissioner Kevin McAleenan. Anduril, like both Palantir and SpaceX, seeks to avoid some common pitfalls. Instead of selling technology to the government for a huge up-front fee, it plans to own the system and lease it, with the data it collects belonging to whatever agency issues the contract. This arrangement, Stephens says, creates an incentive to keep development costs low. Part of SBInet’s failure was that it came too early. Sensors that cost a few bucks today were thousands of dollars a decade ago. Artificial intelligence is no longer an aspiration but a tool that delivers results. But technological attempts to secure the border have also tended to rely on complicated technologies, such as Predator drones, that aren’t cost-effective for long stretches of the border. A much simpler surveillance system could work fine, as long as agents received useful alerts from it. “The key was just finding a way to get information in the hands of agents,” Schimpf says. The camera mounted on Anduril’s surveillance towers takes still images in quick succession. Its competitors in the smart-wall business were pitching taller towers with exotic microwave transmitters and other bespoke gadgetry. For Anduril, the key to making consumer tech work was to combine it with AI. The company taught its software to identify the patterns of a person on the move, allowing it to avoid the expensive zoom lenses and thermal sensors used in competing systems, Schimpf says. “The sophistication of Nest-level technology isn’t bad,” he says, referring to the smart thermostats and motion detectors designed to automate a home. “And no one has used AI for this purpose yet. If you can identify objects with AI, you don’t need to see as far.” Within a couple of months, Anduril had a prototype. Schimpf and his colleagues took it to a test range in Apple Valley, a two-hour drive from their Orange County office. “We lived out of the trailer there,” Schimpf says. Using open source machine-­learning training data, they taught the software how to tell humans from animals or tumbleweeds, and unearthed some glitches. In a certain light, for example, the system can mistake the rear end of a horse for a person. What they didn’t find in affordable parts was a way to capture distant moving objects at night. Thermal cameras cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and fare poorly in the wind and dirt of the Texas border. But Luckey had an idea: Sync a laser beam to a virtual shutter, similar to flash photography. “We shoot a flash beam way, way, way out to where you are,” Luckey says. “It lights up you and the area around you, and then we’re able to pick that up with our electro-­optical sensor.” Anduril discovered it could cheaply repurpose the laser, which it bought in bulk, originally meant for a 600-watt cosmetic hair-removal device. To test their prototype, Stephens called Will Hurd, a Republican congressperson whose district includes the nation’s longest stretch of land bordering Mexico. Hurd has long argued for a digital approach to border security, so when he heard Stephens’ pitch, he perked up. “A lot of contractors say ‘Oh yeah, I can do this,’ but the federal government’s going to have to pay for the prototypes and all that kind of stuff,” he says. “When Anduril representatives explained their approach, I was like, ‘This is pretty cool.’ ” Hurd introduced Stephens and Luckey to a rancher on the border who agreed to host three test towers. A screenshot of an Anduril mobile notification. Anduril Mobile App screenshot of a person walking. In mid-April, Luckey, Stephens, Schimpf, and I are sailing down Highway 90 in southwest Texas in a rented SUV heading to that ranch, a road trip that started with a pit stop at an El Paso Whata­burger (Luckey’s choice). It’s a long drive through the sagebrush-­covered desert, with Schimpf at the wheel. “This is a place where machines are supposed to live,” Luckey says, “not people.” Luckey has a cold, but he chatters between sniffles about movies and technology, and he tells a story about hanging out in VR with Ready Player One author Ernest Cline. He’s wearing his trademark Tommy Bahama aloha shirt, shorts, and flip-flops; the others are in the Silicon Valley cool-weather uniform of puffy jackets and jeans. Schimpf takes a right at an unmarked intersection. We travel over roughly 30 miles of an unpaved road populated mostly by rabbits to reach a gate with a faded sign that designates the ranch as a member of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. Beyond it, inside a comfortable farmhouse, waits Ed, the fifth-­generation owner of the property. (WIRED is changing his name to spare him the attention of drug cartels operating in his area.) With a sagging mustache and a wide drawl, Ed has the air of a canny retired sheriff in a Sam Peckinpah movie. Over coffee, he explains that for decades his land has been an unpatrolled gateway to the United States. Past trials of new technologies hadn’t worked out, but on Hurd’s urging he gave the Californians a chance. To his astonishment, their system seems to be performing well. Take what happened on March 5. At 7:41 am local time, the system noticed activity in the valley. An alert popped up a thousand miles away, on Matt Grimm’s phone. “New person track near tower e1,” it read. Grimm, who was at his home in Orange County, opened Anduril’s app—and saw a dozen people making their way across the gullies and hills of the Texas frontier. In an official installation, such alerts would go straight to Customs and Border Protection agents. But in this case, Grimm notified Ed. Ed called the nearest patrol station and settled into his living room couch with his laptop. Launching Anduril’s software, a wide shot of his land filled the screen. Blinking green rectangles highlighted the trespassers; zooming in, he could make out the group of figures more clearly. Between sips of his morning coffee, he watched the boxes inch across the screen as the people traversed his ranchland. “I can hardly operate a cell phone,” he later recalls. “This is beyond cool.” Artificial intelligence identifies whether it has spotted a moving person, vehicle, animal, or tumbleweed. Later that morning, Grimm could see that a DHS helicopter was headed toward the scene. By then the visitors had traveled northeast of the towers’ range, so he couldn’t watch as border agents apprehended 12 people. In a 10-week span since the towers were installed, Lattice helped agents catch 55 people and seize 982 pounds of marijuana. (For 39 of those individuals, drugs were not involved, suggesting they were just looking for a better life.) The official test outside San Diego, ongoing at press time, led to 10 interceptions in its first 12 days. Last July, Hurd introduced the Secure Miles with All Resources and Technology (SMART) Act, which would direct DHS to deploy technologies for “situational awareness and operational control of the border.” His nine cosponsors include two Democrats. The bill is awaiting a vote, but some of its key ideas found their way into the 2018 federal budget, which provides funds for border-security technology. “Nobody is disagreeing with the smart wall,” says Hurd, a former CIA agent who is one of the few members of Congress with a computer science degree. The economics are an obvious factor. “A concrete structure 30 feet high that takes four hours to penetrate costs $24.5 million a mile,” he says. “A smart wall, a system like what Anduril is proposing, is about a half a million a mile.” The prototype towers on Ed’s ranch are the epitome of cheapskate. A plain metal pole juts from the ground, propped up by a tripod and anchored by cinder blocks. Solar panels hang off its lower portion, and the top is a cobbled-together cluster of radar antennae, cameras, and more. The finished version will look more polished, but its bones will be the same. Unassembled, it can fit into a pickup truck and be installed in less than an hour. Anduril has since added small drones to the system. If the company wins a contract for the hundreds of miles of rural borderlands, where its tech is best suited, these towers will watch the movements of all who cross their line of sight—drug smugglers, job seekers, families, as well as Americans going about their business. Staring down from our bluff toward the Rio Grande, Schimpf reflects on Anduril’s long-term goals, which include protecting private sites like oil pipelines and monitoring the battlefield of the future. “Looking at this helps you conceptualize what it would be like in Afghanistan, if you had a forward-operating base on top of this hill. It’s the same problem.” Anduril is trying out small, cheap helicopter-­style drones. Anduril is unusual among today’s startups for embracing the defense business. In the Valley, many believe that “if you do defense you must be an evil person,” says Joe Lonsdale, an Anduril investor and Palantir cofounder. But that wasn’t always the case. California’s tech sector was once a virtual branch of the military. “Literally 100 percent of the early microchips went to defense use,” says Leslie Berlin, project historian for Stanford’s Silicon Valley archives. In the 1950s and ’60s, “working for the defense effort meant working for the good guys,” Berlin says. After Vietnam, that changed. “Many people in Silicon Valley today don’t feel that way.” The most recent evidence came in April, when The New York Times reported that more than 3,100 Google employees had protested the company’s work on a Pentagon-backed AI effort called Project Maven. Lonsdale and Luckey argue that building cheaper, more efficient systems is a virtuous pursuit, saving taxpayer dollars. Anduril’s Palantir pedigree may have prepared it for criticism. As that company grew to a private valuation of $20 billion, its technology has been portrayed as Big Brother–style surveillance tools. Anduril’s leaders tread lightly on the subject of deadly force—traditionally the purview of defense companies—and have a ready answer when I ask whether the company will ever build systems that kill people. “We’re really focused on the intelligence and surveillance piece right now,” Schimpf says. But in the next beat: Not that there’s anything wrong with building weapons. “I wouldn’t say that’s a line we’re drawing.” Stephens jumps in to clarify. “Part of the unintended shiftiness of our answer is that no one even knows what that means. In 20 years, are we still going to be filling bullets with gunpowder? Or is this electronic warfare? Is it like sending a pulse out that takes drones out of the sky?” Put that way, warfare sounds a bit like a videogame, an echo of the drone pilots who execute deadly missions from behind computer screens many miles away. MythBusters cohost Jamie Hyneman is building an autonomous firefighting tank for Anduril. In a steampunkish workshop in an industrial area of Oakland, California, Anduril houses a project called Sentry that brings this parallel to life. Sentry is a fleet of autonomous firefighting machines meant to battle blazes on California’s hills, among other applications. The idea is to hollow out armored troop carriers to hold more than a thousand gallons of water. With crinkled aluminum skin, a Sentry vehicle looks something like a battlebot tank. That’s no coincidence—Anduril’s subcontractor for the project is Jamie Hyneman, the special effects expert and former cohost of MythBusters who built one of the fiercest battle­bots in Robot Wars history. Luckey passes me an Oculus Rift headset and a handheld controller to try driving a simulation of a Sentry vehicle. On my headset I see a stand of burning trees. I set the tank on autonomous mode and use the index-finger trigger, familiar to anyone who has used an Xbox, to shoot its water cannons at the blazes. It is exactly like playing a video­game. As the flames spread, I concentrate hard to rule over the conflagration, wanting to put in a strong performance for the Anduril team. I leave the Oakland workshop pumped from the excitement of saving the homes of imaginary Californians. But as I steer my car through the battered chain-link gate, past graffiti-covered buildings, the lingering adrenaline from my digital immersion turns to a funny aftertaste. The California fires last summer were devastatingly real. So is warfare. Anduril is on a quest to build awesome tech, the stuff of comics and action films. But it will be deployed in situations of human desperation, a vast remove from the land of fun. Transforming consumer tech’s plowshares into swords is ultimately a dark pursuit. It struck me after I’d wrapped up my visits with Anduril that, aside from the drug smugglers they helped intercept on the border, I had not heard the founders mention the people who might get caught in their omniscient zone. What is the right way to treat those individuals? What of the children and parents who are now being torn apart while crossing? Those are social and political questions, not technical specifications. But it is increasingly the case that the people who build new technologies trigger political consequences. Though tech companies have been taking their knocks lately, even the ones now under the most scrutiny were launched in a glow of idealism. We once dreamed that an era of ultraconnected and infinitely empowering tech would solve the kinds of problems that lead people to flee their own countries or that propel terrorists or nations to attack. Those problems didn’t end. It now seems obvious that tech was never going to make us better human beings; we are still our flawed selves. Instead, those same technologies that once seemed full of promise are finding their way into all-too-human clashes—led by a company named after an avenging sword.

A statement by the state broadcaster said the move was necessary to stem a wave of anti-government protests. Hundreds of people have died in three years of unrest in the country. A 10-month state of emergency that ended last year failed to stop the protests, as did the release from jail of thousands of opposition supporters. Mr Desalegn said he made his decision to stand down on Thursday in the hope that it would help end the years of unrest and political upheaval.

Tom Simonite,"Plenty of people around the world got new gadgets Friday, but one in Eastern Tennessee stands out. Summit, a new supercomputer unveiled at Oak Ridge National Lab is, unofficially for now, the most powerful calculating machine on the planet. It was designed in part to scale up the artificial intelligence techniques that power some of the recent tricks in your smartphone. America hasn’t possessed the world’s most powerful supercomputer since June 2013, when a Chinese machine first claimed the title. Summit is expected to end that run when the official ranking of supercomputers, from an organization called Top500, is updated later this month. Supercomputers have lost some of their allure in the era of cloud computing and humongous data centers. But many thorny computational problems require the giant machines. A US government report last year said the nation should invest more in supercomputing, to keep pace with China on defense projects such as nuclear weapons and hypersonic aircraft, and commercial innovations in aerospace, oil discovery, and pharmaceuticals. Summit, built by IBM, occupies floor space equivalent to two tennis courts, and slurps 4,000 gallons of water a minute around a circulatory system to cool its 37,000 processors. Oak Ridge says its new baby can deliver a peak performance of 200 quadrillion calculations per second (that’s 200 followed by 15 zeros) using a standard measure used to rate supercomputers, or 200 petaflops. That’s about a million times faster than a typical laptop, and nearly twice the peak performance of China’s top-ranking Sunway TaihuLight. The view inside one of the Summit supercomputer's 4,608 servers. During early testing, researchers at Oak Ridge used Summit to perform more than a quintillion calculations per second in a project analyzing variation between human genome sequences. They claim that's the first time a scientific calculation has reached that computational scale. America’s new best computer is significant for more than just the geopolitics of computational brawn. It’s designed to be more suited than previous supercomputers to running the machine learning techniques popular with tech companies such as Google and Apple. One reason computers have lately got much better at recognizing our voices and beating us at boardgames is that researchers discovered that graphics chips could put more power behind an old machine learning technique known as deep neural networks. Facebook recently disclosed that a single AI experiment using billions of Instagram photos occupied hundreds of graphics chips for almost a month. Summit has nearly 28,000 graphics processors made by NVIDIA, alongside more than 9,000 conventional processors from IBM. Such heavy use of graphic chips is unusual for a supercomputer, and should enable breakthroughs in deploying machine learning on tough scientific problems, says Thomas Zacharia, director of Oak Ridge National Lab. “We set out to build the world’s most powerful,” he says, “but it is also the world’s smartest supercomputer.” Summit's thousands of servers could fill two tennis courts. Eliu Huerta, a researcher at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, describes Summit’s giant GPU pool as “like a dreamland.” Huerta previously used machine learning on a supercomputer called Blue Waters to detect signs of gravitational waves in data from the LIGO observatory that won its founders the 2017 Nobel Prize in physics. He hopes Summit’s might will help analyze the roughly 15 terabytes of imagery expected to arrive each night from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, due to switch on in 2019. Summit will also be used to apply deep learning to problems in chemistry, and biology. Zacharia says it could contribute to an Energy Department project using medical records from 22 million veterans, about a quarter-million of which include full genome sequences. Some people worried about US competitiveness in oversized calculating machines hope that hoopla around Summit will inspire more interest in building its successors. The US, China, Japan, and European Union have all declared the first “exascale” computer—with more than 1,000 petaflops of computing power—as the next big milestone in large-scale computing. China claims it achieve that milestone by 2020, says Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The US may get there in 2021 if Summit’s successor, known as Aurora, is completed on schedule, but the program has previously had delays. The Trump administration’s budget this spring asked for $376 million extra funding to help meet the 2021 target. It’s now up to the nation’s legislators to approve it. “High performance computing is absolutely essential for a country’s national security, economic competitiveness, and ability to take on scientific challenges,” says Ezell.

The world-renowned antiquities museum in Damascus closed in 2012 to protect its ancient artefacts from damage. Most of the collection was then evacuated and kept at secret locations to keep them safe. The decision to reopen part of the museum signals the Syrian government's attempts to restore the appearance of normality. Earlier this year, the capital was secured by President Bashar Assad's forces, but fighting still continues in some areas of the country. The seven-year conflict in Syria has left more than 350,000 people dead, and devastated many historic cities and sites across the country. Culture Minister Mohamed al-Ahmad said the reopening of the museum sends a ""genuine message"" that the country's rich cultural heritage was not destroyed by ""terrorism"", the Associated Press reports. Only part of the National Museum of Damascus opened to visitors on Sunday, but the museum's deputy director said authorities were working on reopening it all. ""We will exhibit a group of artefacts from all periods from prehistory, the ancient east and the classical and Islamic eras in this section,"" Ahmad Deeb told the media. The museum's gardens stayed open to the public during the conflict, but the building was closed as Damascus fell under rebel rocket fire.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Science would probably progress a whole lot slower without the infinite human imagination. We talk frequently about times that science fiction has predicted coming science advances. But this time, the National Science Foundation has let its scientists do the imagining. This week, the NSF presented its Future of Scientific Imagination, that is, futures extrapolated from present-day NSF-funded research that may one day become a reality. First on their list was a reimagining of the traditional Thanksgiving Dinner. These days, many of us must travel home from faraway cities to share a meal with our parents. Sure, you can Skype a sibling and your nephew, and then place the laptop at the kitchen table, but they can’t taste mom’s lasagna. And given that its the future, what if they were in space? Plus, these days, everyone is worried about the security of those video calls. So a team of NSF chemists, physicists, engineers, and social scientists considered what a meal might look like in the future. Perhaps your parents could project you into your family living room via a three-dimensional hologram. Such a video link could be secured through a quantum communications system, like the video call recently shared between the Chinese Academy of Sciences President, Chunli Bai, and President Anton Zeilinger of the Austria Academy of Sciences in Vienna. As for the meal itself, one day some sort of quantum photocopier might be able to construct the lasagna atom-by-atom. This is a future extrapolation of work done by researchers Markus Greiner at Harvard and Eric Hudson at UCLA whose precision methods use lasers to create new types of molecules. Maybe your pantry would store individual elements instead of cans. All of this sounds wild, but the quirks of quantum mechanics introduced now-ubiquitous things like lasers and transistors via a quantum revolution that happened decades ago. “There’s huge commercial interest in quantum computing,” Alex Cronin, NSF physics program director explained to Gizmodo. “The dust hasn’t settled yet on what will be the benefits of the second quantum revolution.” Obviously, programming a quantum dinner assembler is many decades away. The series invited scientists to envision other, less Thanksgiving-related and more Black Mirr0r- esque futures as well, like sensors integrated into clothing, microscopic “robo-ants” that can investigate forest fires, specialy engineered cells that perform specific functions, and living buildings with synthetic leaves. I hate the future, and even some positive dreams about it can sound incredibly dystopian and surveillance state-y. However, not having to fly on a plane to visit relatives over the holidays sounds nice, and I like the idea of my mom’s stuffed cabbage materializing in front of me.

ALEXANDRA ALTER,"The award for nonfiction went to Masha Gessen for “ The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia,” which chronicles the return of authoritarianism under Vladimir V. Putin through the lives of four Russians born in the 1980s. “I never thought that a Russia book could ever be longlisted or shortlisted for the National Book Award, but of course things have changed,” Ms. Gessen said in her acceptance speech, alluding to Russia’s interference in the 2016 American presidential election. The National Book Awards, which were established in 1950 and are presented by the National Book Foundation, have gone to some of the most revered writers in the United States, including William Faulkner, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Ralph Ellison, Susan Sontag and Flannery O’Connor. This year’s awards were open to American authors who published books between Dec. 1, 2016, and Nov. 30, 2017. The awards, which were given at a black-tie dinner with close to 800 guests at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, are typically the most glamorous literary event of the year, drawing the industry’s biggest names and players. This year’s ceremony had additional star power, with the actress Cynthia Nixon hosting the ceremony, and former President Bill Clinton and the actress Anne Hathaway presenting awards. “It’s a privilege to be in this room full of huge nerds, I feel right at home,” Ms. Nixon said in her opening remarks. Photo Masha Gessen was awarded this year’s nonfiction prize “The Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia.” Credit Naima Green for The New York Times This year’s ceremony came at a relatively optimistic moment in the publishing industry, as print sales have risen and the once-explosive growth of e-books has fallen off. Publishers’ revenues grew by 3.5 percent in the first half of 2017 compared with the same period last year, according to a recent report from the Association of American Publishers, and hardcover print sales rose by nearly 10 percent. Robin Benway’s young adult novel “ Far From the Tree,” a coming-of-age story about an adopted only child who reconnects with her siblings, won the award for young people’s literature. The poetry prize went to Frank Bidart for “ Half-light: Collected Poems 1965-2016,” which the judges in their citation called “an investigation of selfhood that spans five decades of work and several hundred years of concerns.” The Literarian Award, for “outstanding service to the American literary community,” was given to Richard Robinson, the chairman, president and chief executive of Scholastic, the children’s publishing company. Mr. Clinton, who presented the award, praised Mr. Robinson’s efforts to boost literacy rates and access to books among children through Scholastic’s school-based book clubs and book fairs and nonprofit partnerships. “Because of people like Dick, the gap by race and ethnicity and income, in their readiness to start school, is closing rapidly,” Mr. Clinton said. “All over this country there are people who are forming new neural networks at the speed of light, stimulated by books that would not be there were it not for his day job at Scholastic and his commitment to this kind of philanthropic work.” Mr. Clinton added that he was personally grateful to Mr. Robinson because “he sent Hillary and me copies of the Harry Potter books so we didn’t have to wait in line at bookstores.” In his acceptance speech, Mr. Robinson noted that best-selling Scholastic titles, like “The Hunger Games,” “Harry Potter” and “Captain Underpants,” have “converted nonreaders into readers and made reading available to all.” Annie Proulx, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of “The Shipping News,” “Barkskins” and other works, received the foundation’s medal for distinguished contribution to American letters. Ms. Hathaway, who appeared in a film adaptation of Ms. Proulx’s short story “Brokeback Mountain” and presented the award, praised Ms. Proulx’s ability to create “worlds that feel desolate and full, bleak and hopeful.” “We are richer because of the deceptively simple, precise, devastating poetry of Ms. Proulx,” she said. Ms. Proulx, who was born in 1935, joked about the fact that she was getting a lifetime achievement award even though she didn’t start writing until she was in her 50s. “I kept thinking about it and putting it off,” she said. In a forceful speech, Ms. Proulx expressed alarm at the current state of the world, citing the recent spate of mass shootings, the destruction of the environment, the spread of misinformation over social media, threats of nuclear war and revelations in the media about sexual harassment. “We don’t live in the best of all possible worlds,” she said. “This is a Kafkaesque time.” Women dominated the list of finalists this year, making up 15 of the 20 finalists in four categories. Four out of five fiction finalists were women: The fiction finalists included Min Jin Lee’s novel “ Pachinko,” Lisa Ko’s debut novel “ The Leavers,” Carmen Maria Machado’s debut short story collection “ Her Body and Other Parties,” and Elliot Ackerman’s novel “ Dark at the Crossing.” “Don’t get me wrong, the men’s books are wonderful too,” Ms. Nixon said after noting the prevalence of female authors this year. “But shout out to the ladies.” Continue reading the main story","It is the second National Book Award for Ms. Ward, a Mississippi native who also won in 2011 for her novel “Salvage the Bones.”",2017-11-16T03:58:02Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Jesmyn Ward Wins National Book Award for ‘Sing, Unburied, Sing’",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/books/review/national-book-award-jesmyn-ward.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/16/business/16bookawards1/16bookawards1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1
REBECCA BILL CHAVEZ,"Photo A union worker during a protest against Nafta negotiations in Mexico City last week. Credit Carlos Jasso/Reuters It came straight from the mouth of Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray of Mexico, arguably the most influential member of President Enrique Peña Nieto’s administration: a Trump administration rejection of the North American Free Trade Agreement would undermine United States-Mexico security cooperation and our collaboration on migration. Until recently, the Mexican government had only insinuated that security cooperation was on the table. It’s time for Americans to take the warning seriously as Mexico heads into an election year in which anti-Trump sentiment continues to grow, increasing the political cost of partnering with the United States and buoying the nationalist presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The Americas Barometer reports that the Mexican populace’s distrust of the United States rose to 84 percent from 31 percent in just three months after Donald Trump was elected. Many analysts worry that the Trump administration’s disparaging language and its positions on trade, immigration and the wall threaten our economic and political connections. However, a third core pillar of the relationship — our bilateral defense and security relationship — is also being tested. A deterioration of our defense cooperation threatens the stability and security of our hemisphere in areas from illicit trafficking to migration-related humanitarian crises to destabilizing crime and violence. These developments are unfortunate, given that President Trump inherited a partnership of exceptional collaboration in the defense sphere. This cooperation was facilitated by Mexico’s willingness and capacity to take on a greater share of the security burdens not just in the Western Hemisphere but globally. The Mexican military has increased activity in international forums, developing the groundwork for potential future external military missions, including contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations. After eight years of confidence-building initiatives, the Obama administration established a defense relationship of trust, and cooperation expanded beyond counternarcotics and counterterrorism to broader strategic engagement including coordinated efforts in Central America, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and global peacekeeping. By jeopardizing United States-Mexico counternarcotics cooperation, President Trump risks cutting off his nose to spite his face. He has declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency, and his ill-advised supply-side approach requires Mexican collaboration. Over 90 percent of the heroin in the United States is either produced in or shipped through Mexico, and Mexico is an important transit point for the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl and the principal transit point for cocaine entering the United States. In Mexico, it is the military that has the drug enforcement mission, which includes fighting cartels and poppy eradication. The president would do well to listen to the head of the United States Northern Command, Lori Robinson, who highlighted in her 2017 congressional testimony that collaboration with the Mexican armed forces is strong — and critical to the struggle against illicit trafficking.

Megan Farokhmanesh,"Black Panther was an instant success for Marvel. First, it broke the company’s first-day presale ticket records, out-earning The Last Jedi over its four-day opening weekend. Then, it nabbed the biggest February debut of all time. It’s pulled in more than $1 billion in worldwide box office totals alone, and it currently stands as the highest-grossing film by a black director. Now, its legacy will also include an appearance in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. The museum announced that it will display the costume worn by star Chadwick Boseman and designed by Oscar-nominated designer Ruth E. Carter from October 24th to October 27th, during its first African American Film Festival. “ Black Panther is the first superhero of African descent to appear in mainstream American comics, and the film itself is the first major cinematic production based on the character,” the museum says. “ Black Panther illustrates the progression of blacks in film, an industry that in the past has overlooked blacks, or regulated them to flat, one-dimensional and marginalized figures. The film, like the museum, provides a fuller story of black culture and identity.” Along with Boseman’s costume, the museum will feature a shooting script signed by co-writer and director Ryan Coogler, producer and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, executive producer Nate Moore, and co-writer and producer Joe Robert Cole. Attendees will also be able to see two pages of the spec script and 24 high-resolution production photographs. The Smithsonian also reports that it’s in the final stages of making the costume exhibit a permanent one in the museum. Curator Rhea Combs praised the film’s powerful black characters, especially in regard to its female characters. “It was also nice to see women in dynamic warrior roles, as well as adept in the sciences and technology,” Combs says. “These are images many audiences have longed to see in mainstream films, but for too long haven’t.”",T’Challa’s signature suit will soon be on display at the recently opened National Museum of African American History and Culture.,2018-06-26T15:03:47Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Black Panther is heading to the Smithsonian,https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505626/black-panther-costume-smithsonian-museum-exhibit,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Qzm60XSGfw_kBcFQAgRBcV7aXw=/156x0:994x439/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10018929/Screen_Shot_2018_01_11_at_3.47.24_PM.png,the-verge,The Verge,National,1

Rachel Becker,"Bears Ears National Monument will shrink by 90 percent, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to half its original size, President Trump announced today. The land remaining in these Utah monuments will be divided into multiple smaller sections — an unpopular move that could open once-protected land to fossil fuel extraction and put sacred sites and local species at risk. Native American tribes and conservation groups are preparing to fight back in court. Outside the Utah State Capitol today, President Trump said that he will cut Bears Ears National monument in southeastern Utah — from 1.35 million acres to 228,784 acres, according to a White House statement. The remaining scraps will be sliced into two different sections named Indian Creek and Shash Jaa. Grand Staircase-Escalante will shrink to 1,006,341 acres from 1.9 million acres and will be chopped up into three different units. “I have come to Utah to take a very historic action: to reverse federal overreach and restore the rights of this land to your citizens,” Trump said. We’ve known that these cuts were coming since September, thanks to a leaked memorandum that outlined the Interior Department’s four-month review of 27 national monuments. That memorandum, obtained by the Washington Post, proposed shrinking the borders of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah, Cascade-Siskiyou in Oregon and California, and Gold Butte in Nevada. But the memorandum didn’t say by how much. “This represents the largest rollback of protections on public lands and waters in history.” Now, Trump has revealed the size of the cuts planned for Utah — and conservation groups, hunters, and native tribes in the area aren’t happy. “This represents the largest rollback of protections on public lands and waters in history,” says Dan Hartinger with the conservation group The Wilderness Society. “Over 2 million acres would be opened up to commercial exploitation in places that the public overwhelmingly supports protecting.” “This is a dark day for conservation,” agrees Land Tawney, CEO of the outdoor recreation advocacy group Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers. “We’re irate about this because these monuments were designated to protect special places really from development.” His organization is especially concerned that cuts to Grand Staircase Escalante could harm its population of bighorn sheep, a popular game animal. In fact, fragmenting these habitats could kill off resident plants and animals more quickly than if they were left with a larger, continuous territory, says William Newmark, a conservation biologist with the Natural History Museum of Utah. “What is particularly disturbing about Grand Staircase Escalante is not only have they reduced its total area, but they fragmented it into three units,” he says. “This is a dark day for conservation.” The changes also put key archaeological sites in Bears Ears at risk, says Katherine Belzowski, an attorney for the Navajo Nation. “Bears Ears is kind of a twofold monument,” she says. “It’s protecting not only the archaeological sites in the area, but it’s also protecting the landscape, which is considered sacred.” It’s not clear if President Trump’s actions today are legal. While the Antiquities Act of 1906 gives the president authority to designate national monuments, it doesn’t explicitly permit abolishing them, according to High Country News. In fact, previous presidents have only shrank national monuments a handful of times in the past — like Mount Olympus National Monument, which Woodrow Wilson cut to half its size. The Navajo Nation is gearing up to sue, Belzowski says, along with the four other tribes who pushed for Bears Ears to be designated a national monument in the first place: the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah Ouray, Hopi Nation, and Zuni Tribe. “This vast reduction leaves out so many of our sacred sites and landscapes,” Belzowski says. “And we intend to defend those.”",President Donald Trump announced huge cuts to Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah today,2017-12-04T23:50:49Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Donald Trump makes history — with massive cuts to Utah's national monuments,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16735910/trump-national-monuments-utah-bears-ears-grand-staircase-escalante-cuts,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCjyTYDMug6tmdJONoNuSDCkD-o=/0x8:2880x1516/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7715345/31828928161_4bd4a09c21_o.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,National,1
Rhett Jones,"Were at a critical inflection point for the World Wide Web. Everything is changing, disappearing, splintering, expanding, and being remade. Its time we provide legal protection to whats left of this moment in history. And one way to do that is to make it a national monument. Its difficult to overstate what a unique moment this is in terms of historical progress and opportunity. The world has bifurcated into online and IRL experience, and the two are intrinsically feeding off of each other. But unlike any other turning point in human history, the technology thats upending how civilization functions is also memorializing its own impact on the world through the input of the 3.2 billion people who currently use it. We are constantly creating records and telling each other stories about what life was like around the turn of the millennium, and were doing most of it online. But its becoming clear that the web is rapidly changing. Video and audio have become more prominent, which makes it more taxing for archiving efforts like the non-profit Internet Archive to afford to store increasingly large files. Were also seeing efforts to create a new form of the internet with technologies like the blockchain. And political differences threaten to remake the global web. Googles former CEO Eric Schmidt recently predicted that there will be two distinct versions of the internet by 2028one led by the Chinese, the other by the rest of the world. Politics and a general cultural concern about the effects of internet platforms have also led to increased efforts to delete online content entirely. Whatever your feelings about, say, Infowars conspiracy rants, the YouTube shooters borderline avant-garde manifestos, and deranged algorithmically-generated kids shows, this controversial content has a historical and cultural value that should be available in the future. Beyond intentional removals, websites simply die as people stop maintaining them and servers get cleared out to make room for more information. Internet Live Stats estimates that there are about 1.193 billion websites online at the moment, and that number rises every second. The site estimates that just over 13 percent of those sites are active today, indicating that the bulk of the internet is on death watch. Its time to act before its too late. Is it possible? To figure out if turning the web into a national monument is even doable, we have to first set some parameters given that the web is constantly evolving. So lets say we aim to archive all of the publicly-facing URLs that still exist from the birth of the web and set a cut-off date, like January 1, 2019. Exclude sites on the so-called dark web and password-protected content, and set a firm end date for the project so it wouldnt just go on endlessly and cost unfathomable amounts of money. This whole task would be complicated, of course. And the first question wed have to ask is whether its even legally possible to do this. The short answer is: Probably. The Antiquities Act, which gives presidents the power to create national monuments, was enacted in 1906 under pressure from scholars and scientists who didnt want prospectors and settlers in the southwest destroying archeological artifacts. Under the law, a president has the right to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments. For the purposes of turning the web into a national monument, the line about objects of historic or scientific interest would appear to apply. The first real test of the Antiquities Act came to the Supreme Court in 1920, in the case of Cameron v. United States. At that time, the court ruled that President Theodore Roosevelt indeed had the power to declare the Grand Canyon a monument that would be off-limits to mining because it falls under the category of an object of unusual scientific interest. That precedent and the courts decision not to consider the size of the monument in its decision left the possibilities wide open. Certainly, we wouldnt need server space thats larger than the Grand Canyon to store the web. So, it would seem that a project of this scale would fall under the scope of powers given to the president to designate national monuments. Jonathan Jarvis, who served as director of the U.S. National Park Service for eight years under President Obama, told Gizmodo that making the web a national monument wasnt out of the question. There have been national park units established by Congress around an idea and or a historical event without a physical footprint, he said. Jarvis pointed to the Rosie the Riveter World War 2 Homefront National Historical Park as an example and explained that it was founded to celebrate the women who kept American industry running during the war. He also mentioned the many monuments that have been created to honor the civil rights movement. Still, the web is a tricky thing. Going back to the text of the Antiquities Act, Jarvis said that the line regarding objects of historic or scientific interest would need to be read literally. So I think there would have to be an object to represent the internet in some way to make it a national monument, he said. (Side note: When he was in office, Jarvis added, there actually was some discussion of making the garage where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple into a national monument honoring the personal computer.) As for the internet, the object could be a giant data center. If we really wanted to keep things simple, we could even just turn a copy of the Internet Archives Wayback Machine into a monument. That organization could continue its work of running a living archive, and wed have a legally protected clone for the future. LOCKSS Mark Graham, director of the Internet Archives Wayback Machine, told Gizmodo he was certainly open to the idea of making more copies of his baby. Graham points to the archiving principle known as LOCKSS, an acronym that stands for lots of copies keep stuff safe. Stanford University oversees a LOCKSS program that works with institutions to implement a whole set of preservation principles, but the most important thing is to make as many copies as possible. Graham hasnt given the national monument approach a lot of thought, but he did say that hes been privately exploring the idea of making a living web archive a United Nations World Heritage Site. Specifically, a web archive could fall under UNESCOs Intangible Heritage designation that covers ephemeral cultural artifacts like Turkeys whistled language and Mongolias coaxing ritual for camels. The folks at the Internet Archive welcome competition. Graham emphasized that many countries (for example, Portugal ) already have their own efforts to archive the web. But they each set their own criteria for what to archive, and they often focus on their nations specific cultural concerns. This is fineeven a little bit of archiving goes a long way. Lots of copies keep stuff safe. And the U.S. should ensure it has its own copy. How big is the web? One difficulty is that its hard to figure out exactly how large the web is. Graham thinks about this subject for a living, and even hes not sure about a ballpark figure for its size. Hes only able to say it would take a large-scale research project to get a satisfying answersomething the federal government is good at. The best he can tell us is that the Wayback Machine has been archiving a lot of the web for 22 years. It stores about 22 petabytes right now and is growing at the rate of about one petabyte every three months. These days, we tend to think of large storage in terabytesa petabyte is a thousand terabytes, and a terabyte is a million megabytes. Lets say a megabyte is represented by a book thats one-inch-thick. If we stacked those books, the Wayback Machines archive would be 347,222 miles higha distance that would stretch to the moon and half-way back. Of course, we could create an analog archive rather than a digital one. In 2015, a Washington Post investigation found that if we printed the internet, it would take around 305.5 billion sheets of paper. Estimating what kind of deal the U.S. government could get on the largest single print job in the history of mankind is difficult. Lets go for a high estimate: A single black and white text document printed at FedEx will cost you $0.69. (nice) Just printing it out would cost $2.4 billion. And that wouldnt allow us to capture functionalities, connections, audio, and video, so this solution is far from ideal. What is the web, anyway? When I asked Graham about the ideal process for the government to follow when starting its own web archive, he answered with a question: What is the web? He explained that the criteria Id laid out wouldnt totally cover the challenges of defining the web. Because of the nature of the web, it would be impossible to conclude that weve accomplished our goal of archiving it. Take Facebook, for example. As Graham explained, every URL one enters into Facebook returns its own unique content, every time you enter it into Facebook. In other words, entering the URL for a single profile page two times in a row will return different surrounding content. Of course, you could just set the rule that we take one capture of that page and be done with it, but his point was that the web is a living thing and it only becomes more slippery over time. The answer to defining what should be archived, in Grahams eyes, is archivists. When archivists do what they do, they select an archivists job isnt to keep everything, he said while admitting that his job has been unique in that hes tried to keep everything that he can. The Internet Archive regularly curates collections and highlights selections from the Wayback Machine, but the role of selection will have to become more prominent as more and more information flows online. And it will likely have to evolve beyond the traditional scholarly approach to preserving historically important examples based on a canon to using approaches that can be expressed algorithmically. Graham also emphasized that its important for any monument of the web to be readily accessible to the public. We have a philosophy here with regard to web archiving which is why we think that... a healthy archive is an archive thats used, he said. So if you if you take an archive you store a lot of stuff in the closet and you never look at it and never use it, the probability that its going to be useful to people in the future is a lot less than if its used along the way. He said, for example, that use is key to quality assurance. This is a practical concern as well as a philosophical one. The necessary tools There are different approaches that the U.S. government could take to execute such an enormous project, but Graham thinks it would go about the task in much the same way that the Internet Archive already does it. He said that the project would likely use web crawlers that scan the web and take snapshots of individual pages. But this would have to be augmented with other technologies. He points to the problem of complex pages that are essentially applications that require a whole stack of data to function, in which case all the functional data has to be scooped up and held together over time. Oftentimes, the related files will be part of a back-end that cant just be scraped by a web crawler. In situations like that, the Internet Archive is using a platform called Docker to make the backups. The federal government would also likely be able to corral tools it already has and leverage its influence to directly clone servers at certain companies. That scenario would raise questions about how much of this information we want the government to have in one place. But if that idea bothers you, you probably dont want to contemplate the likelihood that a lot of the archiving project is probably already complete at the NSAs secretive data center in Utah where communications and web traffic are reportedly scooped up, analyzed, and stored. Why dont we just make a copy of that archive, you ask? Well, it would probably be easier to start fresh than it would be to try to disentangle private and classified data from public and innocuous information. The political will The practicalities of this kind of project come with a lot of uncertainty, and thats equally true of the politics that would surround it. It would be expensive, we know that. Budget hawks wouldnt be pleased. And like the space program, there will always be critics who believe that the money could be better spent elsewhere. The good news is that making a national monument of the web wouldnt have to fight through our gridlocked political system because only the president can unilaterally decide to do it. The bad news is that Donald Trump is the president, and its still unclear if he even knows how to use a computer. Still, having spent the last few years getting to know Trump, I think there are a few ways he could be convinced to do it. First of all, remind him that his tweets as president are automatically archived by the government, but his personal tweets before that time could still be under threat of deletion if Twitter ever decides to truly enforce or change its terms of service. Next, argue that the internet is an American achievement. Though the U.S. played an enormous role in funding the research and infrastructure of the internet, its an achievement that belongs to the world. But as we saw with the recent Niel Armstrong biopics decision to not show the American flag being planted on the moon, the right wing really likes to claim mankinds achievements as uniquely American, so we could just give em that one as a compromise for getting this thing done. Another upside for Trump would be that it would give him something positive to show in regards to the protection of national monuments. The Trump administration has been fighting to shrink the size of monuments that are already protected so that private industry can come in and harvest those precious natural resources. By establishing the web as a monument, at least the president could point to new preservation initiatives that not even oil lobbyists could object to. If he really insists, he can put his name on the data center in big gold letters. Ultimately, surpassing the technical and political challenges in establishing the web as a monument is currently infeasible. But that doesnt mean we shouldnt try. The best reason to create this unprecedented kind of monument is that its the right thing to do. As Graham told us: A society has a right to remember its own history.","We’re at a critical inflection point for the World Wide Web.

Sidney Fussell,"The Australian government is ending its plans for a national biometric database meant to help police departments track suspects and other persons of interest, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission announced Friday. Surveillance and security company NEC was awarded the contract in 2016, but after a third-party audit found the project had nearly doubled its budget, ACIC terminated the contact. “NEC is extremely disappointed by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission decision to terminate the Biometric Identification Services project. NEC has worked closely with the ACIC to deliver the BIS project and have clearly demonstrated to the ACIC that we already have a high quality solution that will meet their needs,” a spokesman said in a statement to Australian press. The Biometric Identification Services project’s goal was to expand Australia’s fingerprint identification system by adding facial recognition, palm prints, and foot prints. An audit delivered by consulting group PriceWaterhouseCoopers in November found the project was a year behind schedule and $40 million over its budget of $46 million. The report found the project “has been highly challenged to date, and presents a high risk to the ACIC,” ultimately warning against scrapping the project and recommending an overhaul, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Biometric security processes like face recognition and fingerprinting are already popular among law enforcement both in Australia and the U.S. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law’s Center of Privacy and Technology found 117 million Americans’ faces are in law enforcement networks. That’s about 50 percent of all adults in the United States. ACIC hasn’t announced if it plans to pursue a different company to build the biometric database.

Lily Hay Newman,"Venezuela's massive, nationwide power outages, which began on Thursday, have so far resulted in at least 20 deaths, looting, and loss of access to food, water, fuel, and cash for many of the country's of 31 million residents. Late Monday, the United States said its diplomats would leave the US embassy in Caracas, citing deteriorating conditions. As the societal impacts intensify and Venezuela's internal power struggle continues, the country is clearly struggling to restart its grid and meaningfully restore powera problem exacerbated by its aging infrastructure.
Reenergizing a dead grid, a process known as ""black start,"" is challenging any under circumstances. But statements from Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, opposition leader Juan Guaido, and other officials have largely failed to explain details of what caused the country's outage, or a plan for restoration. Government statements and reports indicate that the blackout stems from a problem at the enormous Guri dam hydropower plant in eastern Venezuela, which generates 80 percent of the country's electricity. And the already arduous process of restoring power seems hobbled by years of system neglect. It's also unclear whether Venezuela has the specialists, manpower, and spare equipment available on the ground to triage the situation quickly.
""The challenge with black start is always just knowing specifically what happened,"" says Nathan Wallace, the director of cyber operations and staff engineer at secure grid companies Cybirical and Ampirical Solutions. ""It sounds like there may be lack of maintenance and some mismanagement. And typically if a system hasnt been maintained, that means they really dont have the visualization needed to understand the state of the system in real time. If the procedure for black start is not accurately representing the state of the system, there can be problems.""
""The challenge with black start is always just knowing specifically what happened.""
Nathan Wallace, Cybirical and Ampirical Solutions
A black start generally involves seeding power from an independent sourcelike small diesel generators or natural gas turbinesto restart power plants in an otherwise dead transmission network. This process is often called ""bootstrapping."" Hydroelectric plants in particular can be designed to essentially black-start themselves. In these plants, wateroften from a damn, as in the case of Guriflows through a turbine, which spins it, powering an electric generator. Since it takes relatively little independent energy to open the water intake gates and potentially generate a lot of power very quickly, hydroelectric plants can work well for black start. It is unclear if Venezuela's Guri plant is designed with this scenario in mind, though.
What makes any black start process especially complicated is the need to ""load balance"" a system, so that as power surges through, the supply from the generator matches the demand. Otherwise the generation plant will run too fast or be exhausted, causing the system to fail again.
""Its a large stepwise process to build up load, build up generation, build up more load, build up more generation until theyve got enough reliability to go to the next element of the system,"" says Michael Toecker, a grid security engineer and founder of the firm Context Industrial Security. ""If a utility has issues with maintenance, or has a history of operational issues, or they dont have a plan, or that plan is outdated, or if they dont have a really good understanding of the limitations of the grid system, everything the utility is attempting to do becomes far more difficult.""
Venezuela's grid is based on a classic model of bulk power generation. From a centralized plantin this case, Gurisubstations transform electricity from low to high voltage so it can be transmitted all over the country, and then converted back down to lower voltage for local distribution. This is fairly typical in small countries, though some prioritize adding diverse generation or connecting with neighboring grids to increase redundancy. Black start researchers and practitioners say, though, that any model has pros and cons. While distributed systems don't have a single point of generation failure, they can also be more difficult to black start if they do go down, since more generation sites need to be bootstrapped and there are more loads to balance.
""Its extremely dangerous to reenergize a system if you have gear that hasnt been maintained well.""
Tim Yardley, University of Illinois
Regardless of the setup, though, the crucial component of all black starts is understanding what caused the outage, having the ability to fix it, and working with a system that can handle the power surges and fluctuations involved in bringing power back online. Without all of these elements in place, says Tim Yardley, a senior researcher at the University of Illinois focused on industrial control crisis simulations, black starts can be prohibitively difficult to execute.
""Reenergizing a grid in some ways is more of a shock to the system than it operating in its norm,"" Yardley says. ""If infrastructure is aging and theres a lack of maintenance and repairs, as you try to turn it back on and try to balance the loads you may have stuff thats not going to come back up, infrastructure thats been physically damaged or that was in such a bad state of repair that reenergizing it causes other problems.""
Crews attempting to deal with black-starting a frail and brittle grid also face major safety considerations, like explosions. ""You have a maintenance issue and a manpower issue, because its extremely dangerous to reenergize a system if you have gear that hasnt been maintained well,"" Yardley notes.
Venezuela has faced years of power instability since about 2009, including two major blackouts in 2013 and a power and water crisis in 2016. At times the blackouts were caused in part by weather conditions like El Nino, but overall they have established a pattern of poor planning, mismanagement, and lack of investment on the part of the government. President Maduro has repeatedly overseen rationing efforts resulting in erratic power and has even set official national clocks back to put the country's morning commute in daylight.
The exact nature of the current situation in Venezuela remains largely unclearconfusion which seems to be contributing to sluggish response. But meanwhile, the increasingly chaotic, dangerous conditions only underscore the stakes of restoring power as quickly as possible.
""It hit me really personally when I saw that hospitals with babies on ventilators and respirators were switching to people manually pumping,"" Cybirical's Wallace says. ""Ive been in black start situations that were definitely stressful, but I can tell you they werent as stressful. There wasnt a whole country relying on me.""

Eric Niiler,"The governments new weather forecast model has a slight problem: It predicts that outside temperatures will be a few degrees colder than what nature delivers. This cold bias means that local meteorologists are abandoning the National Weather Service in favor of forecasts produced by British and European weather agencies.
For the past few weeks, the National Weather Service has been forecasting snowfall that ends up disappearing, according to Doug Kammerer, chief meteorologist at WRC-TV in Washington, DC. Its just not performing well, Kammerer says. It has continued to show us getting big-time snowstorms in this area, where the European model will not show it.
The new model, known as GFS-FV3 (Finite Volume on a Cubed Sphere dynamical core), has often overpredicted snow in the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, a region where incorrect forecasts affect the lives of tens of millions of people.
The existing NWS forecast model, called the Global Forecast System, or GFS, has long been considered second in accuracy to the European models. Now Kammerer and others say the new FV3 upgrade is worse than the forecast model put out by our neighbors to the north. The running joke now among meteorologists is that [the FV3] is looking more like the Canadian model, Kammerer says. For those not plugged into weather humor, apparently the Canadian model also predicts big snowstorms that ultimately vanish.
The FV3 was developed over the past three years by NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. FV3 forecasts were released a few weeks ago for testing by local meteorologists, and many of them took to Twitter to complain about the results. I have no faith in the FV3 [for snowfall], tweeted Boston-based Judah Cohen, a meteorologist at Atmospheric Environmental Research, a private firm that provides forecasts to commercial and government clients.
On Wednesday, the National Weather Service tweeted that the FV3 will be fully operational on March 20. But a NWS official told WIRED on Friday that the agency might push it back a few weeks because of all the complaints.
The FV3 upgrade uses an enhanced set of algorithms that have been developed in the past few years by climate scientists to describe the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans. These algorithms, which capture the physics of cloud formation, tropical storms, and polar winds, among other things, are then populated with temperature data from satellites and surface observations to generate a three- or 10-day forecast.
No model is perfect, says David Novak, acting director of the NWS National Center for Environmental Prediction. The weather community knows this. Novak acknowledges that the FV3 has a cold bias and that the agency is working to fix it. It tends to be colder than what is observed. It appears to be a systematic issue, we are doing our due diligence and investigating these reports.
Novak says the 35-day government shutdown slowed final testing of the FV3. When federal climate scientists and programmers got back to work on January 25, the agency expected the model to be almost ready to go live. It looks like that deadline will now be pushed back.
He argues, however, that the FV3 isnt all bad. He says it produces more accurate forecasts of hurricane intensity and the jet stream, the current of high-altitude air around the northern hemisphere that drives much of the United States weather patterns. We found a lot of the good things, Novak says. We do know there are some areas that may need additional improvement.
NOAA recently signed an agreement with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a Boulder-based research facility that also develops forecast models. Antonio Busalacchi, director of NCARs parent agency, says hes optimistic that the new NWS model will get better over time. Its premature to evaluate any one modeling system based on a snapshot with snowfall forecasts, Busalacchi says. One needs to look at the totality of the system.
At the same time, Busalacchi says that NWS and its parent agency, NOAA, might want to rely on help from academic scientists who are developing their own forecast models. We want to get in a position where the research community and operational community are more collaborative than we have been in the past, he says.
As for Kammerer, he says he'll keep watching the new NWS model as he prepares his own forecast for the weather in Washington, DC. But maybe not for the next snow day.

ANDREW HIGGINS,"Eugenijus Bunka, the son of a prewar Jewish resident who survived because he fled to the Soviet Union, said Mr. Noreika probably didn’t kill Jews himself but still bore responsibility as an administrator who signed orders seizing their property and ordering their “isolation.” “I hear all these people shouting about defending our patriots, but the people who have another view are all silent,” he said, pointing to one of the pits where Plunge’s Jewish residents were buried after being shot or beaten to death by their neighbors. When Ms. Foti started researching her book on her grandfather 18 years ago, she expected to produce a glowing tribute. “My grandfather was going to be the white knight in shining armor, a pure hero from beginning to end,” she said. “I had always heard how he had done so much for Lithuania and had died at the early age of 36 at the hands of the K.G.B.” Instead, after digging up wartime documents with her grandfather’s signature relating to the treatment of Jews and talking to relatives and others during research trips to Lithuania, she realized that he had been an accomplice in mass murder. Mr. Noreika, she said, did not pull the trigger himself but was a “desk killer.” She said he oversaw the slaughter in Plunge, where his family moved into a handsome home seized from its Jewish owners, and also in the nearby town of Siauliai, where he served as county chief under the Nazis starting in late 1941 — and where the main government building now has a plaque in his honor. “Lithuanians have been raped three times — by the Communists twice and by the Nazis once,” Ms. Foti said. “All they know is that they were raped, that they are the victims.

We’ve collected highlights below. Each Monday on Hack Your City, we ask readers for your best tips on a city: driving tips, restaurant recs, things to do, and any other advice for visitors and locals. Then on Thursday, we present the best comments. We’re working our way around the U.S. and around the globe. “Leave camp inhumanly early to start your day,” says Slacklinejoe in a great overview comment about optimizing your visit. “Some of the best wildlife experiences and stunning views happen before most folks have rolled out of their tent/RV/whatever, and getting golden hour shots will set your photos apart from the crowd.” Sounds worth it even if you’re not taking photos. “Like I’m talking 6 am early,” says Rebecca. Dress for the cold, says everyone. “Bring a hat/mittens/jacket suitable for 30s-40s temps no matter what time of year you come,” says DaveSs, in another great overview comment. They recount a snowy June visit, followed by a week with highs in the 80s. “If you fly into Bozeman, you’ll have two options for entering the park: West Yellowstone (West entrance) or Gardiner (North entrance). Choose based on what you intend to see first,” says Tim, explaining the advantages of each at the start of a lengthy guide to the park. Other tips include handling a bear attack, lodge recs, and a suggested itinerary. “Keep weed on the DL. It is federal land, federal laws. I knew of a few people who got popped,” says BobJerryPhil. “Even though there’s tons of tourists, the wildlife still go wherever they want, says howmanyiphones. “Take your time passing a bison on the road. They’re huge and they’ll probably win in a fight with your car.” And be careful! People die in the park from falling off ledges, into running water, or into boiling springs, say several readers. Yellowstone is big. “No matter where you stay, you are going to have to travel long distances on slow, crowded roads to get to all of the various sights/hikes/locations,” says Sneeje. So be patient and don’t try to do it all at once. “Each corner of the park can easily fill a whole day, especially if you like to hike,” says MonkeyT. Reservations fill up quickly, so plan ahead. But, says MC63i, keep checking them for cancellations. They also suggest eating at the diner counters in souvenir shops to avoid long waits at restaurants. “Winter is the absolute best time to go, hands down,” says bozemanite in a long and helpful comment. “The roads are closed to vehicle traffic so you need to rent snowmobiles or ride in the awesome snowcoaches. It’s so great in the winter not only because of all the life and whatnot, but also because it’s as close as you’re going to get to having the entire park to yourself. Plus you can also Ski the Cold Smoke at Bridger and experience the vastness of the largest resort in America, Big Sky.” “Sounds ridiculous I know,” says John Star, “but bring a cheap super-light pith helmet type hat with fine mesh mosquito net to cover your entire head, beekeeper style. Those black clouds of blood sucking ‘state birds’ can and will bite through anything and completely ruin your trip.” “Talk with people at each site about where they’ve been, says Litch_e. “We saw one bison here and there but it wasn’t until we spoke with someone at the towers that we heard about herds of bison in a certain valley. We quickly went to the valley and saw multiple herds.” Don’t do this “Do not keep any food in your car,” says Sixteen Statues. “Nothing that smells like food, either. No wrappers, no chocolate bars, no chips, NOTHING. Bears will smash your car windows in to get to them. It smells a whole lot more filling to them than berries.” “Don’t stop in the friggin’ road for a picture,” says Vlachen. “Absolutely no selfies 10ft away from a bison,” says DaveSs. Don’t speed, says Alex W. “The park rangers do not mess around. It’s not that you can’t handle the road at ‘normal’ speeds, it’s that you have NO idea what’s around the next corner.” “Avoid the Madison junction during evening hours (maybe commuter hours),” says nakul. If you are not staying at West Yellowstone, try to not cross this part of Yellowstone in the evening.” Overlooked spots “The Lonestar Geyser is a short hike/bike from the trail, and is much more dramatic and satisfying than Old Faithful,” says monkeyhumper. “Some of the less popular geyser loops like Painted Pots are just as freaking awesome as anything else,” says Rebecca. “All 3 times I’ve been to the park (including mid-July), Lamar Valley has been virtually deserted of other tourists,” says Skullsfortheskullthrone. “Nice hikes along the rivers/streams, and this is where a lot of the wolves in the park tend to spend time so good chance of seeing them, especially if you’re the only people around.” And multiple commenters recommend the less crowded Grand Teton National Park just south of Yellowstone. “They have ranger-guided wildlife ‘hunts’ in the evenings,” says RgbyRef. “If you plan to make a trip of two nights I recommend camping in GTNP, leave the camper, and drive early to yellowstone for a day trip,” says RCJ.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","National parks became the poster child of the 2013 government shut down. Barricades were put up around national treasures and on the National Mall, people clambered over them, Congressional grandstanding took place at the World War II memorial. Republicans were pretty resoundingly blamed for the mess. Now another government shutdown is mere hours away. Republicans are again being blamed, and federal lands are again at risk of being a public relations battleground. A shutdown would mean thousands of employees, including park rangers, would be furloughed while Congress attempts to get its act together. The Trump administration, perhaps learning from the nightmare last time, is planning to approach national parks a bit differently should the government shut down. The Department of Interior has sent guidance to local park officials telling them that “park roads, lookouts, trails and open-air memorials will generally remain accessible to visitors.” It’s meant to be a win for the public, but that’s a tough sell given the Trump administration’s regressive public lands and wildlife policies. And, it turns out, making sure parks “generally remain accessible” could end up being a nightmare for visitors, as well as the wonders parks are meant to protect. “In practice, what this means is that all nonessential personnel are precluded from working,” Mark Squillace, an environmental law professor at the University of Colorado, told Earther. “They cannot even volunteer. Park employees can presumably work as necessary to protect public property or public safety, but not simply to provide public services that might be necessary for public enjoyment of the parks.” In a statement to Earther, National Park Service spokesperson Jeffrey Olson said “that roads that have already been open will remain open (think snow removal) and vault toilets (wilderness type restrooms) will remain open.” As they did during the 2013 shutdown, law enforcement rangers will also continue their duties in order to keep the peace. But it takes a lot more than roads and pit toilets to make a park function. Visitors will miss out on being able to talk with a park ranger who knows the history, museums, and other resources that tell the rich history of the park. But really, the bathroom situtaion is the biggest concern. “That’s the number one thing they teach you in ranger school: You don’t want parks open without bathrooms open,” an anonymous veteran ranger told Emily Atkin at The New Republic. “Imagine how much exposed feces there might be.” As a former park ranger, I can tell you this is absolutely true. “Where’s the bathroom?” is far and away the most popular visitor question. When it’s not readily accessible, things can go downhill in a hurry. What happened at Glacier National Park during a warm spring a few years ago—when the park was fully staffed no less—is instructive of how visitors can behave when their basic needs aren’t met. “Keeping parks open without full staff is a needless risk and potentially dangerous.” “People were kicking in the door to restrooms even though plumbing wasn’t on and they crossed gates into closed areas,” the park’s superintendent, Jeff Mow, told me at the time for a story on how climate change is affecting parks. While Glacier public information officer Lauren Alley told Earther that the park will have pit toilets available, other parks don’t necessarily have any easily accessible. At Crater Lake National Park, a place where yours truly worked, the winter restroom options are indoors, along the rim of the lake and at the main visitor center. All visitors centers are considered non-essential so will be closed, though gift shops operated by outside concessionaires can remain open, and could offer a workaround to keep some flushable toilets open. Things could get messy fast, even with the tiny trickle of winter visitors Glacier, Crater Lake, and other snowbound parks receive. For parks like Death Valley, Arches or any of the National Park Service-managed sites in South Florida, now is prime time to visit because of the mild weather. With fewer rangers on staff, there are both fewer eyes to make sure visitors are safe, and to make sure they don’t wander into places they shouldn’t for ecological reasons. Rangers help educate people about the delicate cryptobiotic soil that forms a living crust on the ground they shouldn’t go tramping across in Arches. With nobody to share that message, visitors could unwittingly cause damage that will take 5-7 years to heal under the absolute best circumstances. Other parks with significant archeological resources could be at greater risk of looting with fewer eyes on resources. And unlike the soil, once they’re gone, no amount of time can bring them back. “ Even when they are fully staffed, rangers are challenged to prevent vandalism, looting, and even damage to plants and other sensitive resources that visitors can harm accidentally,” The National Parks Conservation Association wrote ahead of the 2013 shutdown (emphasis theirs). The same holds true today. “Keeping parks open without full staff is a needless risk and potentially dangerous, both for the resources we are supposed to protect, and the visitors’ safety,” a 12-year veteran park ranger, who asked to have their name withheld because they still work for the agency, told Earther.","National parks became the poster child of the 2013 government shut down.

Gediman: Basically what we’ve done is that anyone with a campsite was told they have to go, and the hotel folks too, but for employees there’s no specific place. That’s frankly one of our concerns. We have about 500 employees and the concessionaire, which runs the hotels and the restaurants. If someone has nowhere to go, there are Red Cross shelters in the surrounding communities.

ALAN BLINDER,"Mr. Harlow, the city councilman, said it was “important to ask why no other local government in America is bidding on this convention.” Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, many cities have grown wary of hosting national conventions, with the security demands they entail. But the reservations about the 2020 Republican convention have been particularly pointed, in part because of the likelihood of large street protests against Mr. Trump. Pat McCrory, a Republican who was Charlotte’s mayor for 14 years, said left-wing activists were to blame for any difficulties the party has in arranging a convention site. “I think there’s a great deal of political pressure from the fringes, from the far left of the Democratic Party, to show absolutely no cooperation with the Republican Party and our president,” Mr. McCrory, also a former governor of North Carolina, said in an interview after the vote. “Any sign of support can be seen as a political suicide from the political left wing.” On Monday, though, four Charlotte Democrats on the council voted along with the two Republican members to support holding the Republican convention in their city. “It just feels like we’re constantly fighting over toll roads, over nondiscrimination ordinances, over Black Lives Matter, over immigrants’ rights, over a lot of things, and I know that we’ll continue to have fights,” said Julie Eiselt, the mayor pro tem. “But the only time we move forward, like we’ve seen with housing, is when we say, ‘Let’s work together.’”",North Carolina’s largest city has not been eager to embrace a bid for the Republican National Convention in 2020.

Cady Voge,"When Juan Pinto gets in line at the movie theater, he takes out his phone and trades just enough bitcoin for Venezuelan bolivars to pay for the ticket by the time he gets to the counter. Pinto lives in Venezuela, but doesn’t keep any of his money in the national currency. The 29-year-old quit his job as a mechanical engineer to dedicate his life to cryptocurrency three years ago, when he says he “fell in love with the technology.” Venezuela’s crumbling economy played a part as well. “Being a Venezuelan and living in the situation that I’m in, I was more willing to take some risks,” he tells me over Skype. In the US, bitcoin is primarily a speculative investment, whose soaring price has been compared to a bubble. But in Venezuela, where inflation topped 2,616 percent last year, cryptocurrency is a way around restrictions on holding foreign currency, and in some cases, a means of survival. That’s made Venezuela an interesting laboratory for cryptocurrency serving as both a real currency and a viable means of storing value. As the government prints more bolivars, their value plummets; the government recently released a 100,000-bolivar note, currently worth less than 50 US cents at the black-market rate. Bitcoin holders, by contrast, have something most people don’t: a currency that’s worth something. The national currency, officially called the “strong bolivar,” has lost 98 percent of its value against the dollar at the black-market rate in the last year, and the International Monetary Fund predicts that the country’s economy will shrink by 15 percent in 2018. Even President Nicolás Maduro’s government seemed to have lost confidence in the bolivar when last month it introduced a cryptocurrency of its own, the “ petro.” Maduro says his digital money is backed by the country’s natural resources such as oil, gold, and diamonds. The petro may be novel—a digital token centrally controlled by a government is ideologically at odds with the original idea for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin relies on a ledger, called a blockchain, stored on millions of computers. By design, the currency, created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, is not owned or controlled by any single person, company, or government. Many Venezuelans who have turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent years have done so precisely because their government has nothing to do with it. “Being a Venezuelan and living in the situation that I’m in, I was more willing to take some risks."" Pinto started earning bitcoin in 2015 by mining it from his home, meaning his personal computer was continuously running software that works to solve complex math problems, which over time earns you fractions of the digital money. He still has six mining machines but he’s shipped them all to a business partner in China, for safety reasons. The low cost of electricity in Venezuela makes the socialist country one of the most popular places to operate the energy-guzzling mining computers, but it’s also one of the most dangerous places to do so. Mining bitcoin from home is an easy way to earn extra money in Venezuela, but Pinto says that it also puts a target on your front door. Maduro’s government, which controls the electric utilities, has gotten hip to what exorbitant energy use in a single residence means. Authorities with information on energy use show up at homes and either confiscate the machines or extort the miners, and sometimes arrest and detain them as well. Pinto says he’s heard too many stories like this, and that for him, mining inside Venezuela is not worth it. One Caracas software developer, who did not want to be named for security reasons, mines cryptocurrencies on five machines that he’s installed in the homes of five different friends. On average, the coins he’s mining yield a value of $300 to $500 per machine each month. He and other clever miners in Venezuela spread out their machines so there’s no detectable increase in their electricity use. Some of the homes that host the developer’s machines are empty because the owners have fled the country. The homeowners collect up to 30 percent of the developer’s earnings, and the machines record electricity use, making it less likely their home, and belongings, will be seen as abandoned. In other words, mining in excess can put you at risk, but mining just the right amount can protect your home, and your possessions, from being stolen. The developer says he has a good salary that he’s able to live on in Venezuela, so he says he no longer exchanges any of his cryptocurrency for bolivars. He’s holding on to his digital coins as investments. If he ever decides to emigrate, he won’t have to open a new bank account or send wire transfers to access his savings of cryptocurrencies. John Villar is a computer engineer who lives in Caracas with his wife and three kids. In 2013 he realized that the fraction of a bitcoin he had mined two years earlier, just for fun, was worth $100. “With $100 you can live for a month like a king in Venezuela,” Villar laughs. He says he spends just $50 on groceries each month to feed his family of five. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Bitcoin Villar stopped mining about a year ago for the same reason that Pinto shipped his machines to China: He doesn’t want to live in fear. Now most of his income comes from “bounties,” solving complex coding bugs for companies such as Counterparty, which use blockchain technology. The first coder to fix the bug earns the bounty. He says he will collect 500 Counterparty tokens, worth roughly $6,500 at the moment, for his most recent code fix. Villar lives very well by current Venezuelan standards, but says that much of his earnings go toward buying and shipping medicines for his wife, who has multiple sclerosis. Her medications haven’t been available in Venezuela for two years. In order to get those and other household supplies, Villar sells bitcoin for US dollars, buys the products online, and ships them to a company in the US that provides door-to-door delivery to his home in Venezuela. Another Venezuelan, who works in the creative industry, entered the bitcoin economy in March 2017 when a client asked to pay in bitcoin. One bitcoin was worth around $1,000 then; it has since soared to roughly $8,500, making that project even more lucrative. Since then, this man has accepted payment on two other projects in bitcoin and started buying other cryptocurrencies and trading them in search of profits. But he doesn’t widely advertise that he accepts bitcoin because he doesn’t want people to know that he has some, again, for security reasons. The creative worker was in his office in Caracas when I asked him what he thought the future held for the Venezuelan economy. He told me that from his desk he can see the street below, where people frequently rummage through the garbage for food; it’s rare, he says, to find a trash bag in the city that hasn’t been ripped open. “It’s something really depressing,” he says, “and the proof of how bad we are as a country. There’s a lot of hunger, poverty, and I think it will be worse and worse with the passing of time.” People with jobs that pay them in US dollars or other foreign or cryptocurrencies live in a different reality than those who are paid in bolivars. Bitcoin holders have something most people don’t: a currency that’s worth something. Pinto says he feels bad for people earning bolivars and trying to make ends meet, “I hear people complaining everytime I go to a grocery store or a restaurant about the prices like, ‘No, it’s impossible,’ about a meal that is $4, and that’s not a lot, but in Venezuela $4 is a lot of money.” The minimum wage in the country is currently hovering around $5 per month. The site Pinto uses to instantly exchange bitcoin for bolivars is called LocalBitcoins, where buyers and sellers meet and negotiate their own exchange rate. That’s convenient in a country where the local currency’s value changes nearly every day. Pinto started a business called Dr. Miner where he charges a one-time fee to install a single mining computer in a home. The owner doesn’t need to know anything about cryptography or even mining; the software runs on the machine and the owner can earn from $200 to $900 per month, he says. The machines generally cost $100 to $300. Of his friends and family, Pinto says only about 10 percent are still in Venezuela. Most with the means to do so have left the country. His entire family is in Spain and he tells me that he will probably go there soon too. But for now he, like others who’ve stayed, must manage his family’s assets, and this too he is facilitating with cryptocurrency. When he discovered that a prospective renter for his father’s apartment in Caracas also had bitcoin, they agreed the renter would pay half of the deposit (six months rent) in bitcoin. After agreeing on the deal, the renter sent Pinto the bitcoin; Pinto then transferred it to his brother in Madrid, and his brother sold it on LocalBitcoins for euros. Pinto’s father had the rent money in his Spanish bank account within the hour, avoiding delays and fees of an international wire transfer. The appeal of cryptocurrency in a sick country such as Venezuela is obvious, it takes away the need to trust the government and the banks, and puts some control in the hands of people living in a place of chaos. For now, bitcoin is mostly accessible to Venezuela’s middle and upper class, those with college degrees and often multiple passports or access to bank accounts outside of the country. But necessity is the mother of innovation, and perhaps, unlike most prior technological inventions, bitcoin will be driven into the mainstream by economies that are failing rather than thriving. Crypto-Currency Despite last year's rapid rise in bitcoin's value, weakness in its underlying technology could crimp its long-term viability. Read this epic tale of a man who forgot his PIN, and lost $30,000 in bitcoin. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than the nation of Serbia; it could soon surpass US electricity consumption.","Faced with runaway inflation and a weak national currency, Venezuelans are turning to cryptocurrencies to store savings and conduct some transactions.",2018-03-22T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Where Could Bitcoin Succeed as a Currency?

DAVID BROOKS,"In “The Meaning of Marriage,” Tim and Kathy Keller emphasize that in any bad relationship the natural tendency is to see the other person’s selfishness as the key problem. But relationships only thrive when each partner sees his or her own selfishness as the key problem. After all, your own selfishness is the only one you can really control, the only one you have responsibility for. This brings us to the truism that, when arguing, “I” sentences are better than “you” sentences. As Daphne de Marneffe writes in her excellent book “The Rough Patch,” think of the different emotional impacts of these two sentences: “I’d stop yelling if you were more helpful.” And: “I know I’m a piece of work, but I’m trying to control my yelling.” The crucial step, which several books come back to, is the raw and willful decision each partner must make just to recommit. The relationship is strife-ridden. Every fiber of your body says to retreat to the safety of your foxhole. But you have to go against yourself and lunge toward intimacy. As Mike Mason puts it in “The Mystery of Marriage,” “A marriage lives, paradoxically, upon those almost impossible times when it is perfectly clear to the two partners that nothing else but pure sacrificial love can hold them together.” This involves, he writes, “a deliberate choosing of closeness over distance, of companionship over detachment, of relationship over isolation.” That involves a relentless turning toward each other. John Gottman, who I suppose is the dean of marriage experts, describes relationship as a pattern of bids and volleys. One partner makes a conversational bid: “Look how beautiful the sunset looks!” The other partner can either respond with a toward bid: “Wow. Incredible. Thanks for pointing it out!”; or an against bid: “I was reading the paper, do you mind?”; or a turning-away bid, which would be grunting and not responding at all. Successful marriages, Gottman finds, have five toward bids for every one of the other kinds. The relationship masters, he told Emily Esfahani Smith in The Atlantic, are the people who are actively scanning the social horizon for things they appreciate about the other person and can say thank you for.",Some therapeutic wisdom about how to heal our politics.,2018-06-04T23:39:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: How to Repair the National Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/opinion/partisanship-tribalism-marriage-bipartisan-debate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/05/opinion/05brooksWeb/05brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1
Tom Simonite,"In March 2016, Alphabet’s DeepMind research group set a milestone in artificial intelligence when its AlphaGo program defeated professional Go player Lee Sedol, then fifth-ranked in the world, at the complex board game Go. Now China’s Tencent is claiming a milestone of its own in Go—and China’s ambitions in artificial intelligence. Last week, the company’s Fine Art program defeated China’s top professional Ke Jie, despite giving him a significant head start. Ke recently slipped to number two in the world, after holding the top spot for three years. Fine Art’s victory won notice in the world of Go because it helps illustrate the gulf that has opened between human and machine players of the complex boardgame. But it also highlights a shrinking gulf—between AI capabilities in the US and China. In a detailed national strategy for AI released last summer, China set a goal of drawing level with America by 2020, and pulling ahead by 2030. Central, state, and municipal governments are directing money towards AI research and companies. Tencent, whose offerings span from messaging to payments and music, was named to a “ national team ” for AI by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology in November, alongside four other tech giants. Greg Allen, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security, says the company’s Go program shows the US should take China’s technological ambitions seriously. “Fine Art is yet more proof of the stunning progress China has made in AI technology,” he says. China’s big AI push was partly spurred by AlphaGo’s victory in 2016. Professors who advised the Chinese government on the AI plan told the New York Times that Alphabet’s achievement was a “Sputnik moment” in which officials realized they lagged the US in a technology with broad commercial and military applications. Go was invented in China more than 3,000 years ago, and is still viewed as an important part of Chinese cultural heritage. Players take turns placing stones on a 19-by-19 grid in a battle for territory that is many times more complex than chess. Handicaps are used to level the playing field between people of different skill levels. Tencent’s Fine Art defeated Ke Jie despite giving the one-time world champion a two-stone head start. That suggests the program is in a different league than the best humans, not just slightly better. Ingo Althöfer, a math professor and Go expert at Friedrich Schiller University of Jena in Germany, says that it has generally been held that a perfect “Go God” could beat the best human with a three-stone handicap. “Fine Art is trying to reach this limit of perfect play,” he says. Althöfer calls Ke Jie “likely the best human player currently.” DeepMind has so far ignored calls for AlphaGo to play handicapped games in public, Althöfer says. Alphabet’s use of the game to demonstrate the might of its AI muscle rankled some Chinese officials. Google took AlphaGo to China for a “Future of Go Summit” last summer, with the main event a match in which the software defeated Ke Jie. Chinese state television reversed plans to cover the match shortly before it began, and local internet providers blocked Chinese-language broadcasts half an hour after the match started. Tencent created Fine Art in 2016, and has previously said the software has beaten several professionals, including Ke Jie. The company says the latest, upgraded version played a series of handicapped games against professionals starting on Jan. 9. The match against the 20-year-old Ke Jie on Jan. 17 was the capstone. Fine Art still isn’t perfect, though. The International Go Federation reports that Fine Art played 34 games against professionals given a two-stone handicap, and won 30. Those results, like China’s rapid advance in AI, came with an assist from Alphabet and other US companies. Tencent says the latest version of Fine Art drew inspiration from a paper by DeepMind last year about an improved version of AlphaGo called AlphaGo Zero. Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, and many other US companies have helped stoke the worldwide uptick of interest in AI by publishing research papers and releasing software packages. Althöfer is now hoping Tencent and Alphabet will agree to the ultimate Go showdown: Fine Art versus AlphaGo. China's AI Ascent Some US politicians argue restricting Chinese investments would slow the country's advances in AI— it wouldn't work. China's roads will open to self-driving vehicles before America's do, says Chinese search engine Baidu. Government officials suppressed coverage of Alphabet's software AlphaGo defeating China's top Go player, Ke Jie last summer.","China is making a national push in artificial intelligence.

 Anti-government protests erupted in the neighbourhood where the alleged rebellion took place
Members of Venezuela's National Guard have been arrested after they allegedly revolted against the government of President Nicolás Maduro, the defence ministry said in a statement. 
Videos posted on social media showed the officers calling for the removal from office of President Maduro.
The men reportedly seized weapons from a National Guard command post in the Cotiza area of the capital, Caracas.
Footage also shows residents and security forces clashing in the area.

 The National Guard fired tear gas at residents in the Cotiza neighbourhood
The incident comes a year after a rebel police helicopter pilot, Óscar Pérez, threw grenades at government buildings before being killed in a shoot-out with the security forces. 
The ministry of defence said a ""small group"" of National Guard members had stolen weapons from a security post in the Petare neighbourhood of Caracas and taken four officers hostage before making their way to Cotiza in the early hours of Monday.
A video sent to opposition Twitter account @soldadoDfranela shows a man in uniform saying he is acting ""on behalf of the Venezuelan people"" and encouraging Venezuelans to take to the streets in protest at the government.
According to the defence ministry statement, they encountered ""strong resistance"" from officers loyal to the government in the National Guard command post in Cotiza.
It is not clear whether they were overpowered or handed themselves in to the authorities. The statement goes on to say that the weapons they seized have been retrieved and that the men are being questioned.
It says the officers were driven by ""the dark interests of the extreme right"" without giving further details. The Venezuelan government routinely blames shadowy righwing forces for any dissent in the country.
Footage shared on opposition websites shows residents of the neighbourhood taking to the streets in protest at the government in the wake of the overnight incident.

 Cars were set alight in the aftermath of the incident at the National Guard command post
The residents complain about a lack of water and shout ""we want Nicolás to go"" as the security forces try to disperse them with tear gas. Some erect barricades and set them alight.
Venezuelans have been suffering from power and water cuts as well as severe shortages of food and medicines for years. According to United Nations figures, three million have left the country in recent years. 
A wave of mass anti-government protests swept through the country in April and May 2017 but after the arrest of hundreds of demonstrators and a number of deadly clashes, the protests dwindled away with many saying they were too afraid to take to the streets.
But in the past weeks, the new leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, has called on those critical of the government to resume their protests once again and has called for anti-government marches to be held on Wednesday.",Members of the National Guard are arrested for allegedly plotting a revolt against the president.,2019-01-21T15:10:08Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Venezuela 'foils national guard rebellion' against Maduro,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46945690,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/60FC/production/_105282842_9375a6f9-5646-41d5-8da5-590905d08099.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
John K. Delaney,"French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent visit to Washington highlighted how differently our two nations are thinking about the future. In March, the French government unveiled a national strategy for artificial intelligence technology that has a clear goal: make France a global leader in AI. In the last year, China and the European Union have taken similar steps. If we’re serious about having a prosperous economy for decades to come, the United States should do the same. WIRED OPINION ABOUT US Representative John K. Delaney (D-MD) ( @RepJohnDelaney ) is the founder of the AI Caucus and is the only former CEO of a publicly traded company in the House of Representatives. The French strategy —ambitiously titled “For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence”—was outlined in a comprehensive 147-page document authored by world-renowned mathematician and a member of French Parliament Cédric Villani. Importantly, the report shows the French government anticipating AI’s impact on the job market and attempting to get ahead of change so that their citizens can benefit. As President Macron recently told WIRED, “I think artificial intelligence will disrupt all the different business models and it’s the next disruption to come. So I want to be part of it. Otherwise I will just be subjected to this disruption without creating jobs in this country.” France’s national strategy also reveals that Macron’s government is wrestling with how to ensure that AI supports inclusivity and diversity, and to make certain that its implementation is transparent. The French aren’t just theorizing; they’re taking action. France plans to invest 1.5 billion euros (almost $1.8 billion dollars) in the next five years in artificial intelligence research. The French are looking to create their own AI ecosystem, train the next generation of scientists and engineers, and make sure that their workforce is prepared for an automated future. France isn’t alone. Last month, the European Union’s executive branch recommended its member states increase their public and private sector investment in AI. It also pledged billions in direct research spending. Meanwhile, China laid out its AI plan for global dominance last year, a plan that has also been backed up with massive investment. China’s goal is to lead the world in AI technology by 2030. Around the world, our global economic competitors are taking action on artificial intelligence. It’s therefore striking that the United States doesn’t have a national artificial intelligence plan. Despite the recent private meeting with tech executives at the White House, the administration has taken little action in this area. That’s why last year I joined with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate in introducing the Future of AI Act, the first bill of its kind to be introduced in Congress. The bill looks at some of the same key questions that the French have examined, because when you zoom out it is clear that these concerns are universal: How can we make sure that workers and society will benefit? How can we encourage and support economy-boosting and job-creating research? And how can we ensure that AI will be implemented ethically and without bias, while also protecting user privacy? The legislation creates an advisory committee at the Department of Commerce composed of scientists, engineers, ethicists, and civil liberties experts, as well as representatives from labor groups, technology companies, and federal officials. The committee will have 18 months to issue recommendations on how to ensure that artificial intelligence is a positive for the country. The United States needs a full assessment of the state of American research and technology, and what the short and long-term problems and opportunities are. The Future of AI Act, along with the work of the AI Caucus—a bipartisan group I founded—are all about starting the conversation. Right now, in the United States there’s an incredible discussion taking place about AI, automation, the future of work, and privacy—but all of that is taking place in the private sector, academia, and think tanks. Government is woefully behind. There’s no focus on the future. The strength of the United States' private sector makes us the envy of the world, but without a national strategy and increased public investment, we risk having a few companies control the most elemental science of the future. A healthy marketplace needs competition and innovation. Elected officials need to look at the facts and work to find common ground. Whether you are a conservative or a progressive, this future is coming. As I look at where the world is headed, I believe that we need to expand public investment in research, encourage collaboration between the public and private sector, and make sure that AI is deployed in a way that is wholly consistent with our values and with existing laws. Policymakers must understand that machine learning and automation's impact on the economy and job market will mirror that of globalization. The US needs a plan to prepare the workforce to not only survive this change but thrive. The US also needs a much more prominent public debate over the policies around artificial intelligence, since this will be a massively influential technology. Today, we’re not even having the discussion. There’s no plan for where we want to go. China and France already have a plan. If the US doesn't act, we’re in danger of falling behind.

MARC TRACY,"ATLANTA — They come from bordering states and recruit the same players. They devise schemes with matching strengths and weaknesses. One coach used to work for the other coach. Tonight in Atlanta, Georgia and Alabama meet in college football’s national championship game for the first time. Photo Credit Streeter Lecka/Getty Images Stay here for live updates and analysis from Atlanta. How to watch: Kickoff is at 8:17 p.m. Eastern. ESPN has the broadcast, but you can stream the game here. Here are the top story lines for the national championship game. ■ Who is better? Alabama and Georgia have only played 13 and 14 games, respectively, so we don’t truly know which team is actually better. In the national semifinals, Georgia needed double-overtime to beat Oklahoma, while Alabama controlled Clemson in a 24-6 win. The Sagarin Ratings call Alabama the best team in the country and Georgia the third-best. Betting odds have generally pegged Alabama a 4-point favorite. Sounds about right. ■ Trump attending: President Trump is still scheduled to attend the game. The White House had declined ESPN’s request to interview him, ESPN’s Stephanie Druley said Sunday. “We will obviously show him at the game, when we see where he’s sitting and everything else, but we’re waiting for the White House.” POTUS Donald Trump expected to visit Alabama radio booth during tonight's game. — WBRC Steve Crocker (@Fox6Steve) Jan. 8, 2018 Outside Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where the uncharacteristic cold front merged with rain, crowds were larger than might be expected waiting to get in, as police along with Secret Service searched bags and attendees had to go through metal detectors. ■ Running the ball: Alabama and Georgia are relatively conservative by college football standards. On offense, the priority is to establish the run; on defense, the priority is to stop the run. Both teams ranked in the top ten of the Football Bowl Subdivision in rush yards per game, while Georgia was 20th to Alabama’s No. 1 on defense. Both teams have talented running back tandems: Damien Harris and Bo Scarbrough for Alabama; Nick Chubb and Sony Michel for Georgia. But if you want to look at a variable, Alabama’s starting right guard, junior Lester Cotton Sr., is out with a leg injury sustained in the semifinal win over Clemson. Maybe Alabama can try running to the left? Continue reading the main story","Alabama and Georgia, two titans of the Southeastern Conference, square off to decide the national champion.

Tom McKay,"A Chinese national who was living in the U.S. on a student visa pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of trafficking in counterfeit goods and conspiracy over a plot to sell Chinese-made Apple knockoffs to U.S. customers. According to a Department of Justice press release, 43-year-old Jianhua “Jeff” Li’s company Dream Digitals conspired with at least three others to smuggle over 40,000 Chinese-made “electronic devices and accessories, including iPads and iPhones, along with labels and packaging bearing counterfeit Apple trademarks.” In the process, Li netted some $1.1 million in sales revenue from customers who believed they were buying actual Apple products. He also smuggled in parts separately from the counterfeit labels in order to assemble the electronics stateside, part of an effort to avoid detection by customs officials. “Proceeds from the sales of the devices were funneled back to the co-conspirators’ accounts in Florida and New Jersey via structured cash deposits and a portion of the proceeds was then transferred to conspirators in Italy, further disguising the source of the funds,” the DOJ wrote. According to court documents, prosecutors say that if the products were genuine, they would have been worth over $15 million. Jianhua “Jeff” Li's pleads guilty to participating in an Apple counterfeiting operation. Read more Read China has a robust counterfeiting industry; in 2015, officials there busted a factory for producing 41,000 fake iPhones worth up to $19.4 million in one year alone, per Fortune. The counterfeiting ring bought second-hand components in Shenzen and “hired hundreds of workers to reassemble them on six production lines.” Years earlier in 2011, Chinese authorities were reported to have uncovered at least 22 fake Apple stores in the city of Kunming. According to Fortune, the International Chamber of Commerce estimated the global counterfeit trade was worth up to $1.7 trillion in 2012, and China accounted for almost 70 percent of seizures of fake products globally over a period from 2008 to 2010. Apple has separately filed lawsuits against Amazon retailers for selling fake products, like Mobile Star LLC, which it alleged sold large numbers of counterfeit Lightning cables and charges.

LISA LERER and SHANE GOLDMACHER,"Wisconsin holds a searing place in the Democratic Party psyche after Hillary Clinton, the partys last presidential nominee, opted not to campaign in the traditionally blue state during the general election a decision that some blamed for her 22,000-vote defeat in the state.

The National Park Foundation (NPF) has launched PARKTRACKS, an audio portal that lets visitors play a 12-minute-long track of sounds captured at national parks across the country. In honor of the National Parks Service's 102nd birthday, it's also hosting a pop-up listening event in Seattle on Friday and Saturday. But anyone can turn on, tune in, drop out — with nature — on the website. SEE ALSO: The best places to stargaze around the world ""We hope people will take a moment to pause, listen, and let their imaginations be captivated by the natural and cultural sounds of our national parks,"" Alanna Sobel, a National Park Foundation representative, told Mashable over email. There is actually a whole division of the National Parks Service that's devoted to capturing the more ephemeral features of nature: The Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division. That NPS department places microphones in national parks for a month at a time, capturing and analyzing audio from the likes of Yellowstone or the Hawaii Volcanoes. The Natural Sounds division has its own catalogue of sounds, organized by park and even animal, in a portal via Colorado State University. But the track released Friday is more like the radio-ready remix of park sounds. It's a combination of birds chirping and squawking, rivers rushing, thunder, lightning, rain, and even the occasional human chant, captured from multiple parks and edited together into one soothing soundscape. It shows that nature doesn't mean silence — it means life. ""Nature is alive with sound,"" Sobel said. ""People explore nature and parks for a variety of reasons, parks are very personal. Some go in seek of solitude, others go for recreation and movement. Some go to reconnect with our shared heritage, others go to experience a dark night sky. The National Park Foundation’s goal with PARKTRACKS is to bring parks to people through actual natural and cultural sounds."" A recent trip to the Pacific Northwest reminded me of how being in nature, surrounded by soft sound and dappled light, provides a warm feeling of calm, but also vigor, that I'd been missing from my urban life. Listening to the NPF's track doesn't quite replicate the feeling of tranquil awe that being among trees, rivers, and the open sky provides.

Devin Coldewey,"New studies from the National Institutes of Health — specifically the National Toxicology Program — find that cell phone radiation is potentially linked with certain forms of cancer, but they’re far from conclusive. The results are complex and the studies have yet to be peer reviewed, but some of the findings are clearly important enough to warrant public discussion. An early, partial version of this study teasing these effects appeared in 2016 (in fact, I wrote about it ), but these are the full (draft) reports complete with data. Both papers note that “studies published to date have not demonstrated consistently increased incidences of tumors at any site associate with exposure to cell phone RFR [radio frequency radiation] in rats or mice.” But the researchers felt that “based on the designs of the existing studies, it is difficult to definitively conclude that these negative results clearly indicate that cell phone RFR is not carcinogenic.” In other words, no one has taken it far enough, or simulated the radio-immersion environment in which we now live, enough to draw conclusions on the cancer front. So this study takes things up a notch, with longer and stronger exposures. The studies exposed mice and rats to both 900 MHz and 1900Mhz wavelength radio waves (each frequency being its own experiment) for about 9 hours per day, at various strengths ranging from 1 to 10 watts per kilogram. For comparison, the general limit the FCC imposes for exposure is 0.08 W/kg; the absolute maximum allowed, for the extremities of people with occupational exposures, is 20 W/kg for no longer than 6 minutes. So they were really blasting these mice. “The levels and duration of exposure to RFR were much greater than what people experience with even the highest level of cell phone use, and exposed the rodents’ whole bodies. So, these findings should not be directly extrapolated to human cell phone usage,” explained NTP senior scientist John Bucher in a news release accompanying the papers. “We note, however, that the tumors we saw in these studies are similar to tumors previously reported in some studies of frequent cell phone users.” The rodents were examined for various health effects after various durations, from 28 days to 2 years. Before I state the conclusions, a note on terminology. “Equivocal evidence” is just above “no evidence” on the official scale, meaning “showing a marginal increase of neoplasms that may be test agent related.” In other words, something statistically significant but ultimately still somewhat mysterious. “Some evidence” is above that, meaning a more measurable response, followed by the also self-explanatory “clear evidence.” Note that this At 900 MHz: Some evidence linking RFR with malignant schwannoma in the hearts of male rats, no evidence for same in female rats. Equivocal evidence linking exposure to malignant brain glioma in females. Other tumors of various types in both sexes “may have been related to cell phone RFR exposure,” meaning the link is unclear or numbers aren’t conclusive. Less serious “nonneoplastic lesions” were more frequent in exposed males and females. At 1900 MHz: Equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity in lung, liver, and other organ tissues in both male and female mice. Although I would hesitate to draw any major conclusions from these studies, it seems demonstrated that there is some link here, though the level of radiation was orders of magnitude beyond what a person would ever experience in day to day life. As the researchers point out, however, relatively short term studies like this one do little to illuminate the potential for harm in long-term exposure, such as babies who have never not been bathed in RF radiation. An interesting side note is that the radiation-exposed rodents of both types lived significantly longer than their control peers: 28 percent of the original control group survived the full 2 years, while about twice that amount (48-68 percent) survived in the exposed group. Two explanations are proffered for this strange results: either the radiation somehow suppressed the “chronic progressive nephropathy” that these mice tend to suffer from as they age, or possibly reduced feed intake related to the radiation might have done it. Either way, no one is suggesting that the radiation is somehow salutary to the rodents’ constitutions. The reports and data run to hundreds of pages, so this is only a quick look by a non-expert. You can look over the full reports and supplemental materials here, but as this is a major study you can also expect replication, analysis and criticism from all quarters soon, including a scheduled external expert review organized by the NTP in March.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Hi, National Geographic, it’s me, Ryan. I got your package today and I guess I’m wondering—why did you send me a pseudoscientific crystal healing water bottle with your name on it? National Geographic, usually known for photos of animals and the adventures of rich people visiting other countries, is premiering their Will Smith-narrated, Darren Aronofsky-produced series, One Strange Rock, on March 26. I had a chance to watch one of the episodes at a screener last week—it was fine and very wide-eyed. There were lots of shots of Earth from space. It was very pretty. But I guess I’ve been concerned about Nat Geo ever since Fox bought them back in 2015—and this bottle makes me question whether they’re turning into a high-budget Goop. The huge box Nat Geo sent me contained a book, some press material, and this glass water bottle with their name printed on the side. The bottle’s package advertises that it contains “carefully selected and ethically sourced gemstones representing the building blocks of earth,” including “wood,” “water,” “earth,” “metal” and “fire.” It came with an instruction and information manual. Why does my water bottle have an instruction manual? It reads: “For the most precious moments in life! Gems raise the energy level of water. That’s been known for hundreds of years and scientifically proven. VitaJuwel Gemwater Accessories are not only Jewelry for Water, they’re a great tool to prepare heavenly gemwater like fresh from the spring.” The instructions are: screw in the gemstone vial, fill with water, and then wait 7 minutes. Here’s the thing—this is a water bottle containing a sealed jar of gemstones. At no point will the water even come into contact with any of said gemstones. A warning tells you to discard the bottle if there is any way for water to seep into the vial of gems. All of the “science” cited in the brochure comes from widely debunked research from the likes of Japanese author Masaru Emoto—you know, the researcher who claimed humans could impact the chemical structure of water with their thoughts—or unnamed “German scientists.” Some of the claims are really wild. At one point, the pamphlet says: “Everything in nature vibrates. Gems naturally act like a source of subtle vibrations. These vibrations inspirit water, making it more lively and enjoyable.” This is nonsense, and any reference to electricity in crystals (like piezoelectricity, when charge accumulates on some structures in response to physical stress) is neither exclusive to crystals nor relevant to healing or enlivening drinking water. (“Ha! Yeah. Nah,” astrophysicist Katie Mack told me in a DM.) National Geographic, why did you send this ridiculous thing to me????? One press officer representing the new TV show (who I feel bad for) agreed that the bottle was definitely pseudoscientific, and suggested that maybe Nat Geo was “aiming to be symbolic.” Nat Geo has not yet responded to request for comment at the time of publishing, but I’ll update when I hear back. Gems are common in pseudoscience, you may be familiar with crystal healing from Gwyneth Paltrow’s trainwreck of a pseudoscience blog, Goop. Please don’t make me worry that people should align National Geographic with these folks. I already feel like the world has turned its back on science with the anti-vaxxer movement running unchecked, Goop selling “ bio-frequency-healing stickers,” the EPA seemingly doing whatever it can to ruin the environment, and pseudoscience-peddling websites like InfoWars garnering any readers at all. Hey, maybe this is a joke, meant to rile journalists up. Or maybe it really is symbolic, or an oversight. But what’s more worrying is that perhaps there’s someone or even several people working at National Geographic who believe that there are benefits to putting a sealed vial of gemstones into a water bottle.","Hi, National Geographic, it’s me, Ryan.

Sarah Perez,"Apple today announced a pair of initiatives that will allow its customers to support America’s National Parks. Starting tomorrow, August 24, and continuing through the 31st, Apple says it will donate $1 to the National Park Foundation for every purchase made using Apple Pay online at apple.com, or through the Apple Store app in the U.S. It’s also introducing a National Park-themed Apple Watch Activity Challenge to accompany the donation program. Starting on September 1, Apple Watch users worldwide who either walk, run, or do a wheelchair workout of 50 minutes or more will earn an Activity app award and stickers that are inspired by national parks. The 50 minutes is a tribute to Redwood National Park’s 50th anniversary, which is this year. Related to these efforts, the App Store will also feature a round-up of some of the best apps to use to explore the U.S. National Parks. Apple says the proceeds from the donation program will support the National Park Foundation’s mission to protect national parks. This includes projects focused on habitat restoration, historic preservation, and the Open OutDoors for Kids program. “America’s national parks are treasures everyone should experience, and we’re proud to support them again this month by donating a dollar for every purchase made with Apple Pay at one of our stores,” said Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, in a statement about the program. “These awe-inspiring places are our national inheritance, and Apple is doing our part to pass them on to future generations — just as extraordinary, beautiful and wild as we found them.” The company also took the time today to highlight the success of a related initiative, saying it has protected and created enough sustainably managed forests to cover its current and future paper use. In partnership with The Conversation Fund, Apple has protected 36,000 acres of U.S. forests that are sustainably managed, it noted. This is not the first time Apple has hosted such a challenge for the U.S. National Parks. Last year, it ran the same event, making mention of the fact that Apple Pay was accepted at some national parks, like Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon and Muir Woods National Monument, for example. The event itself now has political undertones, given the current administration’s rethinking of national parks, and its interest in deregulating the oil and gas extraction on public lands.","Apple today announced a pair of initiatives that will allow its customers to support America’s National Parks.

Mark Kaufman,"The new acting head of the National Park Service, Paul Daniel Smith, once let the billionaire owner of the Washington Redskins football team chop down 130 trees on protected park land. Redskins owner Dan Snyder, whose riverfront mansion abutted the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, desired a better view of the Potomac River. As a high ranking special assistant to the park director at the time, Smith helped deliver this vista for the wealthy businessman. SEE ALSO: National Park Service advisory board members resign in protest Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced Smith's appointment on Wednesday. “I can think of no one better equipped to help lead our efforts to ensure that the National Park Service is on firm footing to preserve and protect the most spectacular places in the United States for future generations,"" Zinke said. As acting director of the National Park Service, Smith will now oversee 417 national park sites, 20,000 employees, and a budget of nearly $3 billion. It's unknown if President Trump plans to nominate Smith as a full-time director of the agency, which requires Senate confirmation. In 2006, the Park Service Inspector General's Office investigated Smith's role in allowing the removal of 130 protected trees from public land. The Inspector General's report concluded that Smith ""... Inappropriately used his position to apply pressure and circumvent NPS procedures"" on behalf of Snyder, the wealthy Redskins owner. Hikers speaking to ranger on a trail in Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. Image: NPS Further, the government agents assigned to the investigation reported that Smith gave them two inconsistent, contrasting accounts about the decision and thus ""contradicted himself."" Smith escaped punishment, and was soon appointed to lead Colonial National Historic Park in Virginia. Now, Smith finds himself as head of the entire park system. The story, however, doesn't end there. The park ranger that notified Park Service officials about the improper tree-cutting said he faced years of ""reprisals,"" according to reporting by The Washington Post. The ranger, Robert M. Danno, said he was stripped of his gun, accused of theft and ""reassigned to issue picnic permits in a park in Northern Virginia with four picnic tables."" Tellingly, the Park Service confirmed with The Washington Post that the agency had ""settled"" with Danno over the matter and had given him a new job. The new acting director, Smith, will now oversee thousands of rangers like Danno, whose job it is to ensure protected resources are not chopped down by anyone — including billionaires.","The new acting head of the National Park Service, Paul Daniel Smith, once let the billionaire owner of the Washington Redskins football team chop down 130 trees on protected park land.

Dell Cameron,"An Air National Guard c-130 cargo plane on Wednesday crashed near Savannah, Georgia, killing at least five on board, authorities said. The plane was on a training mission when the accident occurred at roughly 11:30am local time. The Associated Press reported that between five and nine passengers were on board, reportedly National Guard members from Puerto Rico en route to the US mainland. A photograph tweeted by firefighters at the scene showed the tail end of the plane ablaze alongside Highway 21 near the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. Debris was shown scattered across the road, a pillar of black smoke rising from the flames. A spokesperson for the Savannah Professional Firefighters Association told Military.com that the tail section was the only part of the plane that remained intact. The names of the victims are behind withheld until family members can be notified, authorities said.

KEN BELSON and MARK LEIBOVICH,"Long said he did not wish to “lecture any team” on what quarterbacks to sign, but “we all agree in this room as players that he should be on a roster.” The owners’ responses were noncommittal. The Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said that fighting for social justice is not “about one person.” The New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft pointed to another “elephant in the room.” “This kneeling,” he said. “The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interests of America,” said Kraft, who is a longtime supporter of Mr. Trump’s. “It’s divisive and it’s horrible.” The owners were intent on finding a way to avoid Trump’s continued criticism. The president’s persistent jabs on Twitter had turned many fans against the league. Lurie, who called Trump’s presidency “disastrous,” cautioned against players getting drawn into the president’s tactics. “We’ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else,” Lurie said. “We have to find a way to not be divided and not get baited.” The Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula sounded anguished over the uncertainty of when Trump would take another shot at the league. “All Donald needs to do is to start to do this again,” Pegula said. “We need some kind of immediate plan because of what’s going on in society. All of us now, we need to put a Band-Aid on what’s going on in the country.” The Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan countered that the worst was behind them. “All the damage Trump’s going to do is done,” he said. The owners kept returning to one bottom-line issue: Large numbers of fans and sponsors had become angry about the protests. Boycotts had been threatened and jerseys burned and — most worrisome — TV ratings were declining. Pegula complained that the league was “under assault.” He unloaded a dizzying flurry of nautical metaphors to describe their predicament. “To me, this is like a glacier moving into the ocean,” he said. “We’re getting hit with a tsunami.” He expressed his wish that the league never be “a glacier crawling into the ocean.” The Houston Texans owner Bob McNair was more direct. He urged the players to tell their colleagues to, essentially, knock off the kneeling. “You fellas need to ask your compadres, fellas, stop that other business, let’s go out and do something that really produces positive results, and we’ll help you.” After the Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross raised the idea of a “march on Washington” by N.F.L. players and owners, Eric Reid, Kaepernick’s former teammate and the first player to kneel alongside him, brought the discussion back to Kaepernick. Reid, who attended the meeting wearing a Kaepernick T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said that his former teammate was being blackballed. Photo Colin Kaepernick in 2016. Credit Ted S. Warren/Associated Press “I feel like he was hung out to dry,” Reid said of Kaepernick. “Everyone in here is talking about how much they support us.” The room fell quiet. “Nobody stepped up and said we support Colin’s right to do this. We all let him become Public Enemy No. 1 in this country, and he still doesn’t have a job.” Pegula offered that he thought the league was battling a perception and “media problem.” He said it would be great for the league to find a compelling spokesman — preferably a player — to promote all of the good things they were doing together. He suggested that the league could learn from the gun lobby in this regard. “For years we’ve watched the National Rifle Association use Charlton Heston as a figurehead,” Pegula said. “We need a spokesman.” Anquan Boldin, a former N.F.L. wide receiver who was at the meeting, said that owners needed to be spokesmen, too. “Letting people know it’s not just the players that care about these issues, but the owners, too,” Boldin said. Pegula didn’t address Boldin’s point except to add that it would be important for the spokesman to be black. (None of the N.F.L.’s 32 owners are black.) “For us to have a face, as an African-American, at least a face that could be in the media,” Pegula continued, “we could fall in behind that.” Kaepernick’s name was not mentioned again. He continues to pursue a labor grievance accusing the owners of colluding to keep him out of the league. He remains unsigned. Before the meeting ended, owners had quoted Thomas Paine (the Falcons owner Arthur Blank), invoked Martin Luther King Jr.’s Selma march (Ross of the Dolphins) and expressed great hope for what they all could accomplish together (“We have a chance to do something monumental,” declared the Giants owner John Mara). The meeting concluded with some participants saying how positive the session had been, and how they would all keep talking. Goodell told the group that another meeting was being scheduled. They planned to issue a “joint statement” to underscore their shared commitment. Kraft said the statement should reflect how everyone had come together for a good cause. “It would be good if you could work in the word ‘unified’ or ‘unity’ in some fashion,” he said, referring to the joint statement. “We could say simply, today we had a reset, and the players’ issues are our issues, and we recognize them and will work together,” Ross said. “I like the language of ‘our issues,’ ” said DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the players’ union. About an hour later, the league released its joint statement: “Today owners and players had a productive meeting focused on how we can work together to promote positive social change and address inequality in our communities. NFL executives and owners joined NFLPA executives and player leaders to review and discuss plans to utilize our platform to promote equality and effectuate positive change. We agreed that these are common issues and pledged to meet again to continue this work together.” Continue reading the main story","“Let’s make sure that we keep this confidential,” Roger Goodell said to begin the session.

ADAM NAGOURNEY,"Californians scoff at the attacks as reflecting jealousy of their states soaring coastlines and bright-blue skies, where Americans have been streaming for almost 200 years. This is another sorry example of the current state of Republican solipsism, said Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor. The irony is that when they attack California, they attack the very engine of Americas prosperity and leadership. Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist from San Francisco, whose organization has financed campaigns against Republicans in 11 states, including Florida and Nevada, said the attacks were a cynical political tactic aimed at diverting voters attention from issues Republicans do not want to talk about, like health care. Do I think California is perfect? Mr. Steyer said. Hell, no. But do I think we have a functioning democracy that is trying to deal with these issues? I think we do. In some ways, California makes itself an easy target, with laws regulating plastic bags and, this year, plastic straws the kind of restrictions that would seem particular anathema to voters in states like Nevada, Colorado and Texas with deep Western skepticism about big government. But its not only the smaller issues: California has come to represent a vision of government expansive and expensive than is not nearly as welcome in swing states like Nevada. The Californians come here, and they want to change things around, said Patrick Casale, 57, a health insurance broker and Republican who lives in Las Vegas. They want us to pay more taxes.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) appears to be on its way to being Trumpified. No, it’s not getting encased in gold. Instead, climate and conservation are out, the economy and national security are in. The Commerce Department recently held a “Vision Setting Summit” where Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, NOAA’s acting administrator talked about his, well, vision for the agency. The talk was accompanied by a slide presentation, which was first reported by the Union of Concerned Scientists on Sunday. Earther has reviewed the slides, which lay out NOAA’s mission and vision statements of yore and what it is today. They also suggest that the agency could take 50 deregulatory actions in the next 30 days to “enhance job creation” and take further actions to reduce the seafood trade deficit. Here’s the past mission (which is still up on the agency’s website): To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans and coasts To share that knowledge and information with others; and To conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources And the updated one: To observe, understand and predict atmospheric and ocean conditions; To share that knowledge and information with others; and To protect lives and property, empower the economy, and support homeland and national security The slide showing NOAA’s vision also showed a shift away from language about resiliency for communities and ecosystems toward one focused on national security and the economy. While the presentation clearly juxtaposes the mission and vision statements as “past” and “present,” NOAA has pushed back on the classification as a wholesale change. “It was not intended to exclude NOAA’s important climate and conservation efforts, which are essential for protecting lives and the environment,” Gallaudet said in a statement to Earther. “Nor should this presentation be considered a final, vetted proposal.” But these shifts are in line with what Gallaudet laid out in a talk at the American Geophysical Union’s annual conference last year for the agency, which oversees fisheries, provides weather forecast, and conducts climate and ocean research. And they’re certainly in line with the Trump administration’s goals at-large. Nearly every agency—but especially environmentally-focused ones—have seen their vision and actions shift dramatically away from enforcing protections and regulations and toward overturning them. Science has also often been put by the wayside, particularly climate science. NOAA has largely avoided this to-date, in part because the agency is without its permanent head. Barry Meyers—Trump’s pick to run NOAA—has seen his confirmation drag out as he attempts to divest from Accuweather, the private weather company he owns that relies on freely available NOAA data. But now changes may be coming to the agency. At the very least, the development dovetails well with Trump’s other recent ocean policy change. “It’s concerning in the sense that NOAA, at least at the politically-appointed levels, is falling into alignment with the rest of the Trump administration where they are looking for short-term gains and reducing emphasis on—or ignoring—longer term challenges,” David Titley, who was NOAA’s chief operating officer under Obama and now runs Penn State’s Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk, told Earther. Those long-term challenges are many for coastal communities. Climate change is causing oceans to rise and seas to acidify. The former means more flooding while the latter can be a huge drag on shellfisheries. Rising ocean temperatures are also boiling coral reefs and could affect the fisheries that are tied to them. “If you undermine NOAA ability do science or redirect work the agency is doing around climate change, that really hampers the ability of state and local government and coastal communities to respond to ongoing changes,” Andrew Rosenberg, the head of Union of Concerned Scientists’ Center for Democracy who also previously worked for NOAA as a scientist, told Earther. Beyond climate research, Rosenberg said much of NOAA’s fisheries research has focused on ensuring catch limits are sustainable. The prospect of 50 deregulatory actions would likely mean ignoring some of that science since fisheries are the the main area under NOAA’s regulatory purview. “I’m not exactly sure what’s on their list, but 50 actions is a lot,” Rosenberg said. “I don’t see how they could justify it scientifically with the language in the law.” The U.S. does have a huge seafood trade deficit with imports topping out at $21.5 billion vs. just $5.4 billion in exports in 2017. Trump himself has specifically called it out as something the U.S. could close, though he hasn’t presented any specific plan for how to do so. Of course, part of what created the deficit is that U.S. fishermen nearly ran certain fisheries like Atlantic cod into the ground from overfishing, which is precisely why there are now fishery regulations in place. Perhaps that’s why the slide deck mentions focusing on farm-raised fish production, putting forward a goal of tripling it over the next 10 years. Any shift in priorities ultimately hinges on Congress. NOAA can request funding that emphasizes certain areas while deemphasizing others, but Congress has the last say on how much money gets spent where. Last funding year is a case in point. The Trump administration asked for Congress to cut NOAA’s climate budget. Instead, Congress kept it flat and increased the agency’s overall budget increase by $234 million. This post has been updated with a statement from NOAA.","The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) appears to be on its way to being Trumpified. No, it’s not getting encased in gold.

Sarah Scoles,"The Moon is a pretty barren place. Sure, there are a few buggies, some golf balls, a flag, urine bags, a family photo. But its mostly empty. If a company called ispace has its way, though, Earths closest space neighbor will soon(ish) be the site of a bustling, industrial city full of workers and tourists. Moon Valley, the dreamers call it. Yesterday, those dreamers announced the first small step in that journey, declaring that SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets will take an ispace orbiter-lander and its rovers to the Moon in 2020 and 2021. After that, the plan goes, frequent missions will start scaffolding the infrastructure to comehunting down, for instance, water that could be used as fuel. And then the industrialization will begin, building up a platform for steady lunar development, according to the companys website. Ispace has 66 employees and headquarters in three countries, and it netted around $95 million in its first funding roundmore than almost any space company, ever. One of its money-making ideas is to attach customers' payloads to its future rovers and landers. Ispace's lunar ambitions are not unique. The Moon is maybe spaces hottest cold place right now: Jeff Bezoss Blue Origin has a lunar settlement on the brain. Smaller organizations like SpaceIL and Moon Express, once contenders for the Google Lunar X Prize, are going forward alone. Then there's the Indian government's Chandrayaan-2 mission, with its lunar orbiter, lander, and rover. Chinas Change 4 is similar. Trump is urging NASA to visit that gray lady first, then jet on to red Mars. The list of lunar ambitions is long. But the reasons to make the Moon into a destination stem equally from its proximity, its personality, and political and financial whimsa fixture of space policy. People love to quote the John F. Kennedy speech that set off the Apollo era. We choose to go to the Moon, they say, feeling important. If they are also feeling verbose, they quote more of Kennedy's words: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Sometimes they simply say, ""Space is hard, usually as an excuse for delays and accidents. Space types allude to this speech more than maybe anything else, except Buzz Aldrin's small steps and giant leaps. This linguistic fondness reveals how much today's explorers long for those good old days, or at least how much they love their own origin story. A few weeks ago, when SpaceX announced it would launch a billionaire and seven creatives to lunar orbit, billionaire Yusaku Maezawa said, I choose to go to the Moon with artists. His use of the first-person shows how spaceflight has changed in the past 50 years. Nevertheless, Maezawa could reuse Kennedys phrasing because SpaceX is doing essentially the same thing NASA did a half-century ago. Been there, done that, if differently. And so we might be better served by quoting a different part of Kennedys speech: But why, some say, the Moon? he asked. Why choose this as our goal? Kennedys queries were rhetorical, their answers provided in other paragraphs: being first, establishing peaceful purpose, doing it because its hard, going because its there. But today, its a more complicated question with complicated answers. Ispace, and other organizations with their eyes on lunar resources, are looking to develop both the Moon and an economy around it. That changed Moon could be a launchpad and refueling station for trips venturing farther afield. It could be a scientific research hub. A place to learn how to live and work long-term in an isolated place without an atmosphere. A national security outpost. An Apollo-esque beat ya. The Moon, in other words, is many things to many people. But to some, its a hurdle. The debate about whether humans choose to go to the Moon or to Mars (or to the Moon and then to Mars) has raged for a long time. Moon-firsters are sometimes called lunatics, Mars-firsters martians. Mars is more geologically interesting, more chemically interesting, could have once been habitable, and could tell us more about how planets go from being kind of nice to being kind of hellscapes. Also, its harder, and we havent done it yet. On the other hand, its harder, and we havent done it yet. And the Moon is likely more lucrative: With Mars as far out of reach as it is, a lunar economy is likely to bustle much sooner than a martian one. If youre a company interested in going to space and making money, the Moon is a much better investment for you, says Lucianne Walkowicz, the chair of astrobiology at the Library of Congress and an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium, in Chicago. Walkowicz is hosting a conference later this week called Becoming Interplanetary and previously hosted one called Decolonizing Mars. As a scientist, shes more interested in using exploration to collect and interpret information that puts our own planet in proper cosmic context. Other planets and moons show us how planets work. But even among scientists, the destination debate isnt really about whether the Moon or Mars is worthy of our bootprints: Its about scarcity. I think that people would like to do all of those things, says Walkowiczgo to the Moon, go to Mars, send more ships to other places in the solar system. A lot of debate comes from the fact that its resource-intensive and there are limited resources. That means limited financial support (especially since even the private exploration companies often depend on government contracts), and limited time: If explorers focus on the Moon, even as a prelude, that likely delays the journey to Mars. Chris Carberry, CEO of Explore Mars, Inc., is working to figure out how lunatics and martians can work together, because neither faction is going anywhere. Maybe we can successfully choose to go the Moonand to Mars. ""Were finding ways to achieve that goal that will also not delay Mars by decades,"" he says. In addition to R&amp;D alignment, perhaps the commercial players could do their lunar thing, and governments could focus Mars-ward. Governments, though, are fickle. In the US, every new president has the opportunity to change space-exploration priorities. And even though private companies can technically do their own thing, savvy business people sometimes shift to where support is. George W. Bush was more of a Moon-first guy. Obama looked more Marsward (with a side trip to an asteroid). Under Trump, the Moon is once again in favor. In an effort to define a space program that in some sense belongs to them and bears their mark, says Walkowicz, theres a tendency to pivot to what the last guy didnt say. Destination can come to seem partisan. That vacillation, says analyst Carlos Manuel Entrena Utrilla, is why private-sector exploration is important. If we ever see sustained human presence anywhere beyond low-Earth orbit, and especially on the Moon or Mars, it will be through commercially viable development, says Ultrilla, who works at consulting company McKinsey. Any other approach that is based on public funding will eventually collapse when national priorities change, as it happened with Apollo. The trick, though, will be that many different companies will have to be ready at just the right moment, so they all have things to buy and sell. That means that the miners need to come online at roughly the same time as the material processors, says Utrilla, and the manufacturers need to start producing once their customers are operating. In life as in love as in lunar exploration, timing is everything. Theoretically, now(ish) is a good time for ispace to be proving out the technology that could make Moon Valley real. Its lunar spacecraft designs recently passed preliminary design review, under scrutiny from a panel of 26 experts, and it plans to begin assembling hardware next summer. The rover design, while upgraded and updated, is based on the setup ispace already developed and built for the X Prize. But what, and who, comes next remains to be seen. For ispace, success in the short term means orbiting the Moon in round one, and landing and deploying data-collecting rovers in round two. If that goes well, the company will go on to round three (through n ), turning the Moonwith help from the other companies and governments that have designs on our planets satelliteinto a useful place. An industrial pit, a pit stop, a playground. And this time, the goal is different: Its not we choose to go to the Moon. Its we choose to change the Moon.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Photo Qualcomm’s chips are used in most mobile phones, and its semiconductors will be used in the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks known as 5G. Credit Graham Walzer for The New York Times The United States government said that Broadcom’s proposed deal to acquire rival chipmaker Qualcomm could pose a national security risk and called for a full investigation into the hostile bid. The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such an investigation is often a death knell for a corporate deal. A government panel, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, said, in part, that the potential risk was related to Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities, according to a letter from a United States Treasury official.

The Revillagigedo Archipelago is a group of volcanic islands off the country's south-east coast. With a protection zone of 57,000 square miles (150,000km), it has become the largest ocean reserve in North America. The move will mean all fishing activity will be banned, and the area will be patrolled by the navy. It is hoped the move will help populations hit by commercial fishing operations in the area recover. The park was designated by a decree signed by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. It will also forbid natural resources being extracted from the land or the building of new hotel infrastructure. The area, which is about 250 miles (400km) south-east of the country's Baja California peninsula has been described as the Galapagos of North America, because of its volcanic nature and unique ecology.

Klint Finley,"President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's proposed $105 billion acquisition of fellow wireless chip giant Qualcomm on Monday amidst mounting fears that US could fall behind China on technology innovation. That’s a little odd, because on its face, the deal itself has nothing to do with China. Broadcom's key units are US-based; the company is headquartered in Singapore, which is generally considered friendly to the US. And in November, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan announced that the company would move its main office back to the US—while standing next to Donald Trump during a press conference at the White House no less. Yet the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, tasked with evaluating foreign investments in the US, advised Trump to block the acquisition. In a letter to Broadcom last week, the agency cited concerns that if the deal went through, Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies could displace Qualcomm as leaders in developing the forthcoming 5G standard for faster, higher-capacity wireless networks. The government’s real concern was probably less that Qualcomm would be controlled by a foreign power, but that Qualcomm would be less innovative under Broadcom's control. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, says Qualcomm is one of the few wireless chip companies that invests for the long term. One of the others, he says, is Huawei. If the Trump administration is worried that the US wireless and semiconductor industries could fall behind China's, then it hardly matters whether Broadcom is a US company or not. Broadcom is known for buying up companies and holding onto their most profitable units and then selling off the riskier parts. Analyst Ben Thompson points out in a blog post that Qualcomm's most profitable assets are its patents, which it licenses out to other companies, not its more expensive business of designing and selling chips. Slashing Qualcomm's research budget in favor and focusing on its patent business would fit Broadcom's modus operandi. ""Since Hock Tan took over Broadcom, they've invested less in R&amp;D overall,"" says semiconductor industry analyst Linley Gwennap. ""It's a great strategy for keeping investors happy, but it leaves the cupboard bare if you want technology innovation overtime."" The numbers bear him out. Broadcom’s spending on R&amp;D amounted to about 19 percent of its revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Qualcomm, by contrast, spent about 25 percent of its revenue on R&amp;D. That could leave the US at a disadvantage in the long term. China imports about half of its semiconductors from US companies, according to a report from the US Department of Commerce. But China is investing $20 billion in the semiconductor industry through its government-controlled Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund in hopes of becoming a real player in the global market for computer chips. Broadcom tried to address some of these concerns in statement last week pledging to keep investing in 5G wireless technology. But the promise evidently wasn't enough for CFIUS, or Trump. In a statement, Broadcom says the company “is reviewing the order. Broadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns.” Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CFIUS also recently blocked the sale of semiconductor company Lattice Semiconductor to an investment firm with reported ties to the Chinese government, and the sale of money transfer service MoneyGram to an affiliate of China’s Alibaba. Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm was always a longshot. Broadcom's wireless chips can be found in every current iPhone model and most Android phones, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon platform powers most Android phones while its cellular modems are found in roughly half of all iPhones. Merging the two would have created significant antitrust concerns for regulators in the US and elsewhere. But despite the long odds, few expected the proposed merger to end this way.

A park spokesman said the bodies of a man and woman were spotted by a tourist beneath Taft Point, which rises about 3,000 ft (900m) above the valley floor. At least 10 people have died in the park this year, the spokesman added. Last month, an Israeli teenager fell to his death from another popular lookout in the world-renowned US national park. Park rangers have not yet identified the pair and are attempting to recover their bodies, officials said on Thursday. ""This incident is under investigation and no further details are available,"" spokesman Scott Gediman said in a statement. The latest deaths come just one week after a photo of the Taft Point lookout went viral, when a photographer captured a wedding proposal amidst the backdrop of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Taft Point, a promontory at elevation 7,500 ft (2.3km), features breathtaking views of Yosemite Falls and El Capitan - the famous granite rock that is popular amongst rock climbers. ""It's a super-popular place in Yosemite. Really popular for engagements, proposals, weddings,"" photographer Matt Dippel said after the snap went viral online. ""There were at least three or four different brides and grooms up there doing their post-wedding photos, so it's definitely not an uncommon thing to see up there,"" he told CNN, after asking the internet to help him locate the couple that he photographed on 6 October. In 2015, famed rock climber Dean Potter died during a stunt that began at Taft Point. Potter, and fellow extreme athlete Graham Hunt, were wearing wingsuits - skin tight suits with batwing sleeves and a flap between their legs to help them glide - when they jumped from the point. The pair crashed after attempting to clear a V-shaped notch in a ridgeline, park officials said.","Officials say a man and woman were killed after they fell from Taft Point, a popular tourist lookout.",2018-10-26T13:49:05Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Two tourists fall to death from Yosemite National Park cliff,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45994506,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6D32/production/_104045972_gettyimages-473972760.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
Jack Morse,"It turns out that hackers are an equal opportunity bunch. During the lead up to the 2016 U.S. election, much ado was made of the hack of the Democratic National Committee and subsequent publishing of stolen emails. Now, thanks to a report by Politico, we know that in 2018 the National Republican Congressional Committee suffered a security breach of its own. Specifically, email accounts belonging to four senior aides working for the House Republican campaign organization were said to have been ""surveilled"" for months. Yup, you read that right: The Republicans' emails were hacked, too. SEE ALSO: The hackers getting paid to keep the internet safe It's unclear at this time who or what organization directed the latest digital excursion. The 2016 hack of the DNC has since been blamed on the Russian intelligence agency known as the GRU. No such accusation has been made in the latest hack, at least publicly. We also don't know what information, exactly, was accessed. ""We don't want to get into details about what was taken because it's an ongoing investigation,"" a senior party official told Politico. ""Let's say they had access to four active accounts. I think you can draw from that."" Notably, many senior Republican officials were reportedly not made aware of the hack at the time of its discovery. According to the Washington Post, the breach was discovered in April of this year. The cybersecurity of the committees data is paramount, and upon learning of the intrusion, the NRCC immediately launched an internal investigation and notified the FBI, which is now investigating the matter,"" NRCC spokesperson Ian Prior told the Post. ""To protect the integrity of that investigation, the NRCC will offer no further comment on the incident."" Interestingly, the media recently asked Donald Trump about the 2016 DNC hack. His response, essentially, was that it was the DNC's fault. TRUMP blames DNC for getting hacked: ""They were doing whatever it was during the Obama admin, &amp; I heard people were trying to hack into RNC too, but we had much better defenses so they couldn't.""

Zack Whittaker,"Today’s bombshell Bloomberg story has the internet split: either the story is right, and reporters have uncovered one of the largest and jarring breaches of the U.S. tech industry by a foreign adversary… or it’s not, and a lot of people screwed up. To recap, Chinese spies reportedly infiltrated the supply chain and installed tiny chips the size of a pencil tip on the motherboards built by Supermicro, which are used in data center servers across the U.S. tech industry from Apple to Amazon. That chip can compromise data on the server, allowing China to spy on some of the world’s most wealthy and powerful countries. Apple, Amazon and Supermicro and the Chinese government strenuously denied the allegations. Apple also released its own standalone statement later in the day, as did Supermicro. You don’t see that very often unless they think they have nothing to hide. You can and should read the statements for yourself. Welcome to the murky world of national security reporting. I’ve covered cybersecurity and national security for about five years, most recently at CBS, where I reported exclusively on several stories including the U.S. government’s covert efforts to force tech companies to hand over their source code in an effort to find vulnerabilities and conduct surveillance. And last year I revealed that the National Security Agency had its fifth data breach in as many years, and classified documents showed that a government data collection program was far wider than first thought and was collecting data on U.S. citizens. Even with this story, my gut is mixed. Where reporters across any topic and beat try to seek the truth, tapping information from the intelligence community is near impossible. For spies and diplomats, it’s illegal to share classified information with anyone and can be and is punishable by time in prison. As a security reporter, you’re either incredibly well sourced or downright lucky. More often than not it’s the latter. Naturally, people are skeptical of this “spy chip” story. On one side you have Bloomberg’s decades-long stellar reputation and reporting acumen, a thoroughly researched story citing more than a dozen sources some inside the government and out and presenting enough evidence to present a convincing case. On the other, the sources are anonymous likely because the information they shared wasn’t theirs to share or it was classified, putting sources in risk of legal jeopardy. But that makes accountability difficult. No reporter wants to say “a source familiar with the matter” because it weakens the story. It’s the reason reporters will tag names to spokespeople or officials so that it holds the powers accountable for their words. And, the denials from the companies themselves though transparently published in full by Bloomberg are not bulletproof in outright rejection of the story’s claims. These statements go through legal counsel and are subject to government regulation. These statements become a counterbalance turning the story from an evidence-based report into a “he said, she said” situation. That puts the onus on the reader to judge Bloomberg’s reporting. Reporters can publish the truth all they want, but ultimately it’s down to the reader to believe it or not. In fairness to Bloomberg, chief among Apple’s complaints is a claim that Bloomberg’s reporters were vague in their questioning. Given the magnitude of the story, you don’t want to reveal all of your cards but still want to seek answers and clarifications without having the subject tip off another news agency a trick sometimes employed by the government in the hope of lighter coverage. Yet, to Apple and Amazon and other companies implicated by the report they too might also be in the dark. Assuming there was an active espionage investigation into the alleged actions of a foreign government, you can bet that only a handful of people at these companies will be even cursorily aware of the situation. U.S. surveillance and counter-espionage laws restrict who can be told about classified information or investigations. Only those who need to be in the know are kept in a very tight loop typically a company’s chief counsel. Often their bosses, the chief executive or president, are not told to avoid making false or misleading statements to shareholders. It’s worth casting your mind back to 2013, days after the first Edward Snowden documents were published. In the aftermath of the disclosure of PRISM, the NSA’s data pulling program that implicated several tech companies including Apple, but not Amazon the companies came out fighting, vehemently denying any involvement or connection. Was it a failure of reporting? Partially, yes. But the companies also had plausible deniability by cherry picking what they rebuffed. Despite a claim by the government that PRISM had “direct access” to tech companies’ servers, the companies responded that this wasn’t true. They didn’t, however, refute indirect access which the companies wouldn’t be allowed to say in any case. Critics of Bloomberg’s story have rightfully argued for more information such as more technical data on the chip, its design and its functionality. Rightfully so it’s entirely reasonable to want to know more. Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker turned founder of Rendition Infosec, told me that the story is “credible,” but “even if it turns out to be untrue, the capability exists and you need to architect your networks to detect this.” I was hesitant to cover this at first given the complexity of the allegations and how explosive the claims are without also seeking confirmation. That’s not easy to do in an hour when Bloomberg’s reporters have been working for the best part of a year. Assuming Bloomberg did everything right a cover story on its magazine, no less, which would have gone through endless editing and fact-checking before going to print the reporters likely hit a wall and had nothing more to report, and went to print. But Bloomberg’s delivery could have been better. Just as The New York Times does even as recently as its coverage of President Trump’s tax affairs, Bloomberg missed an opportunity to be more open and transparent in how it came to the conclusions that it did. Journalism isn’t proprietary. It should be open to as many people as possible. If you’re not transparent in how you report things, you lose readers’ trust. That’s where the story rests on shaky ground. Admittedly, as detailed and as well-sourced as the story is, you and I have to put a lot of trust and faith in Bloomberg and its reporters. And in this day and age where “fake news” is splashed around wrongly and unfairly, for the sake of journalism, my only hope is they’re not wrong.","Today’s bombshell Bloomberg story has the internet split: either the story is right, and reporters have uncovered one of the largest and jarring breaches of the U.S. tech industry by a foreign adversary… or it’s not, and a lot of people screwed up.

ALAN BLINDER,"Even with that discretion, the administrations strategy has alarmed former officials like Ms. Jewell, who argued that open but largely unmanned parks posed risks to visitors and properties alike.
Weve got the worst of all worlds right now, she said. Youve got a dangerous situation, and a situation where our nations treasures are put at risk. There is now a very small number of law enforcement who can patrol and stop poaching, looting and vandalism, as well as people not realizing the risk and potentially hurting themselves.
But with no solution in sight, some states regard their stopgap agreements with Washington as the only feasible solution.
Symbolically, while were watching government at its worst in Washington, the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America at her best, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said in a radio interview with 1010 WINS. So, keeping the torch lit I think is a perfect metaphor while this situation is devolving in Washington.
Mr. Cuomos government has underwritten Statue of Liberty operations in the past, and he and other governors have been settling into something of a routine for shutdowns. In February, after the second of what would become three government shutdowns in 2018, Arizonas governor signed an executive order that demanded a state-level plan to keep the Grand Canyon open during future shutdowns.
Whereas, the order noted acidly, this isnt the first time this has happened and unfortunately, it likely wont be the last.
But officials across the country said Monday that they did not expect their states to prop up the parks indefinitely, or even with regularity. For now, though, they said the emergency payouts technically classified as donations to the Park Service are warranted.","Zion National Park in Utah, which is among the states that have tapped their own treasuries to keep a patchwork of federal properties, including national parks, open and maintained during the government shutdown.",2018-12-24T21:11:48Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Frustrated by Shutdown, States Spend to Keep National Parks Open",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/shutdown-states-national-parks.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/25/us/25states-01/25states-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1

Nick Statt,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has published an astonishing personal blog post on the platform Medium detailing what he claims is extortion and blackmail on behalf of the tabloid National Enquirer. 
In the post, Bezos says he was allegedly threatened with the publication of nude photos of him and suggestive photos of Lauren Sanchez, the news anchor and reporter with whom Bezos was having an affair, unless he publicly made a statement downplaying the motivations behind National Enquirer parent company AMIs investigation into his personal life, by saying the company was never politically motivated or influenced by political forces. National Enquirerfirst detailed Bezos affair, which led to the dissolution of his marriage to MacKenzie Bezos, last month.
Bezos is standing up to extortion at the risk of his nudes leaking
AMI is at the center of an ongoing legal controversy involving President Donald Trump over the practice of catch and kill, or seeking out incriminating information about someone and purposefully shutting the story down to avoid it ever getting out. AMI allegedly approached Bezos after learning he had been conducting a private investigation into how it obtained his text messages, and tried to persuade him into shutting the investigation down because of the likelihood it may lead to more damning revelations about AMIs catch and kill tactics and its political ties to Trump and other world leaders, Bezos claims in the Medium post.
The photos in question include a full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, and a naked selfie in a bathroom, among others, according to a threatening email sent to the attorney of Gavin de Becker, the well-known security consultant Bezos hired to run the private investigation, penned by none other than the Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of AMI. 
Well, that [the email] got my attention. But not in the way they likely hoped. Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because theres a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I cant stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?, Bezos writes. In the AMI letters Im making public, you will see the precise details of their extortionate proposal: they will publish the personal photos unless Gavin de Becker and I make the specific false public statement to the press that we have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMIs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.

Mark Kaufman,"The burning forest just outside of Yosemite National Park in California has choked the air inside the park's iconic valley marked by imposing granite walls that stretch hundreds of feet into the polluted sky. The West's fire season is now well underway, and it has been further stoked by heat waves and especially parched land. As a result of the now over 36,000-acre Ferguson fire, Yosemite — one of the most heavily-visited national parks in the country — has been inundated with tiny bits of particulate pollution, covering the park in a thick haze. SEE ALSO: California hit with two heat waves in less than a month. Here's why it matters. As of Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Forest Service assigned the Yosemite valley an ""Unhealthy"" air quality rating, meaning that everyone should reduce time outside, and people who are especially sensitive to this kind of pollution should avoid prolonged exposure. Yosemite's Half Dome peak can be seen at the top left, but the valley beyond is thick with wildfire haze.

Breathing this particle-laden air over time has been repeatedly tied to heart and lung diseases, particularly the accelerated hardening of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels. Although the park's visitor center remains open, Yosemite's site says that ""smoke may be heavy at times,"" and to ""expect poor air quality &amp; visibility."" The smoky Yosemite Valley Tuesday morning, as picked up by park webcams. Image: Webcam by Yosemite Conservancy A webcam maintained by the Yosemite Conservancy shows live views of the smoke-choked valley as the fires continue to rage. California has already experienced a busy fire season, as large fires returned to California's wine country in early July. This follows on the heels of 2017's terrible season — the state's worst fire year on record — which burned 1.2 million acres of land, an area the size of Delaware. This included December's destructive Thomas Fire, which burned less than 70 miles from Los Angeles. It proved to be the largest fire in California's history, burning an area nearly the size of sprawling Los Angeles itself. Since the early 1980s — when more reliable, modern record keeping began — the Forest Service notes that the amount of land that burns each year has generally doubled. Mismanaged forests and irresponsible behavior in fire country are both to blame, but every fire today is further enhanced by climate change-boosted temperatures, which parch Western land, turning it to tinder.","The burning forest just outside of Yosemite National Park in California has choked the air inside the park's iconic valley marked by imposing granite walls that stretch hundreds of feet into the polluted sky.

PETER BAKER and MAGGIE HABERMAN,"WASHINGTON For months, Republican officials have complained privately that President Trump lacks the ability to confront moments of crisis with moral clarity, choosing to inflame the divisions that have torn the country apart rather than try to bring it together. It took the importuning of his Jewish daughter and son-in-law to craft a powerful statement of outrage at anti-Semitism after Saturdays slaughter at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Then Mr. Trump went back into partisan mode, assailing his enemies. By the evenings end he was tweeting about baseball, and on Sunday he went after another foe. Mr. Trumps mixed messages after the synagogue killings and the wave of bombs sent by one of his supporters to leading Democrats have thrust his leadership into the center of the national debate with about a week until fiercely contested congressional elections. Even some supporters call him tone-deaf, and critics say his fire-and-fury style has fueled a toxic moment in American history, while defenders bristle at what they consider opportunistic attacks by opponents interested only in tearing him down. The deaths of 11 worshipers in Pittsburgh revived questions about what signals Mr. Trump has sent, intentionally or not, to the most radical fringe elements of society. As the president notes, members of his family are Jewish and he has been perhaps the staunchest supporter of Israel to sit in the Oval Office. Yet his castigation of globalists, seen by some as code for Jews, and his attacks on George Soros, the billionaire financier of liberal causes, have unsettled Jewish leaders.",President Trump’s discordant approach to national crises has thrust his leadership into the center of the national debate with about a week until the midterm elections.,2018-10-29T00:38:46Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","News Analysis: For Trump, Dutiful Words of Grief, Then Off to the Next Fight",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/politics/trump-pittsburgh-synagogue.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/us/29dc-trump1/29dc-trump1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1
MARK LANDLER and HELENE COOPER,"After General McMaster left the room, Mr. Mattis and Mr. Tillerson continued to speak, not realizing that other participants were still on the line. The officials familiar with the matter overheard them complaining about a series of meetings that the National Security Council had set up to consider options for North Korea — signs, Mr. Tillerson said, that it was becoming overly aggressive. For now, the frustration at the White House appears to be limited to senior officials rather than Mr. Trump himself. But the president has shown impatience with his military leaders on other issues, notably the debate over whether to deploy additional American troops to Afghanistan. As they examine the most effective way of giving credibility to Mr. Trump’s threat of “fire and fury,” officials are considering the feasibility of a preventive strike that could include disabling a missile on the launchpad or destroying North Korea’s entire nuclear infrastructure. American officials are also said to be considering covert means of disabling the nuclear and missile programs. While General McMaster also favors a diplomatic solution to the impasse, officials said, he emphasizes to colleagues that past efforts to negotiate with North Korea have forced the United States to make unacceptable concessions. The Pentagon has a different view. Mr. Mattis and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., argue forcefully for using diplomacy. They have repeatedly warned, in meetings and on video conference calls, that there are few, if any, military options that would not provoke retaliation from North Korea, according to officials at the Defense Department. Representatives of Mr. Mattis and General Dunford denied that they have slow-walked options to the White House. The Pentagon press secretary, Dana W. White, said that Mr. Mattis “regularly provides the president with a deep arsenal of military options” and that reports of a delay were “false.” General Dunford’s press secretary, Col. Patrick S. Ryer, said: “General Dunford regularly provides the best military advice in a timely and responsive manner. Suggestions to the contrary are inaccurate.” Photo A prominent Korea expert, Victor D. Cha, suggested that his nomination as an ambassador to South Korea had been sidelined because he warned administration officials against a “preventive” military strike. Credit Yonhap, via Associated Press During a visit in October to the D emilitarized Z one between the two Koreas, Mr. Mattis confronted the central contradiction in the Trump administration’s bellicose language: Virtually any military option would put the sprawling city of Seoul, with its population of 10 million, in the cross hairs of North Korea’s artillery guns. At times, South Korea’s defense minister, Song Young-moo, appeared to be giving Mr. Mattis a guided tour of how a strike against North Korea’s nuclear facilities would quickly trigger extensive retaliation. Even the most limited strike, the so-called bloody nose option, risks what one Defense Department official called an unacceptably high number of casualties. Mr. Cha, writing in The Washington Post, said the premise of such a strike — that it would jolt Mr. Kim into recognizing that the United States was serious, and draw him back to the bargaining table — was flawed. “If we believe that Kim is undeterrable without such a strike, how can we also believe that a strike will deter him from responding in kind?” Mr. Cha wrote. “And if Kim is unpredictable, impulsive and bordering on irrational, how can we control the escalation ladder, which is premised on an adversary’s rational understanding of signals and deterrence?” Friends said Mr. Cha pressed that case in meetings at the Pentagon, the United States Pacific Command, the State Department and the National Security Council. He passed along articles critical of preventive military action by two colleagues: John J. Hamre, the president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Michael J. Green, a senior fellow at the center who worked in the George W. Bush administration, as did Mr. Cha. Mr. Green warned against a preventive strike in testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said there appeared to be little support for it, even among normally hawkish Republicans like Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Even the White House has struggled to send a consistent message. In the week after Mr. Trump issued his threat to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea, Stephen K. Bannon, then his chief strategist, told a progressive journalist, “ There’s no military solution. Forget it.” “Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don’t die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons,” he said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Mr. Bannon’s bluntness angered other White House officials and hastened his exit from the White House. But there is evidence that General McMaster shares those concerns. Asked by a reporter in August whether there was any military option that would not put Seoul in North Korea’s cross hairs, he paused briefly, then said, “No.” With as many as 8,000 artillery pieces and rocket launchers positioned along its border with the South, North Korea could rain up to 300,000 rounds on the South in the first hour of a counterattack. While that arsenal is of limited range and could be destroyed in days, North Korea would still have time to cause widespread destruction. In a rare appearance last year on the CBS News program “Face the Nation,” Mr. Mattis warned that war with North Korea would be “catastrophic” — “probably the worst kind of fighting in most people’s lifetimes.” That does not mean the military has not begun preparing for that possibility. At multiple Army bases across the country this month, more than 1000 reserve officers are practicing how to set up so-called mobilization centers, which move reservists overseas in a hurry. But as the military gears up, Mr. Tillerson continues to look for a diplomatic channel to North Korea. State Department officials say the United States has far from exhausted its nonmilitary options for pressuring Pyongyang. It could, for example, push to expel North Korea from the United Nations or interdict ships that it suspects are violating sanctions against the government. Neither Mr. Tillerson nor Mr. Mattis has broken with the White House on the issue of a preventive strike. That is because for now, they still view it as a useful tool in deterring North Korea, according to people briefed by the administration. More important, they continue to be confident that, despite their anxieties, cooler heads with eventually prevail. Adam Goldman, Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

Dell Cameron,"With the launch of a new national cyber strategy, President Donald Trump has authorized the use of “offensive cyber operations” against U.S. adversaries, National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters on Thursday. The U.S. hopes by deploying offensive measures it can deter cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure and other systems, Bolton said, by demonstrating to adversaries that the cost “is higher than they want to bear.” In a letter, Trump said the new guidelines demonstrated his commitment to securing America from digital threats. “It is a call to action for all Americans and our great companies to take the necessary steps to enhance our national cybersecurity,” he said. “We will continue to lead the world in securing a prosperous cyber future.” Trump’s strategy, which he calls the “first fully articulated cyber strategy in 15 years,” replaces one implemented under the Obama administration. It is said to considerably relax rules surrounding the use of cyberweapons by the Pentagon and other agencies. “We’re going to do a lot of things offensively,” Bolton said. The move comes as U.S. intelligence warns of ongoing foreign operations aimed at undermining the 2018 midterm elections, including cyberattacks against voting infrastructure and computer intrusions targeting election officials. Asked if he considered the U.S. to be actively involved in a “cyberwar,” Bolton said he didn’t accept that “characterization.” But with its hands no longer tied, he said, expect the U.S. to strike back more frequently.","With the launch of a new national cyber strategy, President Donald Trump has authorized the use of “offensive cyber operations” against U.S. adversaries, National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters on Thursday.

Loren Grush,"The Trump administration’s National Space Council met publicly for the second time this week to talk about upcoming changes to the US space policy agenda, and the big topic of the day was regulatory reform. The council, a newly formed advisory group led by Vice President Mike Pence, discussed ways that regulations are “stifling” the commercial space industry. “While American industry and technology have leaped toward the future, our government agencies have too often remained stuck in the past,” Pence said at the meeting at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Now, the Council says it’s going to work on a number of changes that will make regulations less burdensome to commercial companies, such as streamlining launch licensing and creating a new undersecretary of Space Commerce. “our government agencies have too often remained stuck in the past.” It’s a familiar refrain from an administration that has made it very clear it wants to decrease government oversight. In August, Trump signed an executive order that directed all agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new one that gets introduced. Meanwhile, the administration is already rolling back a number of environmental statutes, such as the Clean Power Plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now it’s the space industry’s turn, and the Space Council has come up with four different types of regulatory issues it wants to change over the next year. Here’s what the group is proposing: Reform of launch licensing The commercial space industry is calling for a more streamlined way to get a launch license. Right now, any aerospace company that wants to launch a rocket or land a spacecraft back on Earth has to get a license from the Federal Aviation Administration. These licenses are meant to ensure that such vehicles will not harm any unsuspecting bystanders or cause any damage to public property when they launch or land. The process for getting a license is a little disjointed. For instance, the FAA has a unique set of licensing guidelines for each type of launch site. Companies that want to launch from a site overseen by the federal government have a different set of specific rules they have to follow than companies launching from a private spaceport. “Today’s launch licensing regime is plagued by burdensome government barriers,” Pence said. “To make matters worse, launch licenses can’t be transferred often from one site to another.” Additionally, different classifications of vehicles have their own licensing rules, too: a rocket considered expendable has a separate checklist from one that is considered reusable. Image: Blue Origin Blue Origin’s New Shepard taking off. Companies argue that this makes getting a license time-consuming, and instead, they want a much more simplified process that could apply to everyone — regardless of vehicle type or launchpad. “Obviously rockets that are very small and launch from a [commercial] spaceport are different than great, big heavy-lift launch vehicles like the Falcon Heavy,” Jim Muncy, founder of PoliSpace, a space policy consulting agency, tells The Verge. “So taking into account the differences in launch vehicles and design, the industry wants to write more general rules that apply to things equally.” The Commerce Department steps in Space companies have grown much more ambitious over the last decade. SpaceX did launch a sports car into orbit around the Sun, after all, and the company has not been shy about its goal to send humans to the Moon and Mars. Meanwhile, other companies want to do more than just launch satellites. Some plan to launch robots that can service satellites in orbit, operate space habitats, or mine asteroids and the Moon for resources. The problem is that there is no current regulatory framework in place that would allow the government to oversee these specialized activities in space. Now, the Commerce Department says it wants the job of creating that framework. At the meeting, Wilbur Ross, the US secretary of Commerce, proposed creating a “one-stop shop for space commerce” at the department. He also proposed creating a new undersecretary of Space Commerce (what many have referred to as a “space czar”), who would oversee all these advanced operations in space and propose regulations. Image: Moon Express An artistic rendering of the MX-1E lander that Moon Express wants to send to the lunar surface. The Commerce Department wouldn’t be responsible for every space-related regulation — the FAA would still likely oversee licensing for launch and spacecraft reentry, for instance — but this move could help fill a big gap that has been growing in the space industry. In 2016, Moon Express had to seek special government approval for its future mission to the lunar surface. A “space czar” could help to consolidate space regulation in a big way and allow companies to do more than simply launch satellites to orbit. “Basically, they’re saying if you come up with something new and innovative, they can give you authorization to go do that,” Brian Weeden, a space expert at the Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit that specializes in space security, tells The Verge. Sharing the spectrum Aside from streamlining the launch licensing process, companies are also calling for an easier way to get access to the radio frequencies they need to communicate with their satellites. That’s key for controlling and downloading information from those probes. Right now, companies have to apply for a license with the Federal Communications Commission, but the approval process has grown complicated and lengthy, according to the industry. In fact, there is only a small — and finite — spectrum of radio frequencies that companies can use, and a lot of companies want access to this spectrum. there is only a small — and finite — spectrum of radio frequencies that companies can use Commercial companies are also having a hard time coordinating with the US government, especially when it comes to operating Earth-observation satellites. Both private companies and the government have to share a very narrow band of frequencies to operate these satellites, and they’ve had problems coordinating with one another. “When you share, there is a coordination process,” Thomas Stroup, CEO of Shared Spectrum, tells T he Verge. “And that coordination process takes a lot of government approval.” As a result, the National Space Council is asking for better approval and coordination processes for the commercial industry. Additionally, the Department of Commerce is tasked to come up with better ways to manage how the spectrum is used. Export controls Another big area that the commercial industry wants to be reformed is how spaceflight hardware is exported. Predictably, companies want fewer restrictions on how they do business internationally. “That’s a no-brainer. It’s been coming for a long time, and they did part of it a couple years ago,” Laura Forczyk, a space consultant and owner of space research and consulting firm Astralytical, tells The Verge. The US government maintains three big lists of items that need to be licensed for export: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Controls, which covers nuclear equipment; the US Munitions List, which covers defense-related technology; and the Commerce Control List, which covers mostly commercial items that could have a military application. The goal of keeping such lists is to prevent deadly weapon technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Image: NASA Goddard’s Conceptual Image Lab / Chris Meaney Throughout the 2000s, satellites and other space-related technologies fell under the Munitions List. That means that everything from software to a working spacecraft to a screw on that spacecraft is subject to strict regulations on how these items can be transported and shared with foreign countries. “Let’s say [a company] wants to operate from a foreign location, they have pretty stringent restrictions on who can access the facility, the guards they can use, etc.,” says Weeden. Some reform came in 2014 when the Obama administration moved many satellite technologies on to the Commerce Control List, which is less restrictive. However, most items related to human spaceflight are still on the Munitions List. And with many companies looking to fly passengers in the next decade, the industry wants more reform. “Can we work more closely with our international partners, and can we do business internationally?” says Forczyk. “They could make it clear and open it up a little bit.” What next? The Council set a number of deadlines for when recommendations for changes need to be made. The deadline for how to deal with export control reforms is January 1st, 2019, while ideas for launch licensing reform need to be in by March 1st, 2019. So it’ll be a while before we know what changes are in store for the industry, but it looks like reform is on its way.","The Trump administration’s National Space Council met publicly for the second time this week, and the big topic of the day was regulatory reform.",2018-02-23T15:32:33Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",How the Trump administration wants to make it easier for commercial space companies to do business,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/23/17035436/national-space-council-regulatory-reform-industry-mike-pence,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tWIqfbpFQfQ7AdgYIA-jjA82JBI=/0x157:3000x1728/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10284405/25557987937_585c15c34d_o.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,National,1
DAVID BROOKS,"In this new context, a third-party candidate might run on what Hais, Ross and Winograd call constitutional localism. The constitutional part means preserving the civil rights safeguards enshrined in the Constitution. The localism part means a radical decentralization of other powers, to the levels of authority people have faith in. All recent presidential candidates have run against Washington, but on the premise that they could change Washington. Today, a third-party candidate would have to run on creating different kinds of power structures at different levels. Part of the solution is devolving power to towns and cities, but as Bruce Katz and Jeremy Nowak write in their book, “The New Localism,” “New Localism is not the same as local government.” Across the country, power is being most effectively wielded by civic councils — organically formed groups of local officials, business leaders, neighborhood organizations. The members may have different racial, class and partisan identities, but they have one shared identity — love of their community. My colleague Thomas Friedman wrote about one such council in Lancaster, Pa. If you want to see others you probably don’t have to travel far — Winston-Salem, Indianapolis, Detroit, Kalamazoo, Denver, Grand Rapids. Power in these places is not just wielded at the ballot box; it is wielded by movements and collaboratives in a thousand ways. According to a 2015 Heartland Monitor poll, 66 percent of Americans believe that their local area is moving in the right direction. These local efforts need a national leader in part because while it’s easy to say, “devolve power,” actually doing it is complicated. For example, civil rights is the area where the national government was once most clearly superior in many parts of the country. But these days, national partisan divisions overlap with our racial divisions, so it’s national demagogues like Donald Trump who most inflame racial animosity to gain political power. Civil rights progress still requires a forceful federal presence to, say, induce local police forces to reform and integrate. But such progress also requires energized local efforts in which people work across racial differences on common loves, like the future of their community’s children. We also need a national leader to tell a different national story. During the 20th century, a superpower story emerged. In that story, the nation moved as one, and a ridiculous amount of attention got focused on the supposed superhero in the White House. A third-party candidate who shifted attention to local people actually getting stuff done might lose, but he or she would begin to define a new and more plausible version of American greatness.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Throughout its history, Facebook has adamantly argued that it treats our data, and who has access to it, as a sort of sacred trust, with Zuckerberg &amp; Company being the trustees. Yet at the same time, Facebook has continued to undermine privacy by making it cumbersome to opt out of sharing, trying to convince users that we actually do want to share all of our personal information (and some people actually do) and by leaving the door unlocked for its partners and clients to come in and help themselves. Those partners have included 60 device makers that used application programming interfaces, also known as A.P.I.s, so Facebook could run on their gadgets. In Facebook’s view those partners functioned as extensions of the Facebook app itself and offered similar privacy protections. And the company said that most of this intrusive behavior happened a decade ago, when mobile apps barely existed and Facebook had to program its way onto those devices. “We controlled them tightly from the get-go,” said Facebook’s Ime Archibong, vice president for product partnerships, in a response to The Times’s article. Yet a Times reporter was able to retrieve information on 295,000 Facebook users using a five-year-old BlackBerry. A consortium of consumer and privacy organizations, including the Center for Digital Democracy, has already asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated the consent order after the Cambridge Analytica disclosures. Facebook’s failure to protect users’ basic information from outdated devices is only more evidence that the company either can’t manage its data or can’t manage to care, despite Mr. Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony to the contrary. “I say this gently,” said Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, to Mr. Zuckerberg during his testimony. “Your user agreement sucks.” Mr. Zuckerberg told Mr. Kennedy that he should have “complete control” over his data. The senator is willing to put that pledge into law. He and his colleague Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, have proposed regulations that would codify the right of consumers to opt out and keep their information private while giving them more control over it. More important, the senators’ bill would require “plain language” so there’s no confusion — not a big request, since the insurance industry did so years ago without any apparent harm. The European Union has passed such legislation, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., which forces companies such as Facebook to do a better job shielding individual data. Facebook says it is willing to extend the G.D.P.R. to anyone who asks for it. Though why should we have to ask for what ought to be ours to begin with?",Using social media doesn’t have to risk national security.,2018-06-05T23:26:32Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Can Facebook Be Cut Down to Size?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/opinion/facebook-china-privacy-data-security.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/06/opinion/06wed2/06wed2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption The frigatebird is the national bird of Barbuda Hurricane Irma did not just wipe out homes, infrastructure and livelihoods when it tore through the Caribbean island of Barbuda last September. The category five storm also wreaked havoc on the habitat of the tiny island's world-famous frigatebird colony. Codrington Lagoon is said to be the second-largest nesting area outside the Galapagos and has attracted tourists for decades. Image copyright Courtesy of Antigua &amp; Barbuda Tourism Authority Image caption Tourists and bird watchers were drawn to the lagoon because of its rich birdlife But most of the erstwhile 10,000-strong frigatebird population disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the disaster when the catastrophic winds destroyed the mangroves in which they nest and breed. The aptly named magnificent frigatebirds are famed for their colossal 7ft (2.1m) wingspan and the males' spectacular show of flirting by puffing out their throats into a bright red balloon during mating season. Frigatebirds: Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Earned the nickname ""man o' war birds"" due to their habit of aggressively stealing food from other birds Females select mates and form monogamous pairs for the duration of the breeding season Females lay just one egg, every other year Juvenile frigatebirds stay with the mother for up to two years Graceful in flight, they are clumsy on land because of their short legs and small feet They have called this pristine, peaceful area on Antigua's sister island home for as long as residents can remember. Happily, the birds have started to return and even build nests in the fragile, decaying stumps of the once luscious trees. Numbers are now set to rise further thanks to an imminent mangrove restoration project being funded by a team of four transatlantic rowers who are also ardent local environmentalists. Tough challenge In January, Team Antigua completed the gruelling 3,000-mile (4,800km) Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge race from the Canary Islands to Antigua in just 30 days, taking second place. John Watt, Scott Potter, Nico Psihoyos and Eli Fuller raised more than $150,000 (£112,000) towards their goal of creating a marine park in Antigua. Image copyright Courtesy of Atlantic Campaigns Image caption Team Antigua rowed 3,000 miles from the Canary Island of La Gomera to Antigua ""We decided to give a third of the money to Barbuda and we were keen for it to be an environmental project,"" Mr Fuller explains. ""The bird sanctuary is critically important for Codrington economically. And ecologically, you won't find many places as crucial as Barbuda. It's not just birds - it's a vital nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill turtles too."" The sanctuary has long been a significant source of revenue for Barbudans, several of whom earn a living as tour guides. ""Some people do as many as three trips a day in high season,"" says part-time guide Devon Warner. 'Great relief' Seeing the area stripped of vegetation and devoid of birds in the first days after the storm was ""horrifying"", park manager Kelly Burton tells the BBC. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Before Hurricane Irma hit, the mangroves were healthy and full of frigatebirds Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption After Irma, the picture was bleak ""The first thing going through my mind was, would they ever come back?"" Mr Burton recalls. ""Seeing the birds return and nest was a great relief. Many have chicks right now so they will be here at least another year or two. The restoration will be a huge help."" Many of the birds live year round in Barbuda. Others travel between the Caribbean and the Galapagos and there are a handful of other known nesting sites in the region, Mr Burton says. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Frigatebirds nest in the mangroves so restoring them is key ""But the healthiest place is Barbuda. Scientists once took blood samples from the birds to see why ours were so healthy. They think it's due to the low levels of mercury in the fish they eat."" The non-profit Waitt Institute will oversee the mangrove project as part of its marine conservation partnership with the Barbuda Council, known as Blue Halo Barbuda. The process involves collecting several thousand seeds - or propagules - from coastal areas and planting them in a new purpose-built nursery, says science and field manager Andy Estep. ""They will soak in little pots for six months to a year before being planted at the sanctuary,"" he explains. 'Full of life' The $50,000 donated by the rowers will be spent on equipment and supplies for the nursery and a salary for its manager, plus travel expenses for visiting experts from the University of the West Indies. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption The frigatebirds on Barbuda are particularly healthy, experts say Barbudans will be trained to run the nursery and grow propagules for future programmes. Preliminary assessments to gauge the quality of the water in the lagoon, along with salinity, acidity and oxygen levels to help predict how well the young mangroves will thrive, are now poised to begin. ""More than half of the tree mass was lost to Irma,"" Mr Estep continues. ""If we can return it to its former state, that would be fantastic. It's a beautiful place normally and so full of life as one of the two biggest reproductive hotspots for frigatebirds."" Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Environmentalists were worried the birds would not return Nine months after the storm ripped Barbuda apart, causing damage estimated at $220m, islanders are battling on to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. Just like the birds, Barbudans too are slowly coming home. Around 500 of the former 1,800 residents have so far returned from Antigua to rebuild homes and businesses. Reviving the touristic offerings will be key, argues Mr Burton. ""The frigates are also our national bird and something unique to Barbuda. They're been part of the landscape forever,"" he says. ""They choose to make this place their home; it's up to us, as stewards of the land, to look after it for them.""",Frigatebirds almost disappeared from Barbuda after Hurricane Irma hit but now they are back.,2018-06-25T00:35:04Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Barbuda sees a comeback of national bird after Hurricane Irma,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-44547090,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13472/production/_102126987_f31af90f-515e-4bfc-bd28-a6733fc82fdf.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
Zack Whittaker,"What once sounded like science fiction is now a reality: creating almost-perfectly faked videos of people saying things they never did. Surprise: now they’re a reality, thanks to modern computing power and the power to instantly share it on the world’s social stage. But US lawmakers are worried that these faked videos could be used by the enemy to harm national security. If you’re unaware, “deep fakes” are digitally manipulated videos — which, using existing footage mixed with artificial intelligence and machine learning, can be made to look like, or close to, the real thing. Unsurprisingly, one of the first uses of deep fake videos was for porn — by superimposing faces onto others. But now, lawmakers think that deep fakes could be used as part of wider disinformation campaigns — known to be a tactic of adversarial nation states like Russia — in an effort to sway elections or spread false news. “Deep fakes could become a potent tool for hostile powers seeking to spread misinformation,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in a letter to Dan Coats, director of national intelligence. “As deep fake technology becomes more advanced and more accessible, it could pose a threat to United States public discourse and national security, with broad and concerning implications for offensive active measures campaigns targeting the United States,” said the letter, co-signed by Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Carlos Curbelo (R-FL). The lawmakers have a point. In recent years, disinformation has risen and has a major factor in the meddling during the 2016 presidential election. Now, instead of false and misleading news, it was fake videos of politicians throwing shade at their rivals — or worse. Take this deep fake video — created by BuzzFeed News of what appears to be former President Obama calling President Trump a “dipshit” — to show how easy it is. A deep fake video created by BuzzFeed News to show how easy it is to create false and misleading videos. What might be good fun on one hand, on the other it can have a major effect on those who are none the wiser. Schiff, Murphy, and Curbelo want the director of national intelligence — who oversees the nation’s intelligence community — to report back on its assessment of how deep fake technology could harm national security interests, and if there are countermeasures to protect against foreign influence — and their limitations. The DNI’s office was asked to report back to Congress by mid-December. When reached, a spokesperson for the DNI did not immediately comment. If that changes, we’ll update.","What once sounded like science fiction is now a reality: creating almost-perfectly faked videos of people saying things they never did.

""It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House,"" her spokeswoman said. The first lady reportedly feuded with Ms Ricardel during her tour of Africa in October, according to US media. The White House and the National Security Council has yet to comment. The statement came as US media reported that Mr Trump was considering a shake up in the White House West Wing, and may be considering removing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. As deputy national security adviser, Mrs Ricardel serves under National Security Advisor John Bolton on the powerful National Security Council. According to US media reports, Mrs Trump and Mrs Ricardel fell out during the first lady's trip to Africa last month and quarrelled over seating arrangements on her plane. During her trip there, Mrs Trump told ABC in a rare interview that she gives the president ""my honest advice and honest opinions and then he does what he wants to do"". Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The long knives are out at the White House. Behind-the-scenes machinations and off-the-record backstabbing are nothing new in this administration, of course. Practically since inauguration various factions have been vying for political supremacy in the West Wing. What's different this time around is that the office of First Lady Melania Trump decided to attack a member of the White House staff on the record and in no uncertain terms. Presidential spouses do have a long history of involving themselves in White House staffing issues. Nancy Reagan, for instance, had an ongoing feud with Chief of Staff Donald Regan. Hillary Clinton frequently sparred with White House aides. It's the kind of thing that never spills quite so openly into view, however. With the mid-term elections now in the rear-view mirror, the situation in the Trump White House appears to be coming to a head. The biggest face-off appears to be between two key power centres, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Advisor John Bolton. Everything else, including the situation with Mrs Trump, is cascading from that. It's a situation that seems difficult to sustain.

SEE ALSO: Patagonia and Google look to defend public lands with stunning VR film series In what the outdoor clothing company slams as ""the largest elimination of protected land in American history,"" Trump announced plans to scale back Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante by some 80 percent and 45 percent, respectively — leaving the land open to drilling and hunting. The former takes the biggest hit; it will now be just 220,000 acres, down from 1.35 million. It was designated a national monument in the dying days of the Obama administration less than a year ago. Bill Clinton designated Grand Staircase in 1996. Trump's decision has proven controversial. While some praised him for bringing the land back into public use, arguing that Obama overreached with his 2016 decision, many have slammed Monday's news. Environmentalists and Native American rights groups have expressed severe dismay. And Patagonia is not taking it lying down. It's launching one of several lawsuits, aiming to protect Bears Ears National Monument specifically. The company is working with conservation nonprofit Friends of Cedar Mesa and grassroots Native American organization Utah Diné Bikéyah, among others, on the action. An utterly depressing graphic on Patagonia's site visualizes the extent of the issue, and insists ""an area bigger than Yosemite National Park is now at risk of industrialization"" at Grand Staircase.

Zack Whittaker,"It’s not often you can put nuclear weapons, terrorism and climate change on the same list as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, but the U.S. government believes all pose an “emerging threat” to its national security. Several key agencies in the U.S. intelligence community were asked what they saw as long-term threats faced by the country in the next decade and beyond, and the future of “dual-use technologies” took center stage. Agnostic technologies like encryption, autonomous and unmanned systems, AI and quantum computing rank at the top of the agencies’ “worry list” for fears that they could be used to cause harm, rather than advance society. While all can be used for good to secure data, to survey a dangerous area, or simply to save time and effort the government says that all can have disastrous effects if used by an adversary. For example, the government says that, “adversaries could gain increased access to AI through affordable designs used in the commercial industry, and could apply AI to areas such as weapons and technology,” and that “quantum communications could enable adversaries to develop secure communications that U.S. personnel would not be able to intercept or decrypt.” The list of emerging threats also includes information operations such as those purportedly carried out by adversarial nation states in the run up to recent elections may engage in “advanced information operations campaigns that use social media, artificial intelligence, and data analytics to undermine the United States and its allies.” A list of “dual-use” technological threats faced by the U.S. (Image: Government Accountability Office) It’s no surprise that the government fears the unknown: warfare in this day and age has adapted beyond recognition, with nation states targeting one another with literal “cyber-bombs” and disinformation campaigns, sowing seeds of doubt rather than lobbing bombs over borders. “As such, the nature of warfare has evolved to include ‘gray zone’ conflictdefined as the area between war and peace where weaker adversaries have learned how to seize territory and advance their agendas in ways not recognized as ‘war’ by Western democracies,” the government watchdog wrote. Notably, the U.S. pointed its finger specifically at China and Russia with Iran a close third for “pursuing gray zone strategies to achieve their objectives without resorting to military conflict.” And the U.S. knows it has to keep up with the range of threats, or face weakening on the world stage. “The challenge for the United States and its allies will be to develop responses faster than adversaries through a better understanding of the strategic environment,” the government said. That might be tougher than it seems, given that senior government officials said the U.S. has been “strategically surprised” by how fast the threats have evolved. “The nature of conflict has changed, and so the United States must evolve,” the government said.","It’s not often you can put nuclear weapons, terrorism and climate change on the same list as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, but the U.S. government believes all pose an “emerging threat” to its national security.

Jacob Kastrenakes,"President Donald Trump issued an order Monday evening blocking any merger of the chipmaking giants Broadcom and Qualcomm, saying it was necessary to protect national security. Broadcom’s control over Qualcomm, the order says, might allow the Singapore-based company to “take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Broadcom has been trying to purchase Qualcomm for the last several months, but has continually been rebuffed. It’s since tried to stack Qualcomm’s board with friendly members. Trump’s order says that Broadcom will not be allowed to purchase or merge with Qualcomm in any way, and that all of the people Broadcom has proposed to Qualcomm’s board are disqualified. It seems that Broadcom was aware that Trump or his Justice Department might attempt to block the merger on these grounds. Trump has done it before, blocking a Chinese state-owned company from buying an American semiconductor firm back in September.

Marcus Gilmer,"Nearly all the members of the U.S. National Park Service advisory board announced their sudden resignations on Monday night, in protest of what they say has been a lack of engagement by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke during the past year. In a resignation letter, the members said Zinke refused to meet with the panel, which is legally required to provide input to the department regarding how to take care of America's most treasured landscapes. SEE ALSO: The National Park Service removed climate change plans from website, but it may be for a good reason Former Alaska Gov. and advisory board member Tony Knowles turned in the letter of resignation for himself and eight others, citing ""a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside."" The other eight members of the board that joined Knowles include: Gretchen Long, Paul Bardacke, Carolyn Finney, Judy Burke, Stephen Pitti, Milton Chen, Belinda Faustinos, Margaret Wheatley. Just three members remain a part of the board. You can read Knowles complete letter below ( via The Washington Post ). In an interview with Alaska Public Radio, Knowles went a bit more in-depth about what drove the board's frustrations with the current administration. “The department showed no interest in learning about or continuing to use the forward-thinking agenda of science, the effect of climate change, protections of the ecosystems, education,” Knowles said in a phone interview. “And it has rescinded NPS regulations of resource stewardship concerning those very things: biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change.” NPR notes that the nine members who stepped down were all Obama-era appointees and were scheduled to end their terms in May, anyway. But their public resignation sends a clear message of frustration with the way the Trump administration has bungled its way through managing not just the National Park Service but several other Interior Department organizations. For example, the administration still hasn't nominated anyone for Park Service director, and has proposed steep fee hikes for Americans to access many of the most popular parks in the system, including Yosemite National Park in California. And the Interior Department faced backlash last year for omitting ""climate change"" from its strategic plan because, presumably, we have a president that still doesn't believe it's a problem (though the recent disappearance of climate change plans from national parks website was for a different, far better reason.) As Interior Secretary, Zinke has pursued a pro-growth agenda, removing restrictions on drilling for oil, gas, and coal on public lands, and shrinking national monuments set aside by former president president Obama. Zinke is under investigation by his department for his use of private and departmental assets for travel.","Nearly all the members of the U.S. National Park Service advisory board announced their sudden resignations on Monday night, in protest of what they say has been a lack of engagement by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke during the past year.

Peter Burnett was the first governor of the State of California, ascending to the post on December 20, 1849. But his ignominious legacy is hardly known today. Mr. Burnett came from Missouri via Oregon, settling near Sacramento amid the Gold Rush. Just as he had done in Oregon, Mr. Burnett pushed to exclude blacks from the state. While he seemed to couch his argument in antislavery terms, he was merely “disguising” his “equal opportunity racism,” said William Deverell, a historian and the director of the Huntington-U.S.C.

Catie Keck,"A man driving a Tesla Model 3 in Delray, Florida was killed in a collision with another vehicle early Friday that has prompted investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The NTSB tweeted late Friday that it was sending a three-person team to investigate the incident, and that it will work together with the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office on the probe. The NHTSA told Reuters that it too had dispatched an investigative team to look into the incident. Both agencies are currently looking into collisions involving Teslas self-driving mode.
A preliminary police report from the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office obtained by Electrek said the collision occurred at an intersection off Florida State Road 7 near Pero Family Farms. The 2018 Tesla Model 3 was reportedly headed southbound at the time that a tractor-trailer, pulling out of a driveway leading to Pero Family Farms after stopping at a stop sign, attempted to turn left onto the highway headed northbound.
At that time the tractor-trailer entered the path of the Tesla, and the latter hit the drivers side of the trailer, resulting in the roof being sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer, the report said. The 50-year-old Tesla driver died on the scene, per Reuters. It is not clear whether the Teslas Autopilot mode was active at the time of the collision.
Per the police report, the Tesla Model 3 continued for nearly a third of a mile before coming to a complete stop. As several reports have noted, the incident bears remarkable similarities to another fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S that occurred in Florida in 2016.
During that incident, the Tesla struck a tractor-semitrailer in such a way that its roof was sheared off. The vehicle reportedly continued on through a drainage culvert and two wire fences, per an NTSB report on the incident, before hitting a utility pole and finally coming to a stop. The report said Autopilot systems were enabled at the time of the crash.
Tesla told Electrek that it was deeply saddened to hear about this incident, adding that it was contacting the authorities to cooperate in their investigation. Weve reached out to Tesla for more information and will update this report if we hear back.

James Vincent,"France has announced a new national AI strategy, including government funding worth nearly €1.5 billion ($1.85 billion). But the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is worried about the damage this technology could do if not properly guided. In an interview with Wired, he said there was even a risk AI could “jeopardize democracy.” Macron is worried about unaccountable “black box” algorithms being introduced into society and making decisions formerly entrusted to humans. He gave the example of an algorithm used to sort students into universities, and said that if its workings were not easy to understand, it could destroy trust and encourage people to “reject” innovation. “I have to be confident for my people that there is no bias, at least no unfair bias, in this algorithm,” he said. In order to guard against this threat, Macron said the French government will do its best to open up data used by AI systems and pressure private companies to do the same. “Obviously some of them will say, there is a commercial value in my algorithm, I don’t want to make it transparent. But I think we need a fair discussion between service providers and consumers, who are also citizens,” said Macron. Read more: MEET THE ROCKSTAR MATHEMATICIAN LEADING FRANCE’S AI TASK FORCE In the interview, the French president also stressed that Europe needed to play a bigger role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence. He identified the US and China as the sector’s current leaders, but said neither country’s values were fully aligned with those of Europe. In the US, said Macron, work is “entirely driven by the private sector,” while in China, research is “driven by a government whose principles and values are not ours.” The European Union has historically championed digital privacy, and passes legislation that empowers individual to better control their own data. (As demonstrated by the recent General Data Protection Regulation ). Macron said that if the continent wanted to carry these values forward into the 21st century it will have to be “an acting part of this AI revolution” and help “frame the discussion at a global scale.” Macron’s worries echo those of many within the AI community, who praise the technology’s potential benefits but warn it could lead to all sorts of dangerous situation — especially if it is abused by power-hungry corporations or totalitarian governments. And as with other types of new technology, the solution will inevitably be one that involves citizens and governments, not just companies. As Macron told Wired : “This leads me to the conclusion that this huge technological revolution is in fact a political revolution.”","France has announced a new national AI strategy, including nearly €1.5 billion in funding, bu president Emmanuel Macron is worried about the dangers of unaccountable AI and algorithms.",2018-04-02T11:28:43Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","Badly implemented AI could ‘jeopardize democracy,’ says French president Emmanuel Macron",https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17187736/france-ai-strategy-emmanuel-macron-dangers-democracy,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T4N3qpoj_v_Q2eovMfxmNjGj9AM=/0x286:3995x2378/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10569677/936535288.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,National,1
Mark Kaufman,"President Trump may have just dramatically slashed the size of two national monuments in Utah, but America's 59 national parks — as well as over 270 other national park sites — cannot be unilaterally downsized by Trump or any other president. The legal reason is simple and inarguable: ""National parks can only be established by Congress, and everyone agrees they can only be undone, if at all, by Congress,"" Holly Doremus, a natural resources law expert at University of California, Berkeley, told Mashable in an email. SEE ALSO: Photos of the majestic public lands Trump just opened to drilling and hunting National monuments — like Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante — are a different story. Combined, Trump reduced both protected lands by nearly 2 million acres combined. Bears Ears was reduced in size by over 80 percent. Unlike national parks or other national park sites — places like national rivers, national preserves, and national seashores — national monuments are established by the president, who wields the unilateral power to protect places of historic or scientific interest from resource extraction and development. This presidential power is granted by the 1906 Antiquities Act and was first employed by the conservation-minded president Theodore Roosevelt to establish Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming, also in 1906. But while presidents can establish a national monument, it's doubtful — though still arguable —they can change monument boundaries, like Congress can. Because the Trump administration just did this, they have now entered murky legal territory. ""Congress can certainly undo a national monument designation,"" said Doremus. ""It is disputed whether the president can unilaterally do so. Most natural resource scholars think not."" Theodore Roosevelt used the Antiquities Act to protect Devil's Tower National Monument in 1906. Image: national park service A review of the matter, published earlier this year by two natural resource lawyers in The Virginia Law Review, supports this belief. They argue that only Congress has the power to ""downsize"" a national monument, just like only Congress can nix or dissolve a national monument. They write: If the President cannot abolish a national monument because Congress did not delegate that authority to the President, it follows that the President also lacks the power to downsize or loosen the protections afforded to a monument. Still, no president has ever cut the boundaries of a national monument to such an extreme degree and then been challenged in court. The authors add: Importantly though, no Presidential decision to reduce the size of a national monument has ever been tested in court, and so no court has ever ruled on the legality of such an action. Until this gets settled, it's possible the Trump administration will alter or downsize other national monuments. In a once-secret memo given to the president in August, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended that four national monuments be downsized and six others altered. National monuments like Bears Ears are not protected on a president's whim: They are typically reviewed for years and seek public input to confirm their natural and cultural significance, as President Obama articulated in December 2016 : ""Following years of public input and various proposals to protect both of these areas, including legislation and a proposal from tribal governments in and around Utah, these monuments will protect places that a wide range of stakeholders all agree are worthy of protection.""","President Trump may have just dramatically slashed the size of two national monuments in Utah, but America's 59 national parks — as well as over 270 other national park sites — cannot be unilaterally downsized by Trump or any other president.

You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — The majority of members of the National Parks System Advisory Board, which advises the federal government on management of the country’s national parks, have jointly resigned to protest Trump administration policies that the board members say have ignored science, squelched efforts to address climate change and undermined environmental protections. The advisory board was established in 1935 to advise the secretary of the interior, who oversees management of the country’s national parks and monuments. Since taking office last year, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has come under criticism from environmental advocates for promoting President Trump’s agenda of opening up the nation’s public lands and waters to fossil-fuel exploration, and for reducing the protection of public monuments. This month Mr. Zinke announced a plan to open up the majority of the nation’s coastlines to offshore drilling. And in December, the administration reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, by some two million acres, the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation’s history. “From all of the events of this past year I have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside,” wrote Tony Knowles, the head of the advisory board, in a resignation letter dated Monday that was co-signed by eight other members of the 12-member panel. The Washington Post first reported the letter. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. “We resigned because we were deeply disappointed with the department and we were concerned,” Mr. Knowles said in an interview. Mr. Zinke, he said, “appears to have no interest in continuing the agenda of science, the effect of climate change, pursuing the protection of the ecosystem.” Continue reading the main story","Ryan Zinke, the Interior Secretary, in Washington in June.

JOHN BRANCH,"Games are meant to resolve matters, with the finality of a score. That is not the case for the biggest sports story of the year. Good luck figuring out who won and who lost. How is success measured in protests and counterprotests? Is it mere heightened awareness, or do we need to point to concrete change? Is the goal to create division or cohesion, disruption or appeasement? (Let’s step back: Do you even remember what the protests are — or were supposed to be — about? Answer: racial inequality and police brutality, according to Kaepernick, who sat, and later knelt, for pregame national anthems in 2016, and whose last game came on New Year’s Day a year ago.) Photo Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett, center, sits with teammates on the bench during the playing of the national anthem before kickoff against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. The N.F.L. players' protests of racial oppression continue but on a smaller scale as the season ends. Credit Joe Nicholson/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The 2017 season really began in the spring, as Kaepernick, 29, with a sterling reputation as a teammate and with a Super Bowl on his résumé, waited to be signed. It never happened. He has since watched more than 40 other quarterbacks be pulled from football’s unemployment rolls instead. Once the preseason started, Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles raised a fist as his teammate Chris Long put his hand on Jenkins’s back. It was widely considered the first time a white N.F.L. player took part in the protests but mostly started a season-long discussion about what constitutes “took part.” In Cleveland, more than a dozen Browns players knelt in front of the water coolers, offending many, including the local police union, which said it would not participate in flag ceremonies at future games if such conduct continued. It did not, and when the regular season began a few weeks later, the players ran onto the field with police officers, emergency medical workers and military personnel, everyone locking arms in some sort of chain of unity. (It will be remembered by some as the season’s high point. The Browns went 0-16.) It all felt only vaguely related to Kaepernick’s unceremonious protests of 2016, which had required three games before anyone noticed. Trying to discern meaning in this season’s protests was as bewildering as defining a catch in the N.F.L. these days. Ah, but this was 2017, when confusion was merely the first stage of good grief. Just as the regular season began, the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, was asked if Kaepernick was good enough to play in the league. “I’m not a football expert,” said Goodell, who later signed a five-year contract extension worth roughly $100 million, despite his lack of football expertise. Only a few players protested during the first two weeks of the regular season, with more of them standing with a raised fist than kneeling or sitting. But things changed dramatically on a Friday in September. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these N.F.L. owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now — out!’” President Trump told a rally of supporters in Alabama. “‘He’s fired. He’s fired!’” Photo Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch sits during the national anthem before a game Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers. Lynch has been among a small group of N.F.L. players who have consistently protested during a season when numerous sideline gestures during the anthem erupted, sometimes ambiguously. Credit Kelvin Kuo/Associated Press It was the verbal equivalent of starting a barroom brawl. Goodell and many team owners responded, mostly through tepid, prepared statements. Players, unrestrained, took to social media. Trump continued. “If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem,” Trump wrote on Twitter, part of a series of rhetorical bar stools he lobbed for most of a week. “If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!” At least 100 N.F.L. players knelt for the anthem that weekend. The Seattle Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans broke league rules by staying inside during the anthem; the Titans missed the singer Meghan Linsey taking a knee at the end of her rendition. Alejandro Villanueva of the Pittsburgh Steelers came out of the stadium tunnel, barely, while his teammates stayed behind, a miscommunication that thrust them into the fray and made Villanueva an accidental hero among people opposed to the protests. Aaron Rodgers posted an Instagram photo of himself kneeling during warm-ups, which Tom Brady liked, but both stood for the anthem. Their teams, like many others, linked arms. The protests became a sporting form of interpretive dance. What does it mean to take a knee? Is it different from sitting? What about locking arms? Raising a fist? Putting your hand on someone’s shoulder? When LeSean McCoy of the Buffalo Bills stretched during the anthem, people did mental calisthenics to discern what it meant. Things got weird. The Dallas Cowboys and the team’s owner, Jerry Jones, who had threatened his players against kneeling, knelt and linked arms on the field. Then they all stood before the anthem started — a flourish no one quite understood. Fans booed. The president wrote on Twitter the next morning that the booing was the loudest he had ever heard. “Great anger,” he wrote. Everyone, it seemed, found a reason to take some kind of stand. With the goal unclear — to force all players to stand at attention while we rush to the restroom or the beer line? — there was a lot of ruckus and noise, and little discussion or decorum. High school athletes, cheerleaders, marching bands, police officers, city councils, rock stars, even a football team of 8-year-olds and a band playing the anthem for an Oakland A’s game knelt. Some marched to the N.F.L. offices or to the gates of stadiums in shows of solidarity. Conversely, some burned their season tickets or team jerseys and vowed never to watch the N.F.L. again. A Missouri bar owner used the jerseys of two well-known protesting players as doormats to spell out “Lynch Kaepernick.” Plenty, including the president, blamed or credited the controversy for the N.F.L.’s fading television ratings (which were on a slide before the protests). In early October, Vice President Mike Pence showed up to an Indianapolis Colts game and left abruptly ( in what some called a stunt at Trump’s request) when players from the visiting San Francisco 49ers — Kaepernick’s former team — knelt for the anthem. The N.F.L. and Goodell, longtime practitioners in the status quo, tiptoed the fence, to no one’s satisfaction, waiting for the whole thing to fade away, which it kind of did. They responded primarily with meetings, including with protesting players. There were offers to spend more money on charitable causes, but people could not agree on that, either. There was talk that the N.F.L. might just keep players in the locker room during the anthem next season. “That’s almost as bad as kneeling!” the president said on Twitter in November, his ire temporarily resurrected. By then, though, the number of players kneeling or sitting for the anthem had shrunk back to early-season levels, a protest movement hard to sustain without a clear, vocal leader and goals. In places like Seattle and San Francisco, where the majority of protesters played, anthem rituals became routine, barely noticed. Even the television networks turned their cameras away, having moved on. Now, at season’s end, the top sports story of 2017 already feels like something that has come and gone — or is going, at least, perhaps just smoldering until it flares again. Oppression, by any measure, hasn’t ended, or perhaps even slowed. Police brutality against people of color remains a major issue. Those were not things that would go away quickly, if ever. So were the protests a success? Or does something else have to happen? How will history judge the N.F.L. season of 2017? Sunday’s games will not be a memorable part of the story. Nine members of the Seahawks sat, as they had most of the season, while another knelt with a teammate’s hand on his shoulder. Four 49ers knelt. Six other teams had at least one player take part, the reports said, judging by their posture. When the anthems and the television commercials ended, the games and cheers began, as if nothing had happened. The sideline posturing of 2017 came to a close. Fitting for football, it will take a long review to determine just what it was that we think we saw.

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"Economists have warned that government borrowing would limit private sector borrowing, which would constrain economic growth; that it would drive up inflation; and even that the government might find itself unable to borrow, if creditors presumed the United States was too deep in debt and might be unable to make interest payments or repay its liabilities in full.
Some continue to ring those bells. Michael A. Peterson, the president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a leading advocacy group for debt reduction, noted the $22 trillion milestone with a statement that said the federal debt threatens the economic future of every American.
The governments borrowing has real costs, notably the need to make interest payments to investors. Those payments now exceed $1 billion a day. But many experts have concluded that the gravity and immediacy of any threat to the broader economy was overstated. While federal borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, by increasing competition for available funds, larger forces have kept rates at low levels, including the eagerness of China and other nations to lend money to the United States.
Even as the debt climbed, interest payments as a share of G.D.P. declined.
Mr. Trump was among those who warned of dire consequences. In February 2015, he tweeted that if the debt topped $21 trillion, Obama will have effectively bankrupted our country. And the next year, in March 2016, Mr. Trump told The Washington Post he could eliminate the federal debt within eight years.
Mr. Kudlow said Thursday that the White House still expected its policies to cause such an increase in economic growth that annual federal deficits would decline, slowing the rise of the debt.
Thats the key economic growth and some budget restraint, Mr. Kudlow said. Growth, growth, growth, and limit spending. We are doing that, and we will do more of it.
Mr. Kudlow said the administration planned to propose a very tough spending budget this year, including cuts of at least 5 percent in nondefense discretionary spending.","The national debt has topped $22 trillion, a record, creating political challenges for both parties.

Marcus Gilmer,"On Dec. 22, 2018, when parts of the federal government went into shutdown mode, it caused a ripple effect that's continued to be felt by workers and the public alike, sometimes in unexpected ways. 
Among the wide-ranging consequences of the shutdown has been the silence from the various National Park accounts on Instagram, which have amassed millions of followers across the various handles. The main National Park Service Instagram even has a whopping 1.3 million followers.
The National Park Service posted a message on its account on Dec. 21, 2018 that read, ""During the federal government shutdown, we will not monitor or update social media. Some National Park Service areas are accessible, however access may change without notice, and there are no NPS-provided services. For more information, visit the parks website ... ""
Similar messages were found across the various park-specific accounts. 
This, of course, makes sense as the posts are handled by federal workers park employees or a  NPS employee based in Washington, D.C. and those folks are at home like hundreds of thousands of other federal employees who aren't getting paid. 
SEE ALSO: The toilets are overflowing in national parks. But that's not the worst problem.
The lack of pretty photos is hardly the only troubling thing happening with the National Parks system during the shutdown. Because sections of many parks are still open to the public without any oversight, there have been problems ranging from bathrooms overflowing with waste and garbage to a horrible subset of people seemingly intent on doing damage to these invaluable natural resources. 
And that's just because of the current shutdown, never mind the deep maintenance deficit the system is still struggling with.
The Instagram accounts coming back to life won't fix many of the issues. But these accounts have been a tremendous success and not just in the form of marketing tools that attract more visitors to the parks or fill your Insta feed up with pretty pictures. 
The photos and livestreams that happen across these accounts are key tools of advocacy for the parks, be it protection of wildlife living in the parks, educating the public on everything the National Park Service and its employees do, or even promoting ecologically-friendly behavior. 
By pulling in millions of people with stunning photos, the parks can then reach a much larger audience when they need to spread the word about conservation efforts or visitor tips, like what do when a bison walks up and licks your car.

If you want to keep your Instagram feed full of National Park photos, there are non-government accounts that can scratch that itch for you. Accounts like National Park Geek, Parks Project, and the National Park Foundation (the NPS's charitable partner) have been keeping the 'gram game going during the shutdown.
And there's always getting in on the action yourself. After all, many of the parks are still open across the country, so if you live near one, consider going and capturing your own stunning photos. The shutdown helped inspire me to drag my poor dog out into the cold to visit my nearest National Park, even in the dead of winter.

Hopefully, even without the activity on the Instagram accounts, love and attention can still be paid to the National Parks. Whether it's donations for upkeep, volunteering to clean up, or simply making a point to visit, maybe these accounts can still draw much-needed support and attention.

Yes, Oregon's first husband, Dan Little, spent some time last week at Mount Hood National Forest cleaning up bathrooms. He then sent President Trump an invoiced bill for $28 which, frankly, is an incredibly kind bill.
SEE ALSO: The toilets are overflowing in national parks. But that's not the worst problem.
Judging by the looks of the bathroom and the time and effort that Brown probably had to put in to cleaning them, $28 is not nearly enough (and maybe something to consider in working out raises for workers who do this on the regular when the government's not shut down). 
Of course, this is just one series of bathrooms in one park in one state while, apparently, the national flow of poop runneth over in other locations across the country.

Victoria Rodriguez,"You may see the hashtag #NEDAwareness trending this week. The hashtag stands for National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, a movement that lasts from February 25 to March 3, which aims to combat society's beauty standards and promote self-acceptance. 
The annual initiative was created by the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), a nonprofit that offers programs and services to people experiencing eating disorders. This year, the organization aims to make conversations about eating disorders more inclusive by amplifying stories from people of marginalized communities. Online, they're promoting this theme through #ComeAsYouAre as well as #NEDAwareness.

""There is a stereotype that eating disorders only occur in thin, white, affluent women. Not only is that incredibly false, it is dangerous, too,"" Ryan Sheldon, an ambassador to NEDA, wrote in an email. Sheldon explains that more than 30 million Americans will struggle with eating disorders at some point in their lives. 
Organizers want to assure people experiencing eating disorders that they are not alone, says Lauren Smolar, the director of programs at NEDA. The group encourages people to take the Body Acceptance Challenge, a pledge to accept their bodies, respect others' bodies, and fight weight stigma. 
""If were truly going to break the stigma that surrounds eating disorders, we need to show people that the spectrum of those affected is vast,"" Smolar wrote in an email. 
When shared, the hashtags #NEDAwareness and #ComeAsYouAre can help spread awareness but it can also guide you to additional resources, like text hotlines and information about common types of eating disorders.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,"For starters, I believe that the promise of M.B.S., however much you did or did not think he could bring social, economic and religious reform, is finished. Hes made himself radioactive absent a credible, independent exoneration for Jamals disappearance and apparent murder. M.B.S. may be able to hold onto power in Saudi Arabia, but his whole reform program required direct foreign investment and money has been flowing out of Saudi Arabia for months, not in. Now it will get worse. Yes, I covered the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre. I know that money has a short memory. But Saudi Arabia is not China. There has been just way too much craziness coming out of the M.B.S. government for many investors to want to make long-term bets there today, which is too bad. It will weaken any hopes of future reform. And heres one more complication. Even if M.B.S. were pushed aside, if you think there are a 100 Saudi royals with the steel, cunning and ruthlessness he had to push through women driving, removing the Islamic police from the streets and reopening cinemas, you are wrong. There are not. All of these reforms had intense conservative opponents. This is not Denmark, and yet, without sweeping social, economic and religious reforms, Saudi Arabia could well become a huge failed state. Remember, one of ISIS biggest sources of young recruits was Saudi Arabia. And by the way, if you think M.B.S. had a dark side, you ought to look under some rocks in the kingdom. You will find some people there with long beards who dont speak English who believe the most crazy stuff about Shiites, Jews, Christians, Hindus, America and the West. And right now, trust me, they are applauding Jamals assumed murder. So, once again, what do we do? I dont have a simple answer. Its a mess. All I know is that we have to find some way to censure M.B.S. for this without seeming to attack the whole Saudi people and destabilize the country. And we have to make sure that the social/religious reform process in Saudi Arabia proceeds whoever is in charge there. Because that is a vital U.S. interest. But you cant fix stupid. And when your ally does something as sick and as stupid as the Saudis apparently did in Istanbul, there is just no easy fix. But Trump might start by appointing an ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The strategy is based around his ""America first"" campaign platform The Trump administration's National Security Strategy - based on what the White House calls ""principled realism"" - marks a significant shift in emphasis from the past, presenting both a decidedly more pessimistic view of the world but nonetheless a markedly optimistic view of America's place in it. It is easy for critics to write off the president's pronouncements. Certainly at times President Trump sounded at times as though he was still on the campaign trail in launching the new 68-page document, castigating the previous Obama administration and wrapping his new strategy in decidedly populist terms. Nonetheless this is a document that should not be dismissed and it will repay careful reading. It sets out a pragmatic view of a turbulent and troubled world and it recasts some of the president's favourite slogans - not least his consistent call to put ""America First"" - in a new and unexpected light. A broad vision The strategy document itself is divided into four main sections touching on all aspects of national power: diplomatic, economic and military. In its opening preamble, President Trump asserts that ""the US is leading again on the world stage"". He insists that ""the whole world is lifted by America's renewal and the re-emergence of American leadership"". But he speaks of ""an extraordinarily dangerous world"" where, perhaps in a muted echo of the Cold War, rival powers are ""aggressively undermining American interests around the globe"". Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption Members of the US military attended the speech at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington DC on Monday The document is divided into four broad ""pillars"": the first dealing with ""protecting the American people, the homeland and the American way of life"". This deals with a variety of threats from jihadist terrorism, to cyber security and stresses the need to strengthen border controls and immigration policy - a key theme of Mr Trump's presidential campaign. The next section emphasises the need to ""promote American prosperity"". There is a lot here that is familiar Trump policy - the need to promote fair and reciprocal economic relationships; protecting US technical innovation and rejuvenating the domestic economy. Whatever people's views on the merits or otherwise of Mr Trump's policies, this pillar reflects a fundamental truth: American strength abroad fundamentally rests upon prosperity at home. The third pillar deals with traditional military strength in its conventional, nuclear, cyber and space forces. This is uncompromising on the role of rival powers, noting that ""China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical to US values and interests"". It appears to signal an end to a long-standing approach to Beijing which sought to make China what Americans liked to call ""a responsible stake-holder in international society"". Instead, the new Trump strategy asserts that ""contrary to our hopes, China expanded its power at the expense of the sovereignty of others"". Media caption Trump: China and Russia are US rivals in 'new era of competition' There are some instructive departures from the rhetoric found in the president's tweets. On the US nuclear arsenal, for example, the document says that the ""US does not need to match the nuclear arsenals of other powers"" but that it should ""sustain a stockpile that can deter adversaries"". The final section or pillar on advancing American influence redefines Mr Trump's central credo in surprisingly internationalist terms: ""Our America First foreign policy,"" it asserts, ""celebrates America's influence in the world as a positive force that can help set the conditions for peace and prosperity and for developing successful societies"". It argues that ""allies and partners are a great strength of the United States"". The US, the document asserts, will continue to be engaged abroad, where it serves US interests to counter instability; places like Afghanistan ""where state weaknesses or failure would magnify threats to the American homeland"". So overall then this is a document that, despite the packaging and rhetoric, is less of a departure from established US foreign policy norms than many might have expected. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Key members of Trump's administration attended the speech, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson True key elements of the Obama administration's approach are rejected. There is an antipathy to multilateral trade deals; there is no mention of climate change as a security threat; and there is no aspiration toward a world free of nuclear weapons. But its emphasis upon economic strength as the basis for a strong foreign policy is realistic. Will Donald Trump's policies deliver that strong American economy? Who knows? Footing the bill Projected increases in defence spending are all very well when it is not yet in real money. Budget constraints need to be lifted to give the Pentagon a clear sense of what funding they can expect over a multi-year period. Many experts have told me that having larger forces is not enough - quality matters just as much. The era when the US held an unrivalled technical dominance may be at an end. This document, like all the other strategy documents presented by previous administrations, is a bird's eye view of many complex and inter-locking problems. Much of the detail as to how policies will be enacted is absent. So too is any clear sense of priorities - especially where goals may compete for scarce resources. Indeed there is little on how many of these extravagant ambitions will be funded and delivered. Some aspects of Mr Trump' policies already appear to be working in the opposite direction. The drastic cut-backs happening in the staffing, influence and prestige of the state department surely run counter to a strategy that talks of ""preserving a forward diplomatic presence"". Mr Trump's tax cut plans may increase pressure on an already strained defence budget.",The president's new National Security Strategy aims to enact his America First world vision.,2017-12-18T22:52:24Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Trump's National Security Strategy: A pragmatic view of troubled world,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42406212,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1348/production/_99263940_epatrump.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
Marcus Gilmer,"Sometimes, there is room for levity in life, but a few members of the Tennessee Air National Guard found out the hard way that a reenlistment ceremony is not one of those times. SEE ALSO: Watch Boeing refuel a huge military tanker mid-flight Three members of the Tennessee Air National Guard have been punished after a video they made of a reenlistment ceremony, in which one person is wearing a dinosaur puppet, went viral last weekend. While those outside the service may shrug at the above video and chalk it up to some guardsmen having a little fun, those within the military are furious, deriding the video for what they say is making a mockery of a solemn event. The officer wearing the puppet, Master Sgt. Robin Brown, was participating in an official reenlistment ceremony, Tennessee National Guard public affairs spokesman William Jones told multiple outlets. Why she was wearing the puppet isn't clear; some reports say that she was wearing it for her children when they viewed the video later. Jones told the Washington Post he wasn't sure why she wore it. Reached by phone, a spokesperson at the Tennessee National Guard public affairs office declined to comment as to why she was wearing the puppet. Still, the video was met with fury by leadership. Air National Guard Director Lt. Gen Scott Rice posted a statement on Facebook in which he said, reacting to the outcry over the video, ""I’m equally shocked and dismayed by this event that mocks such a cherished and honorable occasion."" And, on Wednesday, the punishment came down, via a Facebook post by MG Terry M. Haston, the Adjutant General-Tennessee. In his statement, Haston said: I am absolutely embarrassed that a senior officer and a senior NCO took such liberties with a time-honored military tradition. The Tennessee National Guard holds the Oath of Enlistment in the highest esteem because that oath signifies every service member’s commitment to defend our state, nation and the freedoms we all enjoy. Not taking this oath solemnly and with the utmost respect is firmly against the traditions and sanctity of our military family and will not be tolerated. As for punishment, Sgt. Brown was ""removed from her full-time position with the Tennessee Joint Public Affairs Office and other administrative actions are underway."" The unidentified colonel administering the ceremony was demoted a level to lieutenant colonel and ""immediately retired."" A third unidentified Senior NCO (non-commissioned officer), the one filming the ceremony, was ""removed from his position as a unit First Sergeant and has received an official reprimand."" However, Haston notes he will remain with the Guard.","Sometimes, there is room for levity in life, but a few members of the Tennessee Air National Guard found out the hard way that a reenlistment ceremony is not one of those times.

NICHOLAS FANDOS,"Congress did not originally intend to give the president this recourse when it enacted the law during the post-Watergate reform era that has governed how and when presidents may invoke emergency-power statutes. 
But the Supreme Court struck down what it calls legislative vetoes in 1983, ruling that for a congressional act to take legal effect, it must be presented to the president for signature or veto. Because it takes two-thirds of both chambers to override a veto, the ruling made it substantially harder for Congress to stop a presidents declaration.
This is the crucial question. Half a dozen or so Republicans made their disapproval of an emergency declaration clear on Thursday.
I dont believe that the National Emergencies Act contemplated a president repurposing billions of dollars outside the normal appropriations process, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. I also believe it will be challenged in court and is of dubious constitutionality.
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and an ally to the president on other issues, said a national emergency declaration of this sort ran counter to the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, agreed.
My view is that this is better to be resolved through the legislative process, he said.
Still, it is highly unlikely that Democrats can pick up enough Republican supporters in the House or the Senate to override Mr. Trumps likely veto. The best case for the presidents opponents is that they show deep fissures among Republicans over the wall. 
They could also try to build bipartisan support for legislation preventing Mr. Trump from drawing money for the wall from funds allocated by Congress for disaster relief.","Congress has tools to override the president’s declaration, but opponents most likely do not have the votes to overcome a veto.",2019-02-15T01:48:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Will Declare a National Emergency.

JOHN R. ALLEN and DAVID G. VICTOR,"What makes climate change such a pernicious problem is that it increases the odds of those adverse conditions arising especially in places where government already does not function well. When the stress of climate change multiplies, so will the problems the military must handle.
While its always a good idea to look at uncertainties in any scientific assessment, the White House red-teaming is poised to investigate the wrong questions. The scheme, anchored in the climate-denier community, is designed to generate talking points for a president who is skeptical of climate science and thus will focus on whether climate change is happening at all and whether a little warming is all bad news.
A useful red team would investigate uncertainties in the opposite way, by focusing on the evidence that the climate is changing much more rapidly than originally expected. Getting serious about the odds that global warming could be much more harmful than expected could amplify previous assessments for the nations security.
Uncertainty is endemic to climate science because the exact level of future changes in climate are hard to pin down. The pathways that lead from warming to tangible harm to the nations coastlines, crops, military and overseas interests are highly complex. Some of the best scientific studies on these impacts including last falls assessment by 13 federal agencies have begun to look at how uncertainty and complexity interact in ways that make climate dangers look much scarier. Good intelligence estimates must grapple more fully with this as well, but doing that properly will be a lot harder now that the White House is instructing the rest of the government to avoid serious analysis of climate dangers.

Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch,"Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch are the authors of ""The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington,"" which is now available in bookstores everywhere. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.
 (CNN)For the past few years, American politics has been in a state of turmoil. We've endured a version of political leadership characterized by near-constant outrage, bombast, bragging, personal attacks and the brazen flaunting of power. The national discourse seems fueled by insults and rage. And public faith in our institutions is eroding fast.
We're a long way from the leadership of George Washington, whose very name evokes American patriotism and power. His stereotypical image is one of a strong, formidable leader who gave us -- and made us -- our best. 
In researching ""The First Conspiracy,"" a book about a secret plot to kill George Washington during the Revolutionary War, what struck us most -- and what made us reflect most deeply on the politics of today -- was not his strength. Instead, it was a different set of qualities: modesty, humility and selflessness -- even when those closest to Washington plotted against him. 
In 1776, powerful British sympathizers in the colonies hatched a plot against Washington -- some say to kidnap him; others say to kill him. Either way, George Washington's life was in danger. The plot itself was led by Governor of New York William Tryon, but the most surprising turn came when Washington's elite unit of soldiers -- his trusted bodyguards, also known as ""Life Guards"" -- turned against him. They were supposed to be the best of the best. Indeed, Washington personally selected these men.
It was a handful of these Life Guards who switched sides and joined the Loyalist conspiracy. How did Washington react when he learned about this plot? He didn't rant and rave. Instead, he helped launch a methodical and top secret investigation.
Rather than focus on himself or even on the enemies who might have killed him, he focused on maintaining the army's morale and reputation in the face of a potential scandal. After a court martial, one of the conspiring soldiers was hanged in front of 20,000 witnesses. But ultimately it was Washington's measured and calm response, while his life was in danger no less, that helped him prevail after this potentially devastating threat to his leadership.
Washington's modesty and selflessness were in evidence from the beginning of his public career. In May 1775, when he arrived in the city of Philadelphia as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Washington was a 43-year-old Virginia landowner not well known outside his home colony. He was thrust into a position of national significance because he possessed something almost every other delegate lacked: military experience. He was one of a few potential candidates to create and lead an army in a brewing war with England. Suddenly, everyone was studying this Virginian closely.
A physically striking man, Washington carried himself with the poise of a former military officer. But what almost every delegate noticed most about him was how modest and gracious he was. In a chamber where many were competing to talk the most and the loudest, Washington spoke quietly. More often, he listened.
When it came time for the delegates to formally select who would take command of the army, Washington's modesty took on an almost comic dimension. When his name was announced as a candidate, he literally fled the chamber, to prevent even the appearance of vanity. John Adams, who nominated him, remembered the moment: ""Mr. Washington, who happened to sit near the door, as soon as he heard me allude to him, from his usual modesty darted into the library room."" 
When Washington received the command, his words of acceptance were almost entirely self-effacing: ""I beg it may be remembered, by every gentleman in the room, that I, this day, declare with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with.""
Was Washington's restraint and modesty an indication of weakness? On the contrary, it was precisely these qualities, combined with a tireless work ethic and an unmistakable dedication to his army, that earned him almost universal respect.
Arguably, Washington's greatest achievement of the Revolutionary era did not come on the battlefield. In 1783, after almost eight years of fighting, the mighty British army finally surrendered to Washington's forces, and the question now for the colonies was: what should happen next?
At this moment, some believed that Washington himself should seize power from the Congress and, backed by his army, become the self-appointed leader of the colonies. One officer suggested he declare himself king; or, if that term was distasteful, to choose a different word, but wield equivalent power. 
In the late eighteenth century, such a power grab by a conquering military leader was the most expected outcome. How would Washington meet this moment?
He voluntarily ceded his power -- and retired.
When King George III of England learned of this, he reportedly said ""if he does that, he must be the greatest man in the world."" 
The general's retirement was short-lived. In 1789, he was elected the first president. One of his first gestures was to reject the address of ""His Highness"" or ""His Excellency;"" instead he chose the more democratic ""Mr. President."" After two terms, he voluntarily left office, setting the precedent for term limits and the peaceful transition of power. 
Modesty, humility and selflessness -- remember when those were American values?
As the nation's first chief executive, Washington set the standard of not just a humble president, but a humble presidency -- an office meant to serve the public, not to serve itself. 
Which brings us to today. For the past few years, America has endured a political climate that is the opposite of Washington's modest ideal. In the midst of this turmoil, it's worth reconsidering a return to those simple virtues of modesty, humility and selflessness, embodied by the great leaders in America's history -- starting with our first.","Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch write that in the midst of the current political turmoil, it's worth considering a return to the simple virtues of modesty, humility and selflessness, embodied by George Washington.",2019-01-08T12:37:57Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",George Washington can lead us out of our national turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/08/opinions/george-washington-model-in-humility-meltzer-mensch/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190107152122-george-washinton-1780-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,National,1

SEE ALSO: Venezuela to launch 'petro', a cryptocurrency backed by oil and other reserves Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro initially announced Petro in December 2017, planning an offering of 100 million Petro tokens, valued at $6 million American dollars. In the pre-sale, Venezuela made 82.4 million coins available. It has reportedly already drawn investment from Turkey, Qatar, and other Middle Eastern countries. It will go on sale to the public in the coming month. The Venezuelan government has published a guide to Petro including its history, goals, and purchase instructions. Petro was built on the Ethereum blockchain. In order to purchase Petro, buyers will have to get a digital Petro wallet. The government says it will be redeemable for other cryptocurrencies or state-backed currencies like the American dollar — though not in Venezuela's own struggling Bolivar. After four years of a worsening economic crisis, the Petro could be one way for Venezuela to circumvent American and European sanctions that prohibit traditional investment in the country due to its authoritarian regime. But speculation abounds regarding both the validity of the Petro as a digital currency, and its ability to help the Venezuelan economy, and people. Though the Petro's value is tied to crude oil, it doesn't actually translate to ownership of any concrete assets. And its link with oil is worrisome in its own right, since some credit the collapse of the Venezuelan economy in large part to plummeting global oil prices. Then there's concern about the actual usefulness of the Petro to the Venezuelan people. The government says that citizens will be able to use the Petro to pay ""national taxes, fees, contributions and public services."" But with access limited to those who acquire a Petro wallet, no guarantee of the Petro's acceptance in other crypto and financial markets, and the currency's inability to transfer into Venezuela's own Bolivar, it's unclear how citizens could come to use and benefit from it in everyday life. But as CNBC points out, the Petro could provide a test-case for other nations with economies struggling due to sanctions — most notably, Russia. It remains to be seen whether the Petro is a revolutionary game changer — as its backing government says — or a speculative scam. Maybe best to stick with Bananacoin for now.","The bleeding Venezuelan economy is pinning its hopes on cryptocurrency.

PETER H. SCHUCK,"In the nature of national emergencies, some definitional leeways are unavoidable. But Congress could readily specify certain conditions that must exist before the president can make such a declaration and thus arrogate to himself extraordinary powers curtailing liberties, seizing property, spending funds appropriated for other purposes and suspending protective laws that Congress would not otherwise be likely to grant him in advance, or perhaps ever. (Indeed, Congress has the power to override Mr. Trump's declaration and it should in this case though it probably wont.)
One can easily specify some of the factors in a national emergency condition that any responsible Congress would insist on before allowing such a declaration to take effect: magnitude (the feared incremental harms of the condition are very large, not just marginal); geographic scope (those harms should be nationwide even if the triggering condition is more localized); extraordinary (the condition should be rare, if not unprecedented); imminence (the anticipated harms should be so close in time that Congress cannot deliberate); and likely effectiveness (the presidents action should promise to substantially solve the problem).
Reasonable people may disagree, of course, about precisely how Congress should define and weigh these factors, how they should be applied to the facts on the ground and whether other factors should be considered. President Trumps wall cannot survive such a rigorous analysis: Even assuming that recent illegal border crossings harm the nation, they are not greater (indeed, they are probably fewer) than in recent decades; Congress has been deliberating (in its fashion) for decades about immigration reform, including border walls; and many Americans believe that the wall would be ineffective and a bad idea. Congress simply disagrees with the president about which border security measures would do the job an instance of decidedly normal politics.
But my larger claim that Congresss delegation to presidents of vast, essentially unconstrained power to declare national emergencies has been an irresponsible surrender of its constitutional responsibilities does not depend on whether my assessment of this particular case is correct. Not since the New Deal has the Supreme Court struck down a statute for this kind of standardless delegation of legislative authority to administrative agencies, but the Roberts court activist, conservative and suspicious of broad delegations of power to agencies recently reached out to review a case, Gundy v. United States, that gives it an opportunity to revive the long-dormant and doubtful non-delegation doctrine.
Another way to make the National Emergencies Act more compatible with the rule of law is through a procedure that would broaden participation in all future decisions to declare national emergencies. Under one such reform, the president would have to consult with the leaders of both parties in Congress before issuing a declaration. Even if Congress could not override such a declaration, members would have to take a public position on the facts and reasons invoked as justification by the president. If time were of the essence (not so in this case; Congress has legislated about a wall for more than a decade), their responses would have to be expedited. With such a procedure in place, judicial review of the declaration could be narrow, if at all.",The fact that the president may have the authority to throw away billions on a foolish campaign promise is itself scandalous.,2019-02-14T23:45:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Real Problem With Trump’s National Emergency Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/opinion/trump-national-emergency.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/opinion/15schuck/merlin_150647961_acfd948c-d3e2-4bce-9a6d-556fbeb1eb98-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1

LIAM STACK,"Ms. Love raised the money during the primary period, even though she knew she would have no primary challenger after she won the nomination at the party convention in April. Her campaign called the complaint completely false and desperate but agreed to redesignate $372,000 for her general election campaign and pay back up to $10,000. Ms. Loves unique profile daughter of Haitian immigrants, a convert to the Mormon Church and the only Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus presented a challenge to Democrats who sought to depict her as a Trump loyalist. She did not enlist the presidents help in her campaign, which he seemed to interpret as a snub. At a televised news conference the day after votes were cast, Mr. Trump attacked Republicans who lost their seats for what he saw as their insufficient support of him and his agenda. The result of Ms. Loves race was still days from being called, but Mr. Trump scornfully lumped her in with the losers anyway. Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost, Mr. Trump told reporters. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia. Mr. McAdams rode to victory in the Fourth District which includes a slice of progressive Salt Lake City but extends south to incorporate a string of more conservative cities and towns in Juab, Sanpete and Utah Counties in part thanks to his record as mayor of Salt Lake County, which covers 85 percent of the district. The city has emerged as a progressive oasis in recent years, and Mr. McAdams has positioned himself as a centrist able to meet the needs of its disparate constituencies. They include immigrants, gay people, religious conservatives, tech employees and investors arriving from out of state. Mr. McAdams became well known for negotiating a deal among Republicans, religious leaders and the gay community on a nondiscrimination ordinance, and worked with Republicans in the State Legislature to alleviate homelessness in the region. As part of that effort, Mr. McAdams secretly posed as a homeless man for three days. For her part, Ms. Love portrayed Mr. McAdams as the politician who was out of touch with the district, casting him as a liberal supporter of Hillary Clinton and abortion rights who would not represent the wishes of Utahns in Congress.

"Augusta Anthony, CNN","(CNN)On a rainy Saturday in Philadelphia, as the partial government shutdown continued, volunteers picked up trash outside Independence Hall, birthplace of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
Across the country, dozens of their colleagues in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association were doing the same at national parks closed or partially closed by the shutdown. They cleaned up litter, emptied garbage cans and swept the grounds -- from the Everglades National Park in Florida to Joshua Tree, California and the Cuyahoga Valley, Ohio.
The group hit the National Mall in Washington on Sunday morning. 
""Service to our nation and cleanliness are important parts of Islam,"" said Dr. Madeel Abdullah, president of youth group, in a press release. ""We could not sit idly by as our national parks collected trash. We will lead by example and dispose of this garbage appropriately and invite all Americans to join us in these parks and others across the nation.""
Group members were joined by people from the general public who contacted the group through social media, spokesperson Salaam Bhatti told CNN, adding that the response to their efforts has been ""overwhelmingly positive.""
Bhatti said members regularly participate in community cleanups, carried out as part of their faith. The group has logged almost 200,000 hours in clean-up projects since 2016, according to Bhatti. 
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association is the largest of its kind in the US, with more than 70 chapters and 5,000 members, all males aged 7 to 40.
Bhatti said more than 60 percent of Americans do not personally know a Muslim, and community efforts like these increase dialogue with members of other religious groups.
""I hope it shows that we're not here just to talk about Islam the whole time,"" Bhatti said. ""We're here to be part of America."" 
National Parks have been largely closed to the public since the shutdown began December 22. In a press release Sunday, the National Park Service said it had ""explored a number of options to address the maintenance and sanitation issues that have arisen at a number of highly visited parks,"" and will now use fee revenues to clean up trash and restrooms.
""We are taking this extraordinary step to ensure that parks are protected, and that visitors can continue to access parks with limited basic services,"" the statement said.
Bhatti told CNN that if the shutdown continues, they will be looking for other national parks to help clear and for more ways they can help community members affected by the shutdown.
An important part of Islam is to help ""wipe away the tears of our neighbors during time of distress,"" he said. ""We are humbly serving our nation at a time when many tears are being shed.""","On a rainy Saturday in Philadelphia, as the partial government shutdown continued, volunteers picked up trash outside Independence Hall, birthplace of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.",2019-01-06T20:11:30Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Muslim youth group cleans up national parks during shutdown,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/06/cnn10/muslim-youth-clean-national-parks-shutdown/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190106194941-02-muslim-youth-group-clean-up-national-parks-during-government-shutdown-01072019-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,National,1
Maya MacGuineas,"Maya MacGuineas is the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget advisory group in Washington, D.C. The views expressed are her own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) As a result of an unprecedented debt binge by Congress over the past year, the national debt is about to roar back to life as a pressing issue after years of hibernation. In 2010, it was among the nation's top concerns. President Obama created a bipartisan national fiscal commission to come up with a plan to address it, but a big agreement ultimately failed. The debt didn't go away. It has been growing by the second ever since, and the dominoes are about to start falling. The recent GOP tax cuts and bipartisan spending increases together will add $2.3 trillion to the national debt in the next10 years. If both are made permanent, that amount goes up to $5.1 trillion. And President Trump is already considering another $100 billion of capital-gains tax cuts. These sums accelerate a coming fiscal freefall and will push the nation over a psychological barrier as soon as next year: trillion-dollar annual deficits. The last time we had trillion-dollar deficits was during the Great Recession, and it was the understandable outcome of a huge economic downturn. This time it is purely self-imposed, resulting from irresponsible policy choices. And Washington is responding to trillion-dollar deficits by increasing them further with more plans for tax cuts and spending, with nary a peep about how to pay for them. Several weeks ago, the Congressional Budget Office laid bare in its annual long-term outlook the dire picture, and the next 15 years won't be pretty. Here is how it will play out, if nothing is done. In 2022, the Highway Trust Fund will run out of full funding. In 2026, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund follows. In 2032, the Social Security trust fund surpluses run dry, and all beneficiaries regardless of age or income level will face a 21 percent across-the-board benefit cut. Before 2030, we could have trillion-dollar annual interest payments. Interest rates have been low until now, but that is changing. As rates go up, we have to pay more on new debt and on all accumulated debt. The amount we pay in interest on the debt is set to triple over the next ten years. But if interest rates rise just 1 point higher than expected, the government will owe an extra $1.9 trillion over 10 years. This is a multi-trillion dollar problem, one hard to even quantify. And Congress recently couldn't even agree to cut $1 billion of unspent federal money, which amounted to loose change in the sofa cushions in terms of the federal budget. These aren't just eye-popping numbers -- there are real, heartfelt consequences for average Americans. High debt pushes up interest rates, which translates to higher payments on mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt. Because debt is rising, rather than stable, in 30 years, a family with a $300,000 mortgage can expect to pay approximately $45,000 more over the course of the mortgage. Interest also means less money for the rest of the federal budget. By 2023, we'll spend more on interest payments than Medicaid or defense. All priorities of all politicians will fall victim. The federal assistance that states rely on will be increasingly uncertain, and social safety net programs will be under pressure. When the debt doomsday actually arrives is anyone's guess. We are entering uncharted waters. The highest the national debt has ever been as a share of the economy is 106 percent -- immediately after World War II. We are on track to surpass that in 16 years, and debt will overtake the size of the entire economy as soon as 2027. At the turn of the 21st century, we were on track to actually pay off the debt. Then there was a massive terror attack, two wars, tax cuts and new spending programs, a Great Recession and multiple natural disasters. During a strong economy, we should be preparing for future events such as those, not pushing the credit card to the limit. One thing is for sure -- Washington needs to grow up. Stop the demagoguery. Make some adult decisions. These numbers are so large that the solution cannot be solely spending cuts or tax increases. Both parties will need to compromise to find a path forward.","Maya MacGuineas writes that the US could soon face trillion dollar deficits, potentially crippling entitlement programs like Social Security thanks to Donald Trump's tax cuts.",2018-07-31T22:03:12Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",National debt is back as a pressing issue,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/opinions/barreling-toward-trillion-dollar-deficits-macguineas/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131016164211-capiton-green-light-story-top.jpg,cnn,CNN,National,1
DAVE MONTGOMERY and MANNY FERNANDEZ,"National Guard troops have been deploying to the southern border for decades after orders by presidents and governors from both parties. In 2010, the Democratic governor of New Mexico at the time, Bill Richardson, ordered a few dozen troops to his state’s border with Mexico after the killing of an Arizona rancher. But Mr. Trump’s mobilization, which could deploy thousands of troops, has reignited concerns in Texas and elsewhere about the militarization of border communities and has angered local officials and lawmakers who say that the troops are not needed and that they give the false impression that their cities are under siege. “It sounds to me more like political rhetoric than something that is actually needed on our border,” said Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat whose district includes the border city of McAllen. “For example, McAllen is at a 32-year low in crime. We’re at a 46-year low in illegal entries. It’s the wildest thing in the world for us to hear that they want to bring National Guard troops to the border region.” Mr. Trump and federal officials said the troops were needed to help the United States Border Patrol address what Mr. Trump said was a growing threat of unauthorized immigrants, drugs and crime from Central America. General Norris said on Friday that the troops would be armed for self-defense “depending on the mission set,” and that it was “premature right now to know what the cost will be” of the overall operation. The deployment is a federal initiative that will be managed by the state, a hybrid known as Title 32. In that capacity, a governor retains control of the National Guard troops but the federal government finances the operation. General Norris said that in addition to the 250 troops being deployed in the coming days, an unknown number of others would likely be called up as part of a “follow-on phase.” The response from Texas officials, coming just three days after Mr. Trump called for militarizing the border, was no surprise. Republican leaders in Texas have been outspoken in condemning cartel-related crime, drugs, violence and human smuggling on the border. In fact, they had moved to put the National Guard on the border years ago. Even as Mr. Trump announced his mobilization this week, the Texas National Guard already had about 100 troops at the border, as part of a state border-security operation that began in 2014. Texas officials dispatched 1,000 National Guard troops to the border because they said drug cartels were taking advantage of the federal government’s focus on the tens of thousands of Central Americans flooding the border at the time. The deployment was meant to “help combat the brutal Mexican drug cartels that are preying upon our communities,” Rick Perry, then the governor, said in 2014. The 2014 deployment was supposed to end the following year, but the mobilization was extended by Mr. Perry’s successor, Greg Abbott. State lawmakers said last year that the cost for the National Guard deployment and Texas Military Forces expenses on the border was nearly $63 million. The 100 National Guard troops who have been at the border play a supporting role to state and federal law enforcement, acting, as state officials describe it, as a “force multiplier.” “We stand ready to support the needs of the state and the nation at the request of the governor or the president,” Lt. Col. Travis Walters, a spokesman for the Texas Military Department, the agency that oversees the state’s National Guard branches, said in a statement. Dave Montgomery reported from Austin, Tex., and Manny Fernandez from Houston. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting from Washington.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright ROYAL COMMISSION INTO CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE Image caption Messages from survivors were published by the inquiry last year Survivors of child sexual abuse in Australia are gathering to hear a national apology. Hundreds of victims and their supporters have arrived in Canberra for the apology, to be given by Prime Minister Scott Morrison in parliament. It follows a five-year inquiry which found tens of thousands of children had suffered abuse in Australian institutions over decades. The government described the findings as a ""national tragedy"". The inquiry, which concluded last December, heard more than 8,000 testimonies from victims about abuse in organisations such as churches, schools and sports clubs. On Monday, Mr Morrison is expected to acknowledge their suffering as well as failures by institutions to protect them. He will also announce the creation of a museum of remembrance to raise awareness about the impacts of abuse, Australian media reported. Support groups said victims and their supporters had travelled from around the nation to hear the apology. ""They are coming with very heavy hearts,"" said Leonie Sheedy, the chief executive of Care Leavers Australasia Network. ""It is a wonderful thing our country's apologising, but there is so much more work to be done."" Many survivors have criticised the government's response to the inquiry - especially over the terms of a national compensation scheme. Victims are eligible to apply for payments of up to A$150,000 (£80,000; $106,000) each.

Katia Hetter,"(CNN) — Yellowstone, Yosemite and the entire country of Switzerland would fit inside the United States ' largest national park, a 13.2 million-acre expanse in Alaska. And it would take about 2,400 of the smallest of the 60 headliner national parks to fill the biggest park's pristine, mountainous terrain. Elsewhere in Alaska, climbing North America's tallest peak takes trained mountaineers two to four weeks, round trip, while visitors to the world's hottest spot -- which is also North America's lowest and driest spot -- are advised to ""travel prepared to survive."" The world's longest contiguous cave system isn't yet completely explored, and it may never be. All these wonders are protected within 417 national park sites spanning more than 84 million acres, all overseen by the US National Park Service in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In honor of the National Park Service's centennial on August 25, 2016, CNN explored 10 record-setting spots, now protected because of legislation passed 100 years ago to preserve the nation's natural and cultural treasures for current and future generations. 1. Largest national park site Wrangell-St. Elias National Park &amp; Preserve, Alaska Yellowstone National Park, the world's first national park and a UNESCO World Heritage site, is enormous. But the 2.2 million-acre Yellowstone doesn't even come close to the nation's largest national park, the remote Wrangell-St. Elias National Park &amp; Preserve in Alaska. It would take six Yellowstones to fill Wrangell-St. Elias' 13.2 million acres. Wrangell-St. Elias is also home to the nation's largest glacial system, nine of the 16 highest US peaks, North America's largest piedmont glacier and longest tidewater glacier and the world's longest interior valley glacier. More than 25% of Wrangell-St. Elias is covered by glaciers, which could explain why this park 200 miles east of Anchorage hosted just 80,000 visitors in 2015. The best time to visit is summer. Snow often arrives in the park by late September, and the two state roads into the park are not regularly maintained during winter. 2. Smallest national park site Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas Hot Springs is the smallest of the 60 national parks in the country. The Arkansas park is so small -- just 5,550 acres -- that it could fit into Wrangell-St. Elias National Park nearly 2,400 times. It would also likely melt its Alaskan cousin: That's due to the park's 47 hot springs coming out of Hot Springs Mountain at 143° Fahrenheit (62° Celsius). It was first protected as a reservation in 1832 because of the popularity of its geothermal spring water for therapeutic bathing. Many businesses set up around Hot Springs to provide access to the waters, and the urban park protects the historic bathhouse structures as well as the waters. Visitors can soak in the traditional Buckstaff Baths (a park concessionaire) and the more modern Quapaw Baths &amp; Spa. Both are on Bathhouse Row, as is the park visitor center in the old Fordyce Bathhouse. 3. Longest cave system in the world Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky Called a ""grand, gloomy and peculiar place"" by early cave guide Stephen Bishop, a slave who eventually gained his freedom, the world's longest known cave system earns its name honestly. Located in the hill country of south-central Kentucky, Mammoth Cave National Park has more than 400 miles of explored and mapped caves, and more are being documented every year. Much of the early credit goes to enslaved and eventually free African-Americans, who explored and led tours through the caves throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Frozen Niagara is one of a few guided tours to welcome small children, the elderly and people who can only walk short distances, while others are more challenging. 4. Tallest monument in the United States Gateway Arch in St. Louis It's known more famously as the St. Louis Arch, but the 630-foot monument that anchors the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial is officially called the Gateway Arch. And yes, it's taller than the 555-foot-tall Washington Monument in the nation's capital. The Gateway Arch marks the role of St. Louis in the country's westward expansion in the 19th century. Although named for President Thomas Jefferson and his role in expanding the young country, the park is also a memorial to the enslaved man Dred Scott, who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom in the Old Courthouse. World renowned architect Eero Saarinen, who had collaborated with his architect father on several projects, entered the 1947 memorial competition independently and won. It was his first major success, but certainly not his last. A tram ride to the top of the arch's observation deck delivers a spectacular view of the city. 5. Deepest lake in the United States Crater Lake National Park, Oregon Stack up about three Gateway Arches and you've got the depth of the United States' deepest lake. For hundreds of thousands of years, volcanic eruptions here built up Mount Mazama. Nearly 8,000 years ago, an eruption removed so much material from the mountain's internal chamber that the mountain collapsed. The remaining caldera, now 1,943 feet deep, is the deepest lake in the United States and the ninth deepest in the world. The 1.1-mile hike descends 700 feet down to the lakeshore, which is the only spot where visitors can swim. It's chilly, though. The average summer surface temperature is just 55°F to 60°F (13°C to 16°C). If that's not cold enough, the average temperature below 300 feet deep is 38°F (3°C). 6. Tallest peak in North America Denali, Denali National Park &amp; Preserve, Alaska Climbing Denali is not for the faint of heart. At 20,310 feet high, the highest peak in North America dwarfs Mount Whitney at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks by 5,900 feet. It's not as strenuous as the hike to the world's highest peak, the 29,029-foot-high Mount Everest in Asia, but climbing Denali is no easy feat. Hiking for days in arctic conditions, carrying backpacks weighing up to 70 pounds while pulling heavily loaded sleds to summit this Alaskan peak for expeditions lasting up to four weeks are all par for the course. Once known as Mount McKinley, the official name of the highest peak in North America was restored in 2015 to Denali, the Native Athabascan name it held for thousands of years. Ohio-born President William McKinley never visited the mountain, which most Alaskans, native and non-native alike, have always called Denali. The summit often disappears behind clouds but is occasionally visible while driving along the 92-mile Denali Park Road, the only road in the park. 7. The lowest spot in North America Death Valley National Park, California The lowest point in North America -- 282 feet below sea level -- is also the hottest spot in the world. Death Valley National Park logged a record 134°F (57°C) in 1913, and the park hasn't cooled down much since then. High temperatures are expected to range from 100°F to over 120°F (49°C) in August, which is a normal summer for this long narrow valley walled in by mountain ranges. And there's no water to spare. The park is also the driest spot in North Ameica, with an average annual rainfall of less than 2 inches That's much less than what other deserts receive. Sometimes the park warns against summer hiking after 10 a.m. due to the heat. Even before the cutoff time, ""travel prepared to survive,"" warns the park. Lots of water and sunscreen are in order for visitors heading to Badwater Basin in the Furnace Creek area, where the park drops to 282 feet below sea level. Too extreme? Spring and winter are supposed to be nice. 8. The world's largest living tree (by volume) General Sherman, Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks, California Among the renowned groves of massive giant sequoias, one tree stands out. The largest tree in the world by volume (over 52,500 cubic feet), the General Sherman Tree is the main attraction in Sequoia National Park. Its circumference at the ground is a whopping 102.6 feet and the largest branch has a diameter of nearly 7 feet. The General Grant Tree, located about 30 miles away in Kings Canyon National Park, is the world's second largest tree by volume, measuring over 46,600 cubic feet. (The two national parks are managed together.) They're the largest, but not the tallest. That honor goes to the redwood trees. 9. Highest continuous paved US road Trail Ridge Road, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado Intrepid motorists are richly rewarded on Rocky Mountain National Park's Trail Ridge Road, the highest continuous paved road in the United States. Topping out at 12,183 feet, the byway snakes through fragile alpine tundra, giving visitors a chance to witness the unique ecosystem without the huffing and puffing of high-elevation hiking. Eleven miles of the 48-mile route traverse wide-open expanses above the treeline, where at 11,500 feet evergreen forests give way to 200 species of ground-hugging alpine plants. Yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, pika and summering elk go about their business as breathless tourists open their car doors at the Alpine Visitor Center, the highest visitor center in the park system, to blasts of cool air. Temperatures at the road's blustery summit are usually 20 to 30 degrees lower than they are at the road's bookends in Grand Lake and Estes Park. 10. Busiest national park Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina The half-million acre park, split fairly evenly between the states of North Carolina and Tennessee, is home to flora and fauna found in both the northern and southern states. Northern animals and vegetation can be found at the park's higher elevations, while their Southern brethren are represented at the lower elevations. Many hikers on the Appalachian Trail walk the border between the two states on the trail through the park. Some prefer to catch the view from Clingmans Dome at 6,643 feet or hike up one of the 16 mountains with peaks taller than 6,000 feet. At more than half a million acres, there's plenty of room to spread out. And if you're looking for something a little less discovered, there are still 412 other National Park Service sites to explore.

JULIA JACOBS,"Rangers were called to a hotel in the park because Mr. Reinke was causing a disturbance by arguing with another guest in the dining room, the news release said, before they realized it was the same man wanted by Yellowstone law enforcement. By this time, the hotel bar had already stopped serving Mr. Reinke, said Lauren Alley, a spokeswoman for Glacier National Park. On July 28, rangers arrested Mr. Reinke at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming for drunk and disorderly conduct, according to the news release. He spent the night in jail then was released on bond. On Tuesday, rangers at Yellowstone stopped the vehicle Mr. Reinke was in for a traffic violation and cited him for failing to wear a seatbelt. Mr. Reinke appeared “intoxicated and argumentative,” the news release said. Later, Mr. Reinke decided to tease the bison, prompting several reports of wildlife harassment from other visitors. Mr. Reinke was issued a citation, but after rangers saw the viral video and connected him to the earlier debauchery in Wyoming, a warrant was issued for his arrest on Thursday. He was arrested that night at the hotel and was booked into a Yellowstone jail in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyo. In addition to disturbing wildlife, Mr. Reinke faces several other charges, including being intoxicated to a degree that endangers himself or others, unreasonable noise and keeping an open container of alcohol in a vehicle, according to court documents. Efforts to reach him for comment on Friday night were unsuccessful. At Mr. Reinke’s court appearance on Friday, a judge ordered that he be held in jail until his next court appearance, which is set for Wednesday.","A man was caught on video taunting a bison at Yellowstone National Park earlier this week.

The world's richest man, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, has accused the National Enquirer's owner of trying to blackmail him over lewd pictures.
Mr Bezos said the magazine's parent company American Media Inc (AMI) wanted him to drop an investigation into how it obtained his private messages.
Mr Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, said last month they were getting divorced.
Their announcement came just before the National Enquirer carried reports about the tech titan's extramarital affair.
AMI has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.

What does Bezos claim?
In a stunning blog post on Thursday, Mr Bezos posted an email he said had been sent to his intermediaries by AMI's representatives threatening to publish ""intimate photos"" of Mr Bezos and his lover, former TV host Lauren Sanchez.
The billionaire, who also owns the Washington Post, said AMI had wanted him to make a ""false public statement"" that the National Enquirer's coverage of him and his mistress was not politically motivated.
""Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,"" wrote Mr Bezos, ""I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.""
Early in the blog post, Mr Bezos mentions AMI's links to President Donald Trump.

 Former TV host Lauren Sanchez is reported to be in a relationship with Mr Bezos
Why does he mention President Trump?
Mr Bezos said his ownership of the Washington Post was a ""complexifier"" for him because he had made enemies of ""certain powerful people"", including President Donald Trump, who is a friend of AMI's boss David Pecker.
AMI recently admitted it had co-ordinated with the Trump presidential campaign to pay a Playboy model $150,000 (£115,000) in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr Trump.
Mr Bezos notes in his blog post how the publisher confessed to the so-called ""catch and kill"" deal to bury Karen McDougal's politically embarrassing story.
AMI's agreement to co-operate with federal authorities means it will not face criminal charges over the payments, Manhattan prosecutors announced in December.
Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen - who facilitated the hush money at the direction, he says, of Mr Trump - has already admitted violating campaign finance laws.","Jeff Bezos says National Enquirer attempted extortion by threatening to publish ""intimate photos"".",2019-02-08T01:02:34Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Jeff Bezos: Amazon boss accuses National Enquirer of blackmail,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47166938,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/082F/production/_105559020_bezos.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
MJ Franklin,"On Wednesday, March 14, students all over the United States are leaving their classrooms for a National School Walkout to protest gun violence. The National School Walkout is the latest protest in a string of demonstrations — along with March 24th's March for Our Lives and April 20th's National School Walkout — designed to highlight the prevalence of gun violence and its effects. SEE ALSO: These celebrities are getting behind March for Our Lives ""Students and staff have the right to teach and learn in an environment free from the worry of being gunned down in their classrooms,"" the National School Walkout explains. ""Parents have the right to send their kids to school in the mornings and see them home alive at the end of the day."" With the demonstration fast approaching, you may be wondering when exactly the walkout is and how can you participate. So here is everything you need to know about March 14th's National School Walkout. What is the National School Walkout? The National School Walkout is a student-led protest against gun violence and policies that enable gun violence. For the protest, students all over the country are walking out of their classrooms for 17 minutes to raise awareness of gun issues. The number 17 is significant because it is designed to highlight the 17 students killed at the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Feb. 14. When is the walkout happening? The National Walkout is taking place on Wednesday, March 14th at 10 a.m. local time. That date is also important because it marks the one month anniversary of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The National School Walkout is just one of many student-led demonstrations that protest gun violence. Image: SAMUEL CORUM/ANADOLU AGENCY/GETTY IMAGES Who started it? The National School Walkout was organized by Empower, a coalition of teen activists from all over the country. You may have actually heard of Empower before — it's the Women's March 's youth organization. ""We believe, as youth, it is imperative we have spaces where our voices are being heard. We DON’T need adults speaking on our behalf,"" Empower says. Why are students protesting? The National School Walkout is designed to protest all forms of gun violence against all people. ""We are walking out for ALL people who have experienced gun violence, including systemic forms of gun violence that disproportionately impact teens in black and brown communities,"" Empower writes on the National Walkout's FAQ page. ""It is important that when we refer to gun violence, we do not overlook the impact of police brutality and militarized policing, or see police in schools as a solution. We also recognize the United States has exported gun violence through imperialist foreign policy to destabilize other nations."" What are the demands of the demonstration? Along with highlighting gun violence, the National School Walkout's goal is to put pressure on Congress to take action to pass gun reform. With this goal in mind, the National School Walkout has a list of demands for congress: ban assault weapons; ban high capacity magazines; expand background checks to all gun sales; pass federal gun violence restraining order laws; fund government research on gun violence; and promote safe storage. You can learn more about the list of demands here. Protesters in Florida call for gun reform after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month. Image: JOE RAEDLE/GETTY IMAGES How you can participate One of the goals for the National Walkout is to be inclusive of students everywhere. As such, there a few simple ways to participate. Firstly, if you're a student, the National Walkout encourages you to walk out of your classroom for the 17 minutes at 10 a.m. If walking outside is not a safe option, The National School Walkout encourages students to congregate in their hallways, school gym, or stand up in their classrooms during the 17 minutes of the protest. The National School Walkout also makes clear: work with your school for the protest. ""Have conversations with your school administration or school resource officer to help determine best practices that take into account the safety of all students."" In addition to ensuring safety, communicating with your school before the walkout will also give all parties an understanding of what the walkout is, and if there will be any consequences to the protest, such as suspensions or detentions. If you want to know your rights as a protestor, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and the National Coalition Against Censorship worked together to create a helpful comic that outlines the dos and don'ts of protesting, as well as what protections the First Amendment assures. You can read and learn more about the comic here. If you're a college student but you don't have class on March 14 at 10 a.m., you can still participate by joining your peers on campus. ""We are encouraging college students who do not have class at 10 a.m. to hold a campus action in a central student area,"" Empower advises. One of the goals for the National School Walkout is to be inclusive of students everywhere. As for adults, the movement is very specific: only students, school staff, or adults invited by the school's administration should walk out of their classroom and join students for the day of protest. ""This is an important safety precaution we must take in order to help ensure the safety of students and staff,"" Empower explains. However, Empower says if you're an adult, there are a few ways to participate. First, you can walk out of your place of work for 17 minutes. Second, you can wear orange, the official color of the movement, for the day. And most importantly, the protest is non-violent. ""By choosing to organize an event with WM Youth Empower, you are committing to acting nonviolently, working to de-escalate confrontations with others, and following the instructions of authorized event marshals,"" Empower says on their Action Network page, where students can register their walkout. And of course, all people are encouraged to spread the word about their demonstration with the hashtag #ENOUGH on social media.","On Wednesday, March 14, students all over the United States are leaving their classrooms for a National School Walkout to protest gun violence.

DAVID BROOKS,"That left a spiritual vacuum, he believed. Americans had no way to see how their daily exertions contributed to a common spiritual cause. They saw no way to achieve individual salvation through community effort. America has created a brilliant political constitution, Whitman wrote. It has amassed untold wealth. But it has not created a democratic culture that captures, celebrates and ennobles the way average Americans live day to day. “The problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and religious, and is to be finally met and treated by literature.” When there is no common sense of mystical purpose, you end up with alienation, division, distrust, “universal ennui,” a loss of faith in the American project. “Never was there, perhaps, more hollowness at heart than at present, and here in the United States,” he observed. Photo Walt Whitman, circa 1860. Credit Library of Congress Whitman was not, however, pessimistic. He had worked as a nurse during the Civil War, watching men recover and die, and the experience had given him illimitable faith in the goodness of average citizens. Average American soldiers showed more fortitude, religious devotion and grandeur than all the storybook heroes, he wrote. They died not for glory, nor even to repel invasion, but out of gratitude to have been included in the American experiment. They died “for an emblem, a mere abstraction — for the life, the safety of the flag.” Whitman spent his life trying to spiritualize democratic life and reshape the American imagination, to help working people see the epic heroism all around them that unites the American spirit. He didn’t mind a little healthy rudeness, what we would call the politically incorrect. He thought that the cause of democracy is sometimes aided not by “the best men only, but sometimes more by those that provoke it — by the combats they arouse.” And above all, he pointed out that the American experiment is young. It is just getting started. “Thus we presume to write, as it were, upon things that exist not, and travel by maps yet unmade, and a blank. But the throes of birth are upon us.” True democracy is still in the future. So much of what he wrote rings true today: the need to see democratic life as an exhilarating adventure, the terrible damage done when you tell groups that they are of no account, the need for a unifying American mythos, the power of culture to provide that mythos and, above all, the reminder that this is still early days. We’re still a young country. The times may be discouraging, but the full strength of American democracy is still waiting to be born.

 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (right) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (left) at a news conference announcing the resolution on Monday
The US House of Representatives is expected to vote to block President Donald Trump's emergency declaration over building a US-Mexico border wall.
Though Republicans have pushed back against the measure, the House is controlled by Democrats.
The bid to overturn the declaration would then go to a Republican-majority Senate, where some conservatives have said they will vote with Democrats.
Mr Trump declared the emergency after Congress refused funding for the wall.
Democrats need a simple majority to pass the measure in the Senate - which means four Republican senators must renege.
So far, three - Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina - have already indicated they will vote to block Mr Trump's order.
Lawmakers are using a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president, but it requires both chambers to vote for it and to complete voting within 18 days.

 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the resolution a matter of patriotism, not partisanship
If the resolution does pass Congress, it will not pass Mr Trump's desk, as he has promised to veto it.
The president has called the situation at the southern border a ""crisis"" and on 15 February, issued a declaration of emergency in order to bypass Congress and build a wall with military funding.
Democrats say the declaration is unconstitutional and that Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Monday: ""This isn't about the border. This is about the constitution of the United States. This is not about politics. It's not about partisanship. It's about patriotism.""
What a difference a few years - and a new presidential administration - make. 
In 2014, when Barack Obama used his executive authority to defer deportation of certain classes of undocumented migrants, Democrats defended him, while Republicans howled about an abuse of presidential authority.
Now it is Republicans attempting to explain President Donald Trump's use of an emergency declaration to redirect funds toward his border wall, while Democrats issue dire warnings of White House overreach.
Such is the ease with which the playing field flips in American politics.
The Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, joined by a handful of Republicans, are poised to rebuke Mr Trump for this wall declaration. 
That will set up a showdown in the Senate, where some conservatives - particularly those up for re-election in 2020 battleground states - are uneasy about going along with what they see as a dangerous precedent. 
They could hand their president an embarrassing setback, forcing him to use his first veto of his administration. Then - because a congressional veto override seems unlikely - the legal battle will shift to the courts. 
The battle for public opinion will stay firmly in the realm of the politicians, of course.

 Republican leader Mitch McConnell says the emergency is an ""understandable consequence"" of Democrats refusing to negotiate with Mr Trump
While many Republicans were critical of using an emergency declaration for a wall prior to Mr Trump's decree, some are now arguing the president is using the authority given to him by the constitution.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said Republicans would uphold Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring the emergency at the border.
Ohio Representative Warren Davidson said: ""I think he didn't necessarily have to do the emergency declaration, but he did, and it's legal,"" the Washington Post reported.
But others maintained Mr Trump's response to a lack of congressional funding was inappropriate.
Skip Twitter post by @RepThomasMassieThere is a crisis at our border, but its not an emergency when Congress doesnt spend money how the President wants. The Presidents constitutional remedy is to veto spending bills that arent suitable to him, yet he has chosen to sign many bills that did not fund the wall.

End of Twitter post by @RepThomasMassie
In the Senate, more Republicans have expressed concerns about setting a dangerous precedent, and Vice-President Mike Pence met members during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has maintained the emergency declaration is ""the predictable and understandable consequences of Democrats' decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest"".
Mr Trump's emergency declaration would open up almost $8bn (£6bn) for the wall, which is still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of the barrier along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border, but far more than the $1.375bn allotted by Congress for barriers.",The resolution to revoke the emergency over the US-Mexico border is facing pushback from Republicans.,2019-02-26T20:52:00Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",House to vote on revoking Trump border wall national emergency,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47379991,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9AEC/production/_105806693_tv052594018.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Lucy Sherriff Image caption The Corcora valley in Colombia is one of the few places where the Quindío Wax Palm grows ""They are essentially living corpses,"" says Colombian scientist Rodrigo Bernal of Colombia's national tree. The ceroxylon quindiuense, a distinct species of palm tree which was declared the country's national tree in 1985, is on the verge of extinction and most Colombians are not even aware of the problem. That is because it takes decades for the palms to show signs of decay, even when they have already reached the end of their lifespan and scientifically they are dead, explains Mr Bernal. He is one of the scientists who has been studying the trees over the past two decades and he is more than a little worried. Tourist attraction Thousands of tourists travel to the Corcora Valley in Colombia's coffee region every year to marvel at the towering palms. But even in this area famous for its wax palms, the trees are few and far between. You may also be interested in: ""The trees live for up to 200 years and because of their long lifespan, their decay will only be seen by younger generations,"" Mr Bernal told the BBC. ""This is why so many Colombians do not realise our national tree is dying out."" Image copyright Felipe Villegas/Instituto Humboldt Since 1989 the number of trees in the region has declined by 78% and there are now only about 2,000 palms left in the Corcora Valley, a group of scientists which has been monitoring the population says. The wax palms are not only a tourist attraction but a key component in the region's ecosystem. The fruits produced by the trees feed a large number of insects, birds and mammals. But according to Mr Bernal, the palms in the Corcora Valley are at risk. Much of the valley's once lush dense forest has been cut down to make way for cattle grazing. This poses problems for the seeds of the wax palm. They either get burned in the sun or they get eaten by the cows. Image copyright Lucy Sherriff Image caption Cows eat the seeds and there are no new saplings to replace those trees which have reached the end of their lifespan Although the living trees are relatively healthy, when they start to decay naturally there are no young saplings to take their place. New threats The Quindío Wax Palm grows in very few areas in Colombia. Apart from the Corcora Valley they can be found in Tochecito, an area in Valle del Cauca province. The little-known Tochecito is thought to hold the largest number of trees - an estimated 70% of the national total. Image copyright Rodrigo Bernal Image caption In Tochecito the density of wax palms is higher than in the Corcora valley But the fact that parts of the area were occupied by the now largely disbanded Farc guerrilla group means that research there was almost impossible. Scientists hope the number of trees may actually be bigger. Mr Bernal and his fellow scientists have turned their attention to Tochecito in the hope that they can preserve its wax palms before it is too late. With the area now safer and more accessible following the 2016 peace deal with the Farc rebels, farmers are moving back and the scientists fear for the future of the national tree. ""We predict we could see half the wax palm population disappear in as little as 50 years' time,"" says Luis Santiago Castillo Martínez of the Humboldt Institute, an environmental research organisation. ""Tochecito is our best opportunity to protect the palms,"" he says of the 42 sq km (16 sq mile) area. Uphill struggle The palm trees are legally protected under a law passed in 1985 which prevents their branches being cut off for use during religious celebrations such as Palm Sunday but there are few repercussions for those who completely fell the trees. Tochecito currently belongs to 40 private landowners and Mr Bernal along with the Humboldt Institute has been asking the Colombian government to declare the area a national park, but so far with little success. Image copyright Felipe Villegas/Instituto Humboldt Image caption The landowners could be key to the palms' conservation ""The most we could achieve was to encourage the owners to declare their farms private reserves,"" says Mr Bernal. Unfortunately there is a loophole to that status, he adds. ""This just means your land is a protected area but it's an empty status as you can use your land however you see fit. If these landowners decide they want to clear their land, they can."" Mr Bernal and his fellow scientists have for years been urging the government to buy up the land - a move they estimate would cost $10m (£7.7m) - but so far no action has been taken. ""It's not a huge amount. It's cents for a nation like Colombia. The government has the authority to buy this land, and protect the trees, but refuses to do so. It is incredibly frustrating,"" he says. The BBC approached Colombia's environment ministry ministry and the government body which oversees the management of Colombia's national parks for comment but did not receive an answer. Image copyright Fernando Villegas/Institute Humboldt Image caption The wax palms have so far been thriving on the steep hillsides in Tochecito Colombia's 58 national parks are managed by the National Parks Systems and while the number of those designated as protected in Colombia has been growing, the budget has been cut, leaving it struggling for resources. Mr Castillo says money is key: ""The first step to protecting the palms will be to allocate the proper amount to the environmental sector."" Mr Bernal and his fellow scientists have developed a management plan to save the species but the budget cuts mean their strategy is unlikely to be enacted. ""I'm so disappointed,"" Mr Bernal says. ""This tree is beloved by Colombian people, everyone knows it is our national tree, But nobody knows we are about to lose it.""","Colombia's wax palms may look healthy but they are on the verge of extinction, scientists warn.",2018-11-05T01:03:59Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",'Living corpses': Why Colombia's national tree is at risk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45901218,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8692/production/_104105443_corcora1ls.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
Devin Coldewey,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos says he is being blackmailed with nude selfies by AMI, owner of the National Enquirer and reportedly protector of the President’s reputation, over claims the publisher has acted as a political operative. The events feel almost as if they have been arranged by mysterious forces as a microcosm of the “tech elite vs. the President” narrative.
Bezos, who has been in the news recently owing to a rather dramatic and public divorce, published a post on a fresh Medium instance describing in detail the process by which he has been targeted by AMI.
It began when Bezos commissioned private security provider and investigator Gavin de Becker to look into how the National Enquirer obtained (and published) private texts and images of his, part of which was apparently to look into connections with Saudi Arabia and potential interference with the Washington Post, which Bezos of course owns.
This apparently did not sit well with David Pecker, AMI’s CEO and Chairman:
Several days ago, an AMI leader advised us that Mr. Pecker is ‘apoplectic’ about our investigation. For reasons still to be better understood, the Saudi angle seems to hit a particularly sensitive nerve… They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didnt stop our investigation.
They wanted Bezos to publicly state that he has “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMIs coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.” This, he writes, is simply not true, and he decided rather to publish the threats in full than to capitulate with the demands.
In emails purportedly from AMI, the publisher details the exact nature of the images they have obtained. Bezos, presumably in order to take away any ammunition they have short of shooting their whole shot, published the list in his post. The images sound suitably personal and they are exactly what you suspect, and include some of the woman with whom he is reportedly involved.
Apparently AMI says the images can and should be published as newsworthy in order to show Amazon shareholders that Bezos has poor judgment. Obviously Bezos disagrees, and he’d rather air his dirty laundry (rather more literally than that is usually meant) than compromise himself and the Post.
In a touching aside, he notes that although the newspaper is “a complexifier” for him, he is completely dedicated to it. “My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when Im 90 and reviewing my life,” he writes.
Notably Bezos chose not to publish this information with any kind of official connection with the Washington Post (such as a letter from the owner or the like, or with Post lawyers); considering this is more of a personal issue for him and that he is accusing AMI of poor journalistic practices (in fact of masquerading as journalism for nefarious purposes), it is well for him to keep a wide berth from potential accusations that he is abusing the Post in any way.
Some may be wondering: What about these images? How could AMI possibly claim they were obtained lawfully? In the email published by Bezos, they say:
Please be advised that our newsgathering and reporting on matters involving your client, including any use of your clients private photographs, has been, and will continue to be, consistent with applicable laws. As you know, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting . . . is not an infringement of copyright. 17 USC Sec. 107.
Whether “fair use” protects them from publishing photos that I can’t imagine could be acquired by anything but illegal means, is a question that may have to be decided in court. On the other hand, AMI and the National Enquirer are surely old hands at this type of thing considering the nature of their business.

Danny Crichton,"Who would have thought that the president who writes in 140-character missives would suddenly be interested in 70 Gbps wireless internet access? The White House released its congressionally-mandated National Security Strategy report (warning: PDF) yesterday. Tucked away in a section on improving America’s infrastructure was this action item: “We will improve America’s digital infrastructure by deploying a secure 5G Internet capability nationwide.” Other than natural gas, 5G wireless service was the only area of technology to get a specific calling out for infrastructure. 5G wireless isn’t a specific technology per se, but rather a set of standards and technologies that interoperate in the millimeter wave spectrum to meet the needs of users today. That includes better performance around latency and bandwidth, as well as support for low-power, many-device contexts due to the rise of Internet of Things. The standards have been discussed and researched for years, and TechCrunch has talked about its promise before in 2015 and how that promise seems ever more distant just earlier this year. There is hope though that the technology will soon see the light of day since Verizon just announced that it will launch its first U.S. service of the technology next year in Sacramento and up to five other cities. Now, a line in a report in Silicon Valley would be useless — people want to see actual products, not talk of products. But in Washington D.C., these sorts of coordinated reports are designed to send a signal throughout the government on how a particular administration sees policy issues. As such, they are important for setting the guidelines for future actions of the federal government. By attaching wireless connectivity into national security, the Trump administration is putting its heaviest hand behind such a recommendation. In addition to supporting 5G wireless rollouts, the report dived into a bunch of startup and tech-related recommendations. Subtweeting Obama-era programs like DIUx, the Defense Department’s designated agency for interfacing with Silicon Valley, the report demands that federal agencies use startup technology more quickly in the field and pushes for a more agile deployment strategy. It also encourages more collaboration between technology companies and the Defense Department. The administration also lists what it says are the critical next-generation of technologies that will underpin the American economy (or put another way, what do DCers read on TechCrunch): “To maintain our competitive advantage, the United States will prioritize emerging technologies critical to economic growth and security, such as data science, encryption, autonomous technologies, gene editing, new materials, nanotechnology, advanced computing technologies, and artificial intelligence.“ While reasonably clear, the report also has some two-faced challenges around immigration. The strategy argues that “The United States must continue to attract the innovative and the inventive, the brilliant and the bold,” but then includes pages of recommendations on strengthening borders and immigration controls that would seem to run directly counter to this high-priority goal. In short, the strategy is about what you would expect from this administration. Except for 5G wireless. Because the president really needs less latency for his tweets.

H. GILBERT WELCH,"The effect was small enough that The New England Journal used a special pair of graphical displays used for health events that occur rarely. One display focused on those participants suffering the cardiovascular events (8 percent versus 6 percent); the other shows the big picture — highlighting the fact that most did not (92 percent versus 94 percent). Oh, and did I mention that to be eligible for Sprint, participants were required to be at higher-than-average risk for cardiovascular events? That means the benefit for average patients would be even smaller. But the problem with using Sprint to guide practice goes well beyond its small effect. Blood pressure is an exceptionally volatile biologic variable — blood pressure changes in response to activity, stress and your surroundings, like being in a doctor’s office. In short, how it is measured matters. For the study, blood pressure was taken as an average of three measurements during an office visit while the patient was seated and after five minutes of quiet rest with no staff members in the room. When was the last time your doctor measured your blood pressure that way? While this may be an ideal way to measure it, that’s not what happens in most doctors’ offices. A blood pressure of 130 in the Sprint study may be equivalent to a blood pressure of 140, even 150, in a busy clinic. A national goal of 130 as measured in actual practice may lead many to be overmedicated — making their blood pressures too low. One of the most impressive findings in Sprint was that few patients had problems with low blood pressure like becoming lightheaded from overmedication and then falling. But one of the most important principles in medicine is that the effects seen in a meticulously managed randomized trial may not be replicated in the messy world of actual clinical practice. Serious falls are common among older adults. In the real world, will a nationwide target of 130, and the side effects of medication lowering blood pressure, lead to more hip fractures? Ask your doctors. See what they think. Let me be clear: Using medications to lower very high blood pressure is the most important preventive intervention we doctors do. But more medications and lower blood pressures are not always better for everyone. I suspect many primary-care practitioners will want to ignore this new target. They understand the downsides of the relentless expansion of medical care into the lives of more people. At the same time, I fear many will be coerced into compliance as the health care industry’s middle management translates the 130 target into a measure of physician performance. That will push doctors to meet the target using whatever means necessary — and that usually means more medications. So focusing on the number 130 not only will involve millions of people but also will involve millions of new prescriptions and millions of dollars. And it will further distract doctors and their patients from activities that aren’t easily measured by numbers, yet are more important to health — real food, regular movement and finding meaning in life. These matter whatever your blood pressure is. H.

Jon Russell,"The nightmare is a reality in India. Reports from the country suggest that the government’s national ID system — Aadhaar, which holds personal data belonging to more than one billion people — was compromised. On the slight positive side, the breach wasn’t down to hackers — at least on this occasion. The access hole was publicized after Indian newspaper The Tribune paid a man less than $10 in exchange for administration access to the database. Reporters from the paper were then given a username and password that allowed them to access information on any citizen by entering their 12-digit number. It gets worse. BuzzFeed tracked down the seller down — a man going by the pseudonym Anil Kumar — and he told the publication that The Tribune deal was just one of eight transactions that he made that week. Each time he sold access to the database for 500 INR, around $8, using a contact he had on WhatsApp to get the requirement admin name and password. “I paid Rs. 6,000 (approximately $95) to an anonymous person in a WhatsApp group I was a part of to create an username and password to the Aadhaar database for myself. I was told that I could then create as many usernames and passwords to access the database as I wanted. I sold each of them to make my Rs. 6,000 back,” Kumar told BuzzFeed. In response to the situation, India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party took a line right out of President Trump playbook, calling reports of a breach “fake news.” Notably, the term ‘breach’ doesn’t exactly fit the story here. Gaining access by paying a third-party isn’t really a breach, that’s just a hell of a messed up situation that can happen when a government uses a string of contractors to manage a highly-sensitive project. Aadhaar isn’t mandatory in India, but a massive campaign to sign citizens up made it almost feel like it was last year. The ID system has crept into a range of services, such as school enrollment, ration disbursements and other national/government projects. Facebook even embraced it via a pilot that encouraged new users to provide details from their ID. Facebook tested linking new accounts with Aadhaar ID details in December Aside from the privacy issue of a government sucking up personal details — and this obvious security risk — there have been reports of tragedies at the hands of the program. In October, the government denied that a girl in eastern state Jharkhand had died from starvation because her family was refused rations for failing to sign up to Aadhaar. In the same state, a second woman is said to have died in the same circumstances on Christmas Day. Activists have pushed back on the program, which linked IDs to citizen’s mobile phone numbers, claiming that the data collection and usage is not constitutional. There have also been many warnings over lax security, including a flaw within the data capture process unearthed in July. Even given that backdrop, this week’s revelations have shocked the nation by showing just how easy (and cheap) it can be to gain access. There’s lots of uncertainty in the confusion following these reports, but one thing is clear. India’s citizens deserve a better response from their government than an accusation of fake news.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The crumbling Theatre des Blues de Bar in Bar-le-Duc is one beneficiary It takes a national treasure to save the national treasure. Stéphane Bern, organiser of France's first heritage lottery, is himself something of a cherished institution. A historian, television star, and royal commentator, he is now lending his celebrity to a cause he holds dear - preserving the country's crumbling past. But there is another side of Bern that is less well-known: he is an Anglophile. And the whole lottery project is explicitly based on his experience in the UK. ""England has always been a source of inspiration. The British have more respect for their patrimony than we French,"" he says. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stéphane Bern is one of the most recognisable men in France ""I met people from the (UK's) National Lottery and they told me how some of the proceeds were used for conservation, and I thought: that's what we must do in France. ""I went to Emmanuel Macron (when he was still a candidate) and told him, and he said: 'Okay when I am president, you go ahead.'"" The upshot is the Loto du Patrimoine, whose first draw takes place today. In fact, the Loto comprises two separate games. The annual prize draw tickets cost €3 and promise a possible jackpot of €13 million. In addition, there is an ongoing scratch-card game that costs €15 a shot. Participants stand a one-in-three chance of at least getting their money back, and big winners can get as much as €1.5m. With 10% of ticket sales going to his Heritage Fund, Bern hopes to raise €15m-€20m in the first year. In the run-up to the launch, he held a nationwide consultation over the internet, leading to a list of some 2,000 buildings in urgent need of preservation. This list was whittled down to 269 priority projects, of which 18 are described as ""emblematic"" and will be the first to receive money. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fort Cigogne, near Brittany, is in need of work to remain stable These include a Roman aqueduct near Lyon; a fort on the Glenan islands off Brittany; a 19th century villa west of Paris; an industrial-era railway roundhouse; a theatre in the eastern town of Bar-le-Duc; and various chateaux and stately homes. Bern's conviction is that it is not the big name monuments in France that need protection - they get all the money they need from the state. It is the thousands of forgotten treasures that languish unaided in villages across the land. ""France is richer than the UK in terms of heritage. In every French town and village you will find a historic house, a church, a fountain - something of interest,"" he says. ""But the problem is, it will not be restored or preserved as it would be in the UK. So we are richer, but we are also poorer."" ""The French have this instinct to expect the state to do everything. But my message to them is simple: we - the people - we are the state. Heritage belongs to us, and it is up to us to preserve it."" Image caption In Thiron-Gardais, the grand abbey cannot stand without support Bern knows that the lottery will only achieve a small amount, but he hopes to open people's minds.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images A Chinese man has been arrested for allegedly spying on US engineers and scientists on behalf of Beijing, US prosecutors say. Ji Chaoqun, 27, was arrested in Chicago and charged with acting as an illegal foreign agent in the US, according to the US attorney's office. Mr Ji came to the US in 2013 to study electrical engineering and enlisted in the US Army Reserves in 2016. He allegedly sought to provide details on eight people for recruitment. Mr Ji is accused of working for an unnamed high-ranking intelligence officer, according to a criminal complaint filed in a Chicago court. Prosecutors say he targeted other Chinese nationals who were working as engineers and scientists, some of whom were US defence contractors, for potential recruitment. He arrived from Beijing in August 2013 on a student visa and studied at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. He later earned a Master's Degree in electrical engineering in 2015. Mr Ji served in the US Army Reserves in 2016 and ""specifically denied having contact with a foreign government within the past seven years"" when he applied through a specialty programme for immigrants known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (Mavni). He later failed to disclose his relationship with the intelligence officer in question during an interview with a US Army officer, prosecutors say. Mr Ji joined the US Army Reserves through the Mavni programme, which expedites citizenship for certain immigrants with critical skills in languages and medicine who are recruited into military service. Nearly 11,000 immigrants have joined the US armed forces through the Mavni programme since it began in 2008.

MARC TRACY,"The interesting question about perhaps the greatest college football coach ever is why he keeps subjecting himself to all this. He has nothing left to prove. He did not before Monday night, and he certainly does not after. No. 4 Alabama sneaked into this College Football Playoff, beat defending champion Clemson — avenging last year’s title game loss — and then, against Georgia, endured a first-half shutout before engineering a magnificent comeback that will be remembered for a single master stroke. In the third quarter, Saban boldly benched starting quarterback Jalen Hurts for a true freshman back-up, Tua Tagovailoa. If the reason he stays is adherence to to his famous Process, which emphasizes doing things the right way over results. Winning games and championships cannot serve as a salve. As Saban said a few years ago, “We don’t try to focus as much on the outcomes as we do on being all that you can be.” At its worst, this philosophy is nihilism. It once reportedly led Saban to complain that a national championship game had “cost me a week of recruiting” — as though the point of recruiting was not to win national championships. At its best, the philosophy coexists uneasily with gratifying results. “It’s not just about winning the championship,” he said after Monday’s game, his voice firmly returned to the monotone. “”There’s more to it than that.” Associate Head Coach Burton Burns, an assistant during Saban’s entire Alabama tenure, had a subtler, more persuasive parsing of the Process. Photo Saban at the start of the third quarter on Monday night. Credit Streeter Lecka/Getty Images Defining Saban as “a competitor” rather than a winner, Burns said, “If you compete, the other thing is going to happen.” Still, Monday night seemed like the worst of competition, competition as a form of addiction, which can be a form of agony. It was more agonizing for Georgia and its fans, of course, but they had no choice; Saban does. The Crimson Tide had 94 yards and zero first downs in the first half. Saban replaced Hurts with Tagovailoa, inviting armchair coaches over for some sweet tea Tuesday morning. Then Alabama improbably came back somehow in a hostile stadium teeming with Georgians, outscoring the Bulldogs by 20-7 in the second half. But it was hardly preordained or without its agonizing moments. A Tagovailoa interception resulted from the rookie trying to pass when the play-call had been to rush. (Teenagers!!!) Poor clock management nearly scuttled an attempt at a game-winning field goal. Then, at the entrance to the Holy Gates, with a kick to win the game with three seconds left in regulation, Alabama kicker Andy Pappanastos somehow missed a 36-yard chip shot. The penultimate play was a 16-yard sack so frustratingly needless that Saban threw a tantrum. Then came the payoff — the virtuosic 41-yard bomb to win the championship. Is Saban in as much pain as he appears? “Well, it is hard,” he acknowledged afterward. Saban lost last year’s national title game to a much younger protégé, Clemson’s Dabo Swinney. Monday night he faced the prospect of losing this one to a much younger protégé, Georgia’s Kirby Smart, Saban’s former defensive coordinator. Next year he faces the prospect of losing future games to a much younger protégé, defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, who, as Tennessee’s head coach, will helm a potential power that Alabama plays every season. Yet this dude abides. Saban said it is to keep teaching his players. “The message to the team tonight after this game was, I hope you take something from this game and the resiliency that you showed in this game and it helps you be more successful in life,” he said. Hurts will have to find another lesson in the experience, but that’s a separate matter. This philosophy — of football, of life — can seem like a low-fat version of Buddhism. It also recalls Existentialism in a more hopeful variant. The French Existentialist philosopher Albert Camus wrote of Sisyphus, the figure of Greek myth condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain only to have it roll back down, at which point Sisyphus renews the endeavor, forever, that there is absurdity in the task but also, maybe, joy: “The absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be unceasing,” Camus wrote, noting, “The rock is still rolling.” (Camus would doubtlessly have said the same of the Tide.) Sisyphus has a task. He does it, with unimaginable “resiliency.” Camus concluded: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” One must also imagine Saban happy, without even counting the six times he has rolled the boulder up the mountain and it has stayed put. (Not to mention the multimillion-dollar salary and the sweet Georgia lake house.) He focuses his energies monomaniacally on doing the thing at which he is the best in the world. If the downside is that he does not get to do it forever or that it has its brutally frustrating moments filled with heartache, well, life is absurd that way. “The eye of the storm is the calmest place,” said Karl Dunbar, who was on his first Saban staff nearly 20 years ago and is Alabama’s defensive line coach. “You don’t listen to the periphery. You just stay in there and do your job.” “We’re in the eye of the storm right now,” Dunbar added. “I hope it lasts for another five years.” Continue reading the main story","Nick Saban may scowl, even through another national championship, but he’s got it made.",2018-01-09T12:47:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On College Football: Why Nick Saban Is the Ultimate Masochist,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/sports/alabama-nick-saban.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/sports/10sabanWEB1/10sabanWEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,National,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Marine Le Pen was defeated in last year's presidential election by Emmanuel Macron France's far-right National Front (FN) is voting this weekend on whether to allow a change of its name. Leader Marine Le Pen has said she wants a new name to reflect a ""change in the nature"" of the party. Since losing to Emmanuel Macron in the presidential run-off last year, Ms Le Pen has lost voters, endured attacks from her father and seen the defection of some of the party's most important figures. Will a name change turn the FN's fortunes around? The pastel buildings and sun-soaked palm trees of Cogolin give the square a tranquil, postcard feel. This tiny Mediterranean town, nestled alongside Saint Tropez, is renowned for producing hand-made pipes. It is a place that values tradition and the old ways of life. Cogolin chose Marine Le Pen over Emmanuel Macron by a clear margin but, almost a year on, her party seems to have lost momentum even here. Mayor Marc-Etienne Lansade quit the party after the election, disillusioned with both its economic policy and, he says, its chances of ever winning power. Bystanders at the town's pétanque court said there was no clear opposition party in France now either. ""The left-right divide is dead,"" said one woman. ""Political parties are no longer relevant, but they all have some good ideas: Marine Le Pen, [the far-left leader Jean-Luc] Mélenchon, and the others too."" The FN received almost 11 million votes in the election, presenting itself as the natural party of opposition to Mr Macron's liberal, internationalist vision. So why, since then, have more than a third of party members failed to pay their dues and several key figures quit? Who is in, who is out Florian Philippot, once the party's number two and popular with newer converts, left the FN last year to launch his own far-right political movement, Les Patriotes. Marine Le Pen's niece, Marion, also left, weakening her aunt's support among traditional FN voters. Marion said she was withdrawing from politics completely but many believe she is biding her time to challenge her aunt for the party. ""There would be room for her if she came back,"" a senior FN figure told French radio recently. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ms Le Pen has campaigned for a change of the party's name And then there's the old conflict with Marine's father, Jean-Marie, who has launched continued attacks on his daughter and her leadership of the party he founded - most recently in a memoir about his early career, published this month. ""He managed to speak ill of me in a book which stops in 1972 - when I was four years old,"" Marine Le Pen told Le Figaro newspaper. ""You have to be really motivated [to do that]."" Add to this the still-fresh memory of Marine Le Pen's disastrous performance in the presidential debate and the party's ""identity crisis"" over whether it represents economically liberal right-wingers or former communist blue-collar workers - and it is not hard to see why the FN has struggled to lead the opposition. And that is without Laurent Wauquiez. A new threat? He is the new leader of France's traditional centre-right party, Les Republicains. He is young, straight-talking and unashamedly right-wing. The media have nicknamed him France's Donald Trump. ""I support the National Front,"" said one woman in Cogolin's weekly market, ""but I think Laurent Wauquiez will emerge: he's got good ideas, he's young. Of course he's criticised but that's because the Paris upper-crust don't like him."" Image copyright EPA Image caption Laurent Wauquiez has been nicknamed France's Donald Trump Mr Wauquiez's brash approach has won him a lot of media attention and right-wing support - and even grudging acknowledgement from MPs in President Macron's party, like Bruno Bonnell. ""Wauquiez is the same generation [as Mr Macron] and will be a strong fighter,"" Mr Bonnell told me. ""I'm convinced he'll gather a lot of forces around his ideas. Obviously we don't share the same vision of France but he'll be a strong opposition."" But the FN's Jean-Lin Lacapelle says Mr Wauquiez is no threat to his party: ""He's either poaching [our voters] and is an imposter or Wauquiez is serious and the doors are wide open for a grand alliance of nationalists. That's what Marine Le Pen is calling for."" The question of whether the FN might form an alliance with France's centre-right is hotly debated. Laurent Wauquiez has repeatedly rejected the idea and recent polls suggest that almost two-thirds of French voters are opposed to it. Among centre-right voters themselves, opposition is even higher. Which is partly why Marine Le Pen is pushing for a change of name - hoping that it might loosen attitudes towards her party, and help open the door to alliances. ""'Front' expresses the idea of an opposition against someone or something,"" she told Le Figaro. ""From now on, we need to go beyond that. We need to express our own ambition for government."" ""I have a lot of affection for the name,"" said FN official Jean-Lin Lacapelle, ""but it can appear a bit aggressive. It had a bad reputation in the past. Some people are happy to vote for Marine Le Pen but don't want to vote for the National Front."" The FN leader already dropped party branding from much of her presidential campaign in a bid to ""detoxify"" her image. But now polls suggest the French are less likely to consider the FN capable of government than before, with that perception dropping more sharply among FN voters themselves. None of the changes of the past seven years has so far been enough to secure the party pride of place in either government or opposition. Marine Le Pen says she even propelled the recent change in French politics, opening up a new division between globalists and nationalists. But, she said, it was ""Emmanuel Macron [who] passed through the door that we opened"".",The National Front will vote on whether to allow a change of its name but will it be enough?,2018-03-10T01:38:54Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",National Front: Whatever happened to France's far right?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43347557,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/161A7/production/_100353509_mediaitem100353435.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
"Julian Zelizer, CNN Political Analyst","Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and co-author with Kevin Kruse of the new book ""Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. 
 (CNN)On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history. President Donald Trump has invoked national emergency power to secure federal funds for a wall that Congress refused to pay for. He has done so based on an alleged crisis at the border that almost no reputable expert agrees is real. 
""The President's actions are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public record, including the administration's own data and estimates,"" proclaimed 58 prominent ex-national security officials who oppose what the President is trying to do. They made this assertion -- to be entered into the Congressional Record -- in a 13-page joint statement issued Monday. 
Even some Republican loyalists understand that if President Trump takes this step to finance a border wall, future presidents in both parties will have sufficient justification to enact policy to tackle their goals, including initiatives on climate change, without congressional support.
Congress has the power to stop President Trump if it wants to; it doesn't need the courts to step in. If the House and Senate vote for a resolution revoking this use of emergency power, with sufficient votes to override an expected presidential veto, Trump has to back down. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, Congress gave itself the power to restrain the president. 
But President Trump is tweeting out warnings to his fellow Republicans. ""I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,"" he tweeted Monday morning. In a follow up, he asked: ""Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security. Please explain that to me?"" 
The good news for President Trump is that the odds are on his side. Most Republicans won't go along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Although a handful of Republicans have indicated they opposed the emergency declaration, most have not. The Democratic-controlled House is expected to pass legislation reversing Trump's emergency order, but it is not even likely that the resolution will make its way through the Senate, where the Republicans hold power. 
This vote is the latest in a series of critical moments since January 2017 in which congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be the foundation of the Trump presidency rather than passive bystanders. Republicans have made active decisions that strengthened the President's hand or allowed him to use his authority in unprecedented fashion because it seemed to serve their political interest. 
When Republicans did not censure President Trump after his stunning failure to fully condemn the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, the party showed that it had the President's back. When the party ended his controversial first year by voting in favor of Trump's massive corporate tax cut, it handed him a crucial legislative victory at a key point in his presidency -- one that greatly improved his standing with the Republican electorate. 
When then-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes released a memo making pointed accusations about the motives of the FBI, he and the Republicans on his committee joined in on the President's ongoing assault on law enforcement institutions -- an apparent attempt to discredit the investigations into his campaign and presidency. 
Most recently, the Republicans allowed President Trump to shut down the federal government for the longest period in American history, even though the Senate had reached an agreement over the budget, so that the administration could score political points with the base. Government workers went without pay so that the party could start setting up for the 2020 campaign. 
In announcing the deal to reopen the government, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his support for the President turning to emergency power -- only days after expressing his staunch opposition to such a move. 
This week's vote might be the most important of all these enabling moments. If the Republicans don't vote to stand between Trump and this aggressive use of presidential power, they are giving consent to the President to unilaterally siphon money from programs that Congress has funded into a program that Congress refused to support. 
Republicans are increasingly erasing any daylight between themselves and President Trump, and it may be about to happen again. This is his party, and more importantly, this practice has been an active decision by Republican elected officials.
When Trump's presidency is over, Republicans will spend many years reckoning with the decisions they have made. Their voting record, their silence and their statements of support will all be in the history books and they will continue to redefine the party of Lincoln and Reagan, which has become the party of Trump, for decades to come.","On Tuesday, House Republicans will take a crucial vote that will mark what the party is becoming at this crossroads in American history.

"Rebecca Buck, CNN","Washington (CNN)Over the past two months, since his buzzy launch February 1, Sen. Cory Booker's campaign has gone relatively quiet methodically grinding away under the guiding philosophy: ""You've got to organize, and get hot at the end.""
""We're trying to win the election,"" Booker's campaign manager Addisu Demissie told reporters Thursday. ""We're not trying to win a news cycle.""
But that slow-and-steady pace now seems poised to pick up. Booker will step back into the spotlight Saturday in Newark, with his first major rally as a candidate. The event will kick off a two-week national tour for Booker, which in its first week will take him to Iowa, Georgia and Nevada. In his remarks, he will lay out his broad vision for the country, oriented around the theme of creating a more just society.
It also comes at a moment of trial, with Booker's momentum apparently stalling after amuted start.
In two polls released this week, by Monmouth University out of Iowa and St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Booker's support registered in the low single-digits, lagging behind half a dozen other candidates.
Those numbers follow a middling first fundraising quarter for the New Jersey senator, who reported raising $5 million enough to sustain a campaign operation, but far less than top fundraisers Bernie Sanders ($18.9 million) and Kamala Harris ($12 million), and even trailing newcomer Pete Buttigieg ($7 million).
Booker's campaign has attempted to downplay that gap: ""The raw numbers of money is irrelevant,"" Demissie said Thursday. ""It has to be connected to a strategy.""
That strategy has been to build slowly, putting the pieces in place now, particularly on the ground in early primary states, to make the most of a breakthrough moment later on.
But Demissie acknowledges the need ""to stay relevant in the conversation"" in the meantime, amidst a competitive and increasingly crowded Democratic field and so the campaign is beginning to ramp up its public exposure, beginning with the rally Saturday in Newark.
""Now, it's phase two,"" said Robert Wolf, an influential Democratic donor, who gave money to Booker and four other candidates in the first quarter: Harris, Buttigieg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
At this juncture, Booker ""needs to continue to creep up in the polls and really solidify himself in the top half dozen"" candidates, Wolf added and Booker's rally in Newark could mark a major moment in that effort.
""Everyone has one day to launch,"" said Wolf, ""so it's an important day for him.""
As with Harris' kickoff rally in Oakland and O'Rourke's in El Paso, Booker's event will be set in a place central to his biography: Newark, where Booker won a city council seat as a 29-year-old political upstart, beating a longtime incumbent, and then went on to challenge longtime incumbent Mayor Sharpe James.
In a Democratic field that could balloon into the twenties, Booker points to his political and governance education in Newark as his special sauce. In his narrow loss to James in 2002, Booker learned the art of political combat. And, after he came back to win the mayorship in 2006, he worked to transform the city as its chief executive.
On Saturday, Booker himself is not expected to focus on that piece of his biography. But his event, and a roster of other speakers, will help him do the talking. The kickoff rally will take place in downtown Military Park, a public space that underwent a dramatic makeover under Booker, nearby a Whole Foods that Booker helped bring to the city. On hand to introduce Booker will be his successor as mayor, Ras Baraka, as well as Sen. Bob Menendez and Gov. Phil Murphy, among others.
Booker's story has so far been eclipsed by those of other ascendant candidates, however including another mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend. Buttigieg benefits from a certain degree of novelty relative to Booker, who was in his own Wunderkind Mayor phase more than a decade ago.
Incidentally, Buttigieg will hold his own rally this weekend in South Bend, to officially announce his campaign for president after an exploratory phase. But Booker will be launching a new phase of sorts as well, beginning to hone his campaign narrative and home in on a central theme of justice.
Booker's organization was ""very intentional in wanting to do this at this point in the campaign"" as opposed to when Booker first jumped into the race in February, Demissie said, ""...as a moment to be able to say clearly and above the din of what's happening on a daily basis, why Cory's in the race and what he's fighting for.""
The campaign will expand its reach in the coming weeks, with plans for Booker to visit Georgia, California, Wisconsin, Texas and Florida for the first time as a candidate. And they will begin hiring in Super Tuesday primary states soon, campaign officials said Thursday, now that their teams on the ground in the first four primary states are up and running.
Booker is also making a turn toward a more pronounced policy focus. During a swing through New Hampshire last week, Booker tailored his stump speech to get more into the weeds of his ""baby bonds"" proposal, which would fund a savings account for every child in America until age 18, in an effort to diminish inequality.
""Not just sentiments,"" Booker told the crowd last week at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network conference. ""I'm fighting to deliver substance.""
That appearance drew rave reviews for Booker, as did his remarks this week at the North American Building Trades Unions. His team hopes to continue racking up such momentum slowly and methodically, confident that the Democratic field remains wide open. 
""They don't need a breakthrough moment at this point,"" said Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics, and a former Democratic operative. ""They need an infrastructure so that when he does have a breakthrough moment, he can capitalize on it and sustain it.""
Plus, breakthrough moments like bolts of political lightning can be ""fleeting,"" Elleithee added. ""It's narrative that wins. That's what he needs to focus on, is getting his narrative out there.""","Booker will step back into the spotlight Saturday in Newark, with his first major rally as a candidate.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright SAPS Image caption Commercial-grade explosives have been used in several robberies The shaky footage could come from a film: men standing on the grassy verge wielding AK-47s, bombs exploding, and the sound of gunfire. But this is not the latest action blockbuster. This is a small South African town in the middle of the day, and what the shocked driver is recording from the relative safety of his own vehicle is a scene being repeated across the nation on an almost daily basis: a cash-in-transit heist. It is an epidemic which has seen millions of rand disappear into the hands of highly organised criminal gangs - a crime spree which some say can be traced back to the police themselves, and that others suggest is being orchestrated by criminals already serving time behind bars. It is, according to those in the know, seen as high prestige and low risk - at least, for those carrying out the attacks. What is happening? Since the start of the year, there have been more than 150 ""cash-in-transit"" robberies - equating to more than one a day. There are a number of approaches. It can involve a gang swooping on an armoured vehicle as it drives down the road, shooting out the tyres before using explosives to get the doors open. Or the security guard can be targeted when they are at their most vulnerable: as they leave the premises carrying the cash, in what is known as a ""cross pavement"" attack. The latter is where the real rise has come in, Anneliese Burgess, a journalist who has spent the last few years researching the phenomenon for her book, Heist! South Africa's cash-in-transit epidemic, tells the BBC. ""It is extraordinary: the incredible brazenness of these acts,"" she explains. ""They just attack people, just shoot them in the back of the head."" Image copyright ER24 Image caption Eight people were injured in this attack on two vans carrying cash ""These gangs of criminals do not have due respect for the lives of our people here in this country,"" agrees Brig Hangwani Mulaudzi, South African Police Service spokesman. ""The nature of criminal conduct is scary - they are using explosives. It is groups of people firing high-calibre firearms."" Who are the robbers? The gangs, according to Yusuf Abramjee, an anti-crime activist, range in size from about 10 to 20 members, and are just as confident in conducting a broad daylight strike in the cities as they are out in the countryside. And when they strike, they are well prepared: AK47s, other assault rifles and commercial-grade explosives - allowing them to blow the back of a van off, and then walk away with the money. ""What we are dealing with is organised crime,"" Mr Abramjee says. More from South Africa: But these are no ordinary criminals, says Ms Burgess. The ""foot soldiers"" - the men who carry out the heists - have worked their way up from home burglaries and car-jackings to become part of these gangs. ""By the time you are selected, you are seen as the cream of the crop, so to speak,"" Burgess tells the BBC. At the top, she adds, are about 200 ""kingpins"", who will work across province boundaries to carry out attacks with, as Mr Abramjee notes, apparent ""military precision"". That high level of organisation has led some, like Mr Abramjee, to believe people with experience in the armed forces may be involved. And then there are the policemen. Image copyright SAPS Image caption There has been an attack each day so far this year Ms Burgess can list a number of cases which have been directly linked to police officers - although, she points out, most of them are working at a ""low level"" within the service, helping make the arrest dockets disappear when gang members are finally apprehended. There have been other cases when police officers have been far more involved, including one former officer in South Africa's elite unit, the Hawks, who was allegedly due to pocket tens of millions of rand for his role keeping a gang out of trouble in just one heist. He has since been found guilty. Brig Mulaudzi, however, is keen to say corruption within the force is not endemic, and those who are have been weeded out. The problem, he adds, is also not limited to the police. ""The issue of corruption - in terms of how the money is moved - that is information which is confidential, but these guys are able to get it,"" Brigadier Mulaudzi points out. Mr Abramjee agrees: ""We are dealing with insider involvement. Most certainly these are not random acts. They know where the cash depots are."" What are the authorities doing? As videos and pictures of the heists and their aftermath continue to go viral, questions are being asked about how the situation was allowed to reach this point. There was an 104% rise in cash-in-transit robberies from 2016 to 2017, when there were 378. With 153 to 31 May, it seems 2018 will hit a similar high. ""These people are making off with millions of rand,"" Mr Abramjee points out. ""We are dealing with a national crime emergency."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Security guards came together to protest against the attacks in Johannesburg on 12 June It has not been helped by what Brig Mulaudzi admits was a ""vacuum"" of intelligence within the police force. But, he says, that is now being rectified. There has, Ms Burgess says, been ""an enormous"" crackdown on the gangs over the last four or five weeks. Last week, officers arrested 13 cash-in-transit suspects - including one gang's alleged ""number two"" - in the space of just 24 hours, Last week, officers arrested 13 cash-in-transit suspects - including one gang's alleged ""number two"" - in the space of just 24 hours, according to TimesLive. But arrests are one thing. ""We have to get to a point where we are able to successfully prosecute them,"" Ms Burgess points out. But what if jail time is not enough? There are rumours that some of these heists are being ordered by people already serving time. One inmate boasted to South Africa's Sunday Times that he could make tens of thousands of rand as a go-between, organising the gangs and the guns needed to carry out the heists, despite being in prison. Image copyright ER24 Image caption A car riddled with bullet holes was found near this attacked van Is it true? Brig Mulaudzi tells the BBC the police are not ruling it out, but - like Ms Burgess - he is not entirely convinced. ""I don't understand what the people inside can really help with,"" Ms Burgess says. However, she is aware of several gangs who will be released in the medium- to short-term who are already making plans for their release - and it does not involve living a crime-free life. ""They all say it is incredibly easy and incredibly lucrative; the consequences are minimal,"" she says, raising the question: why would you give it up?",Gangs wielding AK47s and explosives are targeting South Africa's cash-in-transit industry - with sometimes deadly results.,2018-06-16T23:24:57Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",South Africa's cash-in-transit heists: A national emergency?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44328938,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5959/production/_102037822_5d04e63b-b138-4a9a-95b5-ef8277bb2a1b.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
"Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN","Washington (CNN)The President's top national security adviser said Sunday that the threat of ISIS still remains and could undergo a resurgence, despite Donald Trump's declaration that US backed forces have retaken ""100%"" of the territory once claimed by ISIS in Syria.
""The ISIS threat will remain,"" national security adviser John Bolton said on ABC News' ""This Week."" ""But one reason that the President has committed to keeping an American presence in Iraq and small part of an observer force in Syria, is against the possibility that there would be a real resurgence of ISIS and we would then have the ability to deal with that if that arose."" 
Less than two weeks ago, Trump declared that ""100%"" of the ISIS caliphate was liberated, surprising US officials and regional allies leading the fight who said the battle isn't over.
Gen. Joseph Votel, the top US general overseeing military operations in the Middle East, also warned Thursday that the fight against ISIS is ""far from over"" despite the terror group's territorial losses and cautioned that the remnants of the group are positioning themselves for a potential resurgence.
""The President has been, I think, as clear as clear can be,"" Bolton told ABC News on Sunday. ""When he talks about the defeat of the ISIS territorial caliphate, he has never said that the elimination of the territorial caliphate means the end of ISIS in total. We know that's not the case.""
Bolton said that there are ""ISIS fighters scattered still around Syria and Iraq and that ISIS itself is growing in other parts of the world.""
""The importance of the territorial caliphate goes to an ideological point of ISIS itself, namely that they were a caliphate because under their view of what a caliphate is, you have to control a territory,"" Bolton said. 
Trump announced in December that he would withdraw US troops from Syria, declaring that ISIS has been defeated.

KEN BELSON,"Jeffrey Lurie, owner of the Eagles, took a different view. Don’t pander to the president, he said, by clamping down on the players. Work with the players and tune out the noise. The president will do what he does regardless. “We’ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else,” he said at the meeting. “We have to find a way to not be divided and not get baited.” Most of the owners took the bait anyway. Not long after the meeting, everyone from Commissioner Roger Goodell on down said they preferred if the players stood for the anthem. Behind closed doors, they debated how to change the league’s policy to force, not suggest, that players stand. The owners changed that policy in May, infuriating the players, including many who did not protest during the national anthem last season. Right on cue, the president declared victory. Mr. Trump said he was pleased with the N.F.L.’s new policy, but said he did not think the players should even be staying in the locker room in protest. If a player is not standing for the national anthem, Mr. Trump said, “Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.” If the owners thought the problem would be solved by tweaking their policy, they were wrong. They should have known better, even without Mr. Lurie’s warning. (Mr. Lurie took his own advice: In a statement issued Monday night, the Eagles thanked their fans but never mentioned the president.) Mr. Trump has been fighting the league since the 1980s when, as the owner of the New Jersey Generals of the short-lived U.S.F.L., he successfully sued the league for violating antitrust laws. The victory was hollow. The upstart league won $3 in damages and collapsed. Mr. Trump has tried to buy N.F.L. teams over the years, but has been spurned, though he does remain friends with several owners, most notably Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots. Things changed once he became president. He has attacked the league mercilessly, poking at Mr. Goodell and taking glee in the league’s television ratings falling. He even floated the idea of removing some of the league’s tax exemptions.","Some players knelt during the national anthem before N.F.L. games last season, riling President Trump.",2018-06-05T21:52:19Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On Pro Football: The N.F.L.

Devin Coldewey,"A federal body overseeing labor disputes advised the dismissal of Jeremy Damore’s claim that Google fired him unjustly for his controversial memo regarding inclusion and diversity programs at the company. Citing similar precedents, the National Labor Relations Board counsel deemed parts of the memo “so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive” as to shed their status as protected speech in the workplace. The NLRB memo, issued on January 16 and published publicly yesterday, does not constitute an official ruling or legal action. It is however the official advice of a federal lawyer who specializes in this field, and its conclusion, that the complaint be dismissed, would likely have been followed by the regional board being advised. Instead, Damore withdrew the complaint. In her handling of the complaint, Jayme Sophir (Associate General Counsel of the NLRB’s Division of Advice) examined the public documents relating to the case — viz. the memo itself and the post by CEO Sundar Pichai, among other things — and internal ones, such as posts to employee forums and emails sent to and from Damore and others. Sophir found that Damore’s memo contained a great deal of protected speech, as he clearly seems deeply concerned with company policies that he thinks discriminatory. His opinions on those programs and advice for Google regarding them are certainly protected, she found, and an email from an HR manager to Damore emphasizes this (brackets NLRB’s): I want to make clear that our decision is based solely on the part of your post that generalizes and advances stereotypes about women versus men. It is not based in any way on the portions of your post that discuss [the Employer’s] programs or trainings, or how [the Employer] can improve its inclusion of differing political views. Those are important points. But she also cited several precedents where employees, in the course of “concerted activities regarding working conditions,” exceeded the bounds of protected speech, such as accusations that a foreman was a Klansman, or making degrading allusions to a co-worker’s sexual orientation. These forms of speech could be banned and the speakers in question disciplined or fired “as a reasonable precaution against discord and bitterness.” Portions of Damore’s memo fell under the same category as these examples, Sophir found (brackets mine to interpret redacted portions). The Charging Party’s use of stereotypes based on purported biological differences between women and men should not be treated differently than the types of conduct the Board found unprotected in these cases. [Damore’s] statements about immutable traits linked to sex—such as women’s heightened neuroticism and men’s prevalence at the top of the IQ distribution—were discriminatory and constituted sexual harassment, notwithstanding [his] effort to cloak [his] comments with “scientific” references and analysis, and notwithstanding [his] “not all women” disclaimers. Google’s firing of Damore, therefore, was justified. (Pichai has said he doesn’t regret it, either.) Damore’s defenders have steadfastly maintained that the memo does not say outright that women are biologically less suited to engineering than men, and that critics are being uncharitable in their reading of his arguments. While that may stand up in comment section arguments, it’s harder to assert that Sophir, an expert in the field who evaluates such situations for her profession, failed to closely read the memo. The charge that Google violated the law in firing Damore was advised to be dismissed, should he not withdraw the complaint — which he did. The case was closed on January 19, three days after the NLRB’s memo was issued. It’s not the end of the road for Damore, though this decisive refutation of his complaint is a significant and public setback. He has also filed a class action lawsuit against the company and is agitating in other ways against the political correctness he feels led to his dismissal.

"Katia Hetter, CNN","Katia Hetter, CNN • Updated 21st April 2018 (CNN) — Yosemite National Park has almost everything a nature lover could desire in an outdoor destination : Glorious waterfalls, spectacular meadows and valleys, groves of ancient sequoias and the wildlife that call the park home. Of course, Half Dome looms large for visitors. Each year, thousands of seasoned hikers make it to the summit 8,800 feet above sea level, climbing the last 400 feet on metal cables installed to allow hikers to reach the peak without rock climbing gear. The round trip takes most hikers 10 to 12 hours and permits are required. But as seasonal ranger Kirsten Randolph can attest, the park offers many stunning settings beyond this granite dome. Yosemite National Park exists because President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill creating the Yosemite Land Grant on June 30, 1864. The legislation, which included Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, marks the first time the federal government had set aside a piece of land purely for preservation. That act is generally believed to mark the worldwide birth of the national parks idea. Yosemite National Park was officially created in 1890, although the Valley and Mariposa Grove were still managed by the state of California at that time. These two areas were ceded to the federal government in 1906, creating the park much as it exists today. Park stats : Yosemite National Park is the third most visited national park in the countr y with 3.8 million visitors last year (behind Great Smoky Mountains and Grand Canyon national parks). The park encompasses nearly 1,200 square miles. The location: The Sierra Nevada mountain range in eastern California. If you go: The park entrance fee is $20 per private car, van, pickup or RV. The fee is $10 a person if arriving on foot, horseback, bicycle, motorcycle or noncommercial bus. Visitors 15 and younger can enter for free. Campground fees vary and reservations for campgrounds that require them go fast and are strongly recommended. Meet our ranger: Park ranger Randolph didn't grow up watching television or playing video games. Instead, Randolph played outside with her sister and family in Spokane, Washington, visiting Olympic National Park and other national parks for their vacations. ""I thought how neat it would be to live and work in a national park someday,"" said Randolph, 26. ""The rangers at all the parks seemed to be pretty cool."" She started at Yosemite as an intern, working on young visitor programming. After interning and volunteering for a full year, she got hired as a seasonal park ranger. She doesn't see herself leaving anytime soon. ""Yosemite provides a unique opportunity to enjoy nature and wildlife and have interaction with visitors,"" she says. ""I love witnessing how a first-time visitor connects with this place."" For a day trip, don't miss: Cook's Meadow. You can take the one-mile Cook's Meadow Loop through the meadow. Then make make your way to the base of Yosemite Falls on the Lower Yosemite Fall Trail. Take a drive to see the iconic view at Glacier Point to see how large Yosemite is and catch an impressive view of Half Dome. During the summer, drive along Tioga Road, where the habitat is very different because you're so high in elevation. Head into one of the sequoia groves, such as Mariposa Grove or the less visited Tuolumne or Merced groves. Favorite less-traveled spot: Take the free park shuttle to stop 16 (at Happy Isles) and walk to a marshy meadow called the Fen. ""There's a little bit of a spring underneath that keeps it green all year round,"" says Randolph. ""It's possible to see wildlife all year around this green meadow near Glacier Point."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Cook's Meadow is where Randolph saw her first bear on the job and where she spotted a rare Virginia rail bird. Even though it's in the middle of everything, ""animals are still drawn to it around sunset or at night,"" she says. ""Our wildlife don't like to be out in the hot sun any more than we do."" Most magical moment in the park: No surprise that it's Cook's Meadow (again) for this ranger: Two months ago, that's where her fiance, a park law enforcement officer, proposed to her in the lush green grasses growing in spring. ""Yosemite Falls and Half Dome were in the background,"" she says. Favorite other park to visit: Pinnacles National Park (California). Set aside as a national monument by Theodore Roosevelt in 1908, Pinnacles National Monument was elevated to become the nation's 59th national park (and California's ninth national park) on February 11, 2013. If you visit, you might see endangered California condors, as Randolph did when she and her fiance went camping there last fall. That's because the 27,000-acre park is home to 63 California condors and is one of four condor release sites in the country. What is your favorite national park or national park site and why?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The plane came down in a field near Havana's main airport Two days of national mourning have begun in Cuba after a Boeing 737 airliner crashed near the main airport in Havana, killing more than 100 people. The plane, which was nearly 40 years old, was carrying 105 passengers and six crew members. Three women were pulled alive from the wreckage, but they are said to be in a critical condition. President Miguel Diaz-Canel said an investigation was under way. The crash is Cuba's worst air disaster in decades. What do we know about the dead? Most of the passengers killed are believed to be Cubans, though reports say five foreigners and a six-strong Mexican crew were also on board. Argentina's government said two of its nationals - tourists Dora Beatriz Cifuentes and Oscar Hugo Almaras, both in their sixties - were among the dead. Relatives of the victims have started arriving in Havana to help identify the deceased. Those coming from Holguín - the plane's intended destination - and other eastern parts of the island made the 700km (435-mile) trip on buses. Cuba's National Revolutionary Police escorted them to speed their way, EFE news agency reports.

How did the plane come down? The Boeing 737-201 crashed at 12:08 (16:08 GMT) on Friday, shortly after taking off from Havana on an internal flight to Holguín. It's too early to say what caused the crash, but eyewitnesses on the ground described seeing the jet burst into flames before crashing into a field close to a wooded area near the airport.

""All of a sudden, it made a turn, and went down. We were all amazed."" ""We heard an explosion and then saw a big cloud of smoke go up,"" Gilberto Menendez, who runs a restaurant near the crash site, told Reuters. Mexico's transport department said on its website that ""during take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground"". Boeing said that it was ready to send a technical team to Cuba, ""as permitted under US law and at the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Cuban authorities"". A US trade embargo has been in force against Cuba for many decades. What about the survivors? Four people initially survived the crash but one died after being transported to hospital, the director of Havana's Calixto Garcia hospital, Carlos Alberto Martinez, told Reuters. The three survivors are all women, according to Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma: one aged between 18 and 25, one in her thirties and the third aged 39.

Analysis: Grieving public demand answers By Will Grant, BBC Cuba Correspondent Two days of national mourning have begun, with the entire island sharing a little of the pain of the many families affected by the disaster. But in their grief, people also want answers. They are demanding an explanation as to why a routine flight from Havana came crashing down in a field barely a minute after it took off, with over 100 passengers and crew on board. The country's new president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, faces his first real test in providing those answers. He visited the crash site to thank the emergency services and announced an investigation was already under way. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Flags are flying at half-mast in Cuba as the island grieves the disaster It emerged that the previous president, Raúl Castro, was recuperating from minor surgery on a hernia, and he too expressed his condolences to the victims' families. The families of the survivors face an anxious wait to see if they will pull through, and their countrymen are praying that at least some will have survived this catastrophe. What do we know about the plane? The plane had been leased to state airline Cubana de Aviación by the Mexican company Aerolineas Damojh. The Mexican authorities said the plane was built in 1979 and had been successfully inspected last November. Mexico earlier said it was sending two civil aviation specialists to join the investigation. Aerolineas Damojh, also known as Global Air, has three planes in operation. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Crowds of shocked onlookers gathered at the crash site How does this compare to recent plane crashes? According to industry research, last year was the safest in history for commercial airline travel with no passenger jet crashes. But there have been several serious air disasters this year. Last month, a military plane crashed shortly after take-off in Algeria, killing more than 250 people In February, a Saratov Airlines plane crashed near Moscow, killing 71 people In March, a US-Bangla Airlines flight crashed in Kathmandu, Nepal; 51 people died Cuba's deadliest air crash was in 1989, when a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana, killing 126 people on board and another 24 people on the ground.","Two days of national mourning are declared, after the crash near Havana killed more than 100 people.",2018-05-19T16:47:19Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Cuba plane crash: Island starts two days of national mourning,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-44184751,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p067n05q.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Efforts to save the critically-endangered black rhino appear cursed. Conservation nonprofit African Parks and South African National Parks, along with the governments of South Africa and Chad, confirmed Friday that two more black rhinos have died in Zakouma National Park in Chad. The news follows confirmation of two other rhino carcasses in the park in October. That means four out of the six rhinos translocated to Chad from South Africa in Maya move conservationists celebrated because the species is extinct in the north-central African countryare now dead. None of the deaths are a result of poaching, which is whats historically driven black rhinos to the brink of extinction. For the two recent deaths, vets believe starvation may be to blame. The animals may not have adapted well to their new environment in the park. Further tests are needed to be certain. As for the two remaining rhinos, the plan is to recapture them and hold them for further monitoring. Park staff already captured one as of Friday. However, after the first deaths were confirmed, the partnership said the other four rhinos were supposed to be closely monitored, per African Parks, and yet two more died. The International Rhino Foundation, which was uninvolved in this incident, is still trying to learn more about what happened. A statement sent to Earther explains that while many translocations occur each year without a hitch, they are not always easy to pull off. Complications can arise, especially with long-distance translocations, and every contingency must be considered, the statement reads. Setbacks should not dissuade the conservation community from restocking populations to expand rhino range. While the population of black rhinos is increasing according to the IUCN Red List, only about 5,000 black rhinos remain, making them the third most endangered rhino species on Earth. Most deaths occurred between 1960 and 1995 when the population dropped by 98 percent due to poaching. Recent efforts to save them have been backfiring spectacularly. In July, 10 out of 11 black rhinos died during a transport between parks in Kenya due to deadly salty drinking water. They were already stressed and starved from the move, but this overly salty water pushed them over the edge. Adding insult to injury, the long survivor was attacked by a lion. Hopefully, theres no one to blame but Mother Nature for these last four deaths.","Efforts to save the critically-endangered black rhino appear cursed.

"Matt Novak on Paleofuture, shared by Hudson Hongo to Gizmodo","Jeffrey T. Richelson wrote over a dozen books about national security, nuclear weapons, and agencies like the CIA and KGB—books that were often the product of incredible new revelations obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Richelson, a legend to FOIA advocates and anyone else with an interest in national security, died this past weekend at the age of 67. Richelson died of cancer at his home in Los Angeles on November 11th, according to a report from the National Security Archive. Richelson was a senior fellow at the Archive since the 1990s and contributed countless articles that furthered the public’s knowledge about everything from American espionage to space travel. While Richelson wasn’t a household name, his research would smash into the mainstream in 2013 when his FOIA requests about UFOs led to the declassification of CIA documents about Area 51. That research expanded knowledge about the secretive machinations behind the U-2 and Area 51, along with top secret aircraft testing in Nevada. I spoke with Richelson earlier this year about a film that I obtained through my own FOIA request to the National Nuclear Security Administration. Richelson’s book Defusing Armageddon is a fascinating glimpse into the world of secretive nuclear detectives who are dispatched by the US government whenever a nuclear threat is posed within America’s borders. If you’ve never read any of Richelson’s work I can’t recommend Defusing Armageddon highly enough. Richelson’s other books are widely available on Amazon and each offer a special behind-the-scenes look into the national security establishment. His insights and dogged pursuit of secret government documents through FOIA will be missed. You can read more about Richelson over at the National Security Archive.

And more than 80 percent of millennials, soon to be the largest cohort of voters (if they ever turn out), believe there’s solid evidence behind these freakish manifestations of an overheated earth.

Micah Singleton,"On Saturday, the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) announced that songwriters will get a pay raise from streaming services for the next five years, increasing their rate from 10.5 percent of revenue to 15.1 percent, a 43.8 percent increase. The shift, which is the largest increase in CRB history, came as a result of a dispute between the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) and the music streaming services run by Apple, Google, Spotify, Amazon, and Pandora. The ruling also included a late fee for streaming services that don’t pay publishers and songwriters on time. “This is the best mechanical rate scenario for songwriters in U.S. history which is critically important as interactive streaming continues to dominate the market,” NMPA CEO David Israelite said in a statement. Publishers and songwriters are still paid far less than music labels, however; labels take in $3.82 for every $1 for publishers and songwriters make. The NMPA was looking for a per-stream rate for songwriters — which likely would’ve shrunk that pay gap even further — but the CRB didn’t grant that request. The move comes on the heels of the Music Modernization Act, which would streamline music royalties and create a new agency that would collect and distribute royalties to rights holders.","The shift, which is the largest increase in CRB history, came as a result of a dispute between the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) and the music streaming services run by Apple, Google, Spotify, Amazon, and Pandora.",2018-01-29T16:13:03Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Songwriters are getting a huge pay raise from streaming services,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16945060/songwriters-pay-raise-crb-streaming-services,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMv81tmquRqdK4lejeQ4hkVVPc=/0x253:4203x2454/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10115705/911533714.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,National,1
ALEX MARSHALL,"“If you don’t like the national anthem from the politically correct perspective of all this gender nonsense, then don’t sing it,” the far-right party Alternative for Germany said in a statement on Facebook. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman felt the need to reassure the country. “The chancellor is very happy with our nice national anthem as it is,” he said. Other German politicians have agreed. “Anthems are not written for the moment,” Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, general secretary of Ms. Merkel’s party and seen as her likely heir, said in a statement. “I wouldn’t want our anthem to be changed just so it fits in with the zeitgeist.” The anthem has a difficult history, she added, and has to be put in context. It was originally written in 1841 to help unite Germany’s states, but its opening verse, which included the line “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles” (“Germany, Germany, above all else”), gained sinister connotations under the Nazis and stopped being sung after World War II. The anthem was again adopted for the united Germany after the Berlin Wall fell. “Our national anthem is a piece of history itself,” Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said. Ms. Rose-Möhring’s feelings about the controversy are unknown — the Family Ministry said she would not comment — but those who have succeeded in changing anthems before said it could take years, even decades, to achieve the change if she decides to push her suggestion. Members of Parliament sing Austria's anthem. Video by Anjobi Videoarchiv “I’m not surprised by the big discussion it’s caused, and I’m not surprised the politicians said no — I only succeeded the second time,” said Maria Rauch-Kallat, a former Austrian politician who led efforts to get her country’s anthem changed, with the result that Austrians now sing about their “great daughters” as well as their “great sons.” Nancy Ruth, a former Canadian senator who spearheaded the campaign to make “O Canada” gender-neutral, said she felt all anthems that excluded women should be changed. “What’s my reaction to this?” she asked, before answering her own question using an expletive and expressing frustration about the debate. “Oh, grow up,” she added, addressing those against change. The easiest way to realize the power of a word like “fatherland” was to ask men if they would be happy singing about their motherland instead, she said. Changing an anthem requires a long campaign, she added: “It takes until you have a leader, with a majority, who truly wants equality among the sexes.” Canadian feminists started calling for “O Canada” to be made gender neutral in 1980 and it took Justin Trudeau’s election in 2015 for them to succeed. Angela Merkel was not in a position to offer such leadership given her recent electoral struggles, the former lawmaker said. She recommended that Ms. Rose-Möhring start singing her own words and hope others follow. The Spanish singer Marta Sánchez added words to her country's anthem. Video by La Vanguardia Not all efforts to change Europe’s anthems involve gender. Last month, the pop singer Marta Sánchez prompted debate in Spain by singing lyrics to her country’s wordless anthem (“I come home to my beloved homeland, where my heart was born,” she began). The country’s anthem has been wordless since it was first played at in an official occasion in 1770. Words were used during the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, but not officially adopted, and any new ones could prompt concern from, say, Catalans and Basques. Bosnia’s anthem is also wordless, to keep a lid on potential conflicts. Some Bosnians are calling for lyrics to be added, but ethnic splits mean agreement on a set of official words looks impossible, with some Bosnian Serbs not wanting to give the country a more effective symbol. The winner of a contest for new lyrics to the Swiss national anthem, in the country's four official languages. Video by CHymne Swiss campaigners are arguably undertaking the most comprehensive effort to change a national anthem. In 2013, they held a contest to find new words to their God and weather-obsessed anthem, the “Swiss Psalm.” They have since been trying to cajole people into singing them. Last year, a Christian group ran a postcard campaign against the new words. Lukas Niederberger, director of the Swiss Society for Public Good, the organization behind the contest, said the idea of changing Germany’s anthem seemed sensible. “I think for a modern society, the central text of the culture should be politically correct,” he said. Change shouldn’t be hard, he added. “It’s not like they’re saying change the whole text, just adapting a few words. It’s really no big deal.” A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2018, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: No More ‘Fatherland’? Germans Take Up the Debate.

Patrick Allan,"National Novel Writing Month is all about putting your head down and cranking out as many words as you can, but it can still be fun to make it a social experience, too. A write-in is just what you need to keep you and your fellow scribblers motivated. Here’s how to set one up: This year, I will write my tenth terrible novel. I do this every November; it’s part of the… Read more Read Choose a Place With Lots of Places to Plug in and Sit First thing’s first, you need to pick a venue for your write-in. Wherever you do it—a coffee shop, library, or someone’s house (which is what I do)—make sure it’s a place with lots of places to sit and write, as well as lots of places to plug in laptops and tablets. No matter where you end up choosing, make sure you have some power strips on hand, and maybe an extra charger in case someone forgets to bring theirs. No excuses for anyone to not be writing! Also, if you do decided to meet up in a public place, you absolutely must let the establishment know you have a group of people coming in at a specific time. That gives them time to set up and prepare. And if you’ll be at a place that sells food or drink, encourage everyone to buy something. It’s only right. Lay Out Some Inspiring Books and Writing References At the last write-in I attended, the host had pulled out all of her books on writing she could find and stacked them up in the middle of the big table everyone wrote at. There were books on story structure, character development, grammar, and even references for names. It was a great idea, and it made me realize that sometimes writer’s block can be shattered with a quick peek in a reference book. It’s not a bad idea to have a book or print out of nothing but story prompts either. A little nudge can make all the difference. Do you have the first 1,667 words of your novel in a Google doc? A note on your phone? Or perhaps… Read more Read Have Everyone Share What They’re Working on The best part of a write-in is getting to talk to others about your project, and hear what they’re working on. To kick off your session, have everyone go around and introduce themselves and briefly explain their story. Questions and discussion are encouraged as long as things are kept positive and nobody is questioning creative directions. The idea is to get everyone motivated, not make people feel bad about what they’re writing. Provide a Simple Meal or Easy to Munch on Snacks Writers need fuel. If you’re at a cafe, coffee shop, or restaurant, encourage people to buy things from the establishment. But if you’re at home, provide a meal that’s quick and easy to eat while you all work. Pizza is an easy go-to—all you need is plates and napkins—but it can be something lighter if that’s people want. Any dish that can be eaten without a bunch of extra utensils or special actions is what you want to aim for. Snacks are also good to have around as long as they aren’t too messy. Something salty and crunchy is perfectly satisfying, just skip the chips and crackers that leave traces of themselves on people’s hands. It’s hard to keep typing when you constantly have cheese dust on your fingertips. Pretzels, almonds, and grapes are solid options. Julian Gough, Irish novelist, memoirist, poet, and playwright, gives densely packed advice in his… Read more Read Play Some Writing Games to Get the Creative Juices Flowing The hardest part about writing is often getting started. You know what story you want to tell, but you don’t know how to begin. Writing games can help—or at least get you in the right mindset so you can break through that barrier more easily. Here are a few writing game examples: Word War : NaNoWriMo is all about getting that word count, so this game is a flat out race of who can write the most words in a certain amount of time. It can be based on generic writing prompts that are handed out to everyone, or it can be part of your novel’s word count. Set a timer for 15 minutes and see who comes out on top. Story Objects : Have a pile of paper slips with an object written on each one. People have to choose a slip randomly and find a way to incorporate that object into the section of the story they’re working on. I often find giving myself another problem to solve in a scene makes it more fun to write. And when you’re having fun with your writing, it usually makes it more fun to read. Share-agraph : At a random point in the evening, tell everyone to stop writing (shouting “pencils down!” is optional). At that point, each writer has to read their last complete paragraph out loud to the group. It’s always interesting to hear what other people are writing, and sometimes inspiration can strike while you listen. Nobody has to read if they don’t want to. No matter what games you choose to play, I recommend having some very basic prizes to really get people in the spirit. Pens, notepads, sticky notes, reference books, and other writing-focused gifts are ideal. And don’t play all of the games at once! Use them as breaks throughout the write-in so people use them as a time to refresh their minds with a fresh injection of motivation. Have you hosted a write-in for NaNoWriMo?

The document labels China and Russia as ""rival powers"" and lays out a number of potential threats they pose. The new strategy said Beijing and other governments were determined to challenge American power. But China's foreign ministry criticised the strategy report, saying Washington should ""abandon outdated notions"". Spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: ""No country or report will succeed in distorting facts or deploying malicious slander. ""We urge the US side to stop intentionally distorting China's strategic intentions and to abandon outdated ideas of Cold War mentality and the zero-sum game."" Russia also responded to the new strategy by saying it ""cannot accept"" that it is treated as a threat. It also criticised what it said was the ""imperialist character"" of the document. In the new US national security strategy, China and Russia are said to ""challenge American power, influence and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity"". ""They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence."" The new national security strategy contains a range of claims about China, including: China and Russia ""are developing advanced weapons and capabilities"" that could threaten the US Competitors such as China ""steal US intellectual property valued at hundreds of billions of dollars"" China and Russia are investing in the developing world ""to expand influence and gain competitive advantages"" over the US In Europe, China is gaining a foothold ""by expanding its unfair trade practices and investing in key industries"" China also ""seeks to pull the [Central America] region into its orbit through state-led investments and loans"" Some of the claims have been made before, but the new document casts them as part of a battle for dominance. Media caption Analysis: Trump's plan to confront - and sometimes work with - US rivals Ahead of the document's publication, there were reports that the National Security Strategy would classify China as an economic ""aggressor"", but that did not appear in the final version. Strategy documents are often released with little ceremony, but President Trump appeared at a special event to mark the release of the new strategy. In a speech about his new strategy, Mr Trump said the US faced a new era of competition, and that China and Russia were the primary threats to US economic dominance. But, he said, the US must attempt to build a ""great partnership with them"". Mr Trump described ""four pillars"" to his new plan: protecting the homeland, promoting American prosperity, demonstrating peace through strength and advancing American influence. The 68-page document, which White House officials began work on 11 months ago, suggests a return to Mr Trump's campaign promise of ""America First"". Media caption Donald Trump: 'America first, America first' In his speech, Mr Trump referred to his election victory, saying that in 2016 voters chose to ""Make America Great Again"". Previous American leaders had ""drifted"" and ""lost sight of America's destiny"" he said, standing before a backdrop of American flags. ""Now less than one year later I am proud to report that the entire world has heard the news and has seen the signs,"" he said. ""America is coming back and America is coming back strong."" He also outlined his campaign promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico, as well as reform of the immigration visa system. The new policy stresses economic security but does not recognise climate change as a national security threat. His predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015 declared climate change an ""urgent and growing threat to our national security"".","After being labelled a rival power, China says the US should ""abandon outdated notions"".",2017-12-19T11:16:10Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",China condemns US 'Cold War mentality' on national security,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42409148,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/B349/production/_99279854_gettyimages-872040216.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1

Back Story The Times headline was unassuming in its brevity: “ Claude Monet dies; famous painter.” A week after the French artist died on this day in 1926, we were more effusive, praising Monet as “one of the names in the history of art to which will be attached a single idea, the idea of light.” Photo Claude Monet in an undated photograph, most likely taken in the 1920s. Credit Theresa Bonney/The New York Times Born in 1840, he was famous for outdoor scenes and for reproducing the effects of light, whether on water lilies, haystacks or the cities of Europe. Impressionism, the name of the movement he helped found in the 1870s, was derived from “Impression, Sunrise,” the title of his painting of the harbor of Le Havre in France. Coined derisively by a critic, the name was adopted by Monet and his fellow Impressionists, including Pierre Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro. Almost a century after his death, Monet still captures the public’s imagination. Last year, his painting “Meule” fetched $81.4 million with fees, a new auction high for his work. The painting of a grainstack at sunset reflected the artist’s long fascination with light. “These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me,” Monet wrote in 1909. “It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel.” _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated all morning.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption President Trump received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos US President Donald Trump was greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos as he took to the field for the national anthem during a college football game in Atlanta. But as The Star-Spangled Banner began to play, social media users turned their attention to his anthem etiquette. Mr Trump's supporters said they were proud to see him standing with his hand over his heart, while his critics said it looked as though he had forgotten the lyrics. Did he forget the words? He certainly didn't sing all of them. Video of the anthem shows Mr Trump getting off to a slow start. He appears to mouth some of the words while occasionally pausing and missing some out. Some lines and phrases are sung with gusto. The president can clearly be seen mouthing ""bright stars"" and he finishes with a flourish, smiling and singing ""the land of the free and the home of the brave"". Other lines are not sung at all. Whether or not he forgot the words is open for debate. He has been pictured singing the anthem it in the past and has been vocal in his support of respecting it. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has a theory that singing along in this instance is difficult for two reasons: Skip Twitter post by @awzurcher For those grousing about Trump seemingly not knowing the words to the national anthem: 1) He's hard of hearing and 2) down on the field, the sound bounces around a lot and it's hard to decipher the music. Singing along wouldn't be easy for him. — Anthony Zurcher (@awzurcher) January 9, 2018 End of Twitter post by @awzurcher But other social media users were slightly less forgiving: What is the US president expected to do? The Flag Code covers aspects of etiquette when the anthem is played in some detail. The code is never enforced, however, and there is no punishment for breaching it. In the video, the president can be seen standing in the customary way, as stipulated by the code. It states that: During a rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. By contrast, his predecessor President Barack Obama famously neglected to put his hand over his heart during the 2008 election campaign. He said his grandfather had taught him to do this only during the pledge, and to only sing during the anthem. The code adds that military personnel and veterans should salute throughout the anthem. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Civilians should stand with right hand over heart and military personnel should salute It makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung. However, singing the Star-Spangled Banner is encouraged from school onwards - in some schools it is compulsory. In 1942 the National Anthem Committee wrote that ""it is of paramount importance that emphasis be placed upon the singing of the National Anthem"". Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice as to whether the president sings the anthem or just stands respectfully. Barack Obama has done both, and said in 2016 that ""respecting and honouring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation"". Former President Ronald Reagan once said: ""I can't claim to know the words of all the national anthems in the world, but I don't know of any other that ends with a question and a challenge as ours does."" What has Mr Trump said about the anthem? The president has been extremely vocal in urging respect for the US national anthem. On Monday, he tweeted: We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!"". He has even changed the banner image on his Twitter account to a photograph of him standing during the anthem before the game. Image copyright Twitter/@realDonaldTrump Image caption The banner image on the president's Twitter account is a photograph of him during the national anthem Mr Trump has also strongly criticised NFL stars kneeling during the anthem in protest against perceived racial injustice. He has previously insisted that players who fail to stand should be fired or suspended.",Critics of the president say it looked like he forgot the words before a college football game.,2018-01-09T10:49:14Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Did President Trump forget the words to the national anthem?,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42619347,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05t7pvb.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
ROSS DOUTHAT,"There were good reasons to be skeptical of this promise. The presidency’s powers (over foreign policy especially) have waxed as Congress’s have waned, the bully pulpit belongs to the White House, and since Trump’s populist ideas on economics were more popular than the existing G.O.P. agenda, it was easy to see how he could roll over efforts at containment. But a year later, the project of containment has been much more successful than its critics feared. Here is a short list of moves — some authoritarian, some just destabilizing — that Trump promised or threatened during the campaign: reinstating waterboarding and allowing torture, even over military objections; shaking up NATO and striking a deal that abandons American allies to a Russian sphere of influence; pulling the United States out of Nafta; changing libel laws to make it easier to bankrupt his critics in the press; launching a major trade war with China; pulling the United States out of the Iranian nuclear deal; installing cronies and relatives in high judicial posts; banning Muslim entry to the United States; and deporting millions of illegal immigrants in an enormous sweep. A year later none of these things have happened; few have even been meaningfully attempted. In almost every case the establishment Republicans crowding his cabinet or influencing him from the Senate have had a gentling or restraining (or, from an alt-right perspective, cucking) effect upon Trump’s presidency. You could argue, if you squint, that versions of the last two policies have been pursued — but even there the case is weak, the Trump administration’s behavior less than authoritarian. The travel ban the White House put forward affected a small fraction of the world’s Muslims and has been easily impeded in the courts. Likewise, interior immigration enforcement has become more aggressive and punitive than under Barack Obama — but this increase in arrests has already run into a bureaucratic and judicial backlog that will make mass deportation impossible unless Trump actually short-circuits the judicial process … which, to date, he conspicuously has not. So for the kind of Atlantic-reading, Whole Foods-shopping, Trump-skeptical Republican whom Wittes and Rauch are addressing, the trend in Trumpian policy offers considerable evidence that their elected representatives’ promise to constrain the president’s actions (if not his words) is actually being kept. So, too, with the specific cases that the Atlantic essay focuses on: Trump’s insouciance about Russian interference in the last presidential election, and his continuing attacks on law enforcement professionals over the probe into his campaign’s possible involvement with that interference. Just consider the following caveat that Wittes and Rauch append to their brief: We don’t mean to deny credit where it is due. … Last year, pressure from individual Republicans seemed to discourage Trump from firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and probably prevented action against Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Moreover, Republicans as a group have constrained Trump on occasion. Congress imposed tough sanctions on Russia over the president’s objections. The Senate Intelligence Committee conducted a serious Russia investigation under the leadership of Richard Burr. But the broader response to Trump’s behavior has been tolerant and, often, enabling. So according to authors who are trying to convince Trump-skeptical Republicans to vote against every single G.O.P. politician on principle, many Trump-era Republicans have 1) defended and protected a sweeping probe into their president’s campaign and possibly his family’s finances; 2) passed legislation punishing Russia for its interference; and 3) conducted a “serious Russia investigation” from within the United States Senate. All of which seems like … quite a bit? Perhaps even a sign that many prominent Republicans are not really just “enabling” Trump at all? Now it’s quite true that other Republicans, especially in the House, have run interference for Trump’s attacks on Mueller’s probe, and encouraged rank-and-file conservatives and frequent “Hannity” viewers to believe the worst about the F.B.I. and other “deep state” organs. But partisan attacks on a special counsel’s probe are not the same thing as a sustained presidential assault on democratic institutions. Nor are angry presidential tweets that lack any sustained follow-through: If the president yells about his persecutors and little or nothing happens — the Mueller probe continues, Rod Rosenstein keeps his job, etc. — what’s undermined is presidential authority, not the rule of law. And if many House Republicans are working to enable Trump’s authoritarian instincts while various Senate Republicans work to constrain them, surely that’s cause for precisely the kind of discriminating thinking that Wittes and Rauch want their Republican readers to rule out — for praising Richard Burr and criticizing Devin Nunes, let’s say, or for hoping Republicans keep the Senate while not minding if they lose the House, or otherwise judging conservative leaders case by case rather than insisting that they’re all rubber-stamping an incipient dictatorship. All judgments about a year-old presidency are provisional. It is very easy to imagine a scenario in which the Wittes and Rauch argument would become persuasive. For instance, if Trump were to actually fire Rosenstein and Mueller and close down the Russia investigation and Senate Republicans did nothing. Or, to be a little more imaginative, if Trump started overruling his own foreign policy team and making various unwarranted, Manchurian-candidate-style concessions to the Russians, and the Senate simply went along. Or if he invaded a country and toppled its government without Senate approval, or if he began prosecuting journalists on dubious grounds, or if tried to unilaterally rewrite immigration laws, or if he ordered the C.I.A. to torture prisoners at black sites … … aah, sorry, I became carried away with memories of the last two administrations, neither of which corroded democratic norms through Twitter outbursts and personal sleaziness, to their credit, but both of which made big norm-eroding moves on other fronts that Trump has not yet come close to matching. Which is why, for now, the constant claims that Republicans are enabling an “ American Pinochet ” (as New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait suggested this week) and that honorable conservatives are therefore duty-bound to hand every elected office over to a Democratic Party that, as Wittes and Rauch themselves concede, has become more ideologically extreme — well, at best they are premature, based on things that haven’t happened yet but might; at worst they are a species of hysteria. I wish that Donald Trump were not the president; I blame Republicans for enabling his rise. But once his election was accomplished, their promise of containment became a reasonable approach. And so long as he remains weak and trammeled and conventional in policy, the case that conservatives have a moral obligation to vote like liberals won’t convince.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Roughly 40 of the 300 athletes in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, played for New York teams — not only the Jets and the Giants, but also the now-defunct Staten Island Stapletons, the New York Yankees, the New York Bulldogs, the New York Titans (now known as the Jets) and the Brooklyn Dodgers. We were there first. Both current New York teams, the Jets and the Giants, won the Super Bowl before the Eagles and the Patriots. The Jets’ win was in 1969; the Giants’ first, in 1987. (The Eagles have yet to win in the Super Bowl era.) Also on the list of Giants’ victories: two Super Bowl wins against the Patriots. The first time, in 2008, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City and Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston placed a bet on the outcome. After New York prevailed, Mr. Menino sent 100 cups of New England clam chowder, 144 Boston cream pies, and other local delicacies to Mr. Bloomberg. (The food was donated to charity.) And the last time the Patriots lost the Super Bowl, it was also to the Giants. When’s the game? The indoor game starts at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday on NBC. Here’s what else is happening: Weather Poor Groundhog. The cold continues with temperatures in the 20s. You may see some flurries during the morning commute. Skies are supposed to clear later, and the sunshine is expected to last through most of Saturday. On Sunday, we’re expecting a wintry mix of snow and rain again.

Patrick Allan,"Today is National Plan for Vacation Day, so bust out your calendar and start thumbing through those travel guides. You don’t want to let those precious vacation days go to waste just because you got too busy before you organized some much deserved R and R. I was reminded of today, my favorite of all fake marketing stunt holidays, by travel expert Samantha Brown. In a video from the Project: Time Off YouTube channel (above), Brown shares some of Project: Time Off’s alarming data. For example, 54 percent of Americans left 662 million vacation days unused in 2016. That’s roughly 1.8 million years of time not spent sipping margaritas or visiting grandma. I never expected the travel host I used to watch on TV after school would be scolding me for not taking enough vacation ( Passport to Europe with Samantha anyone?), but here we are—and she’s right. Why is planning your vacation early important? For starters, the more notice you can give work, the less stressed you’ll be about actually using your alloted days. Studies, like this one out of the Netherlands, suggest people find their vacations more enjoyable and more restorative when the time off itself isn’t causing them any stress. Planning early will also save you a ton of money in the long run. Between hotels, event venues, and flights, the earlier you can get things organized, the better for your wallet. Airbnb is even taking strides to appeal to you reluctant planners out there. Recently, they’ve started allowing guests to play less up front when booking, making the service feel a bit more like a hotel. The site lets guests book a place ahead of time without with minimal headaches if their plans fall through at the last minute, and helps keep hosts from losing out on advance bookings from “cash flow-sensitive guests.” So, now’s the time folks. Pick a destination (it can be home), make a goal for your time off (it can simply be to relax), give yourself ample time to let your time off sink in ( eight days or so should do it ), and give yourself an extra day buffer just in case (worst case scenario you have an extra day to just chill and get ready for your return to work).","Today is National Plan for Vacation Day, so bust out your calendar and start thumbing through those travel guides.

Mark Kaufman,"The National Park Service decided Thursday that it will raise fees at 117 national park sites, but the increases are quite modest compared to the previous proposal. Facing a more than $11 billion backlog in the upkeep of national parks, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke previously proposed raising fees to $70 in 17 of the most popular parks like Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon. The government allowed the public to weigh in on the fee increases, and the responses showed overwhelming opposition to the dramatic increase. SEE ALSO: Hey, how about we helicopter grizzly bears into this remote National Park? After being rebuffed, the Park Service will now increase fees by $5 per vehicle for 117 national park sites beginning on June 1, 2018. However, the service notes that two-thirds of parks will remain free. (That said, there are nuances in the fee increases for different parks, such as increases in annual passes, which can be found here.) ""We commend the administration for listening to the outcry of Americans who want their parks to remain affordable,"" John Garder, Senior Director of Budget and Appropriations at the National Parks Conservation Association, said in an interview. The Park Service estimates that this fee increase will bring in $60 million a year. When compared with the considerable maintenance backlog facing parks and their antiquated water, sewage, and transportation systems, along with general preservation needs, this amount is diminutive. ""Given the large scope of the maintenance backlog, amounts of money like this are not going to make an appreciable difference,"" said Garder. A park ranger standing in front of the Statue of Liberty. Image: John Moore/Getty Images Previously, former Park Service Director John Jarvis said that even a $70 million annual increase to $300 million in total collected fees each year wouldn't ""make much of a dent."" Interior Secretary Zinke, after hearing back from the public and reviewing matters, appears to accept this reality. ""The $11.6 billion maintenance backlog isn’t going to be solved overnight and will require a multi-tiered approach as we work to provide badly needed revenue to repair infrastructure,"" Zinke said in a statement. Garder noted that the fee increases will put more money into some parks, which could prove helpful, but dedicated funding from Congress is the only way to realistically solve the maintenance backlog problem. ""Congress needs to pass legislation with dedicated, robust, and reliable funding to address the deferred maintenance backlog,"" said Garder. One of the bills in Congress, the National Parks Legacy Act, has gained some support in Congress, but it's nowhere near a vote in either in the Senate or House. The bill would draw from the billions of dollars the federal government collects from companies who extract fossil fuels both onshore and offshore of the United States. Such a funding source might seem incongruous with the mission of Park Service, which is to promote conservation and stewardship of lands, as opposed to the extraction of resources. But the Park Service has few realistic options for obtaining a sizeable stream of cash. Fee increases aren't just unpopular — they won't do the trick.","The National Park Service decided Thursday that it will raise fees at 117 national park sites, but the increases are quite modest compared to the previous proposal.

Of his lack of resentment, he writes: “You don’t wipe tears on the sleeves of anger.” Said aloud, the words felt heavy with the kind of fresh pain that even the finest actor can’t quite replicate. The line between real and fictional anguish disappears in “C’est la vie” (“That’s Life”), the second of three productions the director Mohamed El Khatib is presenting in Paris this fall. It deals with bereavement, too, albeit unmoored from the public attention a national tragedy commands. Its two actors, Fanny Catel and Daniel Kenigsberg, have both lost a child: Ms. Catel’s daughter Joséphine died at age 5 of complications from Zellweger syndrome, a rare genetic disease, while Mr. Kenigsberg’s 25-year-old son Sam committed suicide in 2014. Mr. El Khatib has been prominently featured at this year’s Festival d’Automne à Paris, a large-scale, multidisciplinary event founded in 1972 that brings performances and exhibitions to a range of Paris venues every fall. In “Stadium,” shown at La Colline Théâtre National in October, the 37-year-old director invited 53 supporters of the RC Lens football club on stage to deconstruct stereotypes about the sport’s fans. “C’est la vie,” performed at the tiny Théâtre Ouvert before a transfer to the Espace Cardin, where it ran through Wednesday, stretches his brand of documentary fiction to breaking point; it asks valuable questions along the way, but provides few answers. Like “You Will Not Have My Hate,” “C’est la vie” attempts to make theater out of private tragedy. And like the other play, it sticks to its protagonists’ stories. At various points, Ms. Catel and Mr. Kenigsberg talk about their children’s deaths in prerecorded videos to avoid reliving the experience; they watch their testimony with the audience. The audience is repeatedly asked to refer to a booklet provided at the start of the performance in addition to the playbill, which includes email exchanges between Mr. El Khatib, Ms. Catel and Mr. Kenigsberg about the production, as well as family trees and a double page devoted to “fact-checking.” The latter records Mr. Kenigsberg’s objections to the way Mr. El Khatib shaped his story during the creation process, which suggests “C’est la vie” took some liberties with the truth. Was the duo acting after all? Were we witnessing a form of catharsis, or merely a staged form of confessional writing? When the bereaved parents didn’t return for curtain calls, the relief was palpable: Catharsis and confession are both admirable, as are Ms. Catel and Mr. Kenigsberg, but much of what they shared seemed ultimately to belong to the private sphere. Meanwhile, some of French theater’s best-known jokesters are tackling questions of public importance. Les Chiens de Navarre, a collective founded in 2005 by the director Jean-Christophe Meurisse, has become identified with the riotous absurdity and scatological stunts of productions like “Les danseurs ont apprécié la qualité du parquet” (“The Dancers Enjoyed the Quality of the Floor”) or “Une raclette” (named after a popular cheese dish). Their latest work marked a departure by focusing instead on a political lightning rod: the notion of national identity. The gamble paid off. “Jusque dans vos bras,” (“All the Way Into Your Arms”) which had its premiere at Lyon’s Nuits de Fourvière festival in June before traveling to the company’s usual Paris residence, the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, feels at once familiar and new. The episodic structure the Chiens favor, with an independent story in every scene, remains, and a group of longtime members, among them the superlative Céline Fuhrer and Maxence Tual, continue to set a high bar. On the other hand, some of the collective’s most recognizable faces (Thomas Scimeca, Anne-Elodie Sorlin) have been replaced for the occasion by new performers — including, for the first time, nonwhite actors, for a production that examines questions of racism in France. Making the audience uncomfortable is part of the Chiens’ playbook, and much of “Jusque dans vos bras,” through Dec. 2, is a wry exercise in privilege-checking. A ringmaster of sorts opened the performance by thanking the audience for “slumming it in this neighborhood,” namely La Chapelle, a neighborhood near the busy Gare du Nord train station with a significant migrant population. In another scene, some of the cast climbed into a boat and broke the fourth wall, asking the audience to intervene and rescue them by pulling a rope: An awkward moment of silence ensued before someone stood up to help. Les Chiens de Navarre’s comic timing is often delectably cruel: The actors took turns embodying the kind of narrow-mindedness that poses as common sense, and perhaps the audience recognized these attitudes in themselves. “I can’t be racist,” Mr. Tual announced at one point. “I spend New Year’s Eve in Marrakesh!” From the idea of “speaking Muslim” to urban myths about nannies of African descent, the dialogue was horrifyingly, hilariously politically incorrect, and peppered with pauses that allowed its fallacies to resonate. Some scenes proved less effective — sketches featuring Joan of Arc and Marie-Antoinette didn’t feel as urgent — but “Jusque dans vos bras” is razor-sharp when it excoriates everyday bigotry. In France especially, petty instincts butt heads with the lofty ideals of democracy and human rights that the nation defines itself by. The mirror the Chiens de Navarre hold up is all too faithful: As the theater audience stepped out into the neglected neighborhood of La Chapelle, the gap between them and the clusters of street peddlers across the street was plain to see.

JOLIE KERR,"Here are some of the things you might need for your clean-out: • Trash bags • Rubber or disposable gloves • A cooler • Cleaning solution • A Dobie Pad, sponges, rags or paper towels • Microfiber cloths Start by Taking Everything Out Yes, everything. You will be tempted to leave some things behind in the name of timesaving (“I can just clean around that box of baking soda.”) Resist this temptation! Removing everything from the icebox all at once will be far less time-consuming than trying to clean around anything. Plus, with everything out of the fridge, it will be easier to take stock of what will stay and what will get thrown out because you can turn a more critical eye to, say, your robust collection of jams and jellies when they’re out of their native environment. This directive also includes taking out any removable shelves, drawers or door inserts. (Cleaning tips for these below.) Do a First Pass at Inventorying Your Foodstuffs Transfer highly perishable items like milk, raw chicken or pork to a cooler or the freezer for the duration of your fridge-cleaning efforts (check those items for spoiling and toss anything that’s gone off). Then set aside bottles, jars, produce and the like, reviewing the food to weed out rotting, moldy or unused things that should go into the trash. Last, review leftovers. This will be, perhaps, unpleasant! Gloves can help to make scooping out old lasagna or soggy salad less disgusting. And, as facile as it sounds, holding a deep breath while decanting moldy foods into the trash will help minimize any stomach-turning. Time to Scrub Start with those shelves, drawers and door inserts you removed. You’ll want to wash them just like you wash dishes, using a sponge and dish soap. Because they’re oddly shaped and oversized items, you might find it easier to wash them in a bathtub or large utility sink, or even outdoors with a hose. Wearing utility clothing for this operation is a good idea, as you’re likely to wind up a bit waterlogged, with bits of old food on you, or possibly just a little sweaty. Once the removable parts are washed, dry them and set them aside. Now fill the sink about halfway up with water and a small amount of dish soap and place any now-empty storage containers in there for a soak while you turn your attention to the interior of the refrigerator. The soaking will expedite the process of washing the containers down the line. There are many good choices when it comes to a cleaning solution for the fridge, and you should take into account what makes you feel comfortable: Some people want the reassurance of a strong disinfectant like bleach, while others shudder at the idea of using bleach in the place where they store their food. Some options to consider are: diluted bleach or white vinegar (but never mix the two); a commercial all-purpose cleaner like Puracy Natural Multi-Surface Cleaner (the top pick from Wirecutter, the New York Times Company’s product review site); glass cleaner; a solution of dish soap and water. While the choice of cleaning solution is flexible, I strongly recommend using a Dobie Pad as a scrubbing tool. These sponges are excellent at scouring stuck-on food and spills from surfaces without scratching the plastic or glass. You can also use regular sponges, dish cloths or rags; an old toothbrush might also be useful if the design of your refrigerator has many nooks and crannies. Thin rags are great for cleaning the rubber seal around the door, where crumbs and all manner of other horrors lurk. For the exterior of your fridge, I recommend using a microfiber cloth, as it’s great at eliminating the streaks and fingerprints that so often mar the surface of stainless appliances. The exterior of plastic refrigerators can be cleaned in the same way as the interior; don’t forget to clean the top, where an unholy amount of grime has likely collected. Particularly Stubborn Spills and Stains Here’s an easy trick that will make short work of removing a badly stuck-on spill: Wet a sponge or rag with very hot water — being careful not to burn your hands — then wring it out and hold it on the sticky substance as you would a compress. The heat and moisture will reconstitute whatever it is that’s congealed, making it more pliable and easier to wipe up. For unrelenting spills, reapply the compress as needed. If the interior of your refrigerator has become stained, try a Magic Eraser to remove unsightly yellowing scuffs or stains left behind by brightly hued condiments (Sriracha, we’re looking at you). Wet the eraser, squeeze it out then rub it on the stain, just like a pencil eraser (note: it will disintegrate similarly). Now, Put Everything Back Start by returning the shelves and drawers and inserts to their places. Do you need to adjust shelf placement to make room for the large plucked bird that will call your refrigerator home shortly? This is a good time to do that. Next, review the condiments you didn’t throw out on your first pass. Open lids to check for mold and empties. Use a sponge or rag dampened with hot water to wipe the exterior of bottles free of sticky drips — don’t forget the bottoms — and tighten caps that haven’t been properly screwed on, so you can prevent future drips. (And here’s a quick trick if you have a mustard jar that’s nearly out: You can make a delicious salad dressing using mustard dregs by pouring oil and vinegar directly into an almost-empty jar, replacing the lid tightly and shake-shake-shaking.). Then, return produce, dairy, meat, drinks and the rest to the refrigerator. Advice for food storage According to the maker of Sub-Zero refrigerators, these are some of the best practices when it comes to food storage. A list of ethylene gas-producing foods can be found here. Wrapped raw meat and fish : Place on a plate or in a container to prevent drips. Store on the lowest shelf to keep drips from contaminating things below. Milk and other dairy : Place milk and other dairy-based foods deep on the shelves to avoid the temperature fluctuations that come with door shelves. Wrapped cheeses can also be stored in drawers. Jarred items like jellies, olives, dressings : These highly stable items can be stored in door shelves, where temperature changes won’t have as much of an effect. Lettuce and fresh herbs : Store in refrigerator drawers. Tomatoes: Store on countertop, away from ethylene gas-producing fruits and vegetables, unless very ripe. Berries : Store unwashed in refrigerator drawers. Wash just before eating. Ethylene gas-producing fruits and vegetables: Store these away from fruits and vegetables that are sensitive to ethylene, like avocados, mangos and tomatoes. Eggs: A still egg is a happy egg! Place eggs in a place where they won’t be disturbed. One Last Tip! Is your refrigerator too quick to turn into a horror show of liquefied lettuce and old taco meat? Add this step to your trash-day routine: Before you tie up the garbage bag, open the fridge and review what’s in there. Throw out anything that’s gone bad or you know you’re not going to eat. Make a mental note of lingering foods that you could incorporate into an upcoming meal. Lots of leftovers? Serve a leftovers buffet for dinner or transfer them into portable containers to bring to work for lunch. Continue reading the main story",Nov. 15 is National Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day.

EILEEN SULLIVAN and NOAH WEILAND,"WASHINGTON — The suspected hacking attempt of the Democratic National Committee’s voter database was a false alarm, and the unusual activity that raised concern was merely a test, a committee official said. The suspicious phishing activity detected this week had prompted the committee to contact the F.B.I. out of fears that it was another Russian attempt to penetrate the committee as Moscow did during the 2016 campaign. The test had similar attributes to an actual hacking, said Bob Lord, the committee’s chief security officer. It was not a test that the committee had authorized. Mr. Lord has referred to the database as “the party’s most sensitive information.” The jolts of panic underscored the continued fear of another major breach of the party’s systems just weeks before the midterm elections, even as computer security has been prioritized and shored up since 2016.

US President Donald Trump has relented to political pressure and ended the longest government shutdown in history.
He had vowed to reject any deal unless it included $5.7bn (£4.3bn) to fund his signature campaign pledge, a US-Mexico wall.
The three-week agreement Mr Trump signed however does not include this.
Even outlets sympathetic to the US president have seen it as a blow. Here's our round-up.
The New York Times
The NYT led its coverage of Friday's news with: ""Trump backs down, ending longest shutdown in US history.""
Its White House correspondent writes that ""for a president consumed with winning"", this was a ""stinging defeat"".
The paper also looked at where conservatives stood on the story, reporting that some feel Mr Trump had caved in.
The left-leaning US newspaper has been a frequent target of Mr Trump, who has called its writers ""gutless"" and the newspaper as ""phony"" on numerous occasions.
The Washington Post
The paper's website has a frozen ticker, highlighting how Mr Trump's impasse with Democrats ended after exactly 34 days, 21 hours and 18 minutes.
Coverage on some of the 800,000 federal workers affected by the five-week closure features prominently.
In a video about a food kitchen for federal workers, some express relief but also fear they may be held ""hostage"" again in three weeks' time.
Washington Post writers argue that Trump may be a ""prisoner of his own impulse"". 
""Elected as a self-proclaimed master dealmaker and business wizard... Trump risks being exposed as ineffective,"" one article said.
Media caption""Many of those people who are not getting paid are totally in favour of what we are doing""
Fox News
The TV channel, a long favoured outlet of Mr Trump, leads its coverage by saying government is ""back in business"" but also reports that the president's approval rating has gone to one of its lowest, with 37% approval and 58% disapproval. 
The Fox News politics editor, however, said that the president has not ""started to eat into his base"" but cautioned that Mr Trump cannot risk looking like he is ""capitulating"" in his demand for a border wall.
It included Mr Trump's tweets appealing for understanding, but also featured stinging criticism from conservative commentator Ann Coulter.
Breitbart News
The right-wing news outlet, which was propelled into the national stage with Mr Trump's election, has not shied away from the unfavourable coverage of Mr Trump's decision.
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Breitbart reports Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signs the legislation with eight pens
Its front page said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had ""rubbed it in"" by signing the bill with eight pens, which she later gave as souvenirs to her colleagues.
Breitbart also reports that at least 30,000 illegal border crossings are expected in the next three weeks that there is no secured funding for a proposed US-Mexico wall. 
They calculated this figure based on Department of Homeland Security data from earlier time periods.
It also reported on Monday's arrest of 110 Central Americans, who scaled an existing border wall into the US.
USA Today
This outlet took a different view from Breitbart, saying Ms Pelosi ""was careful not to gloat"".
Overall consensus is that this is a resounding victory for her, after she stood her ground against Mr Trump's demand for money towards a wall.
USA Today's main story focuses on how the president's relationship with Ms Pelosi ""changes everything in Washington"", and how ""no one should underestimate her"".
It also rounds up conservative backlash against Mr Trump, including from blogger Mike Cernovich who said he was disgusted and did not like being lied to about the wall.",The US press digest President Trump's deal to end the longest government shutdown in history.,2019-01-26T13:43:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",US shutdown: National press see a defeat for Donald Trump,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47014524,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10AE5/production/_105352386_mediaitem105352385.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1

Patrick Allan,"This past month I participated in National Novel Writing Month (also known as “NaNoWriMo”). It was fun, exhausting, stressful, and, at times, miserable. But it was also one of the greatest lessons I’ve ever learned regarding time management and creativity. Julian Gough, Irish novelist, memoirist, poet, and playwright, gives densely packed advice in his… Read more Read The goal of NaNoWriMo is to write 50,000 words of a novel in the span of one month. That breaks down to about 1,667 words a day (for reference, this article isn’t even half that). Your novel doesn’t necessarily have to be finished—mine isn’t—but in order to “win” you must write down at least that many words. It’s an exciting endeavor! Imagine your life one month from now and you have a novel, or at least the great start of one, and you’ll get the idea. Still, when you have a full-time job, a personal life, a family, and other side projects in the works, it can be incredibly difficult to find the time to get your words in. But it’s all worth it. NaNoWriMo taught me many things. I learned once and for all what times are best for me to write during the day; I learned that listening to ambient sounds can be just as good, or better, than listening to music when I write; I learned that it’s better to save the fun parts write for later so you can hit the ground running when you start your next session; and I learned that I generate more ideas for other projects when I’m working hard on one big project. It’s like a creativity feedback loop that gets stronger and stronger the more you do and the more capable you start to feel. Most importantly, though, I learned that there is always time to create things. No matter how busy I was—with my full-time job, other writing projects, multiple weekend trips to San Diego, business trips to New York, running tables at multi-day conventions—there was always a little time to sit down and spill out some words for my story. I even managed to write on my birthday. Eat your heart out, Stephen King. NaNoWriMo, more than any other creative endeavor I’ve undertaken, gave me a serious lesson in time management. I knew that “finding” the time was never going to work. You don’t find time, you “make” time. But this challenge proved that concept for me tenfold, especially as the month dragged on and staying on track got harder and harder. Falling behind a little every day means being behind a lot near the end. If I didn’t write enough one day, I knew I’d have to make it up later, and that really became apparent in the second half of the month. There’s no doubt in my mind this lesson would not have sunk in the way it did for me had I given up after 10 days. You need the whole month. This challenge also forced me to re-examine the way I was spending my free time before I started NaNo. Even though I was writing more than I had ever written before, I still had plenty of time in November to see friends, watch TV, go to the movies, travel, and even play video games. Admittedly, I didn’t get to do any of those things nearly as much as I did before, but the kicker was that I didn’t miss it all that much. It’s kind of like having a couple bites of a dessert instead of gorging yourself on the whole dish. I still got the satisfaction of doing those things without going overboard. You can have your cake and eat it too—just not all of it. This year, I will write my tenth terrible novel. I do this every November; it’s part of the… Read more Read I don’t know how long the effects of this hard-earned mindset will last. As of now, I can barely sit down to enjoy a video game or watch TV the way I used to because I feel like I’m not being productive. It’s like having a little shoulder devil dressed in a business suit constantly poking me with the pitchfork of success. It’s nice to feel driven, but it’s also exhausting. Still, I’m looking back at my life before I tried this wondering what the hell I did with all my time. I believe I’ve started to form a new, highly beneficial habit, and I don’t plan on flicking that devil off of my shoulder anytime soon. Did you participate in NaNoWriMo this year?

'Ticking time bomb' The far right accuses migrants of importing crime and disease. It's a rhetoric that attracted Luca Traini. Last year he stood as a candidate in a local election for the anti-immigrant Northern League. That was before his views led to him shooting and trying to kill six people but during the last year, his friends in Macerata began to notice his extremist views. ""Luca changed suddenly,"" remembers Francesco Clerico, the owner of Robby's Gym. ""In the gym he started expressing extreme views about race. We were very surprised. Image caption Gym owner Francesco Clerico says Traini was ""seduced"" by extremism ""Luca Traini is not a bad person, he is just ignorant and takes everything to the extreme. ""He was constantly looking for a community and he found it in the extreme right, which seduced him. Someone like him, in such a fascist and racist atmosphere, was a ticking time bomb that could explode at any moment."" That explosion happened on 3 February. After shooting six migrants, Luca Traini parked in front of the Monument of the Fallen - an archway built during the Mussolini era. He gave a fascist salute, and was then arrested. ""To victory,"" the inscription on the archway reads. The victory the gunman wants is an Italy without migrants. General election The party Traini supports, the Northern League, is an increasingly powerful force in Italian politics. It's running in the 4 March general election alongside the party led by the former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Opinion polls suggest that this alliance may defeat the centre-left government. Italy's most powerful anti-migrant movement now stands close to a potential share of national power. That scares many Italians. On Saturday 10 February, thousands demonstrated in Macerata. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The anti-racist protest followed a far-right demonstration on Thursday ""We are anti-fascists,"" they chanted. The fact that thousands feel that it's necessary to come out and say this tells you a lot about Italy right now. ""Being here is an important gesture for the entire country,"" says 25-year-old student Marianna, ""because we're seeing a wave of racism and fascism not just here but across Italy"". 'Unease' Macerata itself shut down during the demonstration. Police officers in riot gear were deployed in case far right groups tried to disrupt the event. A day later, the town's shops reopened. Forty thousand people live in this town. The Mayor of Macerata, Romano Carancini from the governing Democratic Party, estimates that 9% of the town is now made up of migrants. In a country which lacks long-established ethnic minority communities, this is a notable increase. Many of the new arrivals in Macerata are young men. ""For many years now, this town has welcomed and integrated people,"" the mayor says, ""This is not a racist town. But in the last year and a half, the increase in migrant arrivals has given rise to a sense of unease."" This hilltop town, once largely ignored, now finds itself at the centre of a bitter national debate about migration and fascism. The arguments here may decide next month's general election. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",Arguments over a hate-filled shooting in Macerata may decide next month's election.,2018-02-12T10:40:06Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Italy migrants attack: Macerata shooting reveals a bitter national debate,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43030951,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12E7/production/_99993840_044499801-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1

At the NBA All-Star basketball game in Los Angeles, former Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie Duhamel performed her unique version of The Star-Spangled Banner, generating a lot of reaction on social media, and not all of it good. ESPN journalist Jemele Hill tweeted a clip from TNT's coverage of the event, pointing out even NBA player Draymond Green could not keep a straight face. Memes were soon circulating, comparisons to previous singers were abound and #Fergie was trending on Twitter, with nearly 92,000 posts made overnight and thousands more on Instagram. You might also like: Some thought she was trying to "" Marilyn Monroe the Star-Spangled Banner,"" in reference to Monroe's public singing of 'Happy Birthday, Mr President' to John F Kennedy. Others claimed the performance made a "" great argument for auto tune "". However, sportswriter Shea Serrano was a little more subtle in his criticism. Fergie is not the first person to come under fire after a performance, with several people referring to Roseanne Barr's public rendition of the national anthem. The comedian could not resist comparing her performance with Fergie's by tweeting, ""I think mine was better lowkey"". It's not just Roseanne and Fergie who have been slated for their singing of the anthem. Social media users have been recollecting athlete Carl Lewis' rendition at the NBA finals in 1993 and Steven Tyler's 2012 performance at the Super Bowl. As one person pointed out, ""you know it's bad"" when the replies to the NBA tweet about Fergie's performance had more replies than retweets and likes combined. However, some people came to the singer's defence, saying at least she did not forget the words or sing out of key. Others pointed out many commenting using the term #Fergie ""think they are vocal coaches."" And Lithuanian singer Simona Milinyte called for a bit of ""respect"" for the artist, adding ""it was just a bad day"" for Fergie. Skip Twitter post by @Simonna I read all the comments&amp;yes, once singers stand up on the stage - they give a right for audience to judge them.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT Image caption A rocket launcher was one of the weapons recovered in Australia's gun amnesty Australians turned in more than 57,000 firearms to authorities last year during a national gun amnesty. The three-month amnesty was the first since Australia's landmark response to a mass shooting in 1996. It aimed to reduce the number of illicit weapons by allowing people to hand them over without fear of prosecution. The government said the amnesty deal had made the nation safer. ""Taking these unregistered firearms off the streets means they will not fall into the hands of criminals, who might use them to endanger the lives of innocent Australians,"" Law Enforcement Minister Angus Taylor said on Thursday. It is illegal to own an unregistered firearm in Australia. Offenders face fines of up to A$280,000 (£172,000;$225,000) and up to 14 years in jail. Among the surrendered items were almost 2,500 automatic weapons, 2,900 handguns and a rocket launcher believed to have been found in a rubbish dump. About a third of the weapons were destroyed, with the others registered or returned for sale. Police estimate there is a local ""grey market"" of up to 260,000 illicit guns, some of which have been in organised crime as well as recent terror incidents. Authorities have cited the example of Man Haron Monis, the perpetrator of a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, who used an unregistered shotgun. Australia last held a gun amnesty in 1996 and 1997, following the killing of 35 people in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur - the nation's worst mass shooting. At that time, nearly 650,000 firearms were handed in. The incident also prompted major reform of gun laws, including a ban on semi-automatic and automatic weapons.",Officials say taking the unregistered firearms off the streets has made the country safer.,2018-03-01T02:45:41Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","Australians turn in 57,000 guns in national amnesty",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-43236421,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16866/production/_100226229_rockete.png,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionFive questions about Trump's border wall
Donald Trump has warned that he could declare a ""national emergency"" on the US-Mexico border, where a row over the funding for his proposed wall has triggered a US government shutdown.
Tapping into emergency presidential powers could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access the money and resources needed to complete the project.
But what are these emergency powers, and is using them that simple?
What exactly is a state of emergency?
A state of emergency is declared in times of crisis. In this case, Mr Trump says the crisis is being caused by migrants arriving on the US-Mexico border.
According to Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, declaring a national emergency gives the president ""access to special powers that are contained in more than 100 other laws"".
Those powers effectively allow the president to bypass the usual political process.
""Obviously, the intent is to provide for badly needed flexibility when there are urgent crisis which Congress does not have time to address,"" she explained.
But is the southern border really an emergency?
While both sides agree it is a problem, whether it constitutes an emergency is a point of debate.
On the one hand, more than 2,000 people were turned away or arrested at the border each day during November alone. Supporters say this equals an emergency. Others argue the figure is far lower than a decade ago, and many of the thousands of people who travelled north from countries like Honduras are presenting themselves as asylum seekers, looking to enter the country legally.
Ms Goitein, an expert on the president's emergency powers, does not believe it reaches the bar.
""It needs to be something fast-moving, totally unforeseen,"" she argued. ""It is meant to be a stopgap measure. 
""This is not such a thing and it would be a tremendous abuse of power to invoke just to short circuit the political process.""
She does, however, point to two sections of the law which Mr Trump - who aims to use the power to free up the money needed for the wall - could possibly use.
One will allow the redirection of funds for military projects already approved by Congress. The other would require the administration to prove the wall amounts to a military construction.
Neither, Ms Goitein notes, are a ""slam dunk"" for the president, who must cite one of the laws as the legal basis for his declaration.
So, Trump could build an emergency wall?
It is technically possible. However, Mr Trump's opponents and civil liberties groups are unlikely to submit to it without a fight.
First of all, Congress could vote against the move. How likely is that? It is unclear. But Chris Stirewalt, the political editor of Fox News, the US channel which has thrown itself behind the border wall, said he could not see Congress allowing it to pass when asked about the situation on Monday.

 Harry Truman, pictured in 1953, tried - unsuccessfully - to use the powers
If it does get through, there is still the option of blocking the move through the courts - which is what happened when President Harry Truman tried to nationalise the steel industry during the Korean War, setting a legal precedent.
As Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, told CNN: ""If Harry Truman couldn't nationalise the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border.""
How frequently do presidents use emergency powers?
Surprisingly often. For example, Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, used it 13 times, while his predecessor George W Bush used it 12 times. If Mr Trump goes ahead with declaring a national emergency, it would be the fourth of his administration.
Some uses were for issues like the H1N1 influenza epidemic, and have since ended. Others are more general and continue to this day, like blocking the property of people ""engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities"".
Perhaps the most well-known occasion a president used his powers was in the case of Franklin D Roosevelt, who used them to order the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans in the months after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour.
George W Bush, meanwhile, used emergency powers to sign off wiretapping and controversial interrogation methods decried as torture following the 9/11 attacks, Ms Goitein said.
So what are the long-term implications of Trump building a wall?
Well, for a start it could mean the US has to find billions of dollars to pay for the wall in the not-too-distant future. Despite Mr Trump's earlier assurances, it doesn't seem like Mexico is about to offer up the cash.
But it could also serve as a wake up call to Congress about the level of power granted to presidents through the 1976 National Emergencies Act.
""All this shows is why the legislation cannot place such unfettered trust in a president,"" Ms Goitein said.",The US president is mulling using his powers to override Congress to build a wall along the border.,2019-01-08T17:22:26Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Can Trump declare a national emergency to build a wall?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46784315,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06x88vc.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,National,1

 The newspaper has gained a reputation for outlandish celebrity coverage
US gossip magazine the National Enquirer has found itself, again, at the centre of a huge news story of its own. 
Its owners, who last year admitted to helping hide allegations about an alleged affair involving Donald Trump, have been accused by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos of trying to blackmail him over lewd photographs.
The world's richest man released bombshell details about the accusations in a lengthy blog post on Thursday.
But what is the National Enquirer? And who are the parent company and man behind it?
The tabloid is best known for its outlandish celebrity gossip and crime coverage.
It was originally founded as The New York Evening Enquirer back in 1926 - when it was distributed as a broadsheet on a Sunday.
After changing hands to Generoso Paul ""Gene"" Pope Jr in the 1950s, it was shrunk down to a tabloid size. He renamed it and began to focus more on sensationalised gory stories with headlines like: ""Mom boiled her baby and ate her.""
Targeting supermarket check-out distribution in the 1960s, the owner lessened the gore and increased its celebrity coverage.
The publication has been unashamed in its use of payment for interviews and photograph scoops since. 
It has covered some of the country's biggest scandals - including the Monica Lewinsky affair and OJ Simpson's trial. 
At its peak it had a weekly circulation of millions, but the internet has had a huge impact on sales. Last year it was announced circulation had dropped to about 265,000 - 18% down in one financial year. 
Its most popular front-page ever was of Elvis Presley dead in his casket - which reportedly sold more than 6.5m copies.
The publication was bought by American Media Inc (AMI) in 1999. The group already had a substantial number of US tabloids and gossip magazines in its portfolio.
The group hired David Pecker as their chief executive - a New Yorker who originally trained as an accountant before getting into publishing.

A 2017 New Yorker profile explored how their headlines are firmly anchored in formulas and celebrities they know sell well. 
Journalist Jeffrey Toobin observed that a lawyer is on call at all times to check stories and try to mitigate against any potential libel issues.
US tabloid culture 
Over the years, the National Enquirer has been no stranger to controversy and, occasionally, lawsuits over its coverage.
In the US, tabloids have a reputation for outlandish reporting - in part because the standard for libelling public figures in the US is high. It has to be proven that there was ""actual malice"" behind any libel claim. 
Any figure wanting to sue could face a protracted and expensive legal battle - which could draw even more attention to any substantiated claim. 
The National Enquirer was first sued for libel by actress Carol Burnett over a 1976 report that she had been drunk and boisterous in an encounter with then-US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. 
Burnett, a campaigner against alcoholism, fervently denied the allegations. A California court sided with her and she was awarded a $1.6m settlement - but the National Enquirer appealed. Eventually the two parties settled out of court. 
Others tried the same in the aftermath, but cases remain hard to prove.
Apologies and retractions from the National Enquirer are also considered rare, but it also has an edition in the UK - where libel laws are far tighter. 
In 2006 actress Kate Hudson was able to win damages at the High Court in London over a two-page story which falsely implied she had an eating disorder.
Ties to the president
By Mr Pecker's own admission, he and President Trump are good friends.
In the 1990s Mr Pecker ran a publishing house that distributed a magazine named Trump Style around Mr Trump's resorts and properties.
Mr Pecker also attended Mr Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania.
When the real estate mogul announced he was running for president, the Enquirer endorsed him and disparaged his opponents. 
Reports in US media suggested stories about the race were sent and reviewed through Mr Trump's lawyer before publishing - though the National Enquirer denied this.
At one point during the election race, the tabloid ran a front page that said Hillary Clinton had ""6 MONTHS TO LIVE!""
Image copyrightGetty Images
They also made allegations about his Republican opponents - alleging at one point that Texas Senator Ted Cruz's father had direct links to the assassination of John F Kennedy.
The tabloid labelled him ""pervy Ted"" and falsely alleged he had several extramarital affairs. 
Mr Cruz at the time labelled the affair story ""garbage"" and accused ""Donald Trump and his henchmen"" of attempting to smear him.
'Catch and kill' 
Mostly notably, AMI has admitted helping Donald Trump's campaign bury a report about an alleged extramarital affair with a former Playboy model.
Federal prosecutors announced in December that AMI had admitted paying Karen McDougal $150,000 (£115,000) for a ""catch and kill"" on her story in the run-up to the 2016 election.
Officials said they did so ""in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign"" to ensure the damaging allegations did not get out before the vote.
AMI entered into a non-prosecution agreement in exchange for their admission. 
Mr Pecker also reportedly received immunity from an investigation into President Trump's long-time lawyer Michael Cohen - who now faces jail - in exchange for information. 
Bezos blackmail allegations
As the New York Times reports, tech giants aren't the usual subject of the National Enquirer's focus - making some believe it was his links to the Washington Post newspaper that made him a target.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Bezos and his wife Mackenzie announced their divorce hours before an Enquirer revealed details of his affair
The tabloid has already published intimate details of his alleged extramarital affair - including private message exchanges. 
Mr Bezos launched a private investigation into how they got their hands on that information, an action he now says has brought threats of intimate photograph leaks.
""It's unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,"" he wrote in a blog post.
After this, he pointed to President Trump's tweets about himself but also cited his newspaper's coverage of the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi - a former columnist - which he said was ""undoubtedly unpopular in certain circles"". 
Mr Bezos also pointed to an Associated Press report about a 97-page glossy magazine produced by AMI that praised Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. It appeared across the US last April.

"Allison Shoemaker on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Greetings. Today is National Tequila Day. This means many of you will hit a happy hour tonight, at which you’ll be confronted with cheap margs. I am not here to dissuade you from drinking those cheap, and probably unsatisfying, margs (though please, be responsible). What I am here to to is dissuade you from making dissatisfying margs. To be clear, making a really good margarita can be as complicated as you want it to be. It can also be expensive, depending on how fancy you’re going. Making a bad margarita can also be as complicated as you want it to be. But making a passable margarita, the kind of marg you wouldn’t be embarrassed to pour for someone, but also wouldn’t want to brag about, is really simple. It involves two important rules plus a subsequent judgment call. A passable margarita can be made with lousy mix, or lousy tequila, but not both. You need ice and limes, and cannot achieve a truly passable margarita without both. Today, if you set out to make yourself a marg, maybe a pitcher o’ margs, stick with those two principles and I can promise you something that’s absolutely tolerable. The judgment call referenced above relates to rule number one, so before you do anything else, decide if you want to cough up a little extra for a nice reposado, or put in the work to make sure everything else is tasty. I’m not arguing that you have to buy something super expensive and small-batch, but it has to be 100 percent agave, so none of that Cuervo bullshit for you. You can absolutely get a good-not-great bottle of tequila for under $40. Then hell, you want to use a margarita mix right out of the bottle? Go for it. Just make sure to use it very sparingly, to dress it up with actual lime juice, and to shake it all vigorously with ice. But say that, in the spirit of National Tequila Day, you want to get fucked up on the cheap. Then you’re going to be putting in some effort. Do still try to find something that’s 100 percent agave—anything else is likely to be half sugarcane spirit, no thanks—but if what you’ve got is kinda burn-y, that’s fine. Just arm yourself with the following: Agave nectar/syrup or simple syrup. The former isn’t super expensive, the latter is really easy to make—equal parts sugar and water in a saucepan, heat until dissolved, add a flavor if you want, simmer for a bit, cool for at least an hour. Throw some sliced jalapeños in there if you want. You’re fancy. That’s going past passable, but what the hell, it’s a holiday. Limes. You need fresh-ass lime juice for the drink, plus a little more for the salt rim. Salt. Kosher salt. Hell, go nuts, get some smoked salt. Ice. If you’ve got a nice orange liqueur at home, you can swap that out for the agave or simple, but use it sparingly. That’s true of all of this stuff. If you’re using 2 oz. of tequila per drink, I’d start with 1/2 oz. of both lime juice and your sweet syrup of choice, then keep tasting until the balance is right for you. Then get that ice and a cocktail shaker and go to town. Either way, you want that shit to be ice cold. Congratulations, you’re an acceptable margarita maker. Behave yourself.","Greetings.
