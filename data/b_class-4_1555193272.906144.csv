Dylan Haas,"In the programming world, a popular pastime is apparently Java-bashing.
Heres how it goes: some bored programmer resurrects the notion that Java is dead, and cites some upstart language thats better for X, Y, and Z reasons. Usually, this occurs in the form of a listicle that starts trending, on, say, StackExchange or maybe theyre just yelling so loudly during happy hour that the internetz can hear.
Either way, theyre usually wrong. Like, colossally wrong.
Yes, theres a reason Java has a bad rap with some folks. Its very often compared and contrasted with Python, which has comparatively simple syntax. Its also earned a reputation for reliably bad performance, thank you Java Enterprise Edition.
But according to the TIOBE Index, which tracks the popularity of programming languages online, Java is the #1 programming language, unchanged since March 2018. Over the past decade, its consistently retained the top spot or hovered near it, along with mainstays C, C++, JavaScript, and the like.
Why has Java reigned supreme over the years? Take a gander below:
1. Java is a foundational language
Its one of *the* core software development skills today.
For instance, take the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a program that runs programs (meta, right?). The JVM is the reason the modern web is the way it is today, allowing Java programs to run on any operating system (whereas before that, programs were written specifically for one OS, vastly restricting their usability on other devices).
While programmers have in recent years touted other JVM languages as better than Java like Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin all of these share some sort of foundation in Java anyways. Even if youre planning to add these new languages to your skillset, learning Java gives you a leg up on mastering them.
2. Java remains a potent frontend dev tool
If youre a frontend developer, Java actually is a better option to learn than NodeJS. Sure, NodeJS is practical, quick, and effective to use hence its popularity but Javas more established as a server-side language.
Plus, there is a *ton* of Java serverside code already out there, as many programs have been written in it over the years. All of which means: if you add Java to your programming repertoire, youll be able to read all Java serverside code out there without crying tiny tears as day turns into night.
3. There are tons of resources available for Java programmers
Some languages are so obscure that developers have trouble finding support when they encounter issues with their code. Like Forth, APL, or MUMPS. Ever heard of them? Exactly.
Not so with Java.
There is a ton of literature available online on Java tools, troubleshooting tips, and tutorials designed to aid in programming that ensure youre not alone when youre staring down that big, bad coding environment on your monitor.
4. Java remains cutting-edge thanks to a faster release cycle
It was released back in 1995, sure. But Java sure works pretty well on the modern web for being an old geezer in the dev world.
Thats thanks to a twice-yearly release cycle, which means Java is evolving more quickly than ever before. New updates mean new tools, which mean more efficient ways to code programs to run the way you want on an internet that is itself constantly evolving.

Jacob Kleinman,"If you bought a first-generation Google Pixel phone you may have some money coming your way. A new class action lawsuit against the tech giant argues that it knew there was an issue with the device’s microphone and sold it as a premium smartphone anyway. After hearing this news, you may be wondering how to get involved in the lawsuit. Here’s what you need to know about the case, and what you should be doing right now if you bought a Pixel from Google. What’s the Case About? Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones suffer from what the company called a “hairline crack in the solder connection on the audio codec.” In some cases, this made it extremely difficult to use the microphone, making phone calls and voice commands impossible. The company says only 1% of Pixel phones included the defect, but the lawsuit notes that within just a few weeks of the device’s launch people were already reporting issues with the microphone. Instead of offering refunds, Google replaced some defective smartphones with new units that had the exact same issue. Even worse, the company never stopped selling the Pixel and Pixel XL despite mounting evidence that something was wrong. Can I Join the Lawsuit? If this all sounds familiar you probably qualify for the class action lawsuit, and even if you didn’t have any issue with your particular smartphone you should still qualify. According to the filing, the case covers “all individuals in the United States who purchased a Google Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone, other than for resale, between October 4, 2016 and the present.” The only exceptions are people directly connected to Google or the trial. That includes anyone working at Google, a Google subsidiary, or Google-affiliated company. It also rules out any judges assigned to the case, along with their immediate family. How to Get Involved For now, there’s not much you need to do. Just by buying a Pixel phone you’re included in the class action lawsuit. Once a trial is approved you’ll probably receive a notice in the mail telling you how to actively join the case. It will also explain how to file a claim once the lawsuit is settled— assuming there’s some money to be had. In the meantime, if you really want to get involved you can contact the law firm behind the case on their website. And if you’re feeling left out, the same firm is also looking for people who purchase the Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL for a separate investigation into the screen burn-in issue that plagued both of those phones when they launched last fall. You can sign up for that case here.",If you bought a first-generation Google Pixel phone you may have some money coming your way.

Roberto Baldwin,"The NVIDIA system can tackle an impressive 320 trillion operations per second. All the parties involved in this new venture hope this will be enough to power level 4 and 5 vehicles which will be used as robo-taxis. Daimler and Bosch announced back in April they would be teaming up to develop self-driving taxis. The two companies had said they wanted to get these vehicles on the road within five years. With today's news, it looks like they're on track with that. The first of the cars using NVIDIA's AI platform (which the Daimler says will be Mercedes S-Class sedans and V-Class vans) will start road testing in a Silicon Valley city starting in the second half of 2019. The two companies are still negotiating with the city and will announce the location at a later date. The final version (or at least ready for a larger general rollout) should be ready in the first part of the next decade. A bit vague timeline wise, but within the goal already set forth by the two companies. In addition, to supply the self-driving AI platform, NVIDIA will work with Bosch and Daimler to build the system necessary for the self-driving ride-hailing service. During the pilot phase, the shuttles will stick to a few predetermined routes. We should start seeing more pilots like this one in the coming years. Waymo already has an Early Rider program up and running in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Uber, Lyft, GM and others are all working towards their own self-driving taxi services. With the initial cost of level 4 and level 5 vehicles being beyond the reach of most consumers (because of the sensors and technology embedded), it makes sense financially to have these cars act as taxis where they'll be able to recoup the tech investment. Daimler noted that it's Mercedes division has been working on a foundation for autonomous driving for a while. That includes last year's Intelligent World Drive. The data gathered from that event and the subsequent research done in its wake will help the partnership build parameters for cars in each market. This isn't the first time Bosch and Mercedes have teamed up for an autonomous car. Back in 1986 they were both part of the Prometheus project that included an autonomous car codenamed VITA (Vision Information Technology Application). Except this time they're going to have to move a whole lot faster because if mobility plays out the way automakers think it will, being one of the first to have a ride-hailing system on the road could be very lucrative.","Putting self-driving cars on the streets requires a lot of computing power.

Roberto Baldwin,"As expected, the new CLA coupe will have Mercedes' voice-controlled MBUX infotainment system. In addition to being able to control the vehicle with your voice, the system also uses augmented video for navigation like the A-Class sedan and GLE SUV.
But Mercedes added an additional feature to the vehicle; Interior Assistant. The gesture-based system can be used to enable functions in the vehicle and can determine if something is being initiated by the driver or passenger. At night, it'll even turn on the reading with a simple gesture.
The car will also work with the newly announced Mercedes-Benz Vivoactive 3 smartwatch or compatible Garmin watch to recommend one of the vehicles Energizing modes. The modes use air conditioning, seats, lighting and music, to set a mood for the driver. so if the car thinks you're stressed, it'll try to relax you. Potentially help when you're about to fly into a fit of road rage.
It'll also get the semi-autonomous features that first made their way to the market in the S-Class with lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control that can adjust to the speed of a corner if it determines the vehicle is moving too quickly to safety round a corner.
All this packaged in a sporty coupe (yes, we know it has four doors) package.

Bryan Menegus,"The Supreme Court, as you may have read, gave its opinion today on Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis and, in a 5-4 split, decided to uphold forced arbitration agreements that preclude employees from pursuing class-action lawsuits against their bosses in court. Neil Gorsuch penned the majority opinion, so join me in opening a window and shouting “ fuuuuuuuuuck yooooouuu Neiiiiiill” four or five times, or until you pass out. Whichever feels better. Essentially the case weighed the Federal Arbitration Act against the employee rights-focused National Labor Relations Act—two pieces of legislation nearing their 100th birthdays. The former won, and the meaning of that victory was deftly put by Justice Ginsberg in her dissenting opinion : the inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers. It’s a dreadful blow to all workers regardless of their grievance. A even though the NLRA protections do not apply to contractors, the ruling has brought a swift and sorry end to a tactic popular among those engaged in the gig economy. “The effect of today’s decision will be to end misclassification class actions, for Gig Economy workers and for everyone else,” Larry Peluso, an attorney who filed one such suit on behalf of Lyft drivers less than two weeks ago, told Gizmodo via email. Employees and wrongfully-categorized “contractors” are in the same boat. “This decision lays the final stone in an almost impenetrable barrier to group action to redress all unlawful employer practices, whether in court or in private arbitration,” he wrote, “the class action aspect of all these cases cannot proceed.” Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney famous for her representation of Uber drivers, explained the grim future of redress in this space: “Gig workers will need to sign up with a lawyer to do an individual arbitration. There are fewer lawyers who will be willing and able to handle individual arbitrations for a lot of workers.” Not only are there fewer firms willing to do the work, but according to employment lawyer Michael Subit, it’s often prohibitively expensive. “If you’re a low-paid worker, the cost of arbitration will most of the time outweigh any potential recovery,” he told Gizmodo by phone. “For a low-wage worker a thousand dollars or a few thousand dollars is a significant claim, but not in the context of [the] high cost of the legal system.” He predicts the outcome of the SCOTUS decision will be, “fewer cases brought, less enforcement, and more examples of people simply not being paid what the law says they should.” “The Supreme Court’s decision acknowledged that this result might not be the best policy but left it to Congress to make the decision to change it if it chooses,” Liss-Riordan added. And maybe a Congress in the future will, but almost certainly that change will not come with this Congress, or with this president. Now gig workers and their legal representation are left to come up with new strategies.","The Supreme Court, as you may have read, gave its opinion today on Epic Systems Corp. v.

Roberto Baldwin,"With MBUX, drivers and passengers aren't limited to random questions, they can also control aspects of the vehicle, including navigation and climate controls. All of this happens with natural language. No scripts and no need to push a button. Just say the wake words, ""Hi Mercedes"" or ""Hey Mercedes"" Between random commands and questions, I was able to adjust the climate control of myself and the passenger. I could turn on and off the heated seats of both. I also found four-star or greater Mexican restaurants in the Seattle area and figured out how far San Francisco was (and the height of Mt. Whitney). I was also able to find locations, start navigation and add waypoints with a Starbucks (which was closed for construction, booo) along my route all without taking my hands off the steering wheel. As more and more systems require us to take our eyes off the task at hand to do simple tasks, it's important to find ways to focus on the road. MBUX does this. But it's not completely without issues. If MBUX can't answer a query or complete a task, it doesn't inform you of this limitation. It just keeps asking what it can help you with. So you never know if you're asking the question wrong or if your not in an area with strong enough signal for questions that require the cloud. Also, you can't use it to do tasks like adjust the volume and turn the lights on/off. Mostly for the sake of safety. For folks that don't want to talk to their car, you can reply via the touchpad which Mercedes has used for years (or via the new touchscreen). These are both connected to a new UI that surfaces most of the major items we care about (navigation, media, radio, phone, settings) to the top. It also uses AI to learn about your behavior and creates favorites for things like the person you call the most or the location you navigate to on a regular basis. One of my favorite new features is the AR that puts directions and street names over a real-world view of your route at low speeds. The map on the center display is replaced by a view of the world in front of the car and blue arrows point you in the right direction. Oh, and it's very fast with very little latency thanks to the automaker using the latest Nvidia hardware. The A-Class sedan that wraps around MBUX should do very well once it hits US shores. Its aggressive low stance gives it the air of a luxury German sport sedan far more expensive than something that starts in the low-to-mid $30,000 range (Mercedes should have final pricing details available in a few months). This is the first A-Class to make it to the United States and while we sadly won't be getting the amazing looking hatchback that's available in Europe, the sedan should turn heads and open up wallets here. The A-Class A220 has a 2.0 liter 4-cylinder turbocharged engine that puts out 188 horsepower and 221 foot-pounds of torque. It's not exactly ready to race the rest of the Mercedes line up, but around town that powerplant should keep folks more than happy. It's available with FWD (front-wheel-drive) or Mercedes' AWD (all-wheel-drive) 4Matic system. After driving both, I'd go for the 4Matic. But if you don't plan on hitting switchbacks anytime soon, the FWD version should suffice around town and in the highway. Although the 4Matic version did seem to have a bit of a harsher ride over rough roads. Because the cars are preproduction I'm not sure if that's a bug or a feature for better handling. Along with MBUX, the A-Class supports all the fancy new driver assistance features found in the S-Class. So in addition to adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, the A-Class outfitted with the Driver Assistance Package will also get route based speed adaptation (the car will slow down at corners on its own while in cruise control) and can change lanes by itself. All that for probably $2,250 more. The interior is typical Mercedes: comfort mixed with luxury. If you opt for the 64-color ambient lighting system, it's a bit like being in a Virgin America cabin. Throw in the large propeller-esque vents and the A-Class seems like the car a young Howard Hughes would have enjoyed driving around in between plane crashes. Young is what Mercedes is going for with the A-Class. It's a fun compact Mercedes that's packed with technology and has a starting price that should lure folks with a bit of cash (and a desire to step up their car into the showroom). The vehicle will be available in early 2019 and once we get our hands on a production vehicle, we'll have a full review.","<!-- TAG START { player: ""Eng: Sideview, autoplay, muted"", owner: ""Engadget AOL"", for: ""Engadget AOL"" } --> <!-- TAG END { date: 09/21/18 } --> ""Hey Mercedes.""

Mariella Moon,"When it announced that the Model 3's production was on track last year, Tesla said the issues that caused its backlog hadn't cropped up yet. It did admit late last year that it was experiencing production bottlenecks mainly due to battery module assembly problems in its Gigafactory facility. And company chief Elon Musk also revealed in an interview that using too many robots for production did more harm than good. Tesla might not have emerged out of it all unscathed, but it seems to be doing better on that front recently. Earlier this month, the company reported that it was finally able to build over 2,000 cars per week for three weeks in a row and it's aiming to starting manufacturing 5,000 cars per week in two months' time. In addition to detailing its production problems, Tesla also wrote in the court filing that its $4 billion investment in Model 3, Gigafactory's development Nevada and all the equipment it commissioned for the project show its ""good faith belief"" in the vehicle. Whether those are enough to convince the court to throw the case out remains to be seen -- for now, the lawsuit is seeking class action status for shareholders who bought Tesla stocks from May 4th, 2016 to October 6th, 2017.

"Justin Maiman, Contributor","Happiness can be learned. 
 That's the central idea behind Yale's most popular class ever. Professor Laurie Santos has collected all the psychological science out there and come up with a step-by-step process for boosting your own happiness. 
 I took the 10-week course online through Coursera for free. It's officially called ""The Science of Well-Being"" and has already been taken by more than 225,000 students online. About one in four students at Yale have taken it since it was first offered. 
 Dr. Santos told me she designed the course for three reasons: to synthesize what psychologists have learned about making our lives better; to help undergrads overcome stress and unhappiness on campus; and ""to live a better life myself."" 
 Five weeks in, I'm a convert. Here's why: The seminars are great, but you also get a lot of homework centered around daily exercises geared towards changing your habits — recognizing and then dropping bad ones while developing new good habits. 
 Here are just four exercises I picked out from a slew of new tips and tricks I've learned so far. Again, the point here is that these positive habits have been tested and proven to work, based on psychological science. 
Focus on your strengths
 This first homework was all about identifying your signature strengths and re-focusing on them each day. I took the VIA Survey online — anyone can take this test for free, check it out here— which revealed my 24 greatest strengths. My top four: love of learning, appreciation of beauty and excellence, leadership and fairness. 
 If you're pretty self-aware, the results won't be a big surprise. The key though is to identify them and find situations to use your strengths every day. That'll lead you down the path to flourishing. Studies show happiness increases and depression decreases when a person uses his or her signature strengths regularly. In my case, I looked for simple ways to use fairness, humor, and love of learning throughout my day. Pro tip: Additional research shows that if you're able to ""bundle"" four of your top strengths while at work, you'll likely flourish, have more positive experiences, and are more likely to think of your work as a ""calling.""

Invest in experiences
 I spend money on experiences like live music, trips or meals over new toys. It's always made me happier. Now I know that research backs this up, regardless of income levels: Going for a walk or traveling to a new place are a much better investment in terms of happiness than buying material things. 
 Turns out your stuff loses ""happiness value"" almost as soon as you've purchased it. Paying for experiences, however, has multiple benefits for happiness. One, the anticipation of the experience leads to more happiness and joy. Two, talking about the experience afterwards with friends reignites your own happy memories and, incredibly enough, sharing these tales with friends tends to boost their happiness too. Finally, we don't tend to get used to experiences the way we do to new stuff. There's no time to get used to a trip to Mexico City, but science shows the joy you get from buying some awesome new thing, like a phone, begins to diminish immediately. It's just how your brain works.

Learn to savor more
 Savoring is the act of stepping outside of an experience to review and really appreciate it — a way of helping you stay present in the moment. And often, savoring forces you to enjoy an experience for longer. 
 My homework was to pinpoint a moment to savor each day. One of mine stuck out: I was running around the park when a strong gust of wind at my back almost lifted me off the ground. It was a strange and wonderful moment, and I made sure to tell my wife when I got home. Looking for these moments has boosted my sense of awe at the world around me. Research shows reliving these happy memories can make your positive emotions last up to a month. 
Express gratitude and spread kindness
 This one is fun. If you're generally thankful and show appreciation for what you have, your happiness levels soar. Sounds too easy, but it works. One exercise we did was make a list of five things we were grateful for each day. Staring at your list simply makes you thankful and reflective. Even doing this once a week has been shown to boost happiness and reduce ill health symptoms. 
 Meanwhile, doing random acts of kindness is another way to find happiness. One study showed that the money you spend on others makes you happier than spending it on yourself, even across different cultures and income levels. For example, small changes, like spending $5 to buy a friend, colleague or stranger a coffee, boosted happiness levels. So I've been buying a lot of coffees. 
 Dr. Santos adds, ""It kind of seems like our brains are wired to see other people's rewards as our own rewards. And so it's kind of like getting a little click of cocaine every single time you do a nice thing for another person. It's kind of an accident of the way our social brain is wired up.""

"Claire Lower on Skillet, shared by Claire Lower to Lifehacker","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties. Because each attendee would often bring a case of whatever cheap lager they favored, I would often find my many bottles and cans of beer I didn’t really want to drink strewn across my apartment the next morning. (I mean, I drank it, but I wish I would have made some beer pickles too.) It’s Freshman Orientation Week at Lifehacker! This week, we’re covering ways to snap out of your summer haze and into an autumnal blitz of activity, whether you’re actually heading to campus for the first time, getting your own kids ready for school, or looking for ways to just be more productive in the classroom of life. So velcro up your Trapper Keepers, students. Class is now in session. You’re most likely already aware that beer makes a great deglazing liquid, but you may not be familiar with its pickling prowess. Using it to season and preserve vegetables is a great way to use up any beer you may not feel like drinking. (Just kidding. I know you guys always feel like drinking all the beer, but these pickles really are good.) The brine is simple enough—it’s beer, vinegar, salt and sugar, plus whatever other flavorful friends you want to add. I’ve used this brine to pickle both onions and corn, and both were delightfully sweet and sour and infused with just a touch of debauchery. To make it yourself, you will need: Your produce of choice—This amount of brine will cover one small onion, one large cucumber, or two ear’s worth of corn kernels. 3/4 cup white vinegar 1/2 cup beer (Pick your poison! I used an IPA this time but lagers and stouts are also tasty.) 1/4 cup sugar 1 tablespoon salt 2 cloves of smashed garlic 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 1 bay leaf Cut your onions into slivers, slice your cucumbers, or remove your corn kernels from the cob. Place the prepared produce in a pint-sized mason jar or a soup container, and set it aside. If you want your pickles to have a kick, halve a jalapeño and throw that in there too. Add the remaining ingredients to a sauce pan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, pour the hot brine over the vegetables, cover them loosely, and let the liquid cool to room temperature. Pop your pickles in the fridge to cool overnight, then put them on sandwiches, sausages, and leftover pizza (for a very collegiate experience).","I was never cool(?) enough to be invited to a “kegger” in college, but I did drink a lot of beer, and I hosted a few parties.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Zero exercise is not enough. Going for a walk every day is probably a good thing. And if you’re training for a marathon, you’ll be on your feet for a couple hours of hard workouts every week. But what is the benchmark for a human being just trying to squeeze enough healthy exercise into their life? Let’s break it down. It’s easy to feel motivated about the idea of exercising. Let’s all run marathons! And do a push-up … Read more Read Fortunately, all the major public health organizations are in agreement. The World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association are all on board with the following guidelines for aerobic exercise: 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise like walking, ideally broken up into 30 minutes per day over five days 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise like running, ideally in three 25-minute chunks It only counts if you do 10 minutes or more in each session, and you should spread your sessions throughout the week (so, you can’t take a single 90-minute spinning class and figure you’re done.) If you’re a stroll-around-the-neighborhood person, go with the first recommendation. If you enjoy hard workouts, but would rather not change into your gym clothes every day, you can just go with the 75 minute recommendation. And feel free to mix and match. Here are some possibilities: Walk 15 minutes to and from work every week day (5 x 30 minutes = 150 moderate) Go running on Monday/Wednesday/Friday, each for 2-3 miles (3 x 25 minutes = 75 vigorous) Take a 90-minute heart-pounding cycling class, and go for a walk after dinner at least a few other days of the week (1 x 90 minutes = 90 vigorous, plus perhaps 3 x 15 = 45 moderate) Go for a 30-minute easy bike ride on Monday. Try a 45-minute water aerobics class on Wednesday. Take a short hike on Saturday. Mow the lawn for an hour on Saturday. (30 + 45 + 30 + 60 = 165 moderate) If you’re confused about what counts in each category, the UK’s National Health Service has a list of “moderate” and “vigorous” activities here. I love long walks and runs, but I tend to not too many of them for one reason: I get bored. Walking … Read more Read If you’re pretty athletic, the above won’t sound like much. Good news! The WHO has set a secondary goal for folks like you. It’s simple: just do double the above. So you can aim for 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity: Two of those killer 90-minute classes, Monday and Thursday A three-mile run every weekday An hour-long martial arts class three times a week...or, to meet the requirement with moderate activity, you can stroll for an hour before breakfast each day, the favorite activity of spunky grandmas and grandpas who will probably never die. (To be fair, the recommendations we’re talking about are for people up to age 65.) So, what about an upper limit? There isn’t one, from a public health point of view. More is better. (And even if you are doing less than the recommendations, anything is better than nothing.) That said, it is possible for you as an individual to do more exercise than your body is ready for. Don’t jump from a life of occasional strolling to a marathon training plan. And if you are on that marathon training plan and you’re feeling worn down, take a break already. Strength, Flexibility, and More So far we’ve been talking about aerobic exercise, which is the kind where you’re continuously moving (or, perhaps, doing quick work/rest intervals) and your heart rate is up. But there are other important forms of exercise, too. The WHO and other organizations recommend two days per week of “high intensity muscle strengthening activity,” which includes anything where you’re thinking in terms of sets and reps. (Three sets of eight to 10 reps is a good structure to start.) So, your workout has you doing 4 sets of 5 reps for this exercise, 3 sets of 8 after that, and—oh,… Read more Read That activity can be anything that challenges your muscles, and where the 10th rep is a lot harder than the first: lifting weights, or resistance band exercises, or bodyweight exercises like push-ups. So if you run three days per week but have time for more, don’t just fit in extra runs; try adding two days in the weight room instead. In addition, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends two other kinds of exercise you might otherwise forget: Two to three days per week that include stretching, ideally spending 60 seconds stretching each major muscle group. This can be in a few short stints of 10-30 seconds each. Two to three days per week that include neuromuscular training. Think of this as hand-eye coordination and its full-body equivalents. Anything involving balance, coordination, or paying attention to your gait fall into these categories. Both of these can fit into your other workouts. Stretching works well in a cool-down session after your main workout, or some people prefer to put it into a warm-up. If you’re doing functional movements like lunges that challenge your balance and coordination, you’re working on neuromuscular fitness.","Zero exercise is not enough.

ADAM LIPTAK,"Much to my surprise, the judge throws out the settlement, he said. It occurs to me that there is an opportunity that no one is taking advantage of. Class action settlements have fairness hearings, and class members can protest. There would be an opportunity to move the law in the right direction. I started winning, he said, noting that he has handled more than two dozen appeals arising from objections to class action settlements. The system was ripe for change because the abuses were so big. Even his critics say Mr. Frank has played a valuable role. Although I often disagree with his objections, I think it is valuable to have a devils advocate challenging class action settlements and fee awards because there is otherwise often no meaningful pushback on what class counsel and the defendants put before the court, said Brian T. Fitzpatrick, a law professor at Vanderbilt Law School and the author of The Conservative Case for Class Actions, which will be published next year. Some people complain that his ultimate goal is to destroy, rather than improve, class actions, said Professor Fitzpatrick, who is visiting this semester at Harvard Law School. I am not sure if that is true he says it isnt but it doesnt really matter. A devils advocates job is to push back on everything, good and bad alike. The Supreme Court case, which will be argued Oct. 31, arose from an $8.5 million settlement between Google and class action lawyers who said the company had violated its users privacy rights. Under the settlement, the lawyers were paid more than $2 million, but members of the class they represented got nothing. Instead, the company agreed to make contributions to institutions concerned with privacy on the internet, including centers at Harvard, Stanford and Chicago-Kent College of Law. A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, upheld the settlement, with all three judges agreeing that trying to pay compensation to the class would be inefficient, as the individual payouts would be about 4 cents. In dissent, Judge J. Clifford Wallace expressed misgivings about the groups to which the payments were to be made. He said he was uneasy about the fact that a substantial portion of the money would go to law schools that the plaintiffs lawyers had attended.","Theodore Frank, a critic of class action settlements, will argue his own case.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Our president apparently does not know the difference between the sexually transmitted diseases HPV and HIV, but I’m not here to judge. As you probably remember from sex ed class, if you think you have a stupid question, you should ask it anyway because you’re probably not the only one. HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, is famous for being the virus that causes AIDS. It’s sexually transmitted, and can damage your immune system, although there are drugs that can keep the virus in check. HIV affects millions of people globally, including 4 percent of Africans. (Bill Gates, who explained the difference between these viruses to our president, runs a foundation that provides HIV diagnosis, prevention, and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa.) According to the CDC, 1.1 million Americans have HPV but one in seven don’t know it. Fortunately, HIV testing is covered cost-free by ACA compliant insurance plans. HPV is the human papillomavirus, best known for causing cervical cancer. If you’ve got a cervix and you go in for a pap smear every couple of years, your gynecologist is looking for signs of infection from this virus. HPV can also be sexually transmitted and is so common that most of us get it at some point (and usually have no idea). Because it occasionally causes cancer, it makes sense for everyone to get the vaccine before they become sexually active. The vaccine is recommended for preteens of all genders and can also be given to young adults. Both diseases are worth knowing about, and both can be devastating if untreated. But they are very, very different things.","Our president apparently does not know the difference between the sexually transmitted diseases HPV and HIV, but I’m not here to judge.

DAVID LEONHARDT,"The open letter is just one example of this deception. The bill’s defenders frequently say some version of, “We need tax reform.” But their plan bears little resemblance to meaningful tax reform. It’s akin to telling someone, “You need a new car,” and then giving the person a lemon. (For those who want more detail on the open letter, Jason Furman walks through its distortions in more detail.) 2. Talk about the plan’s middle-class tax cuts — and ignore the middle-class tax increases. The plan is a windfall for the wealthy, but it’s quite mixed for the middle class and poor. Some provisions raise taxes on the middle class and poor. Others cut taxes. Long term, most families would probably be worse off, as I’ve explained before. One favorite sleight of hand from the plan’s supporters is to talk only about the provisions that help the middle class and conveniently fail to mention the other parts. Take Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican, who went on “Meet the Press” this weekend to sell the bill. “The middle class tax cuts are in there,” Portman said. “It doubles the standard deduction up to 24 grand for a family. It doubles the child tax credit. It actually — it lowers the rates.” All that is true. Unfortunately, Senator Portman left out the elimination of the personal exemption, which protects $4,000 per person from income taxes. He left out the elimination of various tax breaks that help the middle class. And he left out the introduction of a new inflation measure that will push more families into higher tax brackets over time. 3. Pretend that the future will never arrive. To hold down the estimated cost of the bill, Senate leaders have set some of its biggest provisions — the ones that most benefit the middle class — to expire over the next decade. The corporate tax cuts, by contrast, are permanent. But when the plan’s defenders describe the bill, they tend to be talking about a point before the bill is fully implemented — without admitting as much. If you hear a senator talking about a $1,000 tax cut that a typical middle-class family would receive, it’s in one of the plan’s early years. (If you hear a senator talking about a bigger tax cut, as Portman and many others do, they’re usually talking about the upper middle class or affluent without saying so.) By the time the bill is fully implemented, it will be a net tax increase on every income group below $75,000 a year. It will also leave federal taxes virtually unchanged for families making between $75,000 and $100,000. For the wealthy, it’s still a tax cut. And all of these estimates understate the long-term damage to the middle class, because they ignore the cuts to education, transportation, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that will eventually be necessary to reduce the deficit. 4. Rush, rush, rush. Perhaps the biggest giveaway about the plan is the way that its supporters are trying to push it through Congress as quickly as possible. They’re not holding hearings where experts can debate the content of the plan. They are not even waiting for a final analysis from Congress’s official tax arbiter, the Joint Committee on Taxation. They understand that facts and debate hurt their cause. They are hoping that partisan loyalty is strong enough to overcome substance. Related. “If the tax bill is so great,” Catherine Rampell asked in a recent Washington Post column, “why does the GOP keep lying about it?” “Why would anyone write a bill full of provisions that evaporate over time?” Paul Krugman asks. “There’s no economic or policy logic behind it. Instead, it’s all about trying to have it both ways, making a safe space for political double talk.” Poll after poll has shown that the tax plan is deeply unpopular, typically with a national approval rating around 30 percent. Three new polls show that the plan is similarly unpopular in Arizona, Maine and Tennessee, three states with swing-vote senators. In fact, it’s not clear any piece of legislation so unpopular has ever before become law, as Seth Hanlon notes. The failed Roy Moore scam. A conservative group tried to entrap some Washington Post reporters while peddling a fake story about Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate with a history of pursuing teenage girls. The scam failed, and you can watch it fail on video. In The Times, Bari Weiss argues that the incident is a reminder of the limits of “believe all women.” Continue reading the main story","Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, has touted the Trump tax plan’s middle-class tax cuts — but ignored its middle-class tax increases.",2017-11-28T13:31:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Four Big Tax Deceptions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/opinion/republican-tax-plan.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/28/opinion/28leonhardt-newsletter-portman/28leonhardt-newsletter-portman-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-4,1

Heres what you need to know. The memory card explained Youre probably most familiar with memory cards from slotting one into your digital camera or your smartphone. They use solid-state, flash memory similar to the internal storage inside your phone or laptop, with speedy read and write times, and the ability to pack a lot of storage into a small space. As time has gone on, memory cards have been packing more and more storage into cards that have gotten smaller and smaller: The (relatively) chunky cards of the mid-1990s had capacities as small as 2MB, reflecting one of their original goalsto replace the 1.44MB floppy disk. As the 2000s wore on, the SD (Secure Digital) card format established as a joint venture between Toshiba, SanDisk and Panasonic started to dominate the market, followed by the microSD, SDXC and microSDXC cards we have todaywith capacities maxing out at 512GB, if you can afford the asking prices. Other memory card formats are still around for various uses, but the SD and microSD variants are most commonly used in phones and cameras, so well focus on them here. Theyll fit into everything from your drone to your Nintendo Switch. Start shopping for a card, and youll notice a host of different numbers and letters on the face of the card and in its tech specs. Theres actually quite a bit of redundancy going on here (as in some specs are just repeating themselves), but its worth digging in to find out what each of them are referring to. Memory card features and specs To start with youve got a choice of sizes: The standard SD ones (mostly for digital cameras and bigger gear) and the smaller microSD ones (originally developed for, and still used in, smartphones). Extra letters after the SD mean a newer, improved standard, with room for greater capacities and faster speedsthese include HC (High Capacity) and the latest XC (Extended Capacity), and both are used across the SD and microSD form factors today. MicroSDXC cards are the top choice for your phone, and the SDXC cards are your top choice for everything else. After that, the key spec is obviously the capacity, or how much data a card can hold. Newer HC and XC cards offer more storage because of their file systems and various other tweaks, with the newest cards on the market now hitting 512GB (with a theoretical limit thats even higher). Then theres speed, or how fast a memory card can read and write data. If youre shooting high-resolution images, you dont want to have to wait seconds between shots for them to be written to your memory card. Write speed is most important, and is usually specified with a Speed Class rating. The minimum performances you can expect are Class 2 (at least 2 MB/s), Class 4 (at least 4 MB/s), Class 6 (at least 6 MB/s), or Class 10 (at least 10 MB/s). Some card makers will also list a maximum speed and/or a read speed separately to distinguish between different cards. In addition to the raw write speed theres an extra spec to be aware of for higher-end cards: Ultra High Speed (UHS). This is usually written as U1 (write speeds of at least 10 MB/s, like Class 10) or U3 (at least 30 MB/s), but you might also see references to UHS-I, UHS-II, and UHS-III in card specs. These are the potential speeds of the card architecture (the bus speeds) rather than raw transfer speeds, so while related, theyre not actually the same. Dont worry too much about UHS-I, UHS-II, or UHS-IIIlook for U1 or U3 insteadbut if you see them, you know what they are. Theoretical data transfer rates of 104 MB/s are possible with UHS-I, 312 MB/s with UHS-II, and a whopping 624 MB/s with UHS-II, while cards without a UHS rating are stuck at 25 MB/s. However, the flash memory itself and the connected gadgets need to be able to support those bus speeds too. Some cards, particularly older or cheaper ones, will just quote a maximum read or write speeds (as opposed to the minimum write speed indicated by the Speed Class rating)although its important to note that this is usually a maximum rating that you wont get consistently. They might also quote a figure like 150x, which essentially means how much faster it is compared to the read speed of a CD. But thats an outdated reference, which is why you dont see it used much any more. Theres one more spec to talk about, the new Video Speed Class which is designed to help you pick the right card for saving 4K or even 8K video. Youve got V6 (write speeds of up to 6MB/s, like Class 6), V10 (up to 10 MB/s, like Class 10), V30 (up to 30 MB/s, like U3), V60 (up to 60 MB/s), and V90 (up to 90 MB/s). Video Speed Class appears on the fastest and newest XC cards, so look for it if you need top performance. Choosing the right card If youre still with us, congratulations. Youre not quite home and dry just yet though, because as well as working out the spec you need, you also need to make sure its actually going to work in your device. Not all card types or all capacities will work in all phones and cameras, particularly if youre using a gadget thats a few years old. Thankfully, your devices should prominently list the memory cards theyre compatible with, and might even offer some recommendations for a minimum Speed Class. Most Class 10/U1/V10 cards will handle 1080p video comfortably, but for 4K footage its a good idea to go up to U3/V30 instead, otherwise you run the risk of losing frames resulting in stuttered video. Its also worth noting that your choice of memory card doesnt affect the quality of your photos or videosbut more expensive cards can save and process files faster, more reliably, with less chance of errors, and with a better chance of file recovery if the data gets erased. When youve got billions of incoming pixels from a 4K video capture, those are very important factors to consider. Theres some backwards compatibility between new and old standards, so a device capable of reading SDXC cards will be able to read SD and SDHC cards too, albeit at slower speeds. But the reverse isnt true, so you cant just stick an SDXC card in a gadget that only supports SD and SDHC. As weve said, it should be fairly easy to find out which cards are compatible with a given device, but youll want to make sure to double-check each time. (The Nintendo Switch, for example, needs a UHS-I card ). When youve got a handle on the speed you need, you can then decide how much capacity you want, or can afford. The highest capacities (currently 512GB) are usually very expensive, as the tech that makes them possible is only just out of development. So you might find a better value with a smaller card. But as with read and write speeds, youll also want to make sure youre not spending a lot of money on a giant card thats actually too big for your phone or camera to deal with. The most important thing is to first confirm what formats and capacities it supports.","As with a lot of tech purchasing decisions, when it comes to buying a memory card you can’t just click on the first result that appears on your online retailer of choice and that’s that—today’s memory cards, with their small sizes and huge capacities, have fe…",2018-11-23T18:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",How to Pick the Right Memory Card for Every Device You Own,https://gizmodo.com/how-to-pick-the-right-memory-card-for-every-device-you-1829990169,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--PCSa6j3c--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/ivzj1o4dyhrgrwveudan.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,class-4,1
Connie Loizos,"In 2015, the San Francisco-based education platform MasterClass was founded with an express mission to provide everyone access to “genius,” whether it be in filmmaking, directing, book writing, cooking, tennis, basketball, comedy, acting, screenwriting, photography — even producing electronic music. Toward that end, MasterClass, which is now selling a $180 all-you-can eat yearly subscription to 80 percent of its customers, currently offers hours of instructional insights from Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, James Patterson, Gordan Ramsey, Serena Williams, Steph Curry, Judd Apatow, Helen Mirren, Aaron Sorkin, and Annie Leibovitz, among many experts in their respective fields. Now, backed by $80 million in fresh funding that it closed on earlier this month, the fast-growing company is looking to expand on ways to attract new people to its platform, and two of those new areas center on business and politics. So said cofounder and CEO David Rogier at an industry event in San Francisco last week hosted by this editor. In fact, he said to expect classes on how to run for office and how to govern with the next year, which is perhaps unsurprising given that a record number of people are running for Congress this year, including record numbers of women. In fact, Rogier — who has taken some of MasterClass’s storytelling workshops — took attendees behind the scenes to share how quite a bit about MasterClass, including how it is consumed by users, how it approaches marketing spend, and why he thinks it’s five to eight times stickier than online education platforms that promise users credentials of one kind or another. He was interviewed by Sarah McBride of Bloomberg and excerpts of their chat follow. You can also see video of their conversation below. On which class Rogier might recommend to someone new, to give them a flavor of what MasterClass offers: We did a class with Hans Zimmer, a film composer who has composed songs for every single film you’ve ever seen. I’d never heard of Hans Zimmer before [he signed on to do a MasterClass]. I’m also not very good with beats and rhythm. But he starts the class by saying, ‘Every time you play a note, it asks a question — then answers it.’ And I was like, what kind of crap is that ? And then he plays it on the keyboard, and I was like, holy shit, and [the class] has changed the way that I hear music. On how MasterClass decides on who to invite on to the platform: We do lots of work to figure out who people want to learn from. It’s combination of: who is among the best in the world, and who is somebody who [customers] think they can actually learn from? I maybe shouldn’t say this out loud, but one of the people who people love but they don’t want to learn from is Will Smith. I love him as an actor; I think he’s really great. But even though he has the most fans on Facebook and the world, people don’t want to learn from him, when you ask them, because they say he’s tall and handsome and charismatic and funny. Like, I can’t be those things! [Meanwhile] I think of Steph Curry. I think I can be Steph Curry. Steph Curry is 6’1″, 180 pounds... obviously I can’t be Steph Curry [laughs] but there’s something about feeling that I can learn from somebody. How Rogier and his team lined up talent for MasterClass platform in its earliest days: It probably took us a year [to line up the early talent]. I mean, we cold-emailed and cold-called everybody who we could. I remember we wanted a class from James Patterson. James Patterson is the best-selling author in the world, and I cold-emailed everybody I could — his speaking agent, his [primary] agent, his PR person. The only response I got was from a guy who claimed to be his speaking agent. I got so excited. Me and my cofounder Aaron [Rasmussen] go and prepare a pitch. We pitch him. And the guy says, ‘Sorry, James isn’t interested.’ I was really heartbroken. It was the first hot lead we’d had in a long time. And then I’m walking down the street in Los Angeles, and I get a call from a number I don’t recognize, and I say, ‘Hey, this is David.’ And this guy goes, ‘Hi, I’m Jim Patterson.’ And I’m like, ‘The author?’ He’s like, ‘Yes.’ And I’m like, ‘I’m very surprised to hear from you.’ He’s like, ‘I’m a surprising guy.’ [Laughs.] And he said, ‘If the timing works, I’d love to teach.’ And I was like, ‘Sir, I’m pretty confused right now, because I thought I just got a no.’ And he asked who I’d spoken to, and he was like, ‘I don’t know who the f*ck that person is.’ On how MasterClass compensates its all-star instructors: It’s a mix of structure, but we want to make a deal where they share in the upside. It’s a mix of either a fee or a back-end [royalty]. Why some of MasterClass’s courses may seem similar but are distinct, in his view: With Martin Scorsese, we were talking to him about what does he want to teach and how, and he’s like, ‘The only way to learn film is to watch film.’ So I think it’s a total of eight hours where you are sitting with Martin Scorsese as he breaks down film. Compare that to Ron Howard, who did a classroom on directing and who’s like, ‘The last thing you want to do is watch film. What you have to do is actually make film.’ On the evolving revenue model of MasterClass, which used to center around charging $90 per class: By the end of last year, it started being expensive to take our classes, and a big part of what our goal is to make it possible for anybody in the world to learn from the absolute best. So we did lots of testing, and what we rolled out was, for $180 a year, you get access to everything, and that has just blown up. That’s now over 80 percent of our revenue, and we raised [that] $80 million [Series D round] off that success. Rogier on the classes whose popularity has most surprised him: I’m not surprised that a cooking can class from Chef [Gordon] Ramsay does well, or that Steph Curry’s class does well. I’m surprised by some of other folks. We have a class from a guy by the name of Deadmau5... and that class is phenomenal. And it’s like a total surprise. He is [an electronic music producer] and for those who don’t know, he wears an actual mouse helmet because he’s afraid of people. He literally can’t play music, so when he writes songs, he drags the notes on the screen until he hears the sound he likes. I mean, that’s a crazy way to write a song! But his classes on how to write the tracks do really well. Another we just launched, Chris Hadfield, the former commander of the International Space Station, [who teaches about space exploration] — he’s much less well-known but that’s also doing great. So the ones I’m surprised by are the ones that are lesser-known. On how much of the classes are actually consumed, start to finish (and why): The average MOOC sees 4 percent of people finish a class. Our rate are five to eight times that. I really think online social education is stuck where it was when we were all in school when, if you actually want to make great compelling education, it should be just as engaging as watching a movie. We actually bring aboard a lot of filmmakers to help us make the class, beside educators, so as a result, we see much higher rates [regarding] how people engage. But one of the most interesting things for us is that, because it’s not for school school credit, you actually follow what you’re interested in. And so as a result of that — and this is a crazy stat — but roughly one third of the people who start with the Steph Curry class on basketball end up taking a class on screenwriting. All of us have things were care truly, deeply in, but there are also things that you just want to know a bit about. Users want that breadth...[In fact] we’re also going to go into business and how to run for office and how to actually govern. Over the next year, there will be lots of new categories. Rogier on what MasterClass has learned about its customers’ consumption habits (whether they are viewing on their phones, in extended sittings, etc.): Before we launched the $180 yearly subscription, it was: you watch it and you take notes. [The new model] has totally changed how people consume [MasterClass]. Oftentimes, they’re still at home in front of a big screen or the iPad. Also, they usually [view] it in chunks. So they sit down for half an hour and consume; they then come back and consume more. [Last] people seem to consume one class at a time. You go through as much as you’re going to go through with Chef Ramsay before [moving on]. On when MasterClass began spending on marketing and where: My rule around paid marketing is to only spend if it if you’re going to make money off it. It just happens to be that on social and on the web, it’s a great market for us, because we can target people who like photography. And you know, especially early on, this wasn’t a thing that you searched for you. You never searched for the idea: ‘Can I take a photo class from Annie Leibovitz.” But [online] has been a really effective channel for us. On MasterClass’s target audience: It’s a tricky question because we don’t really see trends across age or gender. How we talk about internally is, before the subscription, a big chunk of [our customers] were actually pros. It was, I’m a professional in that category and I want to get better for my job. The second group was, I love this as a passion. What we’ve seen now since launching this all-access pass is a new group of people that people just loves to learn and believes that, if I learn, my life will will be better.","In 2015, the San Francisco-based education platform MasterClass was founded with an express mission to provide everyone access to “genius,” whether it be in filmmaking, directing, book writing, cooking, tennis, basketball, comedy, acting, screenwriting, photo…",2018-10-03T18:13:26Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","MasterClass, the education platform featuring all-star instructors, will soon teach you how to run for office, too",http://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/masterclass-new-offerings/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44212388394_2c90d1c6f2_k.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-4,1

Sam Haysom,"Kids may say some spectacularly funny things at times, but every now and then they can be impressively wise too. SEE ALSO: Smart-ass kid has the perfect response to a confusing math question On Tuesday, teacher Bret Turner tweeted about a recent puzzle he'd set for his first grade class. ""I am the beginning of everything, the end of everywhere,"" reads the riddle. ""I'm the beginning of eternity, the end of time and space. ""What am I?"" The first response he got, while ultimately wrong, was pretty deep. The first guess from one of my 1st graders was “death” and such an awed, somber, reflective hush fell over the class that I didn’t want to tell them that actually the answer is the letter e, which just seemed so banal in the moment pic.twitter.com/7sYFxHNcZk — Bret Turner (@bretjturner) January 2, 2018 When you remember that these are six-year-olds we're talking about, ""death"" is both incredibly wise and incredibly bleak.

Leigh Anderson,"Here on the East Coast, winter has finally arrived: This morning, the temperature was 22 degrees with a wind chill of 9. It’s cold! For some people, the first freeze of winter is doubly depressing—we’re close to the shortest day of the year, which means we’re not getting a good dose of sunlight, and it’s too cold to go outside and get some exercise and fresh air. But don’t despair! Winter can be a season for hibernation, sure, but if you’re clever and plan ahead, you won’t necessarily start climbing the walls. This AskMetafilter question was posted by a user with mobility issues who hates the forced confinement of freezing temps, and commenters chimed in with many useful suggestions on how to weather the winter with one’s good spirits intact. Below are the indoor-entertainment possibilities that resonated the most with me, but definitely check out the whole thread for even more ideas. 1. Deal with your house In my family, the run-up to Christmas causes me a certain amount of mild anxiety. I know a deluge of new gifts for my kids is coming, and it feels like that water level in our cramped apartment is rising. So take a few evenings or a weekend and cull your closets, shelves, and that pile of stuff by the door (we all have one). Or redecorate a room or sew some new pillow covers or build a bookcase. I know that nothing makes me feel more accomplished than painting a room and hauling a load of stuff to the Good Will. Sprucing up your living space provides a sense of satisfaction; it also just...spruces up your living space. Which is nice when you’re trapped there. For some, the winter is a magical time of year. For others like me, it’s a gloomy, cold, darkness… Read more Read 2. Get active for a cause Is the current political environment making you antsy? Do you want to use your time to help other people? You’re not alone. And even if you can’t go door-to-door and attend meetings, you can still do a lot of good work online or on your phone. VolunteerMatch will help you find volunteer opportunities in fields that interest you, and you can filter the results by “virtual opportunities.” (Note—it doesn’t filter perfectly, so you have to read carefully. But there are still lots of chances to help out with web design or admin support for organizations getting off the ground.) If you already have a favorite nonprofit or political candidate, contact them directly and ask how you can help from home. 3. Get completist about a subject This winter I want to learn to play a certain fiddle tune on the guitar in all 12 keys. Will I actually complete it? I doubt it. But by April I might make it through four keys, which is still better than the zero keys I know it in now. I’m also planning a personal mini-class on the Civil War, complete with the Ken Burns documentary and a few thick books already on my nightstand. By the spring I’ll basically have a Ph.D. 4. Host Make people trudge through the snow to you. Put on a pot of stew, bake some bread, and break out the whiskey. How do you think that people in cold climates stay social? Winter is back, and it's colder than ever. Coupled with snow, dry air, sickness, and… Read more Read 5. Get a penpal Postcrossing is something I’ve never heard of, but it seems to be a way to have short correspondences, via postcard, with people all over the world. There are also sites that will match you with more traditional pen pals (check this post out for safety tips before you start). 6. Take an online class Want to bone up on your art history, your calculus, your knife technique? Google around for virtual instruction in whatever subject is grabbing you. I’d probably try some kind of write-your-novel class that would force me to turn in a certain number of pages each week, but there’s obviously a huge range of subjects to choose from. If you live in a snowy place and you don’t have a hot water bottle at the foot of your bed, I’m… Read more Read 7. Proofread Project Gutenberg needs proofreaders for their scanned books. You get to read and help distribute great works of literature at the same time! And of course there are the old cold-weather standbys, like cooking, crafting, and playing music, and the new cold-weather standbys, like video games and social media. Do you have a novel way of getting through a hard winter without losing your mind?

"Josh Ocampo on Vitals, shared by Josh Ocampo to Lifehacker","I used to hate the gymnot because of actual exercise per se, but purely because I was so self-conscious. I was obsessed with the idea that Id be criticized for my shoddy squat form or brief five minutes on the treadmilland then exiled from my gym forever, cast off onto the island of exercise pariahs. I hated it so much Id avoid using the gym at peak hours just to avert the judgment of others, even if that meant getting my adrenaline rush at 4 AM.
The gym can feel a lot like a pressure-cooker for many first-time gym goers, consumed by the idea of having all eyes on them. But the fear of judgment from heavy lifters or marathon runners, all of whom are usually consumed by their own exercise regimens, shouldnt weigh any gym beginner down. Here are some tips on feeling less anxious while exercising and conquering the gym on your first day.
Free weights and machines each have their benefits, but what often keeps us out of the weight room
Read more Read
Bring a Friend
The gym doesnt have to be a solitary experience. In fact, bringing a friend can help ease some of the initial fears of entering a crowded weight room. Having a friend with some expertise at the gym can also help you get familiarized with basic form or weight machines with a purpose that remains unclear (how exactly do you use that leg press machine?) 
Better yet, a recent study has shown that having an emotionally supportive exercise companion can actually increase exercise frequency. 
Join a Group Fitness Class 
Joining a trendy group fitness class can feel intimidating, but its also a great place to learn the basics and ultimately hold yourself accountable.
Once you sign up for a class, it often feels more like an appointment or meeting you cant change. And from experience, I can tell you that youre more likely to make friends, especially in classes that encourage partner work like some Crossfit gyms. John Ford, a certified exercise physiologist, spoke with NBC News about how group classes can help motivate you, too. 
Group settings can lead to a positive competitiveness. For instance, wanting to keep up with those around you can make you push yourself harder than you would on your own. Seeing what others are capable of doing can inspire you to do more. Ive personally had this experience: Watching others made me realize I had put some mental barriers up to pushing harder or trying different exercises/routines
Get a Personal Trainer

Read more Read
Not all personal trainers are created equal. Some are excellent, knowledgeable and encouraging. And others, well, practice the art of bro-science (like the logistics of confusing your muscles to achieve gains, which has yet to be proven).
That said, finding a good trainer to help you learn form and develop a routine is an excellent way to start your fitness journey. I spoke with Luis Cornier, a personal trainer and Precor Master Coach who reiterated the benefits of using a trainer.
I personally have met clients and coaches that first seemed like the world is on their shoulders. Empowering the member to be comfortable in their physicality opens the door to becoming more confident either with a coach or in a class setting.
As we previously wrote, its also important to find a trainer whose compatible with your goals and encourages you when you need it (and isnt trying to hammer you down with sales tactics on the outset).
Dont Be Afraid to Start Small
Every competitive powerlifter, marathon runner or triathlete in history started at square one. You shouldnt expect to deadlift 225 pounds or run 26.2 miles on day one and every exercise-fanatic can relate. Dont occupy yourself with the calorie count on a treadmill or the amount of weight.
Instead, give yourself the time to start small and relish in the progress you make day-to-day. Dont be afraid to ask for help either, like a much-needed spot for a bench press. The gym is a communal space, after all, and no one should feel out of place when it comes to self-improvement.","I used to hate the gym—not because of actual exercise per se, but purely because I was so self-conscious.

In a heated tweet on Monday, the president claimed that he has ""the absolute right to pardon"" himself, which is a sentiment he claims has been ""stated by numerous legal scholars."" He also clarified that he's done ""nothing wrong.""

Josh Constine,"Coinbase has some serious competition. Today Robinhood starts rolling out its no-commission cryptocurrency trading feature in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire. Users can buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum with no extra fees, and track those and 14 other coins in its sleek app. That’s compared to paying 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US on Coinbase. Users can sign up on the Robinhood Crypto site to waitlist for access. Robinhood has a chance to usurp Coinbase as the defacto crypto trading site app by vastly undercutting its fees. When people are buying thousands of dollars of cryptocurrencies at a time, Coinbase’s 1.5 to 4 percent fees in the US can quickly add up. But Robinhood sees giving away the service for free as a powerful way to gain users for its existing service that lets people trade stocks, ETFs, and options without additional charges. It’s stylish, retro-future Tron interface is also a super easy way to check on pricing and news about 16 coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Monero, Dash, Stellar, Qtum, Bitcoin Gold, OmiseGo, NEO, Lisk, and Dogecoin. Robinhood Crypto first announced the feature last month, with one million people signing up in just the first four days. That interest has driven Robinhood’s total registered user count to over 4 million, up from 3 million in November. Those users have transacted over $100 billion to date, saving $1 billion in commission fees. On most stock trading services like E*Trade and Scottrade, customers pay around $7 per trade to cover these companies’ marketing, physical branches, and sales reps. Founded in 2013, Robinhood ditches those fees by running a lean operation centered around engineers and its app. It makes money on the interest of cash its customers keep with it, or by selling monthly Robinhood Gold subscriptions that let users borrow money to trade with. That business has allowed the startup to raise $176 million, most recently at a $1.3 billion valuation. And with its free crypto trading, it may have found a way to luring in a fresh class of amateur investors. Keeping security locked tight will be critical, especially given disastrous breaches at other crypto companies. But as crypto draws a new generation into the world of finance, Robinhood wants to help them play the market, day or night.

Bryan Menegus,"Facebook’s share value has been in a tailspin as the depths of its irresponsible data handling has become known to the world. Salting that wound is a class-action lawsuit, filed today in California’s Northern district, on behalf of the social media giant’s shareholders. Fan Yuan, the shareholder who filed the suit, accuses Facebook of making “materially false and/or misleading” claims about the company’s handling of user data—meaning the instances where Facebook or Zuckerberg himself addressed privacy and security issues and failed to disclose the ongoing Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Cambridge Analytica is certainly the most pressing of the many scandals Facebook is currently embroiled in. The shady analytics firm is believed to have gained access to personal data from around 50 million of Facebook’s users, which it employed to inform online ad spending and influence elections. Earlier today, New York and Massachusetts demanded Facebook turn over information regarding Cambridge Analytica, and congresspeople are increasingly calling for Zuckerberg himself to testify. Cambridge Analytica meanwhile suspended its CEO Alexander Nix today over remarks recorded by British television station Channel 4 News, which feature Nix apparently speaking about entrapping politicians using sex workers. Yuan’s suit—which represents a class of unknown size—alleges that failures to disclose the ongoing situation with Cambridge Analytica has reduced the value of shares he and others hold in the company. He’s asking to award damages unspecified and any other amount the court deems proper. We’ve reached out to Facebook and Pomerantz LLP, the firm representing Yaun, for comment.

Dani Deahl,"Several members of the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) have collectively filed a lawsuit against fitness startup Peloton today, seeking over $150 million in damages. The complaint, filed by Downtown Music Publishing, Ultra Music, and eight other publishing groups, says that Peloton has been using their musical works for years in its workout videos without proper licensing, resulting in income lost for songwriters. The complaint says that Peloton does have some licenses in place with other labels and publishers, but not with the plaintiffs named in this suit. It alleges that Peloton has “used more than 1,000 musical works owned or administered by Plaintiffs over a period of years in the videos that it makes available to its hundreds of thousands of customers without a synchronization (or “sync”) license.” In one instance, the company allegedly “obtained a license for a limited time but then let that license expire, while continuing to use Ultra’s copyrighted works.” “Music is a core part of the Peloton business model” Peloton’s workout videos are broadcast to Peloton bikes and treadmills across the world, usually accompanied by a playlist of songs to guide the workout. The company also offers a digital subscription to its video classes for those who want to exercise with their own non-Peloton equipment. The effect is similar to an in-person gym class, but music heard in a video requires a different license. Playing music in the open for people to hear, like in a gym, requires a license for public airwaves rights. But if you are watching that same class as a video from your Peloton at home, that music now requires what is called a sync license, because the music is synchronized with visual media output. Alleged infringed works include songs from Lady Gaga, Adele, Migos, Skrillex, Katy Perry, and more Some of the works the complaint says Peloton is using without proper licensing include “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, “Only Girl” by Rihanna, “Drip” by Migos and Cardi B, and “Bangarang” by Skrillex and Sirah, as listed in the complaint. “Music is a core part of the Peloton business model and is responsible for much of the brand’s swift success,” said NMPA president and CEO David Israelite said in a statement. “Thousands of exclusive videos and playlists are a major reason hundreds of thousands of people have purchased Peloton products.” Reached by The Verge, Peloton emphasized that it has an extensive licensing system and has partnered with a number of music-industry groups. “We just received the complaint this morning, and we are evaluating it,” a representative from Peloton told The Verge. “Peloton has great respect for songwriters and artists. In fact, we have partnered with each of the major music publishers, record labels and performing rights organizations, and many leading independents. We have also invested heavily to build a best-in-breed reporting and licensing system to support our partners and provide our members with a world-class fitness experience.” The NMPA alleges that these infringements by Peloton have been occurring since 2014, when it launched at-home streaming on its machines. The company is currently valued at $4 billion and, according to The Wall Street Journal, is making steps toward an IPO this year.","Several members of the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) have collectively filed a lawsuit against fitness startup Peloton today, seeking over $150 million in damages.

Kirsten Korosec,"Mercedes-Benz has often reserved its best tech for its highest class models the S Class being the first vehicle to get the latest and greatest. Now Mercedes is bringing more of tech, namely its new MBUX infotainment system, to other vehicles in its portfolio.
Enter the new CLA Class. Mercedes-Benz unveiled Monday the new CLA at CES 2019 a slightly bigger, sleeker, sportier and techier car than its predecessor in a direct appeal to a younger American customer.
The exterior of the new CLA hasn’t changed too much. The rear license plate has been moved down, and it has a bit more aerodynamic and sportier look with a long stretched bonnet featuring powerdomes. It’s sportier and sharper looking.
The more exciting stuff is what’s inside the vehicle. Inside the CLA Class, Mercedes has put its new MBUX system, which debuted in the new A Class. The GLE-Class SUV also has the new MBUX system.
This system is a major upgrade from its old COMAND interface. It’s loaded with features such as augmented reality for navigation, the ability to understand indirect voice commands and operational gestures from the users. The new Interior Assistant, as Mercedes calls, includes a robust gesture control system. 
In the dark, a reading lamp can be switched on and off by briefly extending a hand towards the rear-view mirror, for example. If the driver reaches over towards the unoccupied front passenger seat in the dark, it will be illuminated automatically, Mercedes said. The interior assistant includes a personal favorites function, which is accessed by holding a hand over the center console with the index and middle finger spread in a V-shape. A favorite command could be “navigate me home.” The driver and front passenger can even assign different favorites to the same hand position.
https://api.media.mercedes-benz.com/v2/storage/v1/public/30c11a98-d234-4a47-9e41-8c64350c1d48
And then there’s the voice assistant, which can handle complex questions. 
Ola Källenius, Daimler AG board member responsible for group research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development, demonstrated the voice assistant at CES. “Drivers can speak even more naturally,” he said, adding that the days of yelling at your voice assistant in the car are over. “It’s the ultimate wearable.”
The driver or passenger just needs to say Hey Mercedes,” to engage the voice assistant. From there, they could ask for something as complicated as asking “Find child-friendly Asian restaurants nearby with 4-star rating which are neither Chinese nor Japanese,” an example Källenius gave during the demo.
Finally, there’s the “Energizing Coach.” This service is based on an intelligent algorithm. If a user is wearing the new Mercedes-Benz vivoactive 3 Smartwatch, which had its world première at CES, or another compatible Garmin wearable is worn, personal stats will be provided such as stress level or quality of sleep. The user’s pulse rate supplied by the integrated Garmin wearable is also shown on the media display.
The CLA is an important vehicle for Mercedes in the U.S. market. Mercedes first launched the compact four-door coupe in 2013 as its smallest and least-expensive vehicle in its portfolio that customers could buy in the United States.
It was the first compact Mercedes-Benz on the American market. And while it wasn’t viewed as the best vehicle by some critics, it proved to be popular with U.S. customers.
With the first CLA we celebrated a huge success by selling some 750,000 vehicles and created a totally new segment with a four-door coupé, adds Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing &amp; Sales.
The automaker has recognized the need to give this vehicle a boost of tech, especially considering that on average CLA customers in the U.S. are around 10 years younger than the typical Mercedes-Benz customer.
And it has. As Mercedes puts it, all elements of the interior are arranged according to the “overarching design themes of high tech and youthful avant-garde.'”
Translated this means designers ditched the cowl above the driver cockpit, giving the dashboard a grander look that continues uninterrupted. A widescreen display is completely free-standing. the youngs like screens.
The lower section is visually separated from the main body of the instrument cluster by a trench, and it appears to float in front of the instrument cluster. The ambient lighting enhances this effect. The air vents in a sporty turbine-look are another highlight.
The new CLA will be manufactured at the Kecskemét plant in Hungary and comes onto the market in May 2019.","Mercedes-Benz has often reserved its best tech for its highest class models — the S Class being the first vehicle to get the latest and greatest.

ROBERT D. McFADDEN,"In 1970, she and Mayor Lindsay formed the Council on the Environment, which joined city agencies in trying to improve the local environment. Over more than two decades, with Mrs. Heiskell at the helm, the organization reclaimed trash-strewn lots and created 40 community-run parks, playgrounds and gardens. The Marian S. Heiskell Garden, on West 48th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, was opened in 1997. The council also organized 33 farmers markets, began environmental education programs in 15 schools and promoted early wastepaper recycling programs.
The recipient of many awards for her environmental work, Mrs. Heiskell was a director of the National Audubon Society, the National Park Foundation, the New York Botanical Garden, the New York City Partnership and the Community Service Society of New York.
Mr. Heiskell retired from Time in 1980 and died in 2003. In a memoir, Outsider, Insider: An Unlikely Success Story, privately published in 1998, he wrote that Marian, his third wife, had given him a sense of family and security that he had craved since childhood.
While Mrs. Heiskell stepped down as a director of The Times in 1997, she remained a principal owner of the company under a trust that passed to the four children of Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger upon her death in 1990. The trust, set up in 1986 under an agreement intended to preserve family control of the company, holds 83.7 percent of the Class B stock, which is not publicly traded and elects 70 percent of the board members. Class A stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange and widely held, elects 30 percent of the directors, whose numbers fluctuate slightly.
In succeeding years, Mrs. Heiskell maintained an office at The Times, dining in the cafeteria with staff members and conferring with her brother, the chairman emeritus, known all his life as Punch, and her nephew, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., who succeeded his father as publisher and chairman, and at the end of 2017 was succeeded as publisher by his son, Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, known as A. G. Sulzberger. Mrs. Heiskells daughter Jacqueline Dryfoos served on the board of The Times from 2000 to 2005.
Mrs. Heiskell also supported journalism education. In 2005, she and her sisters contributed $4 million to Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Journalism for advanced management training for news executives, and another $4 million to the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, which opened in 2006, for internships and scholarships. Both gifts were made in honor of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.",Marian Sulzberger Heiskell in an undated photo.

Romain Dillet,"Apple recently unveiled a bunch of new products during a press event in New York. But the company also quietly shared a press release with new configurations for the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Customers can now get a MacBook Pro with an AMD Radeon Pro Vega 16 or Vega 20 graphics processing unit. Before this update, users could only get Radeon Pro 555X or 560X GPUs. Those options are still available, but you can now pay a bit more money to get much better GPUs. As the name suggests, Vega is a new generation of graphics processors. The iMac Pro comes with desktop-class Vega processors the Vega 56 and Vega 64. The Vega 16 or Vega 20 are less powerful than the iMac Pro GPUs. But they also fit in a laptop and consume much less power. In particular, Radeon Pro GPUs use GDDR5 memory just like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One X. But Vega GPUs now take advantage of HBM2 memory, which provides more bandwidth and consumes less power. It leads to a direct bump in performance. Apple says you can expect as much as 60 percent faster graphics performance. But well have to wait for the benchmarks to know that for sure. Vega GPUs are only available on the most expensive 15-inch MacBook Pro configuration that starts at $2,799 with a Radeon Pro 560X.

Nick Summers,"Nico, a scout-type soldier, lines up a shot on a rain-soaked battlefield. The skirmishes play out on a relatively small scale. You rarely have more than 10 units on the battlefield, though protective camps allow you to quickly recall and deploy different soldiers, evolving your strategy as enemies regroup or call in reinforcements. Despite the small numbers, objectives can take up to an hour to complete. If you're savvy with your points, though, and pick the right squad composition, you can complete most missions in under 30 minutes. It's all a matter of balance -- fast attacks are useful, but push too hard and your units will likely be exposed on the enemy's turn. During a hands-on session, I played a tutorial mission and two campaign skirmishes. The first of these was an assault on a castle protecting a war-critical Howitzer cannon. There was only one route inside, a narrow bridge that had long, tall ramparts on either side. Heavy gunners were mounted on both, and it was my job to eliminate them before carefully pushing up to the main gate. At first, I couldn't fathom how to pick them off. But then I was introduced to a new grenadier class that shoots in long, high arcs. Unlike lancers and snipers, which fire in a straight line, this meant I could pick off gunners when they ducked behind some stony cover. The second was set in a fog-filled town overrun by the enemy. My mission was to carefully infiltrate the area and identify how many of their 'tanks' were real and fake. It was a novel premise and I enjoyed using a mixture of scouts and snipers to silently pick off enemy troops and perform reconnaissance undetected. Command Mode gives you a clear overview of the map. The Valkyria Chronicles franchise tackles a fictional war between the Atlantic Federation and the East Europan Imperial Alliance. It takes place on a continent called Europa, which yes, is basically Europe in disguise. The world map is a little different, but you can clearly make out the United Kingdom and the general shape of countries like Italy. Sometimes, this fantasy universe can feel like a bit of a cop-out; an easy way to avoid cultural backlash. It does, however, allow the development team to craft their own narrative and imaginative missions without worrying about their historical accuracy. Valkyria Chronicles 4 is set in the same timeframe as the original game. The campaign, though, focuses on a new squad, led by commander Claude Wallace, that is pushing toward the imperial capital in the east. Like the first game, Valkyria Chronicles 4 spends a lot of time fleshing out its core cast. At first, they seem like a group of anime cliches with one-note personalities; Raz is arrogant and keen to get into a scrap, while Kai is silent or blunt in her remarks. Over time, though, the game delves into their histories, dreams and relationships with one another. After my first mission, for instance, grenadier Riley Miller spotted Raz and Kai and instantly started reminiscing about their shared past. She then slapped Wallace in the face and said: ""I can't believe I took orders from this coward.""","For 99 percent of people, Valkyria Chronicles 4 might as well be called Valkyria Chronicles 2.

Dylan Haas,"The question that refuses to go away: is college relevant? The debate's been raging for a while, with alternative education programs such as coding bootcamps and MOOCs popping up as alternatives to a pricey four-year education. (And considering that the aftermath of this year's college admissions scandal continues to reverberate, we can't blame folks for seeking alternatives.)
Certainly, there is a tradeoff with online courses, as most are pre-recorded and pre-scripted with a set curriculum. Still, many students cite convenience and affordability as the most important things, so they're willing to go without the live instruction. Why go back to formal schooling when you can learn on your own time? That's certainly been the case with most courses we've written about, but the DevGuides Live Webinars are different.

DAMIEN CAVE and CHARLOTTE GRAHAM-McLAY,"New Zealand only registers 4 percent of its weapons. According to the police, about 250,000 people in the country own an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million firearms. It is unclear how many of them would be affected by the ban.
New Zealand is at a considerable disadvantage to countries that have had registries, because theres no way of tracing the firearms because they dont know whos got them, Mr. Alpers said. Were relying entirely on the honesty of the gun owner to turn it in.
Ms. Ardern said that fair compensation would be paid to all those who participate.
Noting that there would be some limited exceptions for specific purposes, especially in rural areas, she said she expected the new law to be in place by April 11, the end of Parliaments next session.
In the interim, as of Thursday afternoon, a change in regulations would alter the licensing rules for the weapons that would eventually be banned. To avoid a rush on purchases, weapons that now require a basic A Class license will fall under an E Class gun license, which is already much harder to obtain, and which the prime minister said would now be impossible to get.
I can assure people there is no point in applying for such a permit, she said.
The suspect in the shootings, Brenton H. Tarrant, 28, was a licensed gun owner and member of a local gun club. An official with one gun retailer said his company had sold Mr. Tarrant four firearms along with ammunition between December 2017 a month after Mr. Tarrant received his gun license and March 2018.
But officials still do not know the source of a semiautomatic rifle that can be seen in a video of the attack on Al Noor Mosque, one of the two mosques the gunman targeted.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Who doesnt love a surprise tax bill?
Most people are expecting a tax refund this year, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017, which lowered rates and doubled the standard deduction. But at least some people who always received a refund in the past will owe money when they file this year, according to the IRS. 
Though most 2018 tax filers are still expected to get refunds, the number who owe tax, and in some cases a penalty, is likely to be larger than in recent years, the agency said.
This is most likely to apply to people with complicated taxes and those who live in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, reports CBS News, and those who itemized in the past but will take the increased standard deduction this yearespecially if you didnt check your withholdingslast year. The tax law increased some tax credits and deductions while completely eliminating or capping some others, which could have caused some of the confusion.
One of the biggest questions this tax season is whether to take the standard deduction, a flat

The IRS notes that two-wage-earner households and employees with non-wage sources of income are also more likely to owe, as well as retirees and those with dependents if they didnt adjust their withholdings last year. Adds the IRS:
In addition, various financial transactions, especially those occurring late in the year, can often have an unexpected tax impact. Examples include year-end and holiday bonuses, stock dividends, capital gain distributions from mutual funds and stocks, bonds, real estate or other property sold at a profit. 
And as I wrote here, many people may get a smaller refund than anticipated, since they already received the tax break in their paychecks throughout 2018. Reports CBS News:
Because the tax bill lowered tax brackets by 1 percentage point to 4 percentage points, most middle-class Americans are seeing much smaller tax cuts.
The middle 20 percent of income earners or people who earn between $42,000 to $67,000 annually saw their taxes decline by $800, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Thats a benefit of about $33 per paycheck.
If you didnt pay enough throughout the year and owe the IRS money, you may also be hit with a fine, though the agency is easing up on that slightly this year because of the confusion surrounding the 2017 tax law.

Nick Douglas,"There are as many ways to learn to code as there are ways to use your coding ability. You can learn it from college courses, books, online resources—or from one of several growing boot camps for developers of all ages. We talked to the founders of two such boot camps: David Graham of Code Ninjas, for kids 7–14, and Michael Choi of Coding Dojo, for teens and adults. They explained their different approaches, both of which give their students the ability to build their own applications. Michael Choi learned to code in Korea at age 12, with help from a friend who would make whole computer games in a day. When he went to college, he found their computer science classes didn’t address his needs. His Coding Dojo program trains students in just 14 weeks. “Our goal is, how can we get people to be a self-sufficient developer?” says Choi. In the first 3–4 weeks, students learn to “think like a computer” with five core concepts: if/else statements, for loops, functions, variables, and object-oriented programming. The next 10 weeks are spent on learning specific languages, and how each language handles those five concepts. This part isn’t just useful for students learning to code for the first time, but also for working developers who want to expand their career options. “They spend their entire career using one language, but now they need to pick something new,” says Choi. Coding Dojo can train a developer in a new language in 3–4 weeks, says Choi, versus 6–9 months learning on their own. But most of the work is done in assignments, not lectures. One reason college courses didn’t work for him is that they involved long lecture. “People only retain about 20 minutes of lecture,” he says, so he boils lessons down as much as possible, assigning 4–5 hours of work based on that lecture. When you’re just starting to learn to code, it’s hard to tell if you’ve got the basics down and if… Read more Read While Graham’s Code Ninjas follows the same principle of learning through building, it works on a much longer scale. The full curriculum lasts 3–4 years, and kids progress through it like a martial arts program, earning colored belts as they complete different levels. Students learn every concept by using it to build a video game. They can even draw their own art for the game. This makes the class feel less like another school subject and more like a fun project—learning to code becomes a game in itself. The kids make some wild games, with things like characters who fart rainbows. “That was not in our original curriculum!” says Graham. “Their imaginations are endless. I thought it would be kind of paint by numbers. What we found out is that kids don’t have those boundaries and walls in their thinking that adults do.” He’s convinced that Super Mario Brothers, where plumbers stomp on mushrooms and turtles, must have been influenced by kids. Graham staffs the school with high school seniors and college students, who can relate to the kids better than adults would. (He also points out that because coding jobs pay so well, he just can’t afford to hire adult coders.) Graham emphasizes that his curriculum teaches real coding—“any kid can whip something up from a template,” he says, but a Code Ninjas black belt can build an app for the App Store from scratch. Or could—Choi has the full curriculum planned out, but Code Ninjas only opened in March 2017, so his first students have only reached the intermediate phase. (Code Ninjas is rapidly expanding, and currently lists 264 locations in 32 states.) Changing career paths, getting an idea for an app out of your head, or just learning something new… Read more Read Graham and Choi agree that young people have an advantage when learning to code. Graham, who has also taught adults to code, says that kids move faster because they’re just more used to soaking up knowledge and following instructions. “Critical thinking isn’t bad, but it doesn’t lend itself to learning as quickly.” Choi says that younger students might have a “slightly easier” time, but his students range from 16 to their 60s. Of course, you can learn to code without a camp. You can still teach yourself, or start solo before moving onto a camp or other social method. Choi recommends the tutorials at W3Schools, and the online edX version of Harvard’s CS50 course. But he warns about the latter, “It goes pretty deep pretty quickly.”","There are as many ways to learn to code as there are ways to use your coding ability.

The last time was in 1998, when Davor Suker and company beat Germany on the way to the semifinals. This is Denmark’s first visit to the last 16 since 2002. • Croatia has impressed with a 3-0 start to the Cup in a tricky group, beating Nigeria, Argentina and Iceland. • With eight yellow cards, Croatia has the most of any team remaining in the tournament. It has committed 55 fouls, second of the remaining teams, three behind France, which has played one more game. • One of Denmark’s goal scorers is its leader, Christian Eriksen. Modric told reporters, “What I can say about Eriksen is, he’s a fantastic player, a world-class player. He’s the most important player for Denmark.” The other scorer, Yussuf Poulsen, returns for this game from a yellow card suspension. • These teams have not met in a competitive match since the qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. Denmark won theat game, with Peter Schemichel, father of current keeper Kasper Schmeichel, in goal. • Croatia is a comfortable favorite to win, with Denmark 4-1 or so.

And it doesnt seem that our politicians are doing anything, or at least not enough, about climate change either."" ""The sea level is rising and so are we."" Image: Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images Students have plenty to be angry about. A coal mine proposed by Indian mining giant Adani, which could have devastating effects on the country's environment, including the Great Barrier Reef, formed a popular protest message on many of the student signs. But there's an even bigger picture. Released Wednesday, the UN's 2018 Emissions Gap Report included Australia in a list of countries not on track to hit emissions goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement, although its government thinks otherwise. A student in Sydney protests in Martin Place.

At the beginning of Oct. 2018, the federal government rejected calls within the damning report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to phase out coal power by 2050.

Jennings Brown,"While some of his classmates wanted to execute senior pranks that would potentially disrupt classes, Missouri high school student Kylan Scheele opted for some tomfoolery that was a little more chill. “Other people were going to release live mice or, you know, building a beach in the front lobby area,” Scheele told Kansas City’s Fox affiliate. “And I thought let’s do something more laid back, so I just decided to post the school for sale.” Scheele listed Truman High School for the reasonable price of $12,275 on Craigslist. His post described the building as a “Huge 20+ room facility” and listed the following selling points, among others: “Newly build football field.” “Newly added 4 modern day rooms.” “Next to Walmart for convenience.” “Huge parking lot, great for partygoers looking for somewhere to park.” “Bigger than normal dinning room.” “Reason for sale is due to loss of students coming up.” “Named after hometown resident U.S. President Harry S. Truman and his family.” But while Scheele’s internet high jinks didn’t cause a headache for school janitors or violate any health codes, that “loss of students” comment concerned school administrators enough that they took action. “I decided to say the reason we’re selling this is because of ‘the loss of students,’ because the senior class is graduating,” said Scheele. Independence Police Department detectives investigated the Craigslist ad and decided not to pursue criminal charges, but told Scheele to remove the post and suggested he speak with school administrators. But that didn’t seem to help much. Scheele told the local news outlet that the administration suspended him for the remainder of the school year and is not allowing him to walk in his graduation this weekend. The school, it seems, saw the post as an “implied threat,” albeit not a credible one. According to a statement from a Independence School District: Out of an abundance of caution, administrators and police investigated and determined there was not a credible threat. A student who makes a real or implied threat, whether it is deemed credible or not, will face discipline. Due to the heightened concern nationally with school violence, we have extra police officers for the remainder of the school year and will have additional officers at graduations for all of our high schools. “They tried to relate it back to all the recent school shootings and everything—they tried tying it back to that,” Scheele told the Fox 4 Kanas City. “But I don’t see how it was a threat at all.” Scheele’s mom Denetra Clark is trying to see the bright side of the school district’s decision. “He’s going to get his diploma no matter what,” Clark said. “But maybe the party will start sooner.” [ Fox 4 Kansas City ]","While some of his classmates wanted to execute senior pranks that would potentially disrupt classes, Missouri high school student Kylan Scheele opted for some tomfoolery that was a little more chill.

Heather Dockray,"Many comedians will attempt to do an impression of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but few will ever succeed. Thankfully, we finally found someone who has mastered the art. 
Comedian Alyssa Limperis recently posted her impression of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to YouTube and Twitter on Thursday. Limperis imagines how Ocasio-Cortez might respond to Tan France, the stylist from Queer Eye, and his infamous French tuck (France's preferred method of tucking shirts).
The cast of Queer Eye, sans Karamo Brown, recently visited Ocasio-Cortez and other Congressional leaders on Capitol Hill.
SEE ALSO: AOC invited Bobby from 'Queer Eye' to help decorate her office
The impression is terrifyingly spot-on. Limperis captures Ocasio-Cortez's emphatic way of announcing her syllables and characteristic hand movements. She knows exactly where she places her gaze and just how often she twists her neck in a mini-fit of irritation.
Kudos to Limperis for further addressing one of the show's greatest injustices the excessive amount of labor Bobby Berk performs compared to others on the show. 
People on Twitter felt similarly.
This is without uncertainty the only AOC impression History will remember

Brian Heater,"Streaming video is the key to Pelotons success. But like any good spin class, its the soundtrack that really does the heavy lifting. A new suit filed by The National Music Publishers’ Association alleges that that the wild successful exercise startup used north of 1,000 songs in its classes without the proper licensing. 
The suit features a laundry list of publishers: Downtown Music Publishing, Big Deal Music, Reservoir, Round Hill, Royalty Network, Pulse Music Publishing and TRO Essex Music Group. While the list of musicians is a whos who of Top 40 musicians:  Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran, Wiz Khalifa, Thomas Rhett, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Florida Georgia Line, Drake and Gwen Stefani, for starters. 
The plaintiffs are seeking more than $150 million in damages over the improper use of songs. 
Unfortunately, instead of recognizing the integral role of songwriters to its company, Peloton has built its business by using their work without their permission or fair compensation for years, President &amp; CEO David Israelite said in a statement. It is frankly unimaginable that a company of this size and sophistication would think it could exploit music in this way without the proper licenses for this long, and we look forward to getting music creators what they deserve.
The association is quick to note that Peloton managed to pull in a $4 billion valuation last year, not a great look if the publishing claims turn out to be accurate.

Adam Rosenberg,"We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V. World War II setting. New cooperative mode. New approaches to progression and personalization. No more premium pass. SEE ALSO: 'Battlefield V' brings huge changes, but maybe not what you're expecting All sorts of good stuff. But there's a lot more to share from our three-hour call with DICE on Monday. Little things that would never make it as a back-of-the-box bullet point, but which still communicate so much about how this new Battlefield is different from all the past Battlefields. So here you go: 7 things you can do in Battlefield V that you couldn't before. 1. Build up your base Fortifications are a thing now! Every soldier hits the battlefield with a tool kit in hand. You can use that tool kit in set locations — especially around capture points — to build resupply stations, sandbag walls, barbed wire fences, tank deterrents, foxholes... you name it. 2. Stick with your squad Squads are elevated to a whole new level of importance in Battlefield V. You've always had the ability to respawn on squadmates, but now you can go a step further and actually see where they are and what they're doing from an over-the-shoulder perspective before you spawn back in. You know how you used to spawn in on a squadmate only to be gunned down seconds later? That should happen a whole lot less in Battlefield V. 3. Anyone can revive now, sort of Medics are still very much the go-to soldier class for players that like to heal. They can revive any downed soldier quickly, bringing them back to full health and ready to fight in no time. But medics aren't the only way to escape death. Squadmates also have the ability to revive one another, regardless of class. It'll take longer to do the revive than a proper medic, and your buddy won't come back with all their health. But it's something. Especially since.... 4. You can drag downed teammates to safety Great news for medics and helpful squadmates alike: When you see a teammate bleeding out on the ground, you can lend a hand and drag them off to a safe location before you get to work on reviving them. It's especially helpful for squadmate revives, since those take longer (unless you're a medic). But everyone should benefit from not being caught in a situation where you're gunned down immediately after being revived. 5. Squad leaders can do cool stuff if they lead well It's not new that Battlefield's squad leaders get some measure of control over their squaddies: When you're the leader, you can issue non-verbal orders that highlight a particular capture/defend point or some other objective. Battlefield V takes that leadership a step further by giving every squad leader a radio. As your squaddies follow orders and complete objectives, you earn points. Earn enough points and you can spend them, via the radio, on all sorts of bonuses: Supply drops, smoke screen barrages, heavy weapons and tanks, and even rocket strikes. 6. Stationary weapons are stationary no more Fixed weapon emplacements like anti-air or anti-tank turrets are no longer locked in one location. In Battlefield V you're able to connect them to an assortment of vehicles and drag them around, trailer-style. 7. Soldier classes can be further specialized Battlefield's four core classes — Assault, Support, Medic, and Recon — are all back in Battlefield V, but that's only where your customization begins. New archetypes allow you to tailor your preferred class for different types of battle conditions. DICE didn't go too heavily into the specifics here, but these archetypes come with skill trees that look like they offer a significant amount of control over how you progress.","We now know about the big picture for Battlefield V.

Megan Rose Dickey,"The story we’re used to hearing is that women get paid less than men. In Google’s case, according to its own internal pay audit, it turned out male-identified Level 4 Software Engineers received less money than women in that same role. That led to Google paying $9.7 million to adjust pay for 10,677 employees.
It’s not clear how many of the employees who received pay adjustments were men (TechCrunch reached out to Google about this, but the company declined to share any additional data) but Google does cite the underpaying of men as a reason for why the company paid more in adjustments for 2018 than in 2017. But The New York Times reports men received a disproportionately higher percentage of the money.
For 2017, Google paid just $270,000 to close any wage gaps for 228 employees across six job groups. Google also cited its new hire analysis as a reason why the company had to make more adjustments. The analysis, which entailed looking for discrepancies in offers to new hires, accounted for 49 of the total amount spent on adjustments. 
“Our pay equity analysis ensures that compensation is fair for employees in the same job, at the same level, location and performance,” Google Lead Analyst for Pay Equity and People Analytics Lauren Barbato wrote in a blog post. “But we know thats only part of the story. Because leveling, performance ratings, and promotion impact pay, this year, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of these processes to make sure the outcomes are fair and equitable for all employees.”
Meanwhile, Google is still battling a class-action pay discrimination lawsuit and is the subject of a Labor Department investigation pertaining to compensation data.","The story we’re used to hearing is that women get paid less than men.

Greg Kumparak,"For the last year or so, Disney has been dabbling with massive virtual reality experiences that let players strap on a portable VR rig and run around in a warehouse-sized environment. In partnership with TheVOID (part of Disney’s 2017 accelerator class) and Lucasfilm’s ILMxLab, it launched a Star Wars-themed experience, Secrets of the Empire, at both Downtown Disney (California) and Disney Springs (Florida) back in November of 2017. The next Disney property getting the VR treatment? Wreck-It Ralph. Here’s the trailer, released this morning: Based on the upcoming movie sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet, this one will be called, aptly, Ralph Breaks VR. Like Secrets before it, the Ralph game will support 4-players running around a shared VR environment but rather than dodging blaster fire and outsmarting stormtroopers, you’ll be having food fights with kittens and outrunning security drones. While I’m mostly neutral on Ralph, I’m… pretty excited for this. Secrets of the Empire is one of the most ridiculous experiences I’ve ever had in virtual reality. It’s hard to say much without spoiling some of the moments, but my jaw was on the damned floor for half of the time. Alas, there wasn’t much time to speak of; the entire thing only lasts about 25 minutes which, at $30 per person, felt way too short. Tickets for Ralph cost roughly the same; depending on location, it’ll be $30 or $33 per person. A representative for Disney confirms that Secrets of the Empire is not going away. It’s an upside of the game taking place almost entirely in VR retune the physical space to be a bit less Star Wars-y, schedule things just right, and you’re all set. (Oh, and while details are light: after Ralph, they’re working on a Marvel-themed experience set to debut in 2019. ) Tickets for the Ralph experience are available starting next week. In addition to VOID’s Disneyland/Disneyworld locations, it’ll also be running at their Glendale, CA and Las Vegas spots.","For the last year or so, Disney has been dabbling with massive virtual reality experiences that let players strap on a portable VR rig and run around in a warehouse-sized environment.

Laura Byager,"Thousands of school children in the UK are currently skipping class in favour of marching the streets in a call for world leaders to act on climate change. 
Inspired by Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, who organised her own month-long strike outside the Swedish parliament to raise awareness of climate change, kids are stepping out in 60 locations across the United Kingdom, according to organisers Youth Strike 4 Climate.
The mass walkout was condemned by some politicians and celebrated by others, but the kids sure seem to mean business.

Bryan Menegus,"Two drivers have filed a class-action lawsuit against their employer, Waitr Holdings, Inc., alleging the company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to meet minimum wage requirements. The suit also claims that some drivers had been misclassified as contractors while performing the work of employees.
The suit, which was submitted late last month to Louisianas Eastern District Court, claims Waitr did not reimburse its workers for mileage driven, a figure thats typically a little over 50 cents per mile. In total, they claim, this led to both plaintiffs being stiffed by around $260 per week. Waitrs systematic failure to adequately reimburse automobile expenses constitutes a kickback to Waitr such that the hourly wages they pay to Plaintiffs and the Putative Class Members was and continues to be below the minimum wage, the suit states.
In recent years, similar suits by contractors claiming theyd been asked to do the work of employees have been filed against other gig economy platforms such as Uber and Lyft, while food delivery services like DoorDash and Instacart have recently faced backlash for subsidizing wages with their workers own tips.
If the name Waitr doesnt ring a bell for those of you in New York or California, thats because it currently only operates in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. It scooped up similar upstart delivery service Bite Squad in Decemberwhich itself had acquired 18 other local delivery companieswhich covers much of the same territory, as well as Nevada, North Carolina, the Dakotas, Ohio, Virginia, Oklahoma, Hawaii, Washington, Iowa, Maryland, and Minnesota. Waitr also happens to be partially funded by football star Drew Brees and owned by Tilman J. Fertittabetter known as the owner of such disparate assets as the Houston Rockets and the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants.
Because this service operates outside the highly dense metro regions of the coasts, at least anecdotally, many drivers are putting considerable wear and tear on their vehicles. The gas reimbursement is a dollar an order but some orders are 5 to 10 miles away from the restaurant which can really cause problems when you have to fill up 4 to 5 times a pay period, one Bite Squad driver alleged on Glassdoor. Half of my pay ends up back in my gas tank.
Weve reached out to Waitr for comment and will update if we hear back. The lawsuit is embedded in full below:

Laura Vitto,"Cara Koscinski just wanted a nice dessert for her son's graduation party. What she received was a cake that she says prompted ""total embarrassment"" and multiple conversations about the alternative meaning of the Latin word ""cum."" In a Facebook post shared Sunday, Koscinski of South Carolina shared photos of a cake she'd ordered from her local Publix supermarket. Though the cake was meant to read, ""Congrats Jacob! Summa Cum Laude class of 2018,"" she was surprised to see the word ""Cum"" — Latin for ""with""; slang for... you know — replaced with dashes. SEE ALSO: All the times we watched awkward sex scenes with our parents ""How utterly ridiculous and I will be speaking to a manager for a refund,"" she wrote. ""Shame on you Publix for turning an innocent Latin phrase into a total embarrassment for having to explain to my son and others (including my 70 year old mother) about this joke of a cake."" Koscinski's post also shows a photo of the online order form where Publix determined her use of ""cum"" counted as ""profane"" language. Despite her efforts to explain the word in the special instructions section, it seems whoever iced the cake didn't get the message. Local station ABC 4 reports that the supermarket has since offered Koscinski a refund for the cake. Honestly, that sounds like the least it can do after forcing a poor woman to explain why ""cum"" might prompt censoring to her own mother.

Ron Miller,"Armory, a startup that has built a CI/CD platform on top the open source Spinnaker project, announced a $10 million Series A today led by Crosslink Capital. Other investors included Bain Capital Ventures, Javelin Venture Partners, YCombinator and Robin Vasan. Software development certainly has changed over the last several years, going from long cycles between updates to a continuous delivery model. The concept is actually called CI/CD or continuous integration/continuous delivery. Armory’s product is designed to eliminate some of the complexity associated with deploying this kind of solution. When they started the company, the founders made a decision to hitch their wagon to Spinnaker, a project that had the backing of industry heavyweights like Google and Netflix. “Spinnaker would become an emerging standard for enabling truly multi-cloud deployments at scale. Instead of re-creating the wheel and building another in-house continuous delivery platform, we made a big bet on having Spinnaker at the core of Armory’s Platform,” company CEO and co-founder Daniel R. Odio wrote in a blog post announcing the funding. The bet apparently paid off and the company’s version of Spinnaker is widely deployed enterprise solution (at least according to them). The startup’s ultimate goal is to help Fortune 2000 companies deploy software much faster — and accessing and understanding CI/CD is a big part of that. As every company out there becomes a software company, they find themselves outside their comfort zones. While Google and Netflix and other hyper-scale organizations have learned to deploy software at startling speed using state of the art methodologies, it’s not so easy for most companies with much smaller engineering teams to pull off. That’s where a company like Armory could come into play. It takes this open source project and it packages it in such a way that it simplifies (to an extent) the complex world that these larger companies operate in on a regular basis, putting Spinnaker and CI/CD concepts in reach of organizations whose core competency might not involve sophisticated software deployment. All of this relates to multi-cloud and cloud-native approaches to software development, which lets you manage your applications and infrastructure wherever they live across any cloud vendor or even on-prem in consistent way. Being able to manage continuous deployment is part of that. Armory launched in 2016 and is based in the Bay area. It has raised a total of $14 million with a $4 million seed round coming last year. They were also a member of the Y Combinator Winter 2017 class and count Y Combinator as an investor in this round.","Armory, a startup that has built a CI/CD platform on top the open source Spinnaker project, announced a $10 million Series A today led by Crosslink Capital.

Anthony Ha,"Propel, maker of the Fresh EBT app for managing food stamps and other benefits, announced today that it has raised $12.8 million in Series A funding. Fresh EBT (the EBT stands for the Electronics Transfer Benefit card, which is how food stamp participants receive their benefits) allows users to check their food stamp/SNAP balance and find stores that accept food stamps. Users can also track their spending. The app is free for consumers and government agencies the company makes money through digital coupons and a job board. Propel says Fresh EBT is now used by more than 1.5 million Americans each month, and that more than 30,000 people have applied for jobs this year that they discovered through the app. For example, the announcement quotes one user, Tracy B. from Fairland, Virginia she described Fresh EBT as her “personal financial adviser,” and also said she used it to find discount zoo tickets, and even her current job. When Propel raised its $4 million seed round last year, founder and CEO Jimmy Chen described his mission as building “a more user-friendly safety net.” He argued that there’s no conflict between Propel’s social mission and its structure as a for-profit business, a position he reiterated in today’s announcement. “Our investors are world-class experts in their respective fields,” he said. “They share an understanding of the challenges of low-income Americans and a belief that Propel can build a massive business by fighting poverty.” Those investors include Nyca Partners, which led the round. Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Omidyar Network, Alexa von Tobel and Kevin Durant’s Thirty Five Ventures also participated. “Its not hard to see the huge opportunity in building better financial services for low-income people, said Nyca Managing Partner Hans Morris in a statement.

Devin Coldewey,"Google has inducted a new class of startups into the Launchpad Studio accelerator it inaugurated last year ; the first group was focused on gleaning new insights from medical data, and this one is about shaking up established financial markets and systems. Some of the companies are well-known, established businesses — but this isn’t the usual type of accelerator that aims to take a fledgling business and bring it to market. Instead, Google supports the selected companies in the development of a project, generally involving applying machine learning to the space they operate in. They call Studio a “product acceleration program.” (There are regular accelerators under the Launchpad brand as well.) This year the companies are all more or less in the financial space, offering banking, identity verification, and retail services in locales around the world. Here’s the list, with Google’s descriptions of each: Alchemy (USA), bridging blockchain and the real world Axinan (Singapore), providing smart insurance for the digital economy Aye Finance (India), transforming financing in India Celo (USA), increasing financial inclusion through a mobile-first cryptocurrency Frontier Car Group (Germany), investing in the transformation of used-car marketplaces Go-Jek (Indonesia), improving the welfare and livelihoods of informal sectors GuiaBolso (Brazil), improving the financial lives of Brazilians Inclusive (Ghana), verifying identities across Africa m.Paani (India), (em)powering local retailers and the next billion users in India Robinhood (USA), democratizing access to financial market Starling Bank (UK), improving financial health with a 100% mobile-only bank As you can see it’s quite an international group. But different areas have different opportunities and talents. Inclusive, for instance, emerged in Africa from the difficulty there in finding and verifying identity documents. I talked with the company’s founder, Paul Damalie, earlier this year. It’s easy to imagine what interesting patterns or helpful knowledge might emerge from a careful analysis of millions of data points tied to demographics, locations, financial situations, and so on. Robinhood’s popular stock-trading platform is hardly in need of rescue by Google’s resident experts and mentors, but again the data it has access to is the interesting part. Why not collaborate with those experts to create new product ideas or studies? Google provides cloud computing resources, access to its stable of tame ML researchers, and continuing support after the 4-month period is over. Congrats to the startups selected for the program; we’ll keep our ears open for whatever products emerge from their work.","Google has inducted a new class of startups into the Launchpad Studio accelerator it inaugurated last year; the first group was focused on gleaning new insights from medical data, and this one is about shaking up established financial markets and systems.",2018-09-05T16:02:19Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Google’s Launchpad Studio accelerator welcomes a cohort of blockchain and finance startups,http://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/googles-launchpad-studio-accelerator-welcomes-a-cohort-of-blockchain-and-finance-startups/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-932459182-1.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,class-4,1

Aarian Marshall,"The Bay Area is blessed; the Bay Area is cursed. This is how Gabriel Metcalf, the director of the urban policy think tank San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association—aka SPUR—puts it, more or less. “We really have everything we need to successfully solve our problems,” he says. “What we’re missing is a kind of civic will to act at the necessary scale.” This month, SPUR embarks on a three-year project to create a regional strategy for the country’s richest area—and its most unequal. The strategy goes far beyond the standard 5, 10, or 20 years for such plans. SPUR is projecting all the way to 2070. And this month, the group released a report on “future scenarios”. They’re an attempt to answer: What happens if nothing in the Bay Area changes over the next half century? What happens if everything does? “It’s too easy to create a massive dystopian document, that the future is all going to be terrible,” says Allison Arieff, SPUR’s editorial director. “This is an effort, in earnest, to look for the positive.” It’s also an interesting way to get at the area’s main gifts and problems, most of which can be summed up in a few statistics. The region, which stretches from Sonoma County in the north, Contra Costa and Alameda Counties in the east, San Francisco in the west, and San Mateo County in the south, put out $748 billion in gross domestic product last year. Its economy is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the US. More than half of Bay Area residents have a bachelor’s degree or more. The median home resold for $712,000 at the beginning of this year, up 11 percent from the year previous. Just 4 percent of the region’s housing is subsidized. High fees and a tortuous permitting progress make it hard to build more. Thanks to increasing traffic congestion, commute times are now at record levels, while residents are taking far fewer public transit trips than they did 25 years ago. Projections show middle-wage jobs in the Bay Area will account for just 22 percent of the job growth in the area between 2010 and 2020—meaning the share of middle-wage jobs has declined compared to low- and high-wage ones. So you don’t need a stack of paper to know that fixing the place by 2070 comes down to the economy. That, plus housing, transportation, and land use. Oh, and the variables that local policy alone cannot control: climate change, natural disasters, whatever the heck is going on in Washington. It’s all very complicated, which is why SPUR’s scenarios make for a useful rubric. Of course, it’s pitched toward the organization’s own policy views: that increased economic prosperity can be created hand-in-hand with the tech community, and that building market-rate housing is one path out of the affordability crunch. Let’s start with what happens if nothing changes. SPUR calls this scenario “Gated Utopia”. Service jobs are automated, and the people who used to do this work have moved away. Schools are good because there’s only rich people here now. Public transit is OK, but only in the urban core, and most of the area’s wealthy residents rely on private transportation, like personal autonomous vehicles. The area is packed with random millionaires—former middle class folk who happened to buy homes when prices were low. Safe, but homogenous; successful, but only for some. “If the current trends continue, that’s where we end up,” says Metcalf. Scenario two: “Bunker Bay Area”, a place marked by economic decline and social exclusion, meaning people are bereft of opportunities because of their income or education level, or because of the color of their skin. The gradual concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is masked, for a time, by the area’s booming economy. But as homelessness becomes more and more common, money leaks out of the public safety net and away from job training programs. The gated community is the architectural signature, as the wealthy use their own resources to protect themselves. Low-income people rely on an informal economy to survive. Three: “Rust Belt West”, a place dominated by anti-business sentiment, economic decline, and social inclusion, meaning politicians and institutions work hard to support workers, the middle class, and the poor. Informal co-ops have taken over for municipal garbage collection and public transit, while hospitals and pharmacies lay mostly fallow. “As companies left, there were no business leaders to contest the policy choices, which over time became more and more extreme,” SPUR explains in its report. Finally, the best of all possible worlds: “A New Social Compact”, a place where the economy booms and social inclusion thrives. A single regional transportation agency—right now, there are eight in the Bay Area—has extended service into lower-density areas, while reconfiguring roads for walking and scooters. Immigration continues unabated. Smaller, infill homes bloom. The terms are meant to be a starting point for a longer process, one that won’t just be guided by SPUR’s own staff. “Planners are in the middle of this shift in how decisions are made. It’s less top-down, though not fully bottom-up,” says Arieff, referencing Robert Moses ’ highway building by near fiat as the “old model” of city decision making. “Organizations such as ours have to be wide open and receptive and inclusive of as many voices as possible.” She notes SPUR will hold three public listening sessions in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose, to get a sense for where many groups’ priorities lie. 2070 feels far away, but knowing what residents really want it to look like is the first step in getting there.

JAMES BARRON,"Mr. Elegudin said the agency was reviewing its maintenance practices. “The truth is, some of the elevators that were installed early on aren’t as reliable and don’t provide the diagnostics we need,” Mr. Elegudin said. “There is nothing worse than getting to a station and finding the elevator is not working.” He said it had happened to him. “You’re literally stuck in our system,” he said. The transit agency is facing three lawsuits about accessibility (the center that Ms. Amari works for is a plaintiff in one, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan; the others were filed in federal court). A spokesman for the agency said it did not comment on litigation. Separately, he noted that transit facilities built before the federal Americans With Disabilities Act took effect in the 1990s “are generally not required to be made accessible.” Joe Rappaport, the executive director of the Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled, an organization bringing one of the suits, said the transit agency needed to be required to live up to Mr. Byford’s promises. “Andy Byford’s successor or the successor after that may not have the same commitment,” he said. For now, the challenges persist. April Coughlin, a transit advocate and college professor who uses a wheelchair, anticipated problems on a recent afternoon when she took the R train to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn. Since early morning, the app on her cellphone had said the elevator at DeKalb Avenue was not working. It wasn’t when she arrived around 3:15 p.m. The sign promised it would be fixed by 5 p.m. (someone had crossed out 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.). But Ms. Coughlin was due at Long Island University to teach a class that began at 4:30 p.m. “How do I get to work?” she asked on the platform, deep underground with no way to get to the street. “The building is literally outside.”","Gabriela Amari, using a subway elevator, must take a circuitous route to work because the station she lives near is not accessible.

Emily Price,"About 4 months ago, the left Shift button on my MacBook randomly stopped working. I use my computer for work and couldn’t really afford to be without it, so now I’ve developed some right pinkie muscles I didn’t know I ever had, and trained myself to use the Shift button the right side of my keyboard instead. When the problem began, I thought the issue was due to something I must have done to my computer. I hadn’t spilled anything on it and had been pretty diligent about not eating and drinking next to it since the “beer incident of 2016” when I totaled my last MacBook 100% sober with an entire IPA. But clearly, I must have done something to make this key fail. If you bought a new MacBook or MacBook Pro in the past few years, you may have a case against… Read more Read Turns out, this one (shockingly) wasn’t my fault. Friday Apple acknowledged an issue with certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models where letters characters repeat unexpectedly, do not appear, or key(s) “feel ‘sticky’ or do not respond in a consistent manner.” You might have heard about the issue from this class action lawsuit. The best part: If you’re having one of those issues with your MacBook, and it’s one of the models they’ve confirmed the issue with, you can get it fixed for free. The eligible models include: ▪MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015) ▪MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016) ▪MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017) ▪MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) ▪MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016) ▪MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017) If you have one of those models and are having keyboard woes, you can get your keyboard fixed for free at an Apple Retail Store, Apple Authorized Service Provider, or you can mail your device into an Apple Repair Center. Before your keyboard gets fixed they’ll first confirm that the issue is due to a defect and not you’re pouring a beer all over your computer. If you do have to get it fixed, it’s going to be a multi-day affair, so you should back up your computer’s data beforehand (you should be doing that anyway) and be prepared to be sans computer for a few days. If you’re like me and you’ve already created a workaround, you also have four years from your original purchase date to get the fix done, so you can pick a time that’s convenient for you.

Harold C. Hutchison,"Russian Sailors man the rails as Russian navy missile-cruiser Varyag departs San Francisco Bay. US Coast Guard/Petty Officer 3rd Class Pamela J. Manns The Slava-class cruiser is a massive warship loaded with missiles. Though it is old, it is still considered a very capable and deadly ship. The Russian Navy will keep the ships for at least a decade. The Kirov-class nuclear-powered guided-missile cruisers often grab most of the attention when people look at the Russian Navy’s surface ships. That’s very understandable — these are powerful assets, packing powerful weapons, like the SS-N-19 Shipwreck surface-to-surface missile and the SA-N-6 Grumble surface-to-air missile. But Russia has other, almost-as-powerful cruisers that roam the seas. The Slava-class cruisers entered service in the 1980s, and they are no slouches, even though they’ve never had the cachet of the Kirovs. Today, Russia is focusing more on smaller ships with a big punch, back in the heyday of the Soviet Union, they were trying to reach the status of a blue-water navy. The Kuznetsov-class carriers — and a nuclear-powered follow-on called the Ulyanovsk — would need escorts capable of providing area air defense and to kill enemy ships. Wikimedia commons The Slava could do that. The Sixteenth Edition of the Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World notes that the Slava-class cruiser carried 16 SS-N-12 Sandbox surface-to-surface missiles and 64 SA-N-6 Grumble surface-to-air missiles. The ship also carried a pair of SA-N-4 missile launchers for point defense, a twin 130mm gun, six AK-630 30mm Gatling guns, two quintuple mounts of 21-inch torpedo tubes, and a Ka-27 Helix helicopter. Russia presently has three such ships in its arsenal. A fourth vessel sat around, waiting to be finished for roughly two decades before being scrapped. Two others were planned and slated to be equipped with improved surface-to-surface missiles, but were canceled after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Russian Navy will have these ships around for at least another decade, by which time they hope to have the Lider-class destroyer ready to enter service. Until then, the Slava-class cruisers give the Russian Navy a hefty punch. Learn more about these ships in the video below:","US Coast Guard/Petty Officer 3rd Class Pamela J.

Julie Muncy,"More than 400 videogames were released this year. Four. Hundred. With a firehose like that, it's all too easy to miss some of the gems that become available, so we pored through our played list to pull together our favorite under-the-radar titles. These weren't necessarily the most popular games released in 2017, nor are they the most accessible, but they're all worth trying out as the year closes out. They're singular, strange, and—to a one—special. Gorogoa Jason Roberts' game is difficult to explain. It's a puzzle game built out of interlocking image grids, moved around to reveal hidden pictures and open new areas. But it's also a game about revelations: opening up your field of perception to see realities previously unknown, to expand and redefine your frame for viewing the world, literally and figuratively. It is surprising, spiritual, and unlike anything you've ever played before. System: Microsoft Windows, iOS, Nintendo Switch Echo Echo is creepy, taking place in an infinitely recursive planet-sized palace filled with copies. Of you. And they get smarter as you go. When you shoot one, they learn how to shoot: break one's neck, and they'll creep up behind you and put in a chokehold. Echo is made by former developers of Io's Hitman series, and you can tell. It's one of the sharpest, most compelling stealth games to come out in ages. And the better you play, the tougher it gets. System: Windows PC, PlayStation 4 Observer A deeply flawed but fundamentally intriguing first-person exploration game, Observer is a shot of cyberpunk horror straight to your eyeballs. With some lazy but fun voice work by Rutger Hauer and a hallucinatory plot about jacking into dying people's brains, it nails a genre pastiche that only the game medium could accomplish. A lot of titles try to do surreal and creepy, but Observer does it a lot better than most. System: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Linux, MacOS Everything is Going to Be OK Natalie Lawhead's surprising opus about anxiety and imposter syndrome is part game anthology, part zine, and all screaming. Deliberately abrasive, Everything is Going to Be OK isn't going to be accessible or interesting to everyone. But all that noise is essential and beautiful if you're willing to wade through it. It creates a space for a heartfelt meditation on the pain of existence and the determination and hope that it takes to wade through it. System: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS Strafe A wild, shouting bullet aimed at the heart of every '90s PC gamer, Strafe is a procedurally generated, unrelenting gun labyrinth—perfect for the subset of gamers that miss Quake but wish it was harder and even more EXTREME. While it can be a bit much, its deftly directed '90s parody and the tight speed of its gunplay make it worth exploring... as long as that's your cup of frothing monster blood. System: Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 Pyre I'm not sure how much I like Pyre. Its writing has the same flaws as all of Supergiant's previous work ( Bastion, Transistor ): a little too vague, a little too disinterested in making the details of its world really flow together into something magical. But if you're willing to look past that, it's original and surprising, a game about a magic sports competition with the fate of the world in the balance. Its action is crisp and deep, its soundtrack is superb, and its art style is like nothing you've seen before. System: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Linux A Mortician's Tale It's hard to make you care about death in a videogame—a medium essentially built out of death—but Laundry Bear's click-based job simulator will make you wonder how you ever didn't. This game is a master class in using interactivity to build a mindspace and imbue it with meaning. As an ode to the death positivity movement, a character piece, and a rebuke to the slippery ease of gaming's death/resurrection cycle, A Mortician's Tale is a quiet triumph. You should play it right now. System: Windows, MacOS What Remains of Edith Finch What Remains of Edith Finch is a striking evolution of its exploratory genre. A complicated and creative spin on so-called walking sims—in which you wander around a haunted, lonely environment as it tells you a story—it manages, in its best moments, to share stories so beautiful and strange that they can't help but provoke a reaction. This is a sentimental game, for better or worse, and it's a beautiful one at that. System: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One","You're heading into a holiday break, right?

MIKE TIERNEY,"As for Meyer, himself, he departs with a somewhat complicated legacy, with great achievements on the field tarnished to a degree by things that occurred away from it.
He won three national titles one with Ohio State and two with the University of Florida and his winning percentage of .853 is unmatched among active coaches. Yet the school suspended him three games this season, concluding he mishandled the issue of an assistant coach accused of domestic abuse. And at his previous stop, in Florida, there were a considerable number of players involved in off-field misconduct.
So while there is no denying his genius as a coach, to his critics, at least, the reports that he would start his retirement by helping instruct a business class at Ohio State on leadership and character seemed like satire. In fact, he will be doing just that.
Meanwhile, against Washington on Tuesday, Meyers Buckeyes (13-1) corrected this seasons main deficiency yielding long gains on the ground. Coming into the game, Ohio State had allowed six rushing touchdowns of more than 75 yards, the most by any Football Bowl Subdivision defense since 2003.
The Huskies (10-4), however, scrounged out just 3.6 yards per carry, with their lengthiest running play covering 19 yards. They resorted to a tailback pass by Myles Gaskin in the fourth quarter to finally put a touchdown on the scoreboard.","The coach, who served a suspension earlier this season, had already announced his retirement, but he coached his team to a win over Washington in his final game.",2019-01-02T03:20:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Ohio State 28, Washington 23 | Rose Bowl: As His Parting Gift, Urban Meyer Gives Ohio State a Rose Bowl Victory",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/sports/urban-meyer-ohio-state-rose-bowl.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/sports/02rosebowl-web1/02rosebowl-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-4,1
Jonathan Shieber,"The 2018 Holiday shopping season was the biggest on record for e-commerce, with nearly $126 billion in online sales. But as e-commerce continues to expand, the demand for warehouse workers is growing faster than the labor supply and creating an increased need for automation.
Given its dominance in e-commerce and the massive scale of its business, theres no surprise that Amazon was one of the first companies to supplement their human workforce with robotics. Since the acquisition of Kiva in 2012, a growing army of robots performs an increasing variety of tasks at Amazon facilities. However, those tasks remain limited in their ability to displace their human counterparts entirely.
Today, robotics are more affordable to a broader array of companies, thanks to lower cost components, and advancements in technology have paved the way for the rise of the collaborative robot or cobot.
inVia Robotics warehouse robots
Cobots are more precise and increasingly flexible with advanced sensor technology, AI, Lidar/Radar, GPS, and connectivity. Machine learning has also made cobots more versatilenot just in their hardware, but in software that facilitates adaptation to a broad array of tasks. And because sensor-rich robots can adapt to a variety of new challenges on the fly, we see more use cases for real-world application.
Don’t expect a severe shift to collaborative robots — we are still in the early innings. The global industrial robot market, dominated by the Big 4 (Kuka, ABB, Fanuc, and Yaskawa) was valued at more than $15 billion in 2017, while the market for cobots reached only $287 million. However, the digital transformation of warehouses presents a tremendous market opportunity for new companies to create value.
We draw connections to the shift we saw from legacy software to SaaS, where traditional sales and business models switched to recurring revenue streams and cloud-based subscription services. By combining domain-specific go-to-market with robust software management platforms, the next generation of robotics companies has the opportunity to avoid long integrator-led sales cycles and become highly sticky over time, much like the early SaaS providers.
6 River Systems robots lead workers to items they need to get from a warehouse shelf.
Additionally, collaborative robotic technology allows robots to augment human labor, lowering the barriers to entry, while still providing clear payback arguments around efficiency. Like the shift to cloud software, best-in-class platforms are now available to the masses without significant upfront investment in infrastructure.
We believe that co-bots will unlock market verticals traditionally underserved by robotics, such as logistics, food, and security.  Companies that offer full-service solutions to these sectors provide attractive opportunities to build value. For example, 6 River Systems — whose cobots, known as Chucks, use cloud software to coordinate warehouse tasks and work side-by-side with human employees — are changing how we think about the human-robot dynamic.
Cobalt Robotics, in the security vertical, allows human security guards to remotely monitor offices, creating cost savings for the employer, and efficiencies for the security guard. And other companies like RightHand Robotics, inVia Robotics, Starship are poised to replace human labor in some commercial settings.
The rapid innovation in this industry promises to bring efficiency and growth to countless sectors in coming years.

Bryan Menegus,"Bitconnect is being sued yet again, according to a document filed today with the US District Court of Northern California. This lawsuit, to the best of our knowledge, is the sixth brought against the company since its abrupt closure in mid-January. On its face a crypto exchange and lending venture, Bitconnect was widely considered—even among the often pie eyed digital token enthusiast communities—to be a Ponzi scheme. Supposedly guaranteed returns at unusually high rates triggered alarm bells for some would be investors, and even drew strong skepticism from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. And yet, the suckers came running with cash in hand to fork over to Bitconnect’s anonymous founders. In early January North Carolina and Texas security divisions both sent out cease and desist orders less than a week apart, with the latter accusing Bitconnect of engaging in fraud outright. Shortly thereafter Bitconnect shut down operations after approximately a year in business, tanking the value of the proprietary digital token held by investors in their staking program. Filed by one Baltazar Avalos, this most recent class-action suit alleges, among other chargers, that Bitconnect and its principles engaged in breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment, among other untoward practices. Though we can’t be sure it’s the same individual, there was only one relevant post from someone using this name prior to this filing, left in the comments of a site called Consider The Consumer on February 4. All it said was “ How to file lawsuit against bitconnect? ” Guess he figured it out.

"mgokey@businessinsider.com (Malarie Gokey), Malarie Gokey","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Samsung/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Sometimes the storage that's built into a device just doesn't cut it — That's where microSD cards come in to expand your device's storage. Many Android smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G6, support microSD cards, as do all GoPro action cameras and some mobile gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch. Whether you need a microSD card for your smartphone, action camera, mobile-gaming console, or something else entirely, we've got the microSD card for you. Before we get into our top picks, here are all the terms and specifications you need to know to buy the right microSD card for your device. Card Type and capacity When it comes to the card type, the two main kinds you'll want to consider are SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity). The only real difference between the two is how much storage they offer. SDHC cards contain 4GB to 32GB, while SDXC cards typically pack 64GB to 2TB. Although most devices accept the SDXC standard for microSD cards with 32GB or more, some devices still only accept lower capacity SDHC microSD cards. Some mobile gaming consoles like the Nintendo 3DS only support SDHC cards for 32GB or less. Most phones support SDXC cards with 64GB or more. Be sure to check which format your device supports. Speed Class SD Association Speed class is where things get complicated. The chart from the SD Association on the right breaks it down visually, but we've explained below. SD cards for your average user come in four speed classes: 10, 6, 4, and 2. Class 2 cards are the slowest and class 10 cards are the fastest. The class number refers to write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s), so Class 2 = 2MB/s, Class 4 = 4MB/s, Class 6 = 6MB/s, and Class 10 = 10MB/s. It's generally a good idea to get a high-speed SD card, especially if you are filming high-resolution video. In that case, you'll want a class 10 microSD card with a UHS (Ultra High Speed) classification. UHS refers to the absolute top theoretical speed of each card. It's a good way to gauge burst shot speeds. UHS-I Cards have a maximum speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards have a maximum speed of 312 MB/s. Finally, there's the card's speed class rating of either U1 or U3 on the top high-end cards. The speed class rating tells you the minimum speed an SD card will write. In other words, your card will never write at a speed slower than its rating. U1 supports at least a 10MB/s write speed, and U3 cards offer at least a 30MB/s write speed. If you shoot in 4K a lot, you have to get a U3 SD card. All the microSD cards in this guide are U3 or U1. App performance class for smartphones and tablets The App Performance Class denotes which MicroSD cards are best for smartphones and tablets. An A1 rating means that the card can open apps and process apps quickly, because it can handle a random read input-output access per second (IOPS) of 1,500 and write IOPS of 500. A1 cards are new, and anyone who wants to use Google's ""Adoptable Storage"" feature, which formats your card as internal storage in an Android device, should look for the new rating. The right microSD card for your device Depending on what you're using your microSD card for, you'll want a different capacity. For smartphone users: A 16GB or 32GB SDHC microSD card is fine for most smartphone users, because you'll probably be using it to store photos, videos, and big mobile games. You shouldn't fill up a 32GB card too fast. If you like to shoot 4K video on your phone, then you have to buy an SDXC microSD card that has a U3 speed class rating and at least 64GB of storage. Many phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G6, support SDXC microSD cards with up to 256GB of storage. For the Nintendo Switch and 3DS: Thankfully, the Nintendo Switch accepts SDXC microSD cards with up to 2TB of storage onboard. Since games take up a ton of storage, we recommend you get a high-capacity card for your Switch. If you have a Nintendo 3DS, you cannot buy an SDXC card. The console only supports SDHC cards with 32GB or less storage. For GoPro users: If you need a microSD card for your GoPro, consult the company's list of recommended cards. The site says that GoPros require a minimum of Class 10, but U1 or U3 are better speed classifications. The HERO camera only supports a 32GB SDHC microSD card, but the HERO 3 Black Edition, HERO 3+, HERO+, and HERO+ LCD cameras support SDXC microSD cards with up to 64GB of capacity. Meanwhile, the HERO 4 and HERO Session cameras are compatible with SDXC microSD cards of up to 128GB. Avoid counterfeit cards by sticking with known brands and clicking on our links.

Ron Miller,"Building a GPU-fueled infrastructure service is not a simple matter for a startup to undertake, but that’s precisely what Paperspace has set out to do. Today, it took it to the next level when it announced Gradient, a service platform that eliminates the need to deploy servers for AI and machine learning projects. Like any serverless architecture, the servers don’t really go away, but the need to deploy them manually does. Gradient provides the means to simply deploy code and Paperspace will take care of all the allocation and management, removing a big piece of the complexity associated with building machine learning models. Dillon Erb, company co-founder and CEO, says that when they launched the company several years ago, GPUs were not as commonly available as a cloud service as they are today. They initially provided a way to launch GPU instances in virtual machines, something they still do, but they saw a problem around a lack of tooling. Erb explained that large companies tend to build their own tool sets, but most companies or teams for that matter, don’t have the resources to spend the time to build the underlying plumbing. “Just having raw compute is not sufficient. You need a software stack,” he said. They spent the last year building Gradient to provide that structure for developers to concentrate on building models and code and collaborating around a project, while leaving the management to Paperspace. It removes the need to have a DevOps team to manage the interactions between the team, the code and the underlying infrastructure. “Just give us code, a Docker container. You don’t have to schedule a VM because we do it for you. You never have to fire up a machine,” he said. Paperspace has been trying to solve hard problems around deploying GPUs in the cloud, since it graduated from the Y Combinator Winter 2015 class. It has raised over $11 million in funding since it launched in 2014 including a $4 million seed round in 2016.","Building a GPU-fueled infrastructure service is not a simple matter for a startup to undertake, but that’s precisely what Paperspace has set out to do.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / An employee pushes a trolley with a Vizio Inc. high-definition television (HDTV) at a Target Corp. store on Black Friday in Dallas, Texas, on Friday, Nov. 24, 2017. reader comments 4 In what is likely a first in the industry, Vizio is on the verge of agreeing to display a class-action lawsuit message through its previously sold ""Smart TV"" televisions as part of a legal settlement. This message is meant to alert customers who bought the TV that they will be party to the forthcoming settlement and likely will get a small amount of money. As Ars has reported previously, the manufacturer has been under scrutiny since a 2015 revelation that it was snooping on its customers. The tracking started in February 2014 on both new TVs and previously sold devices that didn't originally ship with ACR software installed. The software periodically appended IP addresses to the collected data and also made it possible for more detailed personal information—including age, sex, income, marital status, household size, education level, home ownership, and home values—to be associated. Eventually, the company agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a complaint brought by the Federal Trade Commission. However, this new settlement is related to an entirely separate lawsuit, one that was consolidated in federal court in Los Angeles. In a court filing submitted last Wednesday, lawyers for both sides asked the judge to push back approval of the preliminary settlement to October 3. ""The Parties are developing a class notice program with direct notification to the class through VIZIO Smart TV displays, which requires testing to make sure any TV notice can be properly displayed and functions as intended,"" they wrote. ""The additional time requested will allow the parties to confirm that the notice program proposed in the motion for preliminary approval is workable and satisfies applicable legal standards.""

George Dvorsky,"Just six weeks into the First World War, Australian submarine HMAS AE1 disappeared without a trace somewhere off the coast of New Guinea, marking the first time an allied sub had been lost in the conflict. Marine archaeologists have now discovered the historic wreck, ending a mystery that has endured for over a century. Australia, like other commonwealth countries, joined Great Britain in the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary on August 4, 1914. Six weeks later, on September 14, the HMAS AE1 was on patrol off the New Guinean island of East New Britain when it went missing, going down with 35 Australian, New Zealand, and British crewmen on board. No distress calls were issued, nor were there any witnesses to the scene. Its final resting place, and the cause of the sinking, have remained a mystery since that day. Since the sub went down, there have been no less than 13 private and government-funded hunts for the wreck. But as the Sydney Morning Herald reports, it seems the 13th time’s the charm. The missing submarine was discovered yesterday (December 20) by the Australian Navy and the Dutch-owned Fugro N.V. survey company near the Duke of York Islands. The 180-foot-long (55 meters) sub was found resting under nearly 1,000 feet (300 meters) of water. Incredibly, the latest search for the missing vessel started only last week. A combination of radio scans and up-close inspections by a submersible confirmed the identity of the wreck. “The boat and her crew, who’ve been on eternal patrol since 1914... have now been found,” said Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne in a statement. “I truly trust that this discovery will bring peace of mind to the descendants of the families of the crew who lost their lives on board and perhaps in time it may also enable us to discover what caused the submarine to sink,” adding that “It was... a significant tragedy felt by our nation and our allies.” The AE1, along with its sister sub the AE2, were two E-class submarines—the first of their kind for Britain and Australia. According to the Australian Navy, these subs could plunge to a depth of 100 feet (30.5 meters) and travel at maximum speed of 17 mph (28 km/h). In terms of weaponry, these E-class submarines were equipped with four 18-inch torpedo tubes, which were positioned on the ship’s front, rear, and broadsides. Along with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, the AE1 was part of an operation to capture German-occupied New Guinea. Commanded by Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander Thomas Besant, the sub participated in actions that eventually led to the capture of New Guinea. As Payne noted, the reason for the sinking is still unknown. It’s highly unlikely that the sub went down as a result of enemy action, as the nearest German vessel at the time was a survey ship. Also, because no oil, wreckage, or bodies were found, it was assumed the sub sank intact—an assumption that proved correct. Radio scans and images taken by a submersible show a remarkably well-preserved submarine. Speaking to The Australian, retired Rear Admiral Peter Briggs said the sinking likely happened as a result of a diving accident, saying, “The submarine appears to have struck the bottom with sufficient force to dislodge the fin from its footing, forcing it to hinge forward on its leading edge, impacting the casing.” The exact location of the AE1 is being kept secret to prevent any unwanted intrusions. Along with the government of Papua New Guinea, Australia is devising a plan to preserve the site and create a lasting, meaningful commemoration.

Yessenia Funes,"Working out at home is part of my routine. My roommate and I set up her old ass Windows laptop on a living room chair and play legendary fitness DVD Insanity once a week when were not too lazy. Intense fitness guru Shaun Thompson guides us through the brutal workout that includes planks, lunges, and suicides for an hour until were exhausted.
But as with all workout videos, Insanity lacks the motivation and instruction Id get at a class with a real-life trainer; its easy to slack off. New fitness system Mirror hopes to bring that personal touch to workouts at home by streaming boutique-quality classes onto a neatly mounted display. After working outand living withMirror for a few weeks, I can say this thing is a definite improvement to watching an early 2000s video on a precariously perched laptop. Whether its the futurist fitness hack I originally envisioned it to be, is an entirely different question.
Mirror
What is it
A combination mirror and display that streams fitness classes directly to your house
Price
$1,495 + $39 per month

Great classes and convenience. 
No Like
Streaming hiccups. Some of the best one-on-one features aren't enabled yet.
Launched in September, Mirror, as its name suggests, is a full-length reflective screen in which I can see myself. But really, the $1,495 gadget is a camouflaged 40-inch HD 1080p display pimped out with a camera and mic. With a tap on the iOS companion app, it flickers to life, and when I fire up a class, Im watching myself and my instructor on the mirror-screen, crisp as can besave for some finger smudges I had to wipe off with an included cleaning cloth. 
Mirror was designed for people like me who are low on time and feel triumphantly accomplished if they can squeeze in exercise three times a week. What if you could take that HIIT class on your own time? Founder and CEO Brynn Putnam, who has worked in fitness for more than a decade, said she was inspired to make the device when her gym time suddenly cratered after juggling the demands of motherhood.
Mirror is more than just streaming Buns of Steel. Yes, its in line with other on-demand class subscriptionsyou can do on your own time, like fitness app Asana Rebel which offers guided Yoga workouts for about $10 a month or the Freeletics app, which offers a personalized training regimen for as little as $4 a month.
With its pricey proprietary hardware, however, Mirror is cut from the same cloth as insurgent fitness startups like Peleton with its $4,000 treadmill, $2,245 bike, and $20 per month subscription. Mirror is remarkably similar to the Peloton concept except that where you can run on a treadmill and ride the bike without any classes, the actual physical Mirror is useless unless you pay $39 a month to access the classes. Buying the device requires a one-year commitment to the subscription.
Installation with the companys free white glove service took about 10 minutes, plus some extra time to clean up the mess my cat made out of plastic and boxes. You can choose to either mount the device or lean it against the wall. Since I rent, I opted for the latter. I ran into some problems getting an update for the device to install, which I was later informed was due to my slow wifi. (More on this later.)
Whats on the Mirror is entirely controlled via its iOS app (The company still hasnt set a date to roll one out for Android). You can launch one of nine types of exercise classes led by nine different instructors on-demand with options like barre, yoga, and more cardio-intensive boot camp and boxing classes.Some classes last an hour; others are just 15 minutes.
When you first launch the device, you answer some questions about any injuries or limitations (like pregnancy), so the system can offer you alternative exercises during the workout. This is very similar to the typical experience when you first walk into an IRL studio. 
Like any other class, you just follow the instructor. Mirror instructors demonstrate you what move youre going to do, and the app tells you beforehand if you need anything extra like a dumbbell or band. The Mirror itself informs you how long youve got until the next set of exercises comes up, and you can even skip ahead if youre in a rush.
If you prefer a more interactive experience, which is part of what attracted me to this pricey thing in the first place, theres the option to go with the live class schedule. I saw people from Seattle, New York, and Miami in my live boxing class. These classes are limited to certain times of the day and week, but they sometimes change. That way, if you cant make a live class one week, maybe you can the next. For the most part, however, instructors keep their schedules consistent.
During these classes, the trainers often encourage you to pick up your phones and take a selfie or send an emoji through the app, which is visible to everyone taking the class at the time. The app offers emoji like and , which appear on the Mirror when you click them. One instructor, Gerren, calls his class the 100 Team, which added a personal, welcoming touch to what could otherwise be an isolating experience. He started the class asking us to send the emoji to show support. It was a bit annoying to have to grab my phone constantly in the middle of a workout, but I enjoyed the interaction.
I tried yoga, boxing, cardio dance, and a simple stretch class. Every instructor has a unique personality and method, similar to what you get in real life. Also, the instructors are diverse: There are men and women of various races and ethnicities. Thats a big plus for me. I once attended a white-dominated class in which the white instructor felt the need to comment on the reggaeton music she chose by saying, Who knows what theyre saying! That was annoying. I experienced nothing of the like here. I think thats, in part, because were all anonymous users. Some users add photos, but you dont have to. You can keep your identity secret.
If you have an Apple Watch or Bluetooth heart rate monitor, you can connect it to the device. I own neither, but the Mirror includes one. The heart rate monitor is a key part of the experience. It lets instructors see how hard youre going and shout you out. The device itself will give you on-screen prompts like, Way to go! if your heart rate is past the target you pick when you set up the device. If youre slacking off, itll ask you to pick up the pace. The monitor allows you to keep track of your progress so you can, in essence, compete with yourself.
The screen also tells you how many calories youre burning, and thats what really matters to me. For those who arent using a monitor, the Mirror calculates the calories burned using an algorithm that looks at your weight, age, and max heart rateall of which youinput into your fitness profile.
I burned 934 calories in a week of my post-Thanksgiving, pre-Christmas Mirror workouts, which was a pleasant surprise because the workout felt easy at the time. However, by the end of my boxing lesson with Gerren, I was hurting. My arms were sore for a couple of days, and thats exactly what Id expect from a class.
Overall, the exercise experience is positive, and the interactive touches, as well as the ability to see the instructor and myself on the same surface, are useful enough that it doesnt just feel like I could replace this contraption with an Ikea mirror and an on-demand app streaming to my television. Im telling you, the Mirror is pretty freaking coolbut that doesnt make it perfect.
Youd imagine that the devices camera would allow the trainers to see you so they can offer specific advice on your form, but that option wont be available until Mirror launches its one-on-one training, starting at $40 a session,sometime this year. Right now, the camera and mic serve as, uh, decor? A cap is included with the product to cover the camera for those who are paranoid like me. But theres no knowing what the mic catches.
Honestly, it creeps me out, but Im also the type who covers my laptop webcam with tape. These days, its almost the expectation that were all going to possess a bunch of home devices with microphones that might accidentally switch on or be hacked to spy on us, but its worth it to be wary whenever youre introducing a new one. I cant shake a feeling of paranoia.
For her part, Putnam was clear that privacy is a priority, but beyond the camera cover and three-factor security, which requires proximity, the password, and pin to turn on the camera, she didnt elaborate on how else the company will protect user data.
Then, theres the cost. Depending on how much you use Mirror, and how much it reduces your other exercise expenditures, Mirror might not be a bad investment, assuming youre liquid enough to drop the money on it. This $39 monthly fee should cover the entire household; five additional people can access the app to use the Mirror. While the $1,495 is a hefty cost upfront, a decent treadmill can cost you close to $1,000. The even cooler ones quickly soar past $1,000, to say nothing of Pelotons $4,000 beast.
Consider that Mirrors monthly subscription costs less than my monthly $50 ClassPass membership. A years worth of classes will cost you $468 on the Mirror, and thats a lot cheaper than luxe gyms like Equinox. Even if it costs a little more than your routine including the hardware outlay (youll need to do your own math), I could seriously get used to getting a high-quality workout at home.
The one thing that frequently interfered with my workouts was the devices incessant buffering. The Mirror requires a wifi speed of 10 megabits per second, and that can be a problem if you have shitty wifi (like I do). My workouts would break up during live and even on-demand classes. Having your class spontaneously drop out is a little disorienting, but they bounced back pretty quickly. The company is currently working on incorporating streaming optimizations that are used by companies like Netflix to help satisfy those with whack wifi. Its also planning to offer users the option to download workouts directly to Mirror to skip the buffering altogether.
The Mirror is wonderful and delivers on a lot of what the company promises from the outset: high-quality exercise classes conveniently streaming on-demand to slick hardware in your house. And it even offers elements of interactivity that make it more fun and useful. But for something so pricey, it lacks the polish you would expect, and the fact that it hasnt enabled some of the one-on-one interactivity you get from a real studio class feels like a real miss, especially when you consider that the company is asking you to install yet another camera and microphone in your house with no tangible benefits.
Mirror will undeniably deliver a solid workout, and Ive no doubt the platform will improve with refinements in the future. But for now, the big brother workout I was expecting is still just thatthe future.

Adam Rosenberg,"There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news. Bungie dusted off and updated a fresh batch exotic gear from the first Destiny, and will be adding it all to the Destiny 2 loot pool with the release of the May 8 expansion. In all, there are seven returning exotics that we know of. SEE ALSO: 'Destiny 2' gets Warmind and a major update this week. Here's the deal. Because I'm a monster, I decided to rank them. It's mostly armor, so your own ranking is probably super different, and entirely dependent on which class you prefer to play. Personally, I think Warlocks are a trash character class with a trash jump, and you'll see that reflected here. All of which is to say: Please enjoy my 100 percent scientific, completely official, and impossible to argue ranking of Warmind 's returning Destiny exotics. (Note: This ranking assumes all of this returning gear works just like it did in the original Destiny. I might re-rank them after Warmind is out and all secrets are revealed. But this is really just for fun, folks. Don't have a cow.) 7. Suros Regime Image: bungie Look. Any serious Destiny fan knows that Suros is actually #1 here. It's the only weapon in this lineup, for one. But more than that: It's freaking Suros Regime. One of the best weapons in the original game. Not only can it heal you as it deals damage, the bottom half of its magazine also deals bonus damage. For some Destiny players, this is the only exotic they ever used. Suros gets the bottom-rung nod mostly because it's the only weapon here, and it's always fun to start these dumb lists with a curveball. Or hey, let's say it's because the gun is blue now. Sure. That works. Suros is blue and that's bad. 6. Claws of Ahamkara Image: bungie As we've already discussed, Warlocks are trash. They're better in Destiny 2, sure, but their jump still sucks. The Claws of Ahamkara are a Warlock exotic, so instant demerit there. They also come with a fairly useless ability, which is a real problem for a class of gear that's supposed to make you feel powerful. Equip the Claws and you can charge up to two melee attacks instead of the usual one. It's the height of meh. Let's also not overlook the physical makeup of this thing you've willingly chosen to equip. It's basically a bunch of golden feathers protruding from your wrist, with all of them held in place by what appears to be a snap-on leather BDSM restraint. It's... different! But it's not going to up your Destiny 2 game. Sorry Claws of Ahamkara, you lose. 5. Apotheosis Veil Image: bungie Oh hey, look at that. Another Warlock exotic. Woopity scoop. Apotheosis Veil is somehow less useful than Claws of Ahamkara. It's got an exotic perk fully heals you and recharges your melee/grenade attacks whenever you activate your super. That's... nice. You really shouldn't be popping your super when you're at low health, though. Not unless you're wearing Apotheosis Veil, I guess. But why would you? There are better options. Looks alone give this one the edge over Claws of Ahamkara. What the hell is going on in there? Can our Warlock friend breathe? Is there some kind of cool space gas in there that activates your so-so exotic perk? Apotheosis Veil gives good screenshot, but little more than that. 4. Sealed Ahamkara Grasps Image: bungie Visually, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are a step up from the Claws' BDSM feathers. Beyond that, I'm not entirely sure what's going on with these Hunter gauntlets. It's like someone polished and shaped a pile of fossils and glued it onto a sci-fi gauntlet. These rank higher than the Claws of Ahamkara largely because Sealed Ahamkara Grasps are not a Warlock exotic. The perk is also just provably better: You still get to charge up to two melee attacks, but you also have a chance of automatically reloading your weapon whenever you deal melee damage. It's almost as if Destiny itself is out to troll Warlocks. 3. Eternal Warrior Image: Bungie Eternal Warrior has one edge here over all the other exotics: It looks the coolest. It's a helmet that has its own face. What more do you need to know? It's also useful! Assuming it works the way its predecessor did, Titans get added damage resistance whenever their Fist of Havoc super is active. Eternal Warrior also makes Fist of Havoc last even longer. Most of all: It's not Warlock gear. Huge bonus for this (or any other) helmet. 2. Armamentarium Image: Bungie Armamentarium is what the Punisher would wear if he existed in the Destiny universe. Look at this thing. Those rows of bullets. The two breast grenades. A pair of Liefeld-ian pouches. This is an exotic for the Titan that is ready to go to war. It also happens to come with one of the most useful exotic perks in the game: Two grenades. It may not be as flashy as some of the others, but being able to store up as many as two grenade charges is never not useful in Destiny, especially for Titans, one of the most powerful grenade classes in the game. There are always things worth chucking grenades at in Destiny 2. 1. Fr0st-EE5 Image: bungie The Hunter is Destiny 2 's forgotten class, and that's a real shame for me, self-professed Hunter 4 Lyfe. But with the Fr0st-EE5 (pronounced ""frosteez"") coming back, that's all going to change. See all the tubes coming out of the boots in the image above? Those things charge up with power when you're sprinting around. That power then feeds into your abilities, speeding up your melee and grenade regeneration while you're running (you can also turn faster). Hey, you know what's terrible in Destiny 2 ? The recharge time on melee attacks and grenades. Bring on the Fr0st-EE5, baby. To lightly paraphrase what a wise Star Wars man once said: They may not look like much, but they've got it where it counts. You can buy Destiny 2 here.","There's a lot that's new in Warmind, the second major expansion for Destiny 2. But for longtime fans, one of the expansion's most exciting additions may be old news.

Dieter Bohn,"The screen steals the show The greatest Apple product comeback story of the past few years has, without a doubt, been the Apple Watch. Launched with great fanfare four years ago, the initial version tried to do way too much with way too little, and it had confusing software to boot. Worst of all, it was unclear what the original Apple Watch was even for. No single thing stood out. Then Apple did what Apple often does: iterated, refined, and fixed. But as much as there were software and hardware improvements to the Series 2 and Series 3, the most important refinements were to the Apple Watch’s purpose. It gained clarity. It was for fitness and notifications. Eventually, when it was ready, Apple added better connectivity. Now, with the Series 4, Apple is iterating again. And, importantly, it’s learned how to iterate the product’s hardware and its purpose at the same time. The Series 4 has finally achieved something like the original goal of the Apple Watch. It’s not quite a do-anything computer on your wrist, but it can be different things to different people now. With apologies to the new iPhones, the Apple Watch Series 4 was the most impressive thing Apple announced last week. After using it for the past week or so, I think it lives up to the hype. For the first time since the original Apple Watch, the hardware has been fully redesigned, with a new body and new sizes. But it’s not a major overhaul. These still look like the Apple Watches you’re used to: they have the same rounded-corner lozenge shape, the same glass that curves around to match the body, and the same digital crown and single-button layout. Before we get too far, we should talk pricing. This Watch is not especially cheap. The smallest, least expensive model comes with GPS and Wi-Fi and costs $399. But if you start piling on the upgrades, you can quickly jack up the price to something that feels exorbitant, especially if you’re upgrading from a Series 2 or Series 3. It’s $29 more for the larger size, $100 for LTE compatibility (plus $10 per month or so from your carrier), and the stainless steel models are $200 more (and only come with LTE). Add in Apple Care, and you can end up spending a lot — though it’s nothing like the wild “Edition” prices of yore. (Don’t even get me started on the Hermès model.) The larger sizes don’t feel that much bigger than the older models The two new sizes are 40mm and 44mm, but they really don’t feel that much bigger on your wrist than the old sizes. I was using the 42mm Series 3 and the 44mm size is only subtly bigger, but it’s also subtly thinner. To me, it feels about the same, but I think the trade-off of size for thinness is worth it. I suspect the same will be true for people who prefer the smaller size, but my recommendation is to go to a store and try one on before buying. I’m really happy — and impressed — that Apple managed to make existing Watch bands fully compatible with the new sizes. Even my old third-party bands fit seamlessly into the new Watch body. Things look different when the screen turns on. The screen on the Series 4 is just incredibly good. Apple says it’s 30 percent bigger, which is one of those specs that’s easy to just sort of pass over when you read it. But 30 percent is a lot, and you absolutely notice it right away. It’s still OLED so the blacks are truly black and blend into the watchface glass. But if you pick a full-screen watchface, you’ll see that the screen also goes closer to the edges of the Watch than before, including the rounded corners. The overall effect makes the square display on my Series 3 look dumpy and cramped by comparison — even though, until last week, it was arguably the best smartwatch screen on the market. As John Gruber writes, “The Series 4 displays take up so much more of the face of the watches that the new 40mm watch’s display is larger than the display on the old 42mm models — the new small watch has a larger display than the old large watch.” Beyond the size and the screen, there are a few other subtle exterior differences to note about the hardware. The rear of the Watch is now ceramic instead of metal to allow for a better wireless signal. If you spring for the LTE model, the garish red dot on the digital crown has been replaced with a much more subtle red ring. The microphone has been moved between the two buttons so that it’s further away from the speaker to help reduce echo in calls. The speaker has been boosted to provide more volume. It really is way louder, and I haven’t heard any distortion during phone calls. Last year’s Apple Watch had some issues with LTE at launch, though Apple fixed it up fairly quickly. This year, I haven’t had any major problems with LTE. In fact, several people I called with the Watch simply didn’t believe I wasn’t on a phone. It sounds good, and the louder speaker means you can hear it without holding the thing next to your ear. But it does take the Watch a minute (sometimes two) to switch on LTE and get connected. That’s not radically worse than what happens when you pull your phone out of airplane mode, but on the Watch, it’s always a little less clear what’s happening and why when data is not coming in. On the inside, there’s a faster S4 processor, a W3 chip (which is just Apple’s W2 chip with Bluetooth 5.0 support), and an accelerometer and gyroscope that are able to take samples of your movements more often (which is how Apple was able to add the new fall detection feature). Apple’s also tied haptics to the digital crown, so when you spin it, you feel little ticks that precisely correlate to what’s happening on the screen. It’s completely unnecessary but pretty neat. Battery life has been stupendous Last but certainly not least: the battery size is about the same. Battery life on the Series 4 is as good or better than on the Series 3 Watch. Apple claims 18 hours of regular use or six hours of outdoor workouts. I haven’t done a six-hour outdoor workout (and I don’t plan to), but my testing shows the battery life far exceeds Apple’s own claims. I took the Watch off the charger on Saturday morning and wandered around Oakland for four hours while disconnected from my phone. I used LTE for maps, a couple calls, and GPS for tracking my outdoor walk “workout.” I was still at 50 percent at the end of that day, and I didn’t get below 20 percent by the end of my lazy Sunday (which also involved an hour or so of GPS tracking and some LTE data). The battery life is so good that I wish Apple gave me an option for an always-on ambient screen, maybe by turning off some radios. Alas, you still have to turn your wrist to see the time. watchOS 5 is kind of a grab bag of new features, which sounds dismissive, but I don’t mean it to be. It’s a good sign that watchOS is ready to be laden with features instead of rethought from the ground up, as it was in years past. There’s support for podcasts, Walkie Talkie mode, slightly improved (and grouped!) notifications, and a bunch of fitness and health options. But the thing people will probably pay the most attention to are the new watchfaces that are available on the Series 4 Watches. They’re designed to show off the new rounded-corner screen. Some are just sort of flashy animations, while others are chock-full of new complications in phantasmagoric colors. Of the new watchfaces, I am most fond of the animated ones. Apple says that the fire, water, and vapor animations were all created with practical effects. As in: literal fire, vapor, and water were filmed with high-speed cameras as they flowed on custom-welded rigs. They look great; the animations naturally flow right up to the rounded corners. The watchface that you’ll probably see the most in ads is called “infograph.” It takes the bigger screen of the Series 4 and fills it up with as many as eight complications. There’s a “modular” version as well that shows the digital time and six complications. Like many parts of watchOS 5, they use new, more rounded fonts, too. The infograph watchface is polarizing. I don’t like it at all, though I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a “ design crime.” There are just too many colors doing too many different kinds of work splashed all over the screen in a garish and show-offy way. Too many of Apple’s watchface options are like that. Call me boring, but I prefer a Watch look that’s a little more staid. It makes me a little sad that Apple still doesn’t allow third-party watchfaces. Even if you like the new watchfaces, you probably won’t like what happens when you try to select a new complication. There are now “old”- and “new”-style complications, which are completely different and incompatible. The newer watchfaces need the new complications, so third-party developers will have to update their apps (and so will Apple). You can’t add the Home app to the new watchfaces, only the old ones. The most annoying part is that there’s no way to know what complications are available on any given watchface without scrolling through and looking for the one you want. On the fitness front, the best new feature is automatic workout detection, which can tell if you’ve started or stopped a workout and ask you if that’s the case and if you want to log it. There are now options for yoga, hiking, setting a target pace, and tracking your pace. You can also see your cadence as you run and challenge somebody to a week-long exercise competition. (I didn’t extensively test these features; I’m still at the “fill your damn rings” stage of my exercise goals.) Maybe the most interesting change, though, is how Apple is more clearly separating out health features from the fitness stuff. There are a few new features in watchOS 5 and the Series 4 that are designed to help you detect health problems, not just encourage you to close those activity rings or run a marathon. That’s interesting because it more explicitly positions the Apple Watch as a device that can help detect health problems, making it something that people who can’t exercise that much might be more interested in. Apple, as always, is very careful to not cross the line into making actual health claims about its new features. It’s careful to say that the Watch can detect things like irregular heartbeats, not that it will. There’s a big difference between “tracking your fitness” and “monitoring your health” watchOS 5 is able to detect low heart rate now, in addition to high heart rate. Later this year, Apple will add detection for irregular rhythms and provide notifications for them. The big new feature on the Series 4 is that it can take an electrocardiogram (EKG) using electrodes built into the back of the Watch and the digital crown. It can then send a PDF of your results to your doctor. I wasn’t able to test that as it is coming later this year. Both irregular heartbeat detection and the EKG features have been granted “de novo” classification by the FDA, and that distinction is important, as Angela Chen explains : It’s important to understand that the FDA has “cleared” both apps, but that’s not the same as “approving” them. There are usually three ways to get the FDA involved in a new project, according to Jon Speer, co-founder of Greenlight Guru, a company that makes quality management software for medical device companies. The most advanced is FDA approval, which is done only for Class III products, or technologies that might have higher risk but also a higher benefit. (Think: implantable pacemakers.) Approval is the gold standard, and companies need to do a lot of testing to receive this designation. The Apple Watch is in Class II. For Class II and Class I, the FDA doesn’t give “approval,” it just gives clearance. Another new feature exclusive to the Series 4 is hard fall detection, thanks to a new 800Hz accelerometer and gyroscope that can that can measure up to 32 G-forces. The Watch should be able to tell if you’ve had a spill and ask if you’d like to call emergency services. If you don’t move for a full minute after falling, it can do that automatically and also send a message to your emergency contact. Apple is turning it on automatically for users who tell the Watch they’re over age 65, and it’s making it an option for younger users as well. I’ve tried to trigger it without hurting myself and I haven’t been able to, which I suppose is a point in the Watch’s favor. (My tests were far from scientific; I was just hurling myself at the couch.) Apple says that to build its fall detection algorithms, it used data from a study involving 2,500 participants over several years, and it also worked with assisted living facilities and movement disorder clinics. So throwing yourself into bed after a long day shouldn’t trigger it, but a fall from a ladder or tripping over a curb and flailing your arms as you hit the ground might. Again, Apple’s health claims are not that the Watch will detect these falls, but simply that it could. A lot of people were really excited about Walkie Talkie mode, but after testing it, I don’t think it’s especially compelling. Unlike those classic Nextel Push-to-Talk phones, Walkie Talkie mode on the Apple Watch is essentially just a FaceTime Audio call with a button you press to talk and little beeps and visual indicators to tell you if it’s your turn. When you send the first message, you have to wait for a connection to be made, and then it’s just tapping the screen and talking. The connection stays active until a few minutes after the last person finishes speaking. It’s neat, but it doesn’t feel as instant as a true PTT system. I also had connectivity problems with it, but that may have just been OS launch-day overloading. That said, it’s silly fun to push the big yellow button with your nose when it’s your turn to talk. I strongly recommended it. (If it becomes a thing, I want to make sure I get full credit for coining the term “nose calls.”) Siri on watchOS 5 is still Siri. There’s a new feature that lets you simply lift your wrist and start taking instead of pushing a button or saying “Hey Siri,” and it works really well. The Siri shortcuts you set up on your iPhone should also work from your Watch, too. Siri still feels super unreliable, though. Siri gets especially fussy when you have a spotty connection. Too often, when I wanted to ask a question, I’d be met with a “hang on…” message, followed by a “I’ll tap you when I’m ready” message, followed by an interminable wait during which I’d forget whatever it was I needed Siri for. One last little watchOS 5 thing I must mention: you can open links to webpages now, too, which is kind of fun. Articles you click on get put into readability mode, so you don’t have to worry too much about ads or bad layouts on your Watch. Hooray for the web! This year’s Apple Watch is incredibly good. If you use it just for notifications and step counting, it’s probably overkill, but it’s able to handle more advanced features better than any other smartwatch I’ve tested. Mapping, music, workouts, calls, texting, podcasts… most of the stuff I could imagine wanting from a smartwatch works better than ever before. The only real bummer is that I still don’t feel like I can trust Siri to do everything I’d like reliably, and that’s more of an intermittent hassle than a real killer. If you’re looking at this Watch with an eye toward the health features, I have to admit that they’re difficult to test: the new features could be very compelling to a lot of people. Passive monitoring for heart problems and falls could literally be lifesavers, but they aren’t all available yet, and we’d need to see third-party lab testing to really make a call there. The Apple Watch has earned its place as the best-selling watch For people who are looking to upgrade an existing Apple Watch, that’s a harder question to answer than usual. Spending four to six hundred bucks for a bigger screen is a luxury I wouldn’t casually recommend to anybody, even though the screen is wonderful. Many of watchOS 5’s best features will work fine on more recent Apple Watches, too. Yes, there are exclusive watchfaces on the Series 4, but that’s also a silly thing to drop so much money for. What I can tell you is this: the Apple Watch has earned its place as the best-selling watch. It’s at least an order of magnitude better than other smartwatches and fitness trackers. Nearly everything it is designed to do, it does very well. It’s not yet a general purpose computer for your wrist, but, thankfully, Apple isn’t aiming for that anymore. The Watch is for doing little bite-sized versions of phone things like texting and listening to music, it’s for fitness, and it’s for health monitoring. Now that Apple has figured out what the Apple Watch is for, the Series 4 just makes it better. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"In 2017, Google was accused of gender pay discrimination by the U.S. Department of Labor. Later that year, Google employees conducted their own informal salary review, finding that women were paid less than men. In January of last year, several women filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, alleging it underpays women. Which is why a New York Times story on Monday titled Google Moves to Address Wage Equity, and Finds Its Underpaying Many Men was surprising. And, ultimately, misleading.
The story concerned the findings of Googles 2018 pay equity analysis, which looked at 91 percent of employees. Compared to 2017, when Google spent $270,000 on 228 employees to correct systemic pay inequities, the company spent nearly $10 million on over 10,000 employees last year. In a blog post on Monday, the company attributed this bump, in part, to one specific job code: Level 4 Software Engineer, a particularly large category in the company. (A Google spokesperson couldnt specify exactly what percentage of workers the job code represents, but parent company Alphabet said it employed 98,771 people at the end of 2018.)
Within this job code, men were flagged for adjustments because they received less discretionary funds than women, the company said. To conclude from this that many men at Google are underpaid is an oversimplification. As Google mentioned in its blog post, an employees compensation is algorithmically-generated. From there, managers are able to increase an employees salary, bonus, and/or equity through discretionary funds. Among Level 4 Software Engineers, more women were given these additional funds than their male counterparts, so Google adjusted for men in this category.
This doesnt tell us whether men, women, or any other groups in any other job codes are paid less at Google, it just indicates that in this specific job code, which comprises a substantial (but unspecified) percentage of the company, the discrepancy in discretionary funds allotted to women was statistically significant enough for Google to adjust it in favor of men. We still dont know why women in this job code were receiving more of these additional funds, but there are plenty of reports indicating why that may be.
Our pay equity analysis ensures that compensation is fair for employees in the same job, at the same level, location and performance, Google wrote in its blog post. But we know thats only part of the story. Because leveling, performance ratings, and promotion impact pay, this year, we are undertaking a comprehensive review of these processes to make sure the outcomes are fair and equitable for all employees.
A Google spokesperson confirmed that they dont know yet why managers gave more discretionary funds to women in this job code, which is why the company is undergoing a more thorough review, to better understand how things like leveling might be connected to the discretionary funds. The class-action lawsuit filed by former Google employees in 2017 alleged that Google systematically pays women less than men performing similar jobs, while also keeping them in lower-paying and lower-level positions. The lawsuit also alleged that men are promoted more often than women who are just as qualified. 
Its possible that women in this job code should have been promoted to a higher level position. As we saw in the class-action lawsuit, this isnt a novel claim. And if that is the case, Google isnt achieving pay parity by subsequently giving bonuses to their male counterpartsthey are simply reverting to a pay gap that was being corrected through discretionary funds.
 We dont know the motivation behind the significant allocation of discretionary funds to women in this job code, but Google promises to conduct a more thorough review looking into it. We also dont know what kind of pay disparities, if any, Google found elsewhere in the company, though the company said that 49 percent of this years adjustment dollars corrected discrepancies in offers to new employees.
 What we do know is that conflating these adjustments for men with the conclusion that men across the company were underpaid is misguided, and without more transparency, its impossible to know for certain what inequalities exist in this workforceor any other.","In 2017, Google was accused of gender pay discrimination by the U.S. Department of Labor.

"Meghan Moravcik Walbert on Offspring, shared by Meghan Moravcik Walbert to Lifehacker","For parents of kids with birthdays close to the cut-off date for kindergarten registration, the debate can start almost as soon as theyre born: Should we red-shirt him? Will she be ready for kindergarten that soon? Red-shirting, which was originally coined as a term for college athletes who were kept from competing for a year to improve their skills and extend their eligibility, is now often used to describe the act of keeping a child from starting kindergarten for an extra year. Its most common with children who have summer birthdays or a birthday that falls very close to the school districts cut-off date. Whether it is truly at a childs advantage to be red-shirted is up for debate ; but now, a new study indicates that students born in August and who are among the youngest in their kindergarten classes are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Reporter Jenny Anderson writes for Quartz about the study, which was published this week by Harvard Medical School researchers. Heres how a childs birthday can shape their experience in school: Imagine you live in a school district with a Sept. 1 cutoff, meaning your child has to be five years old by Sept. 1 in order to start school. This means that a boy named Lucas, who turned five on Aug. 15, will enroll in the same class as Jack, who will turn six on Sept. 15. Jack has been alive almost 20% longer than little Lucas. Developmentally, this is an eternity. He will likely have better self-control and be better equipped to do the things required in school, like sitting still and listening for long periods of time. As children grow older, small differences in age equalize and dissipate over time, but behaviorally speaking, the difference between a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old could be quite pronounced, said study senior author Anupam Jena, an associate professor of Health Care Policy in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School. What is normal for a five-year-old stands out as immature for six-year-olds. The study found that, in districts with a Sept. 1 cutoff date, kids born in August were 34 percent more likely than their almost-a-year-older September peers to receive a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD symptoms can include hyperactivity, inattention, difficulty sitting still, lack of focus or an inability to follow directions. Personally speaking, my husband and I red-shirted our son. He has a late-September birthday and in our school district, the cut-off date is Oct. 1. The closer we got to the time when we had to make a decision, the clearer it was that he would not be readyeither academically or emotionallyto transition from two hours of preschool four days a week to full-day kindergarten a month before he even turned five years old. And his preschool teachers made it clear that they couldnt have agreed more. Luckily, we had the option (and the financial means) to enter him into a preschool program specifically for kids in this situation; it was five days a week and more academically rigorous than the regular 4-year-old program (but less so than kindergarten). And even now, with my son thriving in second grade, I cant imagine he would be thriving in third grade if wed enrolled him a year earlier. But having a choice at all is a luxury many parents dont have. Many parents cant afford another year of daycare or preschool. And one parent in our Offspring Facebook Group felt forced into registering her son for kindergarten in order to keep a variety of educational services in place for him. He was receiving preschool therapies through a school district program for some developmental delays (gross motor, fine motor, speech). Those therapies expire at age 5 with the assumption that your child then continues the therapies through the special school district, says Jennifer, whose son turned five two weeks before the school districts cut-off date of Aug. 1. If I had made him wait a year, his therapies would have stopped and I would have had to pay out of pocket for three therapists for a year and then have him re-evaluated for school district therapies, which they could have rejected. So sending him to school and having him grandfathered into the school district therapies was the only solution that really made sense. Because other parents chose to delay the start of kindergarten, her son ended up in a class with a wide range of ages, which made her wonder: Would he look as far behind if everyone just went when they were 5? Or is he so much more delayed because half of these kids were lucky enough to be able to wait? Other parents in the Facebook group say they haveor still areconsidering everything from a childs social and academic skills to how their physical size compares to kids their age. Some parents factor in their personal experiences of being among the oldest or youngest when they were in school. Or there are some, like Matt, who are choosing what could be considered a compromise: Our current plan is to enroll in kindergarten and see how things go, Matt says. Worst case, he repeats kindergarten a second year. Every kid is different, so each parent needs to make the best decision for their family.","For parents of kids with birthdays close to the cut-off date for kindergarten registration, the debate can start almost as soon as they’re born: Should we red-shirt him?

More about Ahmed…
In this tutorial, well use the latest versions of Bootstrap 4 and Angular 7 to build an Angular application and style the interface with Bootstrap. Well make use of some new BS4 features to display data.
In case youve already tried building a web application with Angular 7, its time to kick it up a notch. Lets see how we can integrate Bootstrap CSS styles and JavaScript files with an Angular project generated using the Angular CLI, and how to use form controls and classes to create beautiful forms and how to style HTML tables using Table styles.
For the Angular part, well be creating a simple client-side application for creating and listing contacts. Each contact has an ID, name, email, and description, and well be using a simple data service that stores the contacts in a TypeScript array. You can use an advanced in-memory API instead. (Check out A Complete Guide To Routing In Angular.)
Note: You can get the source code of this tutorial from this GitHub repository and see the live example over here.
Requirements
Before we start creating the demo application, lets see the requirements needed for this tutorial.
Basically, you will need the following:
Node.js and NPM installed (you can simply head on over to the official website and download the binaries for your system),
Familiarity with TypeScript,
Working experience of Angular,
Basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.
Web forms are such an important part of the web, but we design them poorly all the time. The brand-new Form Design Patterns book is our new practical guide for people who design, prototype and build all sorts of forms for digital services, products and websites. The eBook is free for Smashing Members.
Check the table of contents 
Installing Angular CLI
Lets start by installing the latest version of Angular CLI. In your terminal, run the following command:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
At the time writing, v7.0.3 of Angular CLI is installed. If you have the CLI already installed, you can make sure you have the latest version by using this command:
$ ng --version
Creating A Project
Once you have Angular CLI installed, lets use it to generate an Angular 7 project by running the following command:
$ ng new angular-bootstrap-demo
The CLI will then ask you:
Would you like to add Angular routing?
Press Y. Next, it will ask you:
Which stylesheet format would you like to use?
Choose CSS.
Adding Bootstrap
After creating the project, you need to install Bootstrap 4 and integrate it with your Angular project.
First, navigate inside your projects root folder:
$ cd angular-bootstrap-demo
Next, install Bootstrap 4 and jQuery from npm:
$ npm install --save bootstrap jquery
(In this case, bootstrap v4.2.1 and jquery v3.3.1 are installed.)
Finally, open the angular.json file and add the file paths of Bootstrap CSS and JS files as well as jQuery to the styles and scripts arrays under the build target:
""architect"": {
 ""build"": {
 [...], 
 ""styles"": [
 ""src/styles.css"", 
 ""node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css""
 ],
 ""scripts"": [
 ""node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"",
 ""node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js""
 ]
 },
Check out how to add Bootstrap to an Angular 6 project for options on how to integrate Bootstrap with Angular.
Adding A Data Service
After creating a project and adding Bootstrap 4, well create an Angular service that will be used to provide some demo data to display in our application.
In your terminal, run the following command to generate a service:
$ ng generate service data
This will create two src/app/data.service.spec.ts and src/app/data.service.ts files.
Open src/app/data.service.ts and replace its contents with the following:
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({
 providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
contacts = [
 {id: 1, name: ""Contact 001"", description: ""Contact 001 des"", email: ""c001@email.com""},
 {id: 2, name: ""Contact 002"", description: ""Contact 002 des"", email: ""c002@email.com""},
 {id: 3, name: ""Contact 003"", description: ""Contact 003 des"", email: ""c003@email.com""},
 {id: 4, name: ""Contact 004"", description: ""Contact 004 des"", email: ""c004@email.com""}
 ];
constructor() { }
public getContacts():Array&lt;{id, name, description, email}&gt;{
 return this.contacts;
 }
 public createContact(contact: {id, name, description, email}){
 this.contacts.push(contact);
 }
}
We add a contacts array with some demo contacts, a getContacts() method which returns the contacts and a createContact() which append a new contact to the contacts array.
Adding Components
After creating the data service, next we need to create some components for our application. In your terminal, run:
$ ng generate component home
$ ng generate component contact-create
$ ng generate component contact-list
Next, well add these components to the routing module to enable navigation in our application. Open the src/app/app-routing.module.ts file and replace its contents with the following:
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { ContactListComponent } from './contact-list/contact-list.component';
import { ContactCreateComponent } from './contact-create/contact-create.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
const routes: Routes = [
 {path: """", pathMatch: ""full"",redirectTo: ""home""},
 {path: ""home"", component: HomeComponent},
 {path: ""contact-create"", component: ContactCreateComponent},
 {path: ""contact-list"", component: ContactListComponent} 
];
@NgModule({
 imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
 exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
We use the redirectTo property of the routers path to redirect users to the home page when they visit our application.
Next, lets create the header and footer components:
$ ng generate component header
$ ng generate component footer
Open the src/app/header/header.component.html file and add the following code:
&lt;nav class=""navbar navbar-expand-md bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""navbar-brand"" href=""#""&gt;Angular Bootstrap Demo&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;button class=""navbar-toggler"" type=""button"" data-toggle=""collapse"" data-target=""#navbarCollapse"" aria-controls=""navbarCollapse""
 aria-expanded=""false"" aria-label=""Toggle navigation""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""navbar-toggler-icon""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;div class=""collapse navbar-collapse"" id=""navbarCollapse""&gt;
 &lt;ul class=""navbar-nav mr-auto""&gt;
&lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/home""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/contact-list""&gt;Contacts&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class=""nav-item""&gt;
 &lt;a class=""nav-link"" routerLink=""/contact-create""&gt;Create&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
A navigation bar will be created with Bootstrap 4, and well use the routerLink directive to link to different components.
Use the .navbar, .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} and .navbar-dark classes to create Bootstrap navigation bars. (For more information about nav bars, check out Bootstraps documentation on Navbar.
Next, open the src/app/header/header.component.css file and add:
.nav-item{
 padding:2px;
 margin-left: 7px;
}
Next, open the src/app/footer/footer.component.html file and add:
&lt;footer&gt;
 &lt;p class=""text-xs-center""&gt;© Copyright 2019. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
Open the src/app/footer/footer.component.css file and add:
footer {
 position: absolute;
 right: 0;
 bottom: 0;
 left: 0;
 padding: 1rem;
 text-align: center;
}
Next, open the src/app/app.component.html file and replace its contents with the following:
&lt;app-header&gt;&lt;/app-header&gt;
&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
&lt;app-footer&gt;&lt;/app-footer&gt;
Were creating an application shell by using the header and footer components which means that they will be present on every page of our application. The only part that will be changed is what will be inserted in the router outlet (check out The Application Shell on the Angular website for more information).
Adding A Bootstrap Jumbotron
According to the Bootstrap docs:
A Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.
Lets add a Jumbotron component to our home page. Open the src/app/home/home.component.html file and add:
&lt;div class=""jumbotron"" style=""background-color: #fff; height: calc(95vh);""&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;Angular Bootstrap Demo&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p class=""lead""&gt;
 This demo shows how to integrate Bootstrap 4 with Angular 7 
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a class=""btn btn-lg btn-primary"" href="""" role=""button""&gt;View tutorial&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The .jumbotron class is used to create a Bootstrap Jumbotron.
Adding A List Component: Using A Bootstrap Table
Now lets create a component-to-list data from the data service and use a Bootstrap 4 table to display tabular data.
First, open the src/app/contact-list/contact-list.component.ts file and inject the data service then call the getContacts() method to get data when the component is initialized:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../data.service';
@Component({
 selector: 'app-contact-list',
 templateUrl: './contact-list.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./contact-list.component.css']
})
export class ContactListComponent implements OnInit {
contacts;
 selectedContact;
constructor(public dataService: DataService) { }
ngOnInit() {
 this.contacts = this.dataService.getContacts(); 
 }
 public selectContact(contact){
 this.selectedContact = contact;
 }
}
We added two variables contactsand selectedContact which hold the set of contacts and the selected contact. And a selectContact() method which assigns the selected contact to the selectedContact variable.
Open the src/app/contact-list/contact-list.component.html file and add:
&lt;div class=""container"" style=""margin-top: 70px;""&gt;
 &lt;table class=""table table-hover""&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
 &lt;tbody&gt;
 &lt;tr *ngFor=""let contact of contacts""&gt;
&lt;td&gt;{{ contact.id }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; {{ contact.name }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt; {{ contact.email }}&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;
 &lt;button class=""btn btn-primary"" (click)=""selectContact(contact)""&gt; Show details&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/tbody&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card text-center"" *ngIf=""selectedContact""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card-header""&gt;
 # {{selectedContact.id}}
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class=""card-block""&gt;
 &lt;h4 class=""card-title""&gt;{{selectedContact.name}}&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;p class=""card-text""&gt;
 {{selectedContact.description}}
 &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
We simply loop through the contacts array and display each contact details and a button to select a contact. If the contact is selected, a Bootstrap 4 Card with more information will be displayed.
This is the definition of a Card from Bootstrap 4 docs:
A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. If youre familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
We use the .table and .table-hover classes to create Bootstrap-styled tables, the .card, .card-block, .card-title and .card-text classes to create cards. (For more information, check out Tables and Cards.)
Adding A Create Component: Using Bootstrap Form Controls And Classes
Lets now add a form to our contact-create component. First, we need to import the FormsModule in our main application module. Open the src/app/app.module.ts file, import FormsModule from @angular/forms, and add it to the imports array:
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
/* ... */
@NgModule({
 declarations: [
 /* ... */
 ],
 imports: [
 BrowserModule,
 AppRoutingModule,
 FormsModule
 ],
 providers: [],
 bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
Next, open the src/app/contact-create/contact-create.component.ts file and replace its contents with the following:
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DataService } from '../data.service';
@Component({
 selector: 'app-contact-create',
 templateUrl: './contact-create.component.html',
 styleUrls: ['./contact-create.component.css']
})
export class ContactCreateComponent implements OnInit {
contact : {id, name, description, email} = {id: null, name: """", description: """", email: """"};
constructor(public dataService: DataService) { }
ngOnInit() {
 }
createContact(){
 console.log(this.contact);
 this.dataService.createContact(this.contact);
 this.contact = {id: null, name: """", description: """", email: """"};
}
}
Next, open the src/app/contact-create/contact-create.component.html file and add the following code:
&lt;div class=""container"" style=""margin-top: 70px;""&gt;
&lt;div class=""row""&gt;
&lt;div class=""col-sm-8 offset-sm-2""&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;form&gt;
 &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;
 &lt;label for=""id""&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;
 &lt;input [(ngModel)]=""contact.id"" type=""text"" name=""id"" class=""form-control"" id=""id"" aria-describedby=""idHelp"" placeholder=""Enter ID""&gt;

We use the .form-group, .form-control classes to create a Bootstrap-styled form (check out Forms for more information).
We use the ngModel directive to bind the form fields to the components’ variable. For data binding to properly work, you need to give each form field a name.

Jackie Dunham,"Educators, parents, and politicians in Ontario are reacting to reports the provincial government plans to cut thousands of full-time teaching positions over the next four years.
According to a memo sent by Ontarios Ministry of Education to school board directors on Wednesday, 3,475 teaching positions will be phased out for an estimated saving of $851 million.
In the notice, the government outlines how many staff positions will be lost each year through attrition, such as when teachers retire, find a new job, or move.
In the 2019 to 2020 school year, the memo states that an estimated 1,558 jobs will be lost. The following year, there will be 619 more job losses. In the 2021 to 2022 school year, another 738 positions will be cut. Finally, in the 2022 to 2023 school year, the memo says another estimated 560 positions will disappear.
The news comes a day after students from more than 700 high schools across Ontario walked out of class to protest the Doug Ford governments planned changes to education, including increasing class sizes, mandating online classes, and overhauling autism programs.
Harvey Bischof, the president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation (OSSTF), said he suspects the cuts to teaching jobs will actually be higher than the estimates laid out in the memo.
He told CTV News Channel the number could be as high as 10,000, but they wont know for certain until the government releases documentation with a breakdown of the figures.
The governments talking about the loss of thousands of teaching positions in the province and that means significant increases in class sizes. That means much less ability to give students the individual attention that my members want to. It means that students will have far fewer options in terms of the courses they select, Bischof said.
Ontario NDP education critic Marit Stiles, too, said shes skeptical about the accuracy of the estimates in the memo.
I think that those numbers are, I would say conservative, from what were hearing from boards. Boards have not moved away from their estimates of what the impact of these cuts are going to mean, she said during a press conference on Friday.
Bischof called the estimated job losses a massive reduction for the education system.
Ive been in education for 29 years, he said. This is by far the most devastating single blow that a government has directed at the education system.
On Friday, Education Minister Lisa Thompson said in a statement that Ontario currently has a much lower student-to-teacher ratio than most of the country. She said teacher hiring has increased by more than 11 per cent in the past 15 years while enrollment has declined by almost one per cent.
Year over year teachers salaries and benefits have increased while students continue to fall behind in important subjects like math, she said.
Thompson said their attrition-based approach will restore balance and sustainability by not filling a total of 3,475 teacher vacancies after educators quit or retire.
Most importantly, our plan ensures that no teachers will be laid off, the statement read.
In response to the announcement, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) said it projects it will have approximately 216 fewer elementary teachers and approximately 800 fewer high school teachers.
The school board said the staffing reductions will cause significant and far-reaching challenges, particularly for high schools. The TDSB said fewer teachers will mean fewer course offerings for students, challenges with growing class sizes, negative impacts on students, and difficulty meeting class sizes agreed on in collective agreements.
In short, a reduction of 800 teachers represents an order of magnitude that is unprecedented, the TDSB said on its website.
The Ontario Families for Public Education, a popular Facebook group consisting of concerned parents, also expressed unease about the news.
As parents, our primary concern is that we will have 10,000 fewer educators in the building. That is devastating, the group wrote on Thursday.
Despite Thompsons earlier claim that there will be no involuntarily job losses, Bischof said that wont make a difference for affected students.
The concern there still is larger class sizes, fewer courses for students to select from, and so the impact on the student, whether a teacher has been laid off or retires, the impact on the student is the same, he said.
Bischof said some Ontario classes could balloon up to as many as 40 students with fewer educators on the payroll.
As for the impact on future teachers in the province, the OSSTF president said the changes mean there virtually wont be a new hire in secondary schools for years.
Were talking about five, six years out. There isnt going to be any new blood coming into the system, he said.","Reaction pours in following news of Ontario's plan to cut 3,475 teaching jobs CTV News Ontario students stage provincewide walkout to protest education changes CBC News Ontario to lose 3,475 full-time teachers over 4 years: ministry memo Global News Doug Ford…",2019-04-05T17:55:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ctvnews.ca'}","Reaction pours in following news of Ontario's plan to cut 3,475 teaching jobs - CTV News",https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/reaction-pours-in-following-news-of-ontario-s-plan-to-cut-3-475-teaching-jobs-1.4367781,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4365978.1554486837!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Ctvnews.ca,class-4,1

""Preferably without even a stopjust get off one plane and get back on the other. that way i dont even have to care about the time zones or do any clock adjustment,"" he told Ars. 
Yet another insane Singapore Airlines A380 suite. I think I agree with Lee on this one

This must be downstairs on a Lufthansa Airbus 380 because it's a 3-4-3 layout. 
On Valentine's Day, Airbus confirmed that production of the massive A380 airliner will come to an end, breaking some plane nerds' hearts. When it was unveiled to the world in 2005, Airbus touted its efficiency over twin-engined long-haul planes, but this mighty carbon-fiber double-decker never lived up to expectations. Not all airports could accommodate its physical size, and getting the self-loading cargo on and off could take a while.
Unlike the 747, it doesn't appear set to have a continued career carrying cargo, either. You'd expect the biggest passenger plane of the skies to make a pretty decent freighter. But there's no folding nose variant, so you can't take full advantage of its commodious interior to carry really big stuff. In 2021, the last A380 will depart final assembly in Toulouse, France. By then, more than 300 of these carbon composite skywhales should have been delivered, and so we expect they'll remain a regular sight at airports they already service.
The Airbus superjumbo never really captured the public's heart the way the 747 has, and there's no denying the decision to put the cockpit on the lower deck gives the plane a hydrocephalic appearance. But the complex curvature of the wing is a thing of beauty, and it's always wonderful to see something so large land so gracefully. (If you time your visit to the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy annex for the right time of day, you can watch them come in up on the observation deck.)
Flying long-distance in an A380 can be an opulent affair. Both Singapore Airlines and Emirates have private first class suites on board, and the flying barfirst seen on the original jumbo jethas made something of a comeback, too. The promo shots have a certain air of ""crew quarters on NCC-170D,"" although you'll see from the gallery(or on YouTube) that they're a little smaller than that. Further aft things are more spartan, and pick the upper deck because the 2-4-2 layout is less cramped than downstairs' 3-4-3.
I've only been fortunate enough to fly an A380 once (of late 747s appear to be the preferred type for Dulles to Heathrow). But that one trip made me fall for the big plastic bird. It was a quiet and smooth ride, and the bathrooms at the front of the upper deck were bigger than the bathrooms of some houses I've lived in. Here's to you, you majestic flying cruise liner.

"mgokey@businessinsider.com (Malarie Gokey), Malarie Gokey","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. SHutterstock/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Choosing the right SD card can be confusing. After lots of research, we found that the SanDisk Extreme Pro 32GB SDHC UHS-I Card is best for most people because it has fast read/write speeds, supports 4K video, and can handle extreme conditions. Unless you're an avid photographer, buying the right SD card can be mystifying. You have to take a variety of specifications into consideration when you buy an SD card: card type, speed, capacity, and more. We researched reviews across the web to find the best SD cards you can buy. We've broken down all the terms and specs so you know how to choose the right SD card for your needs. Whether you're an amateur who's learning, a pro who shoots in RAW all the time, or a videographer who films in 4K, we've got you covered. Card Type When it comes to the card type, the two main kinds you'll want to consider are SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) and SDXC (Secure Digital eXtended Capacity). The only real difference between the two is how much storage they offer. SDHC cards contain 4GB to 32GB, while SDXC cards typically range from 64GB to 2TB. Capacity Chances are, you'll want an SD card with more than 32GB of storage, so you'll be looking at SDXC cards. A 32GB card is fine for casual photographers or people who prefer to have multiple smaller-capacity cards for security (if you lose your card, you don't lose everything). We typically recommend 64GB cards in this guide because you'll want that extra space for high-resolution photographs and video. Speed Class SD Association Speed class is where things get complicated. The chart from the SD Association on the right breaks it down visually, but we've explained below. SD cards for your average user come in four speed classes: 10, 6, 4, and 2. Class 2 cards are the slowest and class 10 cards are the fastest. The class number refers to write speeds in megabytes per second (MB/s), so Class 2 = 2MB/s, Class 4 = 4MB/s, Class 6 = 6MB/s, and Class 10 = 10MB/s. It's generally a good idea to get a high-speed SD card, especially if you are shooting in RAW or filming high-resolution video. In that case, you'll want a class 10 SD card with a UHS (Ultra High Speed) classification. UHS refers to the absolute top theoretical speed of each card. It's a good way to gauge burst shot speeds. UHS-I Cards have a maximum speed of 104 MB/s, while UHS-II cards have a maximum speed of 312 MB/s. The SD Association also has a new UHS-III standard that supports 360-degree, 3D, 4K, and 8K. Read and write speeds will theoretically be 624 MB/s for UHS-III cards — That's double what UHS-II cards are capable of. However, this type of card isn't yet widely available or able to function in current hardware, so it's just something to look forward to. There's the card's speed class rating of either U1 or U3 on the top high-end cards. The speed class rating tells you the minimum speed an SD card will write. In other words, your card will never write at a speed slower than its rating. U1 supports at least a 10MB/s write speed, and U3 cards offer at least a 30MB/s write speed. If you shoot in 4K a lot, you have to get a U3 SD card. All the SD cards in this guide are U3 or U1. Video Speed Class The SD Association also classifies cards by a video speed class standard, which currently ranges from V6 to V90. Check out the SD Association's chart below to see what each of the classifications means in terms of what kind of video you can shoot. SD Association The Association also has a helpful video explainer on YouTube. Our top pick carries the V30 video speed class badge, which is great for shooting 4K video. You'll want to check to be sure your camera supports those speeds. Otherwise, you won't get the full effect of the card. Avoid counterfeit cards by sticking with known brands and clicking on our links. Updated on 04/17/2018 by Malarie Gokey: Added a section on the video class standard, changed our top pick to a newer SanDisk card, and updated prices.","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

"Darran Simon, CNN","(CNN)A Florida middle school student was arrested earlier this month, after he refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance, and allegedly became disruptive when he was kicked out of class.
News of the arrest has drawn criticism that the First Amendment rights of the student, who is black, were violated. ""This is outrageous. Students do not lose their First Amendment rights when they enter the schoolhouse gates,"" The ACLU of Florida wrote on a tweet. ""This is a prime example of the over-policing of Black students in school."" 
But the school district said Monday that the student ""was NOT arrested for refusing to participate in the pledge."" 
On February 4, the student at Lawton Chiles Middle Academy in Lakeland refused to take part in the Pledge of Allegiance, according to the Polk County School District and Lakeland police. 
A substitute teacher in charge of the class was unaware the district student code of conduct doesn't mandate students' participation, the district said. The teacher exchanged words with the student and called the school administration, according to the district. A school resource officer also responded. 
A school administrator and the officer asked the student to leave the class, but the 6th grader refused, Lakeland Police said. Lakeland Police said the student, who left the classroom, created another disturbance, and made threats as he was escorted to the office.
He was arrested for disrupting a school function and resisting an officer without violence and transported to the Juvenile Assessment Center, police said.
""We do not condone the substitute's behavior,"" the district said in a statement Monday. ""We respect our students' right to freedom of expression and we are committed to protecting that critical right while ensuring peaceful classrooms so all students can learn.""
The boy's mother told CNN affiliate Spectrum Bay News 9 she doesn't understand why the situation escalated. Talbot told the station her son is in gifted classes and had been bullied at the school in the past. She has not returned calls from CNN. 
""I'm upset, I'm angry. I'm hurt,"" Dhakira Talbot told the station. ""More so for my son. My son has never been through anything like this. And I feel like they should've handled this differently.""
""If any disciplinary action should've been taken, it should've been with the school,"" she said.
She said her son, who the station said is 11 years old, ""shouldn't have been arrested."" 
In a statement to the school district after the incident obtained by Spectrum Bay News 9, the substitute teacher wrote that when she asked the student to stand for pledge, he ""answered that he won't because the flag of the country is racist. He then started to explain why the national anthem was offensive to black people.""
The dean of students who responded to the classroom asked the student to leave the classroom more than 20 times, Lakeland police said. 
The campus' school officer, who responded to the classroom, made the decision to arrest the student, school officials said. That officer was not called by the administration, the district said.
No one from the middle school asked for charges to be filed and for the student to be arrested, school officials said.
""This arrest was based on the student's choice to disrupt the classroom, make threats and resisting the officer's effort to leave the classroom,"" Lakeland police said. 
The substitute teacher who was involved in the incident was asked to leave the campus immediately, after giving a written statement, the district said. She will not longer be allowed to work district schools, according to the district.

Chaim Gartenberg,"As is practically tradition, HMD Global has come to Mobile World Congress with a new lineup of Nokia phones, and this years group includes budget devices with some clever new features.
That starts with the Nokia 4.2, a new class of phone for the company designed to slot in between the pricier Nokia 5 line and the cheaper Nokia 3. The 4.2 is meant to offer an affordable flagship experience, with premium features like a notched 5.71-inch display, glass front and back design, dual camera system, and a fingerprint sensor without breaking the $200 mark.
The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 439 processor, so its definitely not the fastest device around. Its rounded out by a 3,000 mAh battery and either 2GB RAM with 16GB of storage or 3GB RAM with 32GB of storage. 
But the most interesting part of the Nokia 4 is its buttons. Theres a dedicated Google Assistant button, which Nokia is loading with a few tricks: press it once to trigger the Assistant, twice to bring up Googles Visual Snapshot view, and press and hold to keep the mic open for a conversational, always listening mode like on a full smart speaker. 
Theres also a breathing notification light integrated into the power button. If the device is face down, the light will gently glow when you have new notifications, which is a clever feature. The Nokia 4 will cost either $169 or $199 depending on the storage configuration, although Nokia isnt sure yet which configurations will come to the US when the phone launches in April. 
Nokia 3.2
Next is the Nokia 3.2, an updated version of the 3.1 thats getting the same dedicated Google Assistant and glowing power buttons, a larger 6.26-inch notched display, and a beefy 4,000 mAh battery. 
The 3.2 has the same Snapdragon 439 processor and 2GB RAM / 16GB storage and 3GB RAM / 32GB storage options as the 4.2. But the 3.2 does lack a few of the 4.2s nicer features, like the glass back (its plastic, instead) and the fingerprint sensor. It is a bit cheaper though, set to cost $169 and $139, depending on the storage/RAM option. Like the Nokia 4.2, the Nokia 3.2 will also launch in April. 
Nokia 1
HMD is also announcing the $99 Nokia 1 Plus, which is meant to improve upon last years Nokia 1 as a sort of entry-level smartphone for folks looking to upgrade from a feature phone for the first time. 
It features a 5.45-inch 18:9 display, removable back cover with replaceable battery, and is thinner than last years model. Crucially, itll also run Android 9 Pie Go, instead of the larger Android 9 Pie, and will be available in early March.
Nokia 210
Lastly, theres the Nokia 210, a proper, classic Nokia feature phone. As you might expect, the specs here are nothing to be amazed by: a 2.4-inch QVGA display and 16MB of memory. But, it also does have Snake, physical keys, a removable 1,020mAh battery, an FM radio, and even an app store (for apps designed for Nokias proprietary, Java-based feature phone OS). Itll cost $35 when it comes out later this year.","As is practically tradition, HMD Global is at MWC 2019 with a new lineup of its Nokia phones, spanning the range from budget Android options to featurephones that are designed to offer new options along the company’s entire range.",2019-02-24T15:30:00Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Nokia bets big on buttons with its new budget phones,https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/2/24/18236618/nokia-4-3-1-plus-210-buttons-google-assistant-mwc-2019,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XkHBj4MrmrUtyaSdIig3Rm0viJI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14130573/bfarsace_190210_3229_0029.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,class-4,1
"Veronica Stracqualursi and Gregory Wallace, CNN","Washington (CNN) Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said Tuesday that he has no recollection of stinging remarks he made back in 2016 when he argued that Donald Trump would use executive power ""in a way that is truly unconstitutional"" and would be ""more abusive"" to the Constitution than President Barack Obama. ""I believe that Donald Trump in the White House will be more abusive to the Constitution than Barack Obama and that's saying a lot,"" Pruitt said during a February 4, 2016, interview on Tulsa radio station KFAQ. His remarks were first uncovered by the watchdog group Documented. When asked during the 2016 interview if he was a Trump supporter, Pruitt answered no. At the time, Pruitt was serving as Oklahoma attorney general and ""National Chairman of Federal-State Relations"" for Republican candidate Jeb Bush's campaign before Bush dropped out later that month. ""If Donald Trump is the nominee and eventually the President, he would take, I think, unapologetic steps to use executive power to confront Congress in a way that is truly unconstitutional,"" said Pruitt, who was tapped by Trump to lead the EPA in December 2016. Pruitt's remark came up during a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works hearing Tuesday. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, read Pruitt's remarks and asked him, ""Do you recall saying that?"" ""I don't, senator,"" Pruitt said. ""I don't echo that today at all."" After the hearing ended, Pruitt further walked back his statement. ""After meeting him, and now having the honor of working for him, it is abundantly clear that President Trump is the most consequential leader of our time,"" he said in a statement released by the EPA.

Brian Stelter,"An investment group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, has moved into exclusive negotiations about a bid for the company's assets, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. A deal could now be days away, the person said. The Weinstein Co. has been seeking a buyer for several months. The movie and TV studio was severely hurt by the sexual harassment and assault scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein. In fact, the stain was so damaging that the company likely won't carry the name Weinstein at all in the future. Representatives for Contreras-Sweet and The Weinstein Co. declined to comment on Tuesday. Deadline, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported that exclusive negotiations are underway. The person with knowledge of the talks said the plan calls for Contreras-Sweet's group to acquire the studio's employees, projects and assets. The plan will avert a bankruptcy auction, which was thought to be a likely outcome. Related: Six women sue Harvey Weinstein and his company in class action lawsuit But the investor group will not be buying The Weinstein Co. per se -- because they'll be forming a new company with a new name. Erasing the stain, so to speak. Last fall Contreras-Sweet was reportedly interested in having a ""women-led board"" take control of The Weinstein Co. Her proposal letter to the company sparked both internal and external interest. Before running the SBA during the Obama administration, Contreras-Sweet was the founder of ProAmerica Bank. The Weinstein Co. has operated in a state of limbo ever since the scandal involving Harvey Weinstein erupted last October. Projects have been frozen and partners have backed away from the studio. So a sale would provide some much-appreciated guidance to staffers about the future of the company.

Wirecutter,"Street price: $140; deal price: $110 w/ code EMCEPEE77 This is a nice opportunity to save on a larger-capacity version of a recommended external hard drive when you use code EMCEPEE77 in cart. This 6 TB drive offers 150% of the storage of the WD My Book 4 TB, the top pick in our guide to the best external desktop hard drive. At $110, this is the lowest price we've seen for this capacity and is likely to be a short-lived drop as these code deals tend not to stick around. As with all Newegg purchases, we recommend using a 3rd party payment service. The WD My Book (6 TB) is a larger storage version our top pick in our guide to the best external desktop hard drive. Of our lower-capacity top pick, Justin Krajeski wrote, ""Western Digital's 4 TB My Book is the best desktop hard drive for most people because it's reliable and it offers the best balance of speed and price. It was about as fast as the competition in all of our tests, it's the least expensive drive we tested at this writing, and it has a longer warranty (three years) than the other contenders."" Krajeski continues, ""Although no hard drive is immune from failure, the WD My Book has proven reliable. We found just 21 reported failures out of 358 Amazon reviews of the 4 TB model, or 6 percent. Backblaze's 2017 report notes that WD's 4 TB drives had a low, 2.2 percent annualized failure rate. Neither of these research methods is a perfect indicator of the My Book's reliability, but they are the best we have."" Street price: $90; deal price: $73 If you're a PS4 gamer seeking a wireless option, this is a great drop on this recommended headset. Listed at $100, we've been seeing regular sale pricing at $80, but this drop sees the price fall $7 more to $73, the lowest we've seen. Whether you're looking to add this headset to your PSVR setup or just want to game entirely sans wires, this is a great chance to save. The PlayStation Gold Wireless Headset is our pick for a wireless headset option in our guide to the best PS4 headset. Dennis Burger wrote, ""If you absolutely hate wires, even just a short one running from your headset to the controller in your hands, or if you're looking for a tweakable, customizable personal audio experience for your PS4, there's a lot to love about Sony's updated PlayStation Gold Wireless Headset. This much-improved version of the original Gold Wireless boasts better durability, better performance, and superior styling compared with the original Gold. The truth is that you could buy a better-sounding, more comfortable wireless headset for $50 more, but you'd be giving up what we consider to be very worthwhile features—namely, Sony's own proprietary virtual surround sound processing, as well as an app that allows you to tune the headset's sound."" Street price: $26; deal price: $21 w/ code TYWIRE20 If you've been looking for a wall outlet with an included USB-C as well as a USB-A port (both capable of charging a phone or tablet at top speeds simultaneously), this is a great opportunity to save on a recommended option. Use code TYWIRE20 in cart to drop the price of this outlet from $26 to $21, the first discount we've seen for this item. The Topgreener TU21558AC is the new top pick in our guide to the best USB wall outlet. Mark Smirniotis wrote, ""If you don't want to hunt for wall chargers, or if you're sick of them clogging up AC outlets all over your home, the Topgreener TU21558AC offers the best way to add permanent USB charging ports to a new or existing wall outlet. Without sacrificing AC outlets, this Topgreener model is the only outlet in our test group that can charge a USB-A device and a USB-C device at full speed without sacrificing even a small amount of power on either port. Plus, it's UL listed and code compliant to replace outlets in almost every room."" Street price: $400; deal price: $300 Down to $300, this is a great price on the white color of this recommended Chromecast-enabled speaker pick. This versatile speaker is also Bluetooth and AirPlay capable, giving you a variety of connectivity choices. If you're interested in some of the biggest sound you can get out of a Chromecast speaker, this is a nice opportunity to get this option at a discount. The black color is also available for $300 from an Amazon fulfilled seller, but the white is sold by Riva itself. The Riva Festival is the upgrade pick in our guide to the best Chromecast speaker. Brent Butterworth wrote, ""The Riva Festival sounds better than any Chromecast speaker we tested, but it's in an entirely different class of product than our other two picks. As of this writing, it was priced more than three times as high as the JBL Playlist, our top pick. But it's not fair to compare the two, any more than it's fair to compare a luxury sedan with an econobox. It's more than five times as heavy and more than three times as large as the Playlist. That said, if you want the best sound from a Chromecast speaker under $500, this is the one to get. It has six active and four passive speaker drivers, compared with the Playlist's two active and one passive drivers, and its amplifier section has nearly seven times the rated power.""

1. Pinterest sets IPO range at $15-17, valuing it at $10.6B vs previous valuation of $12.3B
Social media platform Pinterest filed an updated S-1, where it set the price range at $15-17 per share, which would value the company between $10 billion and $11.3 billion.
That’s a tough (or, you might argue, conservative) picture, valuing the company at around $2 billion less than its valuation as a private startup when it last raised funding in 2017.
2. To stop copycats, Snapchat shares itself
Evan Spiegel has finally found a way to fight back against Mark Zuckerbergs army of clones. His plan is to let other apps embed the best parts of Snapchat, rather than building their own half-rate copies.
3. Grab plans to raise $2B more this year to fund an acquisition spree in Southeast Asia
Fresh from closing a near-$1.5 billion raise from SoftBanks Vision Fund as part of a huge, multi-billion Series H deal, Grab said today that it plans to extend the round to $6.5 billion to amp up its battle with Go-Jek.

Spotify is going after podcasts in a major way in 2019.

3. Instacart faces class-action lawsuit regarding wages and tips
The suit alleges Instacart intentionally and maliciously misappropriated gratuities in order to pay plaintiffs wages even though Instacart maintained that 100 percent of customer tips went directly to shoppers. Based on this representation, Instacart knew customers would believe their tips were being given to shoppers in addition to wages, not to supplement wages entirely.
4. Angela Ahrendts is leaving Apple
Ahrendts joining Apple in 2014 was massive news, with her having served as the CEO of the luxury fashion brand Burberry from 2006 to 2014. She led the charge to reimagine Apples retail stores, shifting them to what she hoped felt more like a modern-day town square.

Emma Comeau,"When you hit the ground running at Disrupt San Francisco 2019 and you will be sure to save time for a Q&amp;A session. Youre going to hear a bevy of world-class speakers discussing a range of thought-provoking topics on the Main Stage. A Q&amp;A Session is the place where you can continue the discussion from the Main Stage or Extra Crunch Stage or even raise a new one.
We interrupt this message to remind you to buy your pass to Disrupt SF 2019 and enjoy significant super early-bird savings. We now return you to our regularly scheduled programming.
Whats the difference between Main Stage interviews and Q&amp;A Sessions? So glad you asked. Main Stage events occur in the largest auditorium and are live-streamed on TechCrunch.com around the world. Q&amp;A Sessions are specifically for Disrupt SF attendees to extend the conversation with speakers and take place in a smaller, more intimate space. A TechCrunch editor moderates a panel of experts, and they take questions submitted from the audience. Its the perfect time to take a deeper dive into a topic or to follow-up on an issue raised during a Main Stage or Extra Crunch Stage presentation.
Main Stage events are recorded, live-streamed and theyre also available later, on demand not the case with Q&amp;A Sessions. The only way to benefit from the content is to be there in person. Better plan to arrive early if you want a seat. Theyre very popular, space is limited and admission is strictly first come, first served.
Q&amp;A Session topics vary and relate to the category tracks featured at Disrupt SF 2019: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Biotech/Healthtech, Blockchain, Fintech, Gaming, Investor Topics, Media, Mobility, Privacy/Security, Retail/E-commerce, Robotics/IoT/Hardware, SaaS, Space and Social Impact &amp; Education.

Leigh Anderson,"Hey, Christmas is on Monday! The family holiday celebration is in two days and there’s exactly nothing under the tree for your niece, your mom, your brother and maybe even your own partner. Sure, you could hit the mall, but the stores are pretty picked over by now...and frankly, a lot of people don’t actually want any more stuff this holiday season. Enter the digital gift. For those of us living in cramped quarters, non-“thing” gifts are the only items on our wish lists to Santa. Gift certificates are the original non-thing presents, of course, but if you’re looking for new ideas, there are a million new virtual goods and services that won’t take up any space in the stocking (or on the plane ride home). Online Classes If you’ve got a autodidact in the family, check out the millions of virtual classes available on the internet. Take a look at Udemy for instruction in coding, business, or photography, among others; Babbel or LingQ for languages; Great Courses for science or history (and other) lectures from professors; or ArtistWorks for music lessons. Got a friend or a teen interested in standup? Check out Steve Martin’s online comedy workshop with Masterclass or Gold Comedy’s class for girls. Have a family member newly interested in yoga? Find classes for beginners all the way up to yoga master at Gaia. Want to up your game in the kitchen ? The Institute of Culinary Skills offers a knife-skills class for $105. If you're thinking of learning to code, the language you decide to pick up first has a lot to… Read more Read Museum or Sightseeing Memberships and Tickets I like gifts that people can use all year, like passes to local activities or attractions. If there’s a kid in your family who’s crazy about dinosaurs, consider a membership to the local natural history museum. Or a ten-pack of tickets to the zoo, ice-skating rink, or ski slope, or January tickets to the theater or opera. In my neighborhood there’s an indoor play space for kids that costs just a little too much; I would be thrilled with a five-pack of passes to get my kids through the worst of winter. Or if you’ve got a movie buff, consider a packet of tickets to the local cinema. Podcasts and Audiobooks Podcasts and audiobooks are the way to go if the giftee drives a lot or needs entertainment at the gym. If you’re keeping costs low this season, or if your recipient is new to podcasts, you can download your favorite episodes and make a “mix” for the recipient. If they’ve already got favorites, consider upgrading to the premium versions of their favorites (one Lifehacker staffer is getting Marc Maron ’s podcast for her dad; I’m getting a Slate Plus subscription with enhanced podcasts for one of my news junkie relatives.) For kids, Pinna offers a ton of options. Last year I gave my mom an Audible subscription.

Despite many people understanding the concept of 3D printing, few know the 3D design and printing… Read more Read Quality-of-Life Services I can’t afford to hire a real interior decorator, and I find them kind of intimidating anyway. Enter the virtual decorator: If you search Etsy for interior design services, your recipient can get online advice, mood boards, and shopping help to spruce up one room or the whole house. But before you consider redecorating, you might consider reorganizing: The National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals will help you find a professional organizer who will come to your house or and help you clear out your closets. For that matter, you can hire someone from TaskRabbit to come help out a family member who needs shelves put up or errands run ( here’s how to get a gift card for TaskRabbit.) If one of your friends has a new baby, a gift certificate for meal delivery from a local fancy-food shop, or for a house cleaning service, might just make their year. Homemade vouchers for babysitting are also always appreciated. Everyone loves a great podcast, including us! So imagine, if you will, that we’re handing you one… Read more Read Digital Entertainment For those friends who prefer to read on their Kindle or tablet, you can give a digital copy of your favorite book via Amazon or a CD via iTunes. This year I’m giving a friend a copy of Station Eleven and a Margo Price album. For the video gamers in your life, you might consider an app store gift card so they can buy extra power-ups or whatever in their favorite games. Amazon has somehow managed to create four different models of its Kindle ereader. Each of the four… Read more Read Bodywork If someone gave me some personal training sessions, or a gift card for a massage or pedicure, I would love them forever. You can call the spa or gym and likely get a gift certificate e-mailed in five minutes. Virtual Privacy If you’ve got a college student, they might appreciate a virtual private network to encrypt their communications and keep their data safe. This is likely the kind of gift that the recipient will want to participate in selecting and installing, but if you need some basic instructions, check out this how-to from Slate. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a great way to add security to your browsing while also… Read more Read Consumables How about the person who really doesn’t want any more things, but is still kind of a foodie? Beer / wine / cookie / oyster -of-the-month clubs extend the delicious treats of the holidays over a few months or a whole year, and if you’re lucky and you live close by, you can stop in on delivery day. Magazine and Newspaper Subscriptions Print magazines aren’t just for doctors’ offices, and your sibling might enjoy getting the New Yorker or the Atlantic, or Food and Wine. I got my husband a subscription to the Washington Post, which with Amazon Prime is free for six months and then $4 after. (Okay, that’s really a gift for me too.) Charitable Donations If you’re not keen at all on the consumerism of the holiday season and want to redistribute your resources a bit, consider a donation to a favorite charity in your family member’s name. Writing a note explaining why you thought they would support this particular charity can be a meaningful holiday communication in and of itself. An important aspect of having well-rounded finances is charity. Giving is generally accepted by… Read more Read The most important thing to remember is that you can get any of these with just a few minute’s notice—even a handwritten IOU is better than nothing.

Emirates The seat reclines into a fully lie-flat bed and can even be placed in a ""zero-gravity"" position ""inspired by NASA technology,"" according to Emirates, which gives ""a feeling of relaxation and weightlessness.""

There's even a full-length cupboard for hanging your clothes. In an industry first, suites located in the middle aisle will also have ""virtual windows"" which project the view from outside the aircraft using real-time camera technology.

"USA TODAY Sports, Josh Peter, USA TODAY Sports","SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz looks at the top five quarterbacks of the 2018 NFL Draft and the teams that would be the best fit for each. USA TODAY Sports Josh Rose, left, and Sam Darnold are expected to be among the top picks in Thursday's NFL draft. (Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports) Buckle up your figurative chin straps, boys. That in essence is the advice for Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen, Josh Allen and Baker Mayfield – the four quarterbacks widely expected to be taken among first top 10 picks of the 2018 NFL draft Thursday – courtesy of four retired quarterbacks who headed down a similar path long ago. Heath Shuler. Akili Smith. Joey Harrington. Kelly Stouffer. All of them have been labeled busts, highly drafted quarterbacks who failed to live up to expectations, and each told USA TODAY Sports that the transition from draft day to the NFL is critical. More: Who needs to draft a quarterback? Ranking NFL teams' need from 1-32 More: NFL draft 2018 quarterback rankings: Will Wyoming's Josh Allen or USC's Sam Darnold be No. 1 pick? “It happens so fast, you don’t have time to react,"" said Shuler, picked No. 3 overall by the Washington Redskins in 1994. “It’s like drinking through a fire hose."" Here’s some of what Shuler, Smith, Harrington and Stouffer remembered, and some of what they thought might help this year’s crop of prized quarterbacks stay on track. Heath Shuler Shuler finished as runner-up to Charlie Ward for the 1993 Heisman Trophy and held nearly all the passing records at the University of Tennessee before bypassing his senior year and entering the 1994 NFL draft. Heath Shuler was the third overall pick of Washington 1994 but last only three seasons with the team. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) He played four seasons in the NFL, throwing for 15 touchdowns and 33 interceptions before a foot injury ended his career in 1998. “My biggest enemy was myself,’’ Shuler said. “Push, pressure myself. From high school to college, I always had always been successful. Very fortunate that I’d always been with a winning team that had a tot of talent. So I put this added pressure on myself.’’ But Shuler said much of what took place after the day of the draft was beyond his control. “To be truthful, I think there’s so much emphasis put on those first three or four picks, or even the first 10 picks,’’ he said. “When in reality, if you’re a quarterback, it’d be much better to be drafted at the end of the first round. “Because that means you’re going to be with a team that has been far more successful and a team that has had some playoff experience. And if they’re looking to bring you in as the next quarterback … that’s a better opportunity than it is to be a highly drafted first-round pick.’’ When Shuler joined the Redskins, they were coming off a 4-12 season. They also had a first-year head coach, Norv Turner, and first-year quarterbacks coach, Cam Cameron. “We were all rookies. so we were pressing ourselves,’’ Shuler said. “I needed a veteran guy to put his arm around me and say, ‘Hey, you know it’s going to take some time.' "" After three disappointing seasons with the Redskins and one failed season with the New Orleans Saints, Shuler said, he made an important discovery after signing with the Oakland Raiders. Jon Gruden, then the Raiders head coach, was running the West Coast Offense, similar to what Shuler ran in high school and coach. “Oh my gosh, I should have begged before to be in this system all over again,’’ said Shuler, who re-injured his foot in training camp and then retired. “This is where I felt comfortable and that’s where I felt like I had the most to give back with my own abilities. “Ultimately, it comes down to that coach and that system and that team around you.’’ Akili Smith After starting just 11 games at the University of Oregon but throwing 30 touchdowns during that impressive stretch, Smith was taken No. 3 overall by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 1999 NFL draft. Akili Smith was the third overall pick in 1999 but played in only 22 games over four seasons for the Cincinnati Bengals. (Photo: AL Behrman, Associated Press) Less than six years later, he was playing for the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europe. He finished his NFL career having passed for five touchdowns with 13 interceptions. Looking back, Smith said, a highly drafted quarterback needs to stay focused. “The money you get and the fame and things of that nature, you have to put all of that stuff to the side,"" he said, “and make sure that you get acclimated with your new organization, with your new city, with your teammates and things of that nature.’’ That wasn’t easy, Smith said, after he signed a contract that was worth up to $56 million and included a $10.8 million signing bonus. “Oh, my God, I had an uncle that had a $1 million ‘Price Is Right’ check and he was on his front lawn and taking pictures thinking that I was going to give him $1 million,’’ Smith said. “And then you got other aunties and parents and brothers, everybody is just expecting something. And it’s not fair to that individual."" In part, Smith said, he traces his failures in part to a 27-day, rookie contract holdout that he said resulted in no financial gain. “First things first, get your butt in (training) camp,’’ Smith said. “You may only get one opportunity at a signing bonus. But at the end of the day, if you get in camp and you take care of business, you’ll be able to enter into your second contract in the NFL. “What was the holdout really about? The holdout turns out to be more about the dislike between the Browns family and Leigh Steinberg (Smith’s agent at the time).’’ Though Smith also said he doesn’t think any young quarterback could have succeeded with the Bengals at that time, he cites his own behavior as part of the problem. “I ran from Cincinnati to come back to San Diego to party and do things like that, looking for temporarily pleasure,’’ he said. “If you go to a Cleveland Browns or something like that, obviously things aren’t where they need to be. You don’t run from that situation. “You go to a local boys and girls club. You go to an at-risk or group home or something like that and you start working with the people in the community. It will keep you grounded. it will keep you humble.’’ Joey Harrington In 2001, a billboard in Times Square read “Joey Heisman.’’ Harrington, then racking up yards and touchdowns at the University of Oregon, finished a respectable fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting before being picked No. 3 overall by the Detroit Lions in the 2002 NFL draft. Joey Harrington was the third overall pick of Detroit in 2002 and played in the NFL for six seasons. (Photo: Scott Audette, AP) He played six seasons and passed for 14,693 yards, but had a sub-par quarterback rating of 69.4 while throwing for 79 touchdowns and 85 picks. “I think the biggest piece of advice that I could pass on to anybody is don’t ever lose belief in yourself,’’ Harrington said. “When you get to the level where you’re theoretically one of the 32 best people in the world at what you do, you’re competing against the best in the world and not everything’s going to go right all the time. And there may be some significant stretches where you struggle. “But no matter what happens, you can’t lose belief in yourself. The moment you lose belief in your ability to play and your ability to compete in the NFL is the moment you’re done. Because doubt breeds hesitation, and hesitation creates mistakes. “The difference between a touchdown and an interception in the NFL is fractions of a second. And so if you doubt yourself enough to hesitate, that potential touchdown turns into an interception.’’ After his third year in the league, Harrington said, he consulted a sports psychologist for the first time. “That’s the only reason I continued in the NFL is because I started working with one,’’ he said. “I mean, I struggled in Detroit. And for me, it was really the first time I had had any sort of failure, public failure, and so that was rough. I didn’t deal with it well. And had I not sought out a sports psychologist afterward, I would have been in some trouble. “There’s 100 guys that can make every single throw in the NFL. They can throw every deep comeback, they can throw every post route. What separates success from failure is absolutely minute in the NFL. Not only is it minute, but it’s all in your head.’’ Kelly Stouffer By the end of his senior year at Colorado State, Stouffer was the school’s career leading passer but suddenly in limbo. Picked No. 6 overall in the 1987 draft by the then-St. Louis Cardinals, Stouffer held out when contract negotiations fell apart. A year later the Seattle Seahawks acquired his rights. He threw for seven touchdowns and 19 touchdowns during his five-year NFL career. He emerged as the starter midway through his rookie season, but injuries helped derail his career. “All of the sudden you’re hurt and out for six weeks,"" he said. “Well, for me that was a huge challenge because I didn’t know how to take that. So what begins to happen to me is I begin to lose my confidence, I begin to just feel differently about myself even though it was things out of my control. “Before long I found myself really questioning my ability to do the job. And once you start thinking that way, the world begins to spin out of control as far as football is concerned.’’ A head-spinning experience is what this year’s prized rookie quarterbacks can expect, Stouffer said. “I think the best advice I could give is you have to realize it’s going to be a completely different animal and there really isn’t anyway to circumvent the learning curve you’re going to experience,’’ he said. “That’s just simply part of the process and really unavoidable, and that doesn’t mean that something is wrong. It doesn’t mean the sky is falling. “It just means that you’re at a different level now and there are grown men that play the game at the highest level everywhere you look. In the end, it’s a football game. It really is just a game that is a played in a similar way that these kids will be used to. And so before long you’ll find yourself realizing it’s somewhat business as usual. “Once you get past that initial shock.’’ So buckle up those chin straps, boys.

If you’re holing up for a wild weekend of screaming into pillows and drunk-dialing members of Congress, may I suggest treating yourself to ninety minutes of unbridled female excellence courtesy of the National Women’s Soccer League? You deserve it. A Wall Street Journal op-ed published Tuesday made the push-pull defense we’ve seen among Brett… Read more Read Women’s soccer tends to be a hard sell for a lot of viewers, which is a shame because it rules. Everything that people think they hate about soccer is largely absent from women’s games: there’s no diving, no stop-drop-and-roll antics, no tearful, Oscar-worthy appeals to the officials. To put a finer point on it, unlike top mens’ leagues, Twitter, the news, prestige TV, the White House, most workplaces, and general public life, NWSL games are utterly devoid of overpaid adult men throwing full-on pissbaby tantrums to get their way. What a concept! There are plenty more reasons to watch this game in particular, and everyone from total newcomers to huge soccer nerds can find something to root for. Newbies are in good hands thanks to Aly Wagner and Jenn Hildreth’s top-notch commentary work, which effortlessly blends expert analysis and genuine, infectious enthusiasm for the game. If you’re just here for the drama, I have great news: Saturday’s final is a rematch, and the defending champions have home-field advantage. Even better, the home field in question is a sold-out Providence Park in Portland, Oregon—which means the atmosphere is going to be unreal. Can 21,000 very loud fans help the Portland Thorns beat the North Carolina Courage, a feat they haven’t managed since last year’s final? As a Portland fan, I dunno—the Courage has lost exactly one game this season, and they seem fundamentally disinterested in losing another. No matter the outcome, I’m pumped for what promises to be a barn-burner of a match. If you are, too, get ready to tune into Lifetime this Saturday, September 22nd, at 1:30 P.M. Pacific/4:30 P.M. Eastern. (Yes, Lifetime.) For more context, here’s a primer on the teams and their standout players. North Carolina Courage: The Terrifying Juggernaut With No Apparent Weaknesses The Courage scored more goals this season than any team in NWSL history, and they’ve got their formula down pat. Abby Dahlkemper dribbles into space and passes the ball up to Jess McDonald, who holds it as Lynn Williams makes a run into the box. More often than not, Lynn Williams scores. Sometimes Crystal Dunn gets involved, and sometimes Dahlkemper contributes a free kick instead of a run upfield, but the essential strategy rarely changes. Why should it? This goal was William’s second that game, her thirteenth that season, and the Courage’s fifty-first in 2018: Video courtesy of NWSLSoccer on YouTube. Players to watch: It’s kinda hard to beat the completely absurd Jess McDonald/Lynn Williams combo, though I haven’t fully recovered from this jaw-dropping Sam Mewis goal. I’m probably most excited to watch reigning Defender of the Year Abby Dahlkemper and human Swiss Army Knife Crystal Dunn, but the entire squad is just stacked. Portland Thorns: The Scrappy, Beautiful Hot Mess Defending Champs With two championships (2013 and 2017) to their name, the Thorns have always been at least competitive, if not outright dominant. Still, this sure didn’t seem like their year: key attackers Allie Long, Amandine Henry, and Nadia Nadim all left for other teams, and injuries kept defender Emily Menges and world-class playmaker Tobin Heath off the starting lineup until early May. Also, first-string goalie Adrianna Franch had knee surgery in April. That’s a lot of change all at once, but the Thorns figured it out, started scoring more goals, and earned a spot in their second consecutive championship game. That’s why I think this frustrating, sloppy, breathtaking display is the 2018 Thorns goal: Video courtesy of NWSLSoccer on YouTube. Players to watch: League MVP front-runner Lindsey Horan has scored banger after banger after banger all season long, mostly with her head, and mostly in cahoots with Tobin Heath and Christine Sinclair. As for the back line, Adrianna Franch will likely make a ridiculous save or three, and Emily Menges has a history of coming up with huge blocks in big games. Finally, we have to talk about North Carolina’s Jaelene Hinkle. She’s an excellent defender but also a vocal, unrepentant homophobe who declined a national team spot because she couldn’t bring herself to wear rainbow numbers on her back. She’s gotten plenty of blowback on social media for this choice, but the only real-life consequence has been boos from Portland fans. This is significant: in a sport where mens’ supporter groups routinely participate in homophobic chants, hearing a crowd boo an athlete for being homophobic feels downright cathartic. A sold-out Thorns match at Providence Park is the opposite of a safe space for homophobes, so Saturday should be interesting for Jaelene to say the least. Jaelene Hinkle is a 25-year-old American soccer player who currently plays for the NWSL’s North… Read more Read Courage coach Bob Riley and teammate Jess McDonald have defended Hinkle in interviews, but judging by the silence from everyone else, her comments have put her many LGBTQ colleagues in a deeply uncomfortable position. As a fan, it’s at least comforting to know that the NWSL’s “come-as-you-are” supporter culture does not apply to bigots. If that’s not a compelling reason to tune in after an unbearably long week of terrible stories about terrible men, I don’t know what is. The 2018 NWSL Championship kicks off tomorrow, September 22nd, at 1:30 P.M. Pacific time (4:30 P.M. Eastern).

Victoria Song,"Despite what wearables makers would have you think, its not just all smartwatches. Theres still a place for the humble fitness tracker. For starters, theyre much cheaper than smartwatches, provide accurate fitness tracking, have better battery life, and are perfectly adequate at delivering push notifications. This basically sums up Fitbits new flagship fitness trackers, the Inspire and Inspire HR.
At $100, the Inspire HR is literally a quarter of the price of an Apple Watch Series 4. The Inspire, which omits the heart rate monitoring, is even cheaper at $70. Similar non-Fitbit fitness trackers, like Garmins Vivosmart 4, are still more expensive at $130. So from an affordability standpoint, Fitbits Inspire line is definitely worth a closer examination. After all, if it cant deliver the same performance customers have come to expect from Fitbits, what good is the lower price?

Boring design. Doesn't stand out.
I spent a week with the Inspire HR, and so far, its been a mixed bag. Functionally, I dont have much to complain about. It tracks my steps, distance, calories burned, and active minutesjust like any fitness tracker worth its salt does in 2019. I get continuous heart rate monitoring, and I can confirm that youll get at least five days of battery life off one charge. Its water resistant to 50 meters or 5ATM, which is generally the standard needed to be considered swimproofand yes, the Inspire HR survived multiple showers and run-ins with my dishes.
As for accuracy, the Inspire HR delivers a solid performance. On a one-mile treadmill walk at 3.5 miles per hourthe average walking speedit logged 2,100 steps to my control pedometers 2,139 steps for an excellent difference of 1.8 percent. It did equally well on a one-mile run at 5 mph, registering 1,924 steps to the control pedometers 1,992 steps. Thats a decent difference of 3 percent. Heart rate tracking was also on point, falling within 2 beats per minute of an Apple Watch Series 4 during exercise, and within 10 bpm of my Polar H10 chest strap. (Chest straps deliver more accurate readings than wrist-based optical monitors, as theyre actually sending an electric signal to your heart.)
Automatic exercise tracking is also decent. I wore the Inspire HR to a groovy dancehall class, and while it tracked my 90 minutes of rhythmically challenged flopping around as a sport I was pleased it marked the exercise at all. Often times, Ill wear a Series 4 to the same class and despite sweating my butt off, it wont register as exercise.
So if battery life is great, accuracy is on-point, and the price is super, shouldnt this be the fitness tracker to end all fitness trackers? It might have been, if not for the design.
The Inspire HRs design is disappointing. It copies the slim and sleek shape of Fitbits popular Alta trackers, and normally, Id consider that a good thing. However, on my wrist, the Inspire HR just looks cheap. Gone is the Altas anodized aluminum bodywhat you get now is black plastic. Also, the joints where the screen meets the strap are less angular. While I can appreciate that Fitbit meant to make it a more rounded, modern look, I cant help but feel the design choice makes it look more childish.
Thats not to say the Inspire HR hasnt made any design improvements. The touchscreen is no longer dependent on taps, which was one of the major annoyances with the Alta. The monochrome screen is now swipe-based, as in you swipe down to access a quick menu to exercises, and up to view your daily stats. Still, Fitbit hasnt managed to figure out how to reduce bezels and the Inspire HR has incredibly thick ones the width of my pinky finger at the top and bottom.
Also different is the mechanism for swapping bands. The Alta had a handy latch that made switching straps super intuitive and easy. The Inspire HR has opted for the same pin system as the Versa. Its not hard per se, but it is cumbersome and for me, makes me disinclined to ever swap out straps.
You can, however, opt to do away with straps entirely and plop the tracker into a clip accessory, which used to be the purview of Fitbits cheapest trackers. Thats because with the Inspire and Inspire HR, Fitbit is obliterating its entire lower-end product offering. The Inspire trackers will effectively replace the Fitbit Zip, One, Flex 2, Alta, and Alta HRmeaning your only other options in the Fitbit family will be its series of smartwatches and the Fitbit Charge 3.
Thats smart business, but wearing the Inspire HR, I cant help but mourn the Alta HR. Before the Versa, the Alta HR was the Fitbit I most commonly recommended to casual wearables users. Not only was it stylish and discreet, it also wasnt horribly priced and it delivered accurate tracking metrics. Other trackers followed suit, and you can definitely notice the Alta HRs design influence on Garmins Vivosmart 4.
It might seem petty to whine about the Inspire HRs looks, especially since functionally its not really a compromise or step down from the Alta HR. But design is a big part of whether you actually stick with a wearable in the long run, or if simply collects dust at the bottom of your drawer. Im pretty sure no one is going to compliment me on the Inspire HR unless I opt for a nicer accessory. Meanwhile, Ive gotten plenty of compliments while wearing the Alta HR and Versa. Sure, its extremely vain, but it is a motivating factor keep your tracker charged and on your wrist. In that sense, the Inspire HR feels like a blatant corporate cash grab, which is a stinking shame.
All this makes Fitbits Charge 3 a much more attractive option for a simple fitness tracker. Its only $50 more, but you get about seven days of battery lifeand yes, an extra two days does make a differenceplus all the same tracking features, and some smartwatch-esque functionality via apps. Theres a bigger touchscreen, haptic feedback, and its just a classier looking device. Likewise, Garmins aforementioned vivosmart 4 is also a solid alternative. Its $30 more, and you give up the ability to switch out straps, but it actually makes use of its Sp02 sensors and Garmins entire software platform is better suited to anyone who really wants to get into their data. (Fitbits platform is much more palatable to anyone who wants a more streamlined view.)
But really, the Inspire HRs lackluster design and failure to truly differentiate itself from the Charge 3 just makes me wonder: Why bother at all? After all, Fitbit just released its Versa Lite Edition which gets you all basic powers of its smartwatch ecosystem, for just $60 more than the Inspire HR.
If this sounds harsh, it admittedly may be. It is admirable that Fitbit managed to figure out a sub-$100 tracker, especially since it performs quite well. But naming your tracker Inspire ought to evoke that feeling in some formand it just doesnt.
README:
Lots of great features and accurate tracking, especially for a sub $100 tracker!
The design just seems chintzier than predecessors like the Alta HR, and newer options like the Versa Lite Edition.
Doesnt distinguish itself from Fitbits other flagship tracker, the Charge 3.","Despite what wearables makers would have you think, it’s not just all smartwatches.

Christopher Woody,"A photo illustration of the future USS Columbia (SSBN 826). US Navy/Petty Officer 1st Class Armando Gonzales Faulty welding in missile tubes bound for the Navy's newest submarines could create additional problems for one of the Navy's most expensive and highest-priority programs. Twelve missiles tubes build by defense contractor BWXT are being reviewed for substandard welds that were uncovered after discrepancies were found in the equipment the firm was using to test the welds before sending them to General Dynamic Electric Boat, which is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class ballistic-missile sub program, according to a report by Defense News. BWXT was one of three firms subcontracted to build tubes for Columbia-class subs and for the UK's Dreadnought-class missiles subs. The firm was one of two subcontracted to build tubes for the US's Virginia-class attack subs. The USS Virginia returns to the General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard after the successful completion of its first voyage in open seas, July 30, 2004. US Navy GDEB had already received seven of the tubes and five were still being built. The Navy and GDEB have launched an investigation, according to Defense News. The issue comes to light at the start of fabrication for the Columbia class subs, which is meant to replace the Navy's Ohio-class ballistic-missile subs and begin strategic patrols by 2031. The Navy has to start building the new boats by 2021 in order to stay on that timeline. A spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command told Defense News that the problem, which appears to be limited to tubes made by BWXT, shouldn't put the Columbia-class program behind schedule. The Columbia-class sub program is already one of the Defense Department's most expensive, expected to cost $122.3 billion, roughly $4.9 billion a boat, to build 12 boats, which are to replace the Navy's current 14 Ohio-class missile submarines. The aging Ohio-class boats began entered service between 1981 and 1997 with a 30-year service life, which was extended to 42 years with a four-year midlife overhaul. The Columbia-class subs will replace the Ohios as a leg of the US's nuclear triad, built with an improved nuclear reactor that will preclude the need for a midlife overhaul and give the 12 Columbia-class subs the same sea presence as the 14 Ohio-class boats, Navy officials have said. Because of nuclear submarines' ability to move undetected, experts view them as more survivable than the long-range bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles that make up the other arms of the US nuclear triad. The guided-missile submarine USS Ohio arrives at Naval Base Kitsap-Bremerton to begin a major maintenance period at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, April 4, 2017. U.S. Navy photo by Jeremy Moore The ultimate impact of the problem with the BWXT-made tubes is not yet clear, according to Bryan Clark, a former submarine officer and now an analyst for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""It's not a good sign for a program that has had a lot of attention,"" Clark told Defense News. ""It's the Navy's number one acquisition priority."" The Columbia-class program has already faced questions about its technology. Problems with one component can compound, and that could be especially challenging for GDEB, which is supposed to start building two Virginia-class attack subs alongside a Columbia-class boat annually in the coming years. The Navy wants to continue building two Virginia-class subs a year — rather than reduce it to one a year once production of Columbia-class subs starts in 2021 — in order to head off a shortfall in submarines that was expected to hit in the mid-2020s. The Navy also wants to shorten the Virginia-class construction time line and keep five of its Los Angeles-class attack boats in service for 10 more years. ""The problem is that this causes challenges down the line,"" Clark said of the faulty tube welds. ""The missile tubes get delayed, what are the cascading effects of other components down the line?""","Contractors working on the Navy's newest class of ballistic missile sub have found a fault in their new missile tubes, which are designed to fire nuclear weapons.

MIKE IVES,"Unlike the Japanese women’s national team, the country’s men’s team did not quality for 2018 Winter Olympics. But with help from today’s top teenage prospects, Christiansen said he expected the men to be competitive in qualifying for the 2022 and 2026 Games — on par with countries like Austria, Denmark and France, which have each produced about a dozen N.H.L. players and been in the top division in the world rankings. “They’re going to have some really, really strong teams,” he said. During the recent game in Karuizawa, Iguchi, an elegant skater, seemed at turns to be taking it easy: stickhandling circles around his opponents with the puck, as a cat-owner might tease kittens with a ball of string, before picking his corners for shots. Iguchi said later that when he was learning to play, he had been inspired by Pavel Datsyuk, a Russian stickhandling wizard and longtime Detroit Red Wings star, who now plays in the Kontinental Hockey League. “He can deke and stickhandle like no one else,” Iguchi said. Graham said that Iguchi’s own agility and stickhandling skills were remarkable for a player his age, but that a key question was whether he could continue to develop his already considerable speed. “He’s one of the best 14-year-olds in the world,” he said. “But a 14- and 18-year-old are night and day.” Iguchi already has an international following. His Instagram account has more than 18,000 followers, and he has appeared in YouTube videos that have collectively received millions of views. (His teammates nicknamed him “YouTuber.”) GoPro: Japanese Ice Hockey Prodigy Aito Iguchi Video by GoPro But in person, Iguchi is unassuming and seems ambivalent about being the center of attention. During an interview after his recent six-point game in Karuizawa, he politely fielded questions with the detachment of a teenager sitting through an algebra class or a dental appointment. His gaze was drifting toward the ice. “He’s just a kid being a kid,” Graham said. “And he loves hockey.” A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2018, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: Japanese Prodigy Tries to Skate a Path to the N.H.L.

At some point during the high school tenures of so many, that pressure releases in the form of An Incident. And if you've ever wanted to read all of these stories, now you can. On Monday night, Buzzfeed writer Katie Notopoulos Tweeted out a simple question: What was “the incident” in your high school? — Katie Notopoulos (@katienotopoulos) December 26, 2017 SEE ALSO: When you're on the high school diving team, get ready for some fails And oh, the responses she got (which as of this writing is 1,825, and doesn't even count manual ""response"" retweets). Needless to say: - Some of them are incredibly dark! - Many involve teacher-student relationships! - Drugs and booze often end up in the mix! So let's just, in this context, consider those stories rote. As opposed to these, which are fantastic : - Newton South High School, Class of '02, The Lewd Crude Scavenger Hunt: When your high school's ""Incident"" is insane enough to make the news of a website like The Smoking Gun, you know they've done something right. So goes Lindsey Weber's high school, which had a scavenger hunt so patently ratchet that it made national news. Among the hunted items: A brick from a rival high school (10 points), a bowling ball (5 points), a Mo Vaughn baseball card (5 points), and ""shit in a bag"" (10 points). And those are just off of the fake list they made to throw off cops. On the real list? Stealing the golden arches off a McDonald's (120 points), take a Viagra (5 points per pill, with a max-out of four pills), a license plate from a cop car (30 points), a left-handed baseball glove (5 points), a fish (7 points), and a "" Ghostbusters gun"" (10 points). And those are among the more, uh, printable items on the list. According to The Smoking Gun, half of Newton's 330 seniors got in on the action. This was apparently some kind of tradition that had gone on for some time—the resulting action was so madcap that director Eli Roth almost made a movie out of it, explaining: ""What started out as Cannonball Run quickly devolved into Caligula."" - Nyack High School, Class of '08, Giant Peen of Desks: When writer Sophie Kleeman went to high school, she saw an authorized senior prank go rogue when a bunch of kids were supposed to form a ""2008"" with desks and chairs removed from a classroom. Instead, they opted for (shocker) a giant penis shape. Said the local news : "" Seventeen-year-old senior Erin Cummings says it was upsetting to see her classmates' hard work turned into a huge penis even though many other students thought it was hilarious.

Tom Marks,"Not all bugs are bad. By Tom Marks Speaking with Valkyria Chronicles producer Kei Mikami at E3, he revealed that Valkyria Chronicles 4’s new class, the Grenadier, was actually inspired by a bug they found during the development of the first game. Apparently toward the end of development, a bug would pop up that caused your squad’s tanks to shoot grenades instead of shells. While they were able to fix the bug, the team actually enjoyed this long range grenade style of play. They even wanted to add it as a new class in the first Valkyria Chronicles, but unfortunately it was too late in development to make that large of a change and the idea had to be scrapped. They tried to bring it back for the second Valkyria Chronicles, but couldn’t make it work there either. Now that Valkyria Chronicles 4 is returning to the large maps of the original, the grenadier fit in much better. Mikami also said that they wanted to add a more cinematic sort of attack to this game, comparing the falling grenades to WW2 movies where soldiers are running with explosions all around them. The grenadier is a risky unit to use, because it can shoot grenades very far but is extremely slow. It also needs to set up before attacking, which leaves them vulnerable to enemy fire. This makes it a much different unity than most others, so it’s interesting to hear how long the idea has been around for. Tom Marks is IGN's PC Editor and pie maker.

AZI PAYBARAH,"Youre asking people to get out of their cars, then the mass transit needs to work better. The railroads had its worst on-time record in nearly two decades. Its a mess.
 Is congestion pricing a tax on low-income and working-class people?
Long Island people driving into the city, who are already paying a good amount to live on Long Island and commute, would certainly not see it favorably. I dont know if they use the tax word. I dont think anyones asking for this on Long Island. The question is, can there be a commensurate benefit to balance it?
 Someone suggested an exemption for New York City residents. 
[Laughs] I think different people have different regional needs.
 Is there a way to make congestion pricing just for the rich? Can only luxury vehicles be charged?
The only specific on vehicles that has been brought up is an exemption for motorcycles.
 Im sure the motorcycle lobby is happy about that.

Former Indian central bank governor Raghuram Rajan has warned capitalism is ""under serious threat"" as it has stopped providing for the masses. 
Mr Rajan told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme ""when that happens, the many revolt against capitalism"".
He said governments cannot afford to ignore social inequality when considering the economy. 
Mr Rajan led India's central bank and was also a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. 
He has been tipped by some as a possible successor to take over from Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England.
""I think capitalism is under serious threat because it's stopped providing for the many, and when that happens, the many revolt against capitalism,"" he told the BBC. 
Mr Rajan said it was possible in the past to obtain a middle class job with ""modest education"".
But the landscape has changed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and the resulting austerity. 
""Now, if you really want to succeed, you need a really good education,"" he told Radio 4.
""Unfortunately, the very communities that are hit by the forces of global trade and global information tend to be communities which have deteriorating schools, rising crime, rising social illnesses and are unable to prepare their members for the global economy.""

 Protesters march in London in January, calling for an end to austerity and a general election
A report from S&amp;P Global Ratings suggests another global credit downturn is possible, with a 50% surge in worldwide debt since the global financial crisis. 
It said since 2008, government debt has risen 77% while corporate debt is up 51%. 
However, the analysts said the next downturn is unlikely to be as severe as the 2008 financial crisis.
Mr Rajan believes that capitalism is breaking down because it is not providing equal opportunities. 
""It's not providing equal opportunity and in fact the people who are falling off are in a much worse situation,"" he said. 
He said authoritarian regimes arise ""when you socialise all the means of production"". 
""A balance is needed, you can't pick and choose - what you need to do is improve opportunity.""
In discussing the state of the global economy Mr Rajan, now a professor at the University of Chicago, also pointed to the challenges of putting limits on the trade of goods.
""If you put up those barriers, then down the line they'll put up barriers to our goods. How are you going to keep the goods flowing across those borders when we need to send them?""",Former Indian central bank governor Raghuram Rajan warns of the challenges facing global democracy.,2019-03-12T05:12:05Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Raghuram Rajan says capitalism is 'under serious threat',https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47532522,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16B0A/production/_105983929_raghuram-rajan.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,class-4,1
JENNIFER WEINER,"My teacher was a genial man with white hair and an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, from the lives of composers to exactly how many versions of a Chopin nocturne were found in his desk after he died.
Here, he said, setting a piece of sheet music on the stand. Play just the right hands part. I peered at the page, touching the keys of the grand piano hesitantly. My fingers felt twice as thick as usual; my hands, half as flexible. Even though Id spent hundreds of hours in exactly that position eyes on the page, hands on the keys, right foot on the pedal, left foot on the floor it felt brand new. The piece was a Burgmuller étude in 4/4 time. I settled my hand on an A, then a G, then an F, then Is that an E?
It is indeed! my teacher said, sounding as proud as if Id recognized an obscure mathematical formula, instead of just a note.
Slowly, haltingly, I played the song through: right hand, then left hand, then both hands together. See, that wasnt so bad! my teacher said.
I began playing half an hour a day: working through Mozarts sonatinas, sampling Tchaikovskys Seasons and gloomy Norwegian folk songs by Grieg. As a kid, I hated to practice. As an adult, the time flies. I peer myopically at the sheet music, wincing as I hit an A instead of an A sharp six times in a row. A hundred responsibilities beckon. I should be working. Folding laundry. Starting dinner. I ignore them, and lose myself in the task of puzzling out the notes.

We Are The Mighty,"The USS Blue Ridge. us navy She doesn't look like much. Weighing in at just under 19,000 tons, this ship doesn't have much in the way of firepower, either. She's relatively slow with a top speed of 23 knots. So, when you look at a Blue Ridge-class ship, you may wonder to yourself, ""just what the heck is this thing's purpose?"" The short answer: She's the brains of the fleet. To be more precise, she's there to ""provide command and control for fleet commanders"" according to the United States Navy. But it's not entirely uncommon for a lesser-armed ship to take on such an important role. Back in World War II, the auxiliary USS Argonne (AG 31) served as a flagship in the South Pacific for Admiral William F. Halsey. The transport USS MacCawley (APA 4) was used as the flagship for Admiral Richmond ""Kelly"" Turner until its loss in a friendly fire incident in 1943. The United States even converted a pair of amphibious ships, USS Coronado (APF 11) and USS LaSalle (AGF 3), to act as fleet flagships during the Cold War.

Specialist 1st Class Marvin E. Thompson Jr. The two-ship Blue Ridge-class, however, was built specifically for the task of enabling a fleet commander to handle his fleet. As a small, mobile command post, it is much less vulnerable to attacks from terrorists or enemies. There's a lot of ocean to hide in, so you have to search really hard to find it. If worst comes to worst, the Blue Ridge does have some emergency firepower. For self-defense, the ship is outfitted with two Mk 15 Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems. These 20mm guns are a last-ditch defense against incoming missiles, but this ship is intended to be well out of harm's way. Its primary weapons are its array of communications antennae, allowing commanders to handle operations across an entire theater if need be.

Andrew Freedman,"Air travel is often depicted as a spreader of diseases around the world, given that it squeezes lots of people into a small space. However, a new study shows that you're not likely to get the flu from a passenger seated more than 1 meter, or 3.3 feet, away from you. The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, claims to be the first to rigorously test the spread of viruses — specifically influenza — that are transmitted via large droplets, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Researchers from Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Boeing employed teams of observers in pairs, sitting every five rows down in economy class in single-aisle aircraft during 10 transcontinental flights in 2012 and 2013. These observers watched and recorded the movements of passengers during the flight using an iPad app. SEE ALSO: 3 of 4 kids who've died from flu this year weren't vaccinated, say federal doctors The study used the movement of each passenger to simulate the spread of influenza virus from a passenger seated in the mid-cabin (seat 14C, to be exact), and an infectious crew member. The researchers developed a new model of the network of contacts passengers and crew members had with one another, as well as a simulation model of disease spread, to find out how many additional people would get sick while on typical flights that last between 4 and 5 hours. The results were surprising. On average, an infectious passenger seated in the mid-cabin had the potential to infect an additional 0.7 additional people per flight. However, if an infectious crew member chose not to stay home, and did not take medication to limit their coughing, then that infectious crew member would infect an additional 4.6 passengers per flight, the study found. ""Our model simulations yield that an infected flight attendant could infect several passengers, and we quantify this. This provides additional support for the policy of preventing crew members from working when sick,"" said study lead author Vicki Stover Hertzberg, of Emory University. The study found that people sitting in window seats who did not get up to go use the restroom or check the overhead bin had far less exposure to infectious passengers than people sitting at the aisle, or people who spent time in line waiting for the restroom at the back of the cabin, for example. So, come next flu season, you might want to pick a window seat and avoid getting up. ""If they select the window seat to minimize those exposures, they also need to stay there (i.e., don’t move). When they move, they increase their exposures,"" Hertzberg said. The study has some significant limitations. It does not apply to illnesses transmitted via smaller particles known as aerosols, which include tuberculosis, measles, and other dangerous pathogens. ""These tiny particles need not fall within a meter of the infected passenger,"" Hertzberg said. ""They can stay suspended in the cabin air for long periods of time, be taken up by air recirculation systems, etc."" The study also didn't quantify the risk of getting sick from viruses located on air cabin surfaces, such as an armrest or seatbelt. And it doesn’t apply to twin-aisle, larger aircraft used on long-haul flights, or quick shuttle flights, such as from Boston to Washington, D.C. The bottom line, though, said study co-author Howard Weiss, also of Emory, is that ""If you practice good hand hygiene, keep your hands away from your face, and if you are seated further away than a meter from an infected passenger, you are unlikely to get infected by influenza during an 4 to 5 hour flight.""","Air travel is often depicted as a spreader of diseases around the world, given that it squeezes lots of people into a small space.

Adam Clark Estes,"Big news for lovers of the iPhone SE, a franken-gadget made of old Apple parts and billed as a more affordable iOS device: It appears that the budget iPhone lineup is finally going to get its first refresh two years after the original model hit the market. The announcement could come as early as WWDC in June. In fact, Apple might be announcing several new iPhones. The news of the new iPhones comes out of a Russian-language regulatory filing with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC). As first reported by the French website Consomac, Apple has registered 11 new iPhones that will run iOS 11: A1920, A1921, A1984, A2097, A2098, A2099, A2101, A2103, A2104, A2105 and A2106. It’s unclear if these model numbers correspond to unique models or simply different sizes and carriers for the same model. One could easily assume that the difference in the A19** models and the A20** models is the difference between some sort of new iPhone SE and a completely new iPhone SE Plus. However, it’s also quite possible that Apple will reveal the rumored full-screen iPhone lineup based on the iPhone X form factor. Analysts expect Apple to sell a 6.5-inch “iPhone X Plus” and a cheaper 6.1-inch iPhone X (SE?) alongside the current 5.8-inch OLED iPhone X. But again, this is just conjecture at this point. What does seem clear, however, is the likelihood of Apple announcing new iPhones in the near future. A similar story about two new iPad model numbers registered with the EEC occurred in February, and then last month, Apple rolled out two new cheap 9.7-inch iPads (one with cellular connectivity and one with only wifi) at its big education event in Chicago. Another EEC filing last year predicted new MacBook models before Apple announced them at WWDC 2017. So it seems like Apple is about to have an iPhone surprise party. This could mean an update to the iPhone SE or it could mean the arrival of a whole new class of notch-sporting devices that you might be able to buy for less than $1,000. If it happens at WWDC, this would be the first time Apple has made an iPhone announcement in June since the iPhone 4 in 2010, although that announcement was spoiled pretty hard.

Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, China’s dominant ride-hailing company, is continuing its international expansion after it announced plans to launch in Australia this month. The company — which bought Uber’s China business in 2016 — said it will begin serving customers in Melbourne from June 25 following a month-long trial period in Geelong, a neighboring city that’s 75km away. The business will be run by a Didi subsidiary in Australia and it plans to offer “a series of welcome packages to both drivers and riders” — aka discounts and promotions, no doubt. It began signing up drivers on June 1, the company added. The Australia launch will again put Didi in direct competition with Uber, but that is becoming increasingly common, and also Ola which counts Didi as an investor — more on that below. This move follows forays into Taiwan, Mexico and Brazil this year as Didi has finally expanded beyond its China-based empire. Didi raised $4 billion in December to develop AI, general technology and to fund international expansion and it has taken a variety of routes to doing the latter. This Australia launch is organic, with Didi developing its own team, while in Taiwan it has used a franchise model and it went into Brazil via acquisition, snapping up local Uber-rival 99 at a valuation of $1 billion. It is also set to enter Japan where it has teamed up with investor SoftBank on a joint-venture. “In 2018, Didi will continue to cultivate markets in Latin America, Australia and Japan. We are confident a combination of world-class transportation AI technology and deep local expertise will bring a better experience to overseas markets,” the company added in a statement. This international expansion has also brought a new level of confusion since Didi has cultivated relationships with other ride-hailing companies across the world while also expanding its own presence internationally. The Uber deal brought with it a stock swap — turning Didi and Uber from competitors into stakeholders — and the Chinese company has also backed Grab in Southeast Asia, Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India, Careem in the Middle East and — most recently — Taxify, which covers Europe and Africa. In the case of Australia, Didi will come up against both Uber and Ola, with the India firm currently present in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney via an expansion made earlier this year. Uber vs Didi is to be expected — that’s a complicated relationship — but in taking on Ola (so soon after it came to Australia), Didi is competing directly with a company that it funded via an investment deal for the first time. That might be a small insight into Didi’s relationship with Ola. Unlike Grab, which has seen Didi follow-on its investments, the Chinese firm sat out Ola’s most recent fundraising last year despite making an investment in the company back in 2015. Ola declined to comment. Didi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its new rivalry with Ola Down Under. The move into Australia comes at a time when Didi is under intense pressure following the death of a passenger uses its ‘Hitch’ service last month. The company suspended the Hitch service — which allows groups people who are headed in the same direction together — and removed a number of features while limiting its operations to day-time only. This week, it said it would resume night-time rides but only for drivers picking up passengers of the sex.","Didi Chuxing, China’s dominant ride-hailing company, is continuing its international expansion after it announced plans to launch in Australia this month.

Erica Klarreich,"""Nadie te quita lo bailado.” (No one can take from you what you’ve danced.) For Federico Ardila, this Latin American expression epitomizes his approach to life and mathematics. It’s the driving force behind the parties he DJs in venues across the San Francisco Bay Area, where people dance till morning to the beats of his native Colombia. The dance floor is a place “where you have your freedom and you have your power, and nobody can take that away from you,” Ardila said. Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. He taught the expression to his students at San Francisco State University, where he is a math professor, after giving them a punishingly hard exam. San Francisco State has a highly diverse student body, and Ardila, who just turned 40, is a prominent voice in the mathematics community about how to make students from underrepresented groups— such as women and people of color—feel that they belong. But on this occasion, as he looked around at his students’ demoralized faces, he knew he had missed the mark. “Nadie te quita lo bailado,” Ardila told his students. “I think that’s a very powerful message—that nobody can take away from you the joy that you’ve had doing mathematics,” he told Quanta Magazine in an interview last month. “And people can give you grades, but that’s not going to take away the freedom that you felt and the fulfillment that you felt.” The expression also applies to Ardila’s research, though not always in ways he would have chosen. Four years ago in Portland, Oregon, a thief smashed his car window and made off with a backpack containing, as luck would have it, five years’ worth of work—all of Ardila’s notes from a sweeping new paper he was developing. Proofs, examples, counterexamples and conjectures were all gone. But the thief couldn’t steal the mathematics Ardila had “danced” in his mind. Over the past few years, Ardila and his coauthor, Marcelo Aguiar of Cornell University, have painstakingly reconstructed their work unifying the geometric and algebraic sides of combinatorics—the study of discrete structures like a social network, a sudoku puzzle, or a phylogenetic tree. They finally posted their 113-page paper online in September, and in January Ardila will be presenting their work in an invited address at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, the biggest annual math conference in the United States. Quanta spoke with Ardila at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, where he is visiting for the fall semester, about the mathematics he has danced and taught. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Your mathematical talent was identified quite early—in fourth grade, you got the highest score in your age group in a national math competition in Colombia. It was actually my sister, Natalia, who first showed great promise in mathematics. I was just the little brother. She and my cousin Ana María, they both performed really, really well in this national math competition. And I think the organizers probably said, “OK, these two women are very good, and then here’s the little brother who’s coming along to the awards ceremony. Maybe he’s OK also.” I feel like from a young age, they were paying attention to me. I never enjoyed mathematics in school very much, but my experience through the Math Olympics was much more creative and much more playful. Federico Ardila as a child in Colombia with his mother, Amparo, and his sister, Natalia. And it turned out that it was, as many of these spaces are, a very male-dominated space, and eventually both my sister and my cousin felt uncomfortable with this space. I mean, they’re doing amazing things now; my cousin is an engineer and my sister is a music pedagogy professor. But I do think it’s kind of interesting—that was a space where I felt very comfortable and that felt very nurturing to me, and it didn’t feel so to other people. It was a space that was very “othering” for them. I think that’s always served to remind me of the role of a mathematician, of an educator, in curating the culture of a place. That’s why that’s been such a theme in my work. You’ve said that you were surprised to get into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where you did your undergraduate and doctoral studies. What’s the story there? I had never heard of MIT. And it hadn’t crossed my mind to study abroad. I was already enrolled in the local university. But my classmate told me MIT had awesome financial aid and said the math there was really good. I wanted to learn more math, so I decided to play along and apply. At that moment I was failing most of my classes in high school. It was not clear that I was going to graduate. I had a little bit of an attitude problem. I was very interested in a lot of things but I did not like being told, “Read this” or “Think this way.” I just kind of wanted to do things on my own terms. I was failing, I think, six out of eight subjects. Had I known what MIT was, I should have known not to apply. There is no way I should have applied with that kind of transcript. I like telling this story to my students because I think we often close doors to ourselves by thinking that we’re not eligible or that we’re not good enough. And especially if you’re somebody who feels “othered” in your discipline or who feels like you’re lacking confidence, it’s easy to close doors on yourself. There’s a lot of people in life who are ready to close doors for you, so you can’t do it for yourself. When you came to the United States, as an undergraduate at MIT, it was your turn to feel like the “other.” It’s not that anybody did anything to mistreat me or to doubt me or to explicitly make me feel unwelcome, but I definitely felt very different. I mean, my mathematical education was outstanding and I had fantastic access to professors and really interesting material, but I only realized in retrospect that I was extremely isolated. There’s a system in place that makes certain people comfortable and others uncomfortable, I think just by the nature of who’s in the space. And I say that without wanting to point fingers, because I think you can be critical about the spaces that “other” you, but you also have to be critical about the ways in which you “other” other people. I think because mathematics sees itself as very objective, we think we can just say, “Well, logically, this seems to make sense that we’re doing everything correctly.” I think sometimes we’re a little bit oblivious as to what is the culture of a place, or who feels welcome, or what are we doing to make them feel welcome? So when I try to create mathematical spaces, I try to be very mindful of letting people be their full human selves. And I hope that will give people more access to tools and opportunities. What are some of the ways you do that in your teaching? In a classroom I’m the professor, and so in some sense I’m the culture keeper. And one thing that I try to do—and it’s a little bit scary and it’s not easy—is to really try to shift the power dynamic and make sure that students feel like equally powerful contributors to the place. I try to create spaces where we’re kind of together constructing a mathematical reality. So, for example, I taught a combinatorics class, and in every single class every single student did something active and communicated their mathematical ideas to somebody else. The structure of the class was such that they couldn’t just sit there and be passive. I believe in the power of music, and so I got each one of them to play a song for the rest for us at the beginning of each class. At the beginning it felt like this wild experiment where I didn’t know what was going to happen, but I was really moved by their responses. Some of them would dedicate the song to their mom and talk about how whenever they’re studying math, they’re very aware that their mom worked incredibly hard to give them the opportunity to be the first ones in their family to go to college. Another student played this song in Arabic called “Freedom.” And she was talking about how in this day and age it’s very difficult for her to feel at home and welcome and free in this country, and how mathematics for her is a place where nobody can take her freedom away. That classroom felt like no other classroom that I’ve ever taught in. It was a very human experience, and it was one of the richest math classrooms that I’ve had. I think one worries when you do that, “Are you covering enough mathematics?” But when students are engaged so actively and when you really listen to their ideas, then magic happens that you couldn’t have done by preparing a class and just delivering it. Mathematics has this stereotype of being an emotionless subject, but you describe it in very emotional terms—for instance, in course curricula you promise your students a “joyful” experience. I think doing mathematics is tremendously emotional, and I think that anybody who does mathematics knows this. I just don’t think that we have the emotional awareness or vocabulary to talk about this as a community. But you walk around this building and people are making these discoveries, and there are so many emotions going on—a lot of frustration and a lot of joy. I think one thing that happens is we don’t acknowledge this as a culture—because mathematics is emotional in sometimes very difficult ways. It can really make you feel very bad about yourself sometimes. You can be pushing on something for six months and then have it collapse, and that hurts. I don’t think we talk about that hurt enough. And the joy of discovering something after six months of working on it is really deep. Your own research is in combinatorics. And the paper you’ll be presenting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings connects two different ways of understanding combinatorial structures, through the lenses of geometry and algebra. How do those two approaches work? When you look at the geometric side of things, suppose, for example, you want to study the permutations (the ways of rearranging a collection of objects). It’s pretty well known that if you have n objects, the number of ways of putting them in a row is n factorial (the product n ( n -1)( n -2)…1). So it’s not a very interesting problem to count how many ways there are. But what is their inherent structure? The three-dimensional permutahedron, a geometric depiction of the ways to rearrange the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Two permutations are connected by an edge if one can be transformed into the other by swapping two consecutive numbers. If you look at when two permutations are related to each other by just swapping two elements, then you start understanding not only how many there are but how are they related to each other. And then, when you say, “OK, let’s take all the permutations, and put an edge between two of them if they’re a swap away,” then you find that you get this beautiful shape that’s a polytope (a geometric object with flat sides). I think it’s completely surprising initially that the inherent relations between permutations are captured in this beautiful polytope called a permutahedron. So all of a sudden you have this geometric model, and you can use tools from polytope theory to try to say new things about permutations. And that polytope has existed for a long time and is very well understood. And then you can also think of permutations algebraically—there’s a natural sort of “multiplication” on permutations, in which the product of two permutations is the permutation you get by doing one permutation after the other. This is one of the most important objects in algebra, this group of permutations. There are these two traditions, to take combinatorial objects and either make them geometric or make them algebraic. This project with Marcelo Aguiar was about trying to bring together these two points of view, and in fact we discovered that polytopes like the permutahedra have an additional related algebraic structure. I think we found a really beautiful connection between the geometric and the algebraic structure of combinatorial objects. We got a dozen results just from building this architecture and then reaping the benefits. For many, though by no means all, mathematicians, teaching takes a back seat to research. But for you, it seems that teaching and research are very much intertwined. You often give your students open-ended problems, and you’ve co-authored many papers with students. I love working with students. And I love sharing the joy of discovery with them. Most of my students are master’s and undergrad students, because San Francisco State doesn’t have a PhD program. I think that has steered my research to things that are more immediately accessible. But still, I need the questions to be very deep. I’m very excited about my research. I think I’m doing the most interesting research of my life right now. People tell you at 40 you start declining, and I feel like I’m getting good now. Federico Ardila DJing at the 2017 Life Is Living Festival in Oakland. Almost a decade ago you founded a DJ collective based in Oakland. How does that tie into your work as a mathematician and teacher? When I DJ I’m really looking for joy, and I’m looking to create an atmosphere where people can build bridges and connect. My professor side comes out a little bit, because I play a lot of stuff that people don’t know, and I try to play music from many places that they haven’t thought about. I also see music as a tool for social change. Some of the events I do are social benefits—it’s about music, but it’s also about feeding the soul and getting ready for the change that you want to make in the world. It feels very similar to the kind of atmosphere that I try to create in a classroom. I see all of these things as being connected.

Simplemost,"This was the young royal's first time wearing pants in public. WPA Pool/Getty Images Move over, Lady Gaga. There's a new fashion icon who is pushing the envelope when it comes to style... and he is just 4 years old. We are talking about Prince George, of course! The pint-sized prince has been in the public eye since the day he was born, and as such, his fashion has always been closely scrutinized. No wonder his rule-breaking outfit at the royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry is garnering so much attention. So what fashion crime did the little one commit? He wore pants! Yes, this scandalous moment is making headlines across the UK and beyond. But why? The little royal is usually seen wearing shorts. Chris Jackson/Getty Images According to British aristocratic tradition, boys never wear long pants until they are 7 or 8 years old. Instead, young boys only wear shorts (also known as short pants or short trousers). As etiquette expert William Hanson explained to Vanity Fair, ""Trousers are for older boys and men, whereas shorts on younger boys are one of the silent class markers that we have in England. Although times are (slowly) changing, a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class — quite suburban."" Hence, to dress the young prince in pants instead of trousers when he is only 4 years old (5 years old in July) is quite avant-garde. Although the outfit may have appeared serious and dapper (he wore a mini version of the frockcoat worn by his dad and uncle, complete with a matching red braid down the leg), it definitely caused a few gasps among those in the sartorial know. But he stepped out in pants for the special occasion. WPA Pool/Getty Images This begs the question: Now that Prince George has gotten a taste for long trousers, will he be willing to go back to short pants? Dressing a 4-year-old is never an easy task, but when it comes to dressing them according to royal aristocratic standards... eek! Good luck with that, Kate and William.

Susan Crawford,"For the past six months, life has been miserable for my dry cleaner. A small business in Greenwich Village, Jerri's (""Cleaning the Village Since 1964!"") has relied on Verizon’s DSL internet access for years. DSL is our era's version of dialup. It's excruciatingly low-capacity: Dialup works by dividing frequencies over a copper phone line, making it slow to transmit information. Because of problems with the wiring running to the building, Jerri’s internet access has been sporadic—often making it impossible to access customer accounts. New York was supposed to be a model for how the modern city could launch high-speed internet for its residents. When the Bloomberg mayoral administration re-signed an agreement with Verizon in 2008, it required that the company wire all residential buildings with its fiber service, FiOS. The agreement was heralded by the press as a way of triggering competition— the presence of Verizon’s fiber product would end the local monopoly of Time Warner Cable, now Spectrum, which provides internet access over a different, lower-capacity wire called hybrid fiber-coaxial. Cable internet access dominates most cities, but it often loses market share to more reasonably priced fiber offerings. The city believed that the new agreement would bring great changes: Every residence could choose between fiber and cable. Verizon, for its part, promised it would finish the job by the end of 2014, and said the presence of its fiber network would cut prices, “promote innovation, and improve the quality of service provided to the people of the City.” That hasn’t happened. Even in the capital of American commerce, competitive options frequently aren't available. Jerri’s is just a single business, but its struggles show the dreadful state of high speed internet access in New York City. The trouble is that New York’s government holds legal power over residential cable television service, not business service. And the agreement left plenty of loopholes for Verizon. At the beginning of last year, Verizon said that FiOS was ""available"" to ""nearly seven million homes and businesses in greater New York City."" But Verizon can pick and choose which businesses are eligible for FiOS, which means that mom and pop outfits, like Jerri’s, can get left out. It's impossible to say how common this problem is across the city; Verizon makes nothing public. A 2015 city audit showed that at least a quarter of the city's residential blocks had no FiOS service. About a third of Bronx residents and more than 60 percent of New Yorkers without a high school education don't have a wire at home. According to the city, one in five New Yorkers doesn't have internet access at home, and the figure rises to one in three for people living under the poverty line. Spectrum's services may be ""available"" to all of those residences, but the prices charged for this utility service are effectively unaffordable to many New Yorkers. Now the City of New York has sued Verizon over the company's failure to wire all of the city's residential buildings with FiOS. Verizon claims that the franchise agreement simply requires it to bring fiber to an intersection near a particular address, rather than to a midpoint on the block where that address is found. The company points to building owners as major obstacles—claiming that the city has failed to help it get its services into buildings. New York City's connectivity woes hold a lesson for other municipalities. But New York City's connectivity woes hold a lesson for other municipalities: Cities need to build or oversee their own ""dark"" (passive) fiber networks to ensure that everyone gets world class, inexpensive data access. (New York City has asked for good ideas aimed at improving universal high speed internet access, and this should be one of those being considered.) Where cities control the blank street grid of fiber reaching every building, they can force competition, low prices, and sterling customer service into the marketplace. Otherwise, your businesses, as well as your residents, will be gasping for air. New York City could be in a very different position today if those Bloomberg officials had called for a city-overseen fiber network. The creation of a neutral, unlit ""last mile"" network that reaches every building in the city, like a street grid, would have allowed the city to ensure fiber access to everyone. It could have been a money-making enterprise: The city might have leased access to that network to a host of competing retail providers, as San Francisco is considering. That would have spurred competition and lower prices for all of the nearly one million businesses in New York City, not just the one-off shiny Silicon Alley virtual reality incubators on which Verizon's press releases are currently focused. Every business needs the opportunities made possible by great, symmetric, inexpensive internet access. When cities don't exercise control or oversight over basic infrastructure like roads, bridges, electricity, or, now, fiber access, they can get stuck with whatever services the private market decides to provide. That has grave consequences. It makes little sense for multiple companies to incur the high upfront costs of installing wires to particular addresses, so markets will inevitably be divided between local monopolies. And companies will pick the most lucrative areas to serve and will leave out poorer households or smaller businesses. Cities end up with high-priced, noncompetitive services that are great for the companies selling them, but not great for public values and overall economic growth. It’s not that Verizon isn’t capable of building such a grid. Times are good for the telecom giant. The Trump administration's tax cuts have lowered its tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which will increase the company's free cash flow for 2018 by $3.5 billion—to $4 billion. That's a stupendous amount of money. Verizon has magnanimously announced it will hand 50 shares of its stock (total value as of February 1: about $2,700) to each of its full-time employees, a gesture similar to John D. Rockefeller's tradition of tossing dimes over the side of his touring car to waiting crowds. Verizon is free, of course, to use its tax windfall however it chooses; the company is likely to pay down debt, buy back its shares to increase their value, and shore up its dividends. Or maybe buy some other company. But the company is under no obligation to use its riches to improve its service—and that’s a problem. The better way forward, by far, is for cities to incur the upfront burden of building infrastructure that allows wholesale fiber reaches every address, and then leasing that access to a host of competitors. Result: inexpensive, world-class data services for everyone. In the end, Jerri's story shows that dense city blocks face the same challenges as rural areas: Under Verizon’s care, we are all being taken to the cleaners.

After checking out all of the private cabin's features, Neistat called it the ""all-time greatest airplane seat."" However, Macheras, who has experienced the first class offerings from the likes of Emirates, Etihad, and Cathay Pacific, said there were a number of things about Singapore Airlines' new private suite that make it the ""hands down winner."" Here are the six reasons Singapore Airlines wins, according to Macheras. 1. The bed and seat are separate The core reason Singapore Airlines' A380 first class cabin is ""miles ahead of Emirates'"" is its concept, Macheras said. ""These days 99% of business class cabins feature a big seat that reclines into a fully flat bed — it's so common nowadays — but this suite has a seat and a bed,"" he explained. Alex Machers 2. It's more spacious than a 'central London apartment' The second reason is the space, he said. ""When we talk about spacious cabins in first class, it's usually about how much movement you have in your seat. ""With Emirates first class, it's a small area that is taken up pretty much by the seat, so you can just stand on the spot, but in the Singapore suite there was space to walk around. I'm known for my pacing on the phone — in fact I'm doing it right now — and I found myself pacing during the flight at 43,000 feet."" ""People have tweeted me saying it looks bigger than their central London apartment,"" he added. Alex Macheras 3. It has an understated, elegant style ""With all these airlines offering beds in their first class cabins, they have to differentiate themselves from competitors through the small details and quirks,"" Macheras said. ""Emirates is known for its glitziness and sparkly gold products, whereas Singapore is understated and elegant. It's low-lit like a boutique hotel, which appeals to many more people than the wild lights show of Emirates."" 4. The amenity kits are luxurious Luxury French brand Lalique has designed the new amenity kits as well as the pajamas and bedding for the first class suites. ""The new amenity kits were another thing that impressed me,"" Macheras said. ""But this isn’t just a plush blanket, it’s white crisp Lalique bedsheets that you might expect in a hotel room. The amenity kits are packed with Lalique fragrances, creams, balms, moisturisers, and even a scented candle. 5. The seat has a 'swivel' mechanism so you can face the window Alex Macheras The plush armchair featured in the Singapore Airlines' suite has an electronic swivel mechanism that means you can face any direction you want. ""What's the bonus in having this function? It's something I hadn't considered before I took this flight, but when you fly as much as I do, you've often seen all of the movies on offer,"" he said. Being able to reposition your seat means that you can soak up the views while aboard, he explained. ""When we flew over the Middle East it was 6 p.m. on the ground and the sun was setting and I caught this impressive sunset with so many different tones of orange,"" he said. ""I could just relax and watch it with my headphones in, without getting neck ache."" It also just so happened to be the peak of the Geminid meteor shower while he was on the flight, so while flying over Iran the aircraft was surrounded by shooting stars. ""In the space of about four minutes, I saw about 10 shooting stars,"" he said. 6. There's a 32-inch flat screen TV ""Finally, there's a 32-inch flat screen mounted on the wall of the suite, which is controlled by the tablet and can move left or right — it's like being in someone's living room.""

Devin Coldewey,"The home of the future, we are assured, will be swarming with tiny sensors: security cameras, carbon monoxide detectors, speakers, and everything else. Few need to be running all the time — but how do you wake them up when they’re needed if they’re off in the first place? Ultrasound. That’s the idea being pursued by Angad Rekhi and Amin Arbabian at Stanford, anyway. Their approach to the problem of devices that can’t stay on, yet can’t be all the way off, is to minimize the amount of energy necessary to send and receive a “wake” signal. That way the internet of things really only consumes power when they’re actively in use. Radio, which of course all these tiny sensors use to transmit and receive information, is actually pretty expensive in terms of power and space. Keeping the antenna and signal processor ready and listening uses more energy than these devices have to spare if they’re to last for years on a charge. Ultrasonic sensors, on the other hand, are incredibly power-efficient and require very little space. Ultrasound — soundwaves above the human range of hearing, 22KHz or so — is a much more physical phenomenon, and detecting it is easier in many ways than detecting radio frequency waves. It’s a bit like the difference between a sensor that’s sensitive to nearly intangible x-rays versus one that detects ordinary visible light. Rekhi (left) and Arbabian looking natural in the lab. Rekhi, a grad student in electrical engineering working under Arbabian, describes their approach in a paper just presented at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. It’s a simple idea in a way — a small switch that hits a bigger switch — but the results are impressive. The system’s ultrasound receiver is efficient even for an efficient class of sensors; the tiny, super-sensitive microphone was developed at Stanford as well, by the Khuri-Yakub Group. The receiver is always on, but draws an amazingly small 4 nanowatts of power, and is sensitive enough to detect a signal with a single nanowatt’s strength. That puts it well ahead of most radio receivers in terms of power consumption and sensitivity. There’s one from a study last year that has it beat on both… but it’s also more than 50 times bigger. The ultrasonic sensor only takes up 14.5 square millimeters to the radio chip’s 900. That’s valuable real estate on an embedded device. You wouldn’t be able to activate it from across town, of course — ultrasonic signals don’t travel through walls. But they do bounce around them, and the wake-up system’s sensitivity means even the smallest fragment of an ultrasonic signal will be sufficient to activate it. It’s just a prototype right now, but don’t be surprised if this sort of mega-efficient tech gets snatched up or duplicated by companies trying to squeeze every ounce of life out of a watt-hour.

BeauHD,"Today, with an update to watchOS, Apple is making its electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) reading feature available to Apple Watch Series 4 owners. It's also releasing an irregular rate notification feature that will be available on Apple Watches going back to Series 1. Both are a part of watchOS 5.1.2. To take an EKG, you open up the EKG app on the Watch and lightly rest your index finger on the crown for 30 seconds. The Watch then acts like a single-lead EKG to read your heart rhythm and record it into the Health app on your phone. From there, you can create a PDF report to send to your doctor. The irregular heart rate monitoring is passive. Apple says that it checks your rhythm every two hours or so (depending on whether you're stationary or not), and if there are five consecutive readings that seem abnormal, it will alert you and suggest you reach out to a doctor. If you have been previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, Apple's setup process tells you not to use the feature. Apple tells me these features are most definitely not diagnostic tools. In fact, before you can activate either of them, you will need to page through several screens of information that try to put their use into context and warn you to contact your doctor if needed. They are also not the sort of features Apple expects users to really use on a regular basis. The EKG feature, in particular, should only really be used if you feel something abnormal going on, and then you should only share the resulting report with your doctor, not act on it directly.","An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Today, with an update to watchOS, Apple is making its electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) reading feature available to Apple Watch Series 4 owners.

Brian Pascus,"In an effort to increase customer comfort and get a leg up on the competition, Delta Air Lines recently renovated all of the seats within its fleet of Boeing 777-200s. On Monday, Delta announced a ""full fleet interior renovation"" that has made the width of its economy class seats 18.5 inches. For comparison, American Airlines and United Airlines seats are 17 inches wide. ""The upgraded 777 design is part of Delta's multi-billion dollar investment in the overall customer experience,"" the airline said in a statement on its media website. The biggest change for travelers is in economy class (known as Main Cabin extra). Fliers in those seats now have more room to spread their legs. Previously, Delta used an industry standard 3-3-3 seat arrangement for economy class — that being three seats at the left window, four in the middle, three at the right window. Delta's new Main Cconfigurationation will feature nine seats across — three in each section, nine total — rather than the standard 10 across issued by American Airlines and United Airlines. ""The comfort of our customers—across all cabins—is a top priority,"" Delta spokesperson, Savannah Huddleston, said in a statement to Business Insider on Thursday. ""That's why we've committed to remain at 9-abreast seating in the Main Cabin as we modify our 777s, versus the new norm of 10 across. With 9-abreat, we're able to offer wider Main Cabin seats - the widest of our international fleet - and more preferable seat options."" The wider seats come with a personal power outlet for passengers and an 11-inch TV screen for them to watch movies or shows. This sounds pretty impressive, especially when considering earlier this year American Airlines announced it will be eliminating screens on the back of seats in its 737s. Another cool improvement is Delta's premium economy section, called Premium Select. This smaller section of the plane has only eight seats across (structured in a 2-4-2 format) to ensure greater legroom and more space for passengers to move around the cabin. Finally, Delta's first class cabin (known as ""Delta One Suites""), now has sliding door accesses to a private cove filled with entertainment options, a personal table, and a 24-inch wide reclining seat. According to Forbes, the newly renovated Delta 777-200 will have 296 total seats: 220 seats in Main Cabin, 48 in Premium Select, and a precious 28 in Delta One Suites.

Jess Joho,"Well, every Black Mirror viewer knew it’d only be a matter of time before we started ranking social class using people’s Uber ratings, or wasting our lives in a VR game, or uploading our digital selves to the toilet — or whatever. But actually, one Black Mirror prediction just became vividly real at CES. And it's more horrifying than all of those combined. Pizza Hut took to Twitter to unveil the state-of-the-art tech that will revolutionize the way the company inserts its cheese-covered cardboard circles into your mouth hole. Its driverless pizza delivery vehicle, the e-Palette developed by Toyota, works eerily similar to the fictional one seen in Black Mirror 's ""Crocodile"" episode. The Netflix show's Twitter account had the perfect response, too, which basically amounted to, ""We tried to warn you, sheeple."" Autonomous pizza delivery! I mean just imagine: Soon you'll be able to get all the nutritional value of ketchup sauce flatbread, only without the hassle of minimal human interaction. It's like Seamless, but for people who find even the very concept of a person being in proximity to their delivery food distasteful. Eagle-eyed viewers might've also caught on that the show's fast food chain, Fences Pizza, was a recurring easter egg throughout Season 4, appearing in ""USS Callister"" as well as ""Crocodile."" Actually, Fences Pizza was a major plot point of ""Crocodile,"" when one of its driverless trucks hits a pedestrian, leading plucky insurance investigator Shazia Akmand on a journey to get to the bottom of the victim's claim. (Spoiler alert: Shazia winds up biting off a bit more than she can chew lolz.) SEE ALSO: 'Black Mirror' doesn't understand dating apps So there you have it folks. According to Pizza Hut's CES announcement, we've got about two years to prepare for our automated pizza delivery truck dystopian future. Because if Black Mirror taught us anything, it's that this will immediately lead to robot pizza car overlords murdering everyone in the streets. Or, worse still, will trap us all in lengthy insurance claim battles. Or even more nightmarish: They'll force feed us Pizza Hut's (at best) semi-edible pies until we die, or turn into the doughy humans seen floating around space in Wall-E. **shudders** No thank you. Give me at least half-decent pizza, or give me death. But now that our worst Black Mirror predictions are coming true, we'll also likely be quick to lose all ability to connect and interact with one another and the natural world around us.

Ryan Pickrell,"With a renewed focus on great power competition, the US military has been showcasing its power in the South China Sea through carrier exercises and bomber overflights. The US Navy's Ronald Regan Strike Group and Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force's Escort Flotilla 4 Battle Group conducted joint military exercises in the hotly-contested South China Sea Friday, the US Navy reported in an official press statement. The Ronald Reagan Strike Group ship's aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan conduct an exercise with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force ships Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Erwin Jacob V. Miciano/U.S. Navy/Handout The drills were a part of a rare tour of the disputed waterway by Japan's Kaga helicopter carrier, classified as a destroyer, and two guided-missile destroyers — the Inazuma and the Suzutsuki. The Japanese naval force teamed up with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, the guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam, and the guided-missile destroyer USS Milius for bilateral training. The US and Japanese ships practiced formation sailing and maneuvering. ""Training with Escort Flotilla 4 was a fantastic opportunity to bring together our strike group with the JMSDF battle group and further the interoperability we have been building for years between our forces,"" Rear Adm.

Following reports indicating that China deployed jamming technology, anti-ship cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and even heavy bombers to its outposts in the South China Sea, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis accused China of ""intimidation and coercion."" In the past week, the US sent B-52H Stratofortress heavy long-range bombers tearing through the tense South China Sea twice in support of US Indo-Pacific Command's Continuous Bomber Presence mission, which is focused on bolstering America's deterrence capabilities.

WINNIE HU,"“It’s not fair, it’s not equitable,” she said. “All kids should have access to all the schools — and not because you live in a certain neighborhood and your parents have access to certain resources.” At the request of parents and local elected officials, the city education department spent $150,000 to hire an urban planning firm, WXY Studio, to lead a community process to come up with a way to integrate the middle schools. Hundreds of parents and educators have worked collaboratively over the past year — largely avoiding the drama of District 3 — on a plan that will be presented this summer. In District 3, a battle erupted two years ago when school zones were redrawn to reduce crowding and increase diversity at elementary schools. One of the schools involved was Public School 199, a high-performing elementary school on the Upper West Side where parents hire tutors to ensure their children excel on state tests, and where the angry meeting caught on video took place. The district’s middle-school effort has drawn a variety of criticisms from parents. Some say it is unfair, since there are not enough seats for all the qualified applicants at the top schools, and that it could lower the quality of education. Others say it doesn’t do enough to help lower-performing middle schools. Robin Aronow, a school consultant, said that she had received a flood of calls from parents who are anxious about the plan and are considering applying to private schools in addition to public schools. City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, a Democrat from the Upper West Side, said the goal should be to increase the academic and economic diversity in every school, though she also understood the concerns raised by some white, middle-class parents. “This is about, ‘I don’t want to lose a spot for my kid,’” she said. Under the plan that was initially unveiled, every District 3 school would offer 10 percent of its sixth-grade seats to students who average a 1 on state tests — the lowest grade on a 1-to-4 scale — and another 15 percent to those who average a 2. For the current school year, only 11 percent of Booker T. Washington’s 299 admission offers went to these students.","At the Booker T.

MIKE McINTIRE and BEN PROTESS,"She cautioned against the attitude that heavy drinking is no big deal and that boys will be boys. Excessive drinking is closely tied to incidents of sexual assault, she said, and thats why theres so much concern about college drinking. She noted that she was not commenting on any accusations against Judge Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaughs own comments over the years leave little doubt that heavy drinking was a feature of his youth. On his high school yearbook page from 1983, he labeled himself the Keg City Club treasurer, noting 100 Kegs or Bust, and the biggest contributor to Beach Week Ralph Club, apparently a reference to throwing up. In a 2014 speech to Yale Law students (a transcript of which was posted on Twitter by a Washington Post reporter), Judge Kavanaugh spoke fondly of two episodes during his time at the law school that involved heavy drinking. In one, he said, he organized a bus trip for a baseball game and night of barhopping in Boston, during which students did group chugs from a beer keg only for us to return falling out of the bus onto the front steps of Yale Law School at about 4:45 a.m. Another time, he said, he was at a class banquet during his final year, where he had more than a few beers beforehand, and a drunk friend fell and broke a table before getting up and being refused any more drinks by the bartender. I actually still possess a photo of him sprawled on the floor on top of the table, Judge Kavanaugh said. While an undergrad at Yale, Judge Kavanaugh joined two organizations with reputations for hard partying. One was Delta Kappa Epsilon, a fraternity that several former Yale students described as a magnet for hard-drinking athletes who liked to party and pull pranks. DKE members marched around campus with womens underwear hanging from poles, and would print T-shirts for a drinking competition called Tang that featured beer- and sex-inspired witticisms, according to the Yale student newspaper. Judge Kavanaugh also joined Truth and Courage, a secret society for seniors known largely as a drinking club. Some fraternity brothers said they never saw Judge Kavanaugh drinking to excess in college. Chris Munnelly, a software executive in Scottdale, Ariz., who was a freshman when Judge Kavanaugh was a senior, said, He was not a big drinker from my interactions with him.","The allegations of sexual misconduct by Judge Brett M.

Sam Machkovech,"Enlarge / Treyarch's David Vonderhaar (left) and Dan Bunting speak at the CoDBLOPS4 reveal event. reader comments 0 LOS ANGELES—""Treyarch has never shied away from breaking away from convention."" With those words, studio chairman Mark Lamia kicked off a Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 reveal event full of noisy videos and noisier boasts, but the studio didn't have a ton to show for its ambitious words. The speech failed to reveal any revolutionary or paradigm-shifting content—like real-gameplay proof of advances in the series' ""Zombies"" mode or any footage of how its upcoming battle royale twists will ""spin [the genre] on its head."" (The event also, if you missed it, confirmed a Call of Duty first: no single-player campaign.) For now, the most optimism we can muster about Black Ops 4 comes from an hour-long team-combat session that followed the presser. The short takeaway from our world-premiere hands-on is that Activision has gotten some Overwatch in its CoD—and the results feel smoother (and, honestly, more conventional) in action than you might think. Heroes never die I went hands-on with three team-combat modes on PlayStation 4 that are expected to ship in the final version: Domination, Control, and Hardpoint. Each five-on-five match took place on a different, new map and allowed players to flex the series' new-feature muscles. All three modes revolved around point-capture mechanics. Domination (capture and maintain three points) returns from prior entries in the series, while Hardpoint mixes that idea up with a single capture point that's constantly moving around the map. With Control, Treyarch and Activision liberally borrow from Overwatch 's mode of the same name. In BLOPS4 's version, teams alternate between capturing or defending two pre-defined points on the map, though teams can also lose a round by running out of limited respawns. The first team to three rounds wins a Control match. CoDBLOPS4 will ship with at least eight new heroes—er, sorry, I mean ""classes""—that just so happen to be defined by specific avatars and special time-charged abilities. But they're not heroes. They're classes. The classes each got kiosks at the reveal event space. Seraph's outfit and cyborg arm. Crash's... bead necklace? Before getting into any combat, however, I had to pick a ""class,"" as shown in the above cardboard card. (These abilities are subject to change before the final game launches.) Though this choice determines how your soldier looks in action, it otherwise only fills in two slots of your soldier's loadout: a grenade-button ability (which takes a decent amount of time to recharge depending on its power) and an ""ultimate"" power (which takes so long to recharge that you'll likely only use it twice per standard match). Yes, this seems Overwatch -y as heck, but it's really not that heavy a change. Basically, the new set-up adds two more choices to your standard ""loadout"" of perks, bonuses, weapon attachments, and ""kill streak"" options. Like in older CoD games, the non-class portions of your loadout fill up 10 ""card"" slots on your ""custom soldier"" page, so you can opt to fill a single weapon with tons of perks or leave a weapon less modified in order to equip more boosts to elements like armor or radar. The class-specific ultimate abilities, honestly, find the right balance between feeling enthrallingly charged-up and still somehow military-appropriate. After my PlayStation 4 tests, I played another long match on PC and was not surprised to find the game ran smoothly and controlled well on keyboard-and-mouse at 60 frames per second. Sadly, Activision didn't have 120Hz or 144Hz monitors on hand to show off BLOPS4 's support for uncapped frame rates, and the engine team did not have its HDR post-processing pipeline enabled just yet. (Widescreen and multi-monitor support is also confirmed for PC BLOPS4.) One Treyarch developer on hand said work began in 2016 on building HDR-specific, on-the-fly modifications to visuals, and we look forward to hearing more about those on both console and PC. One class can slam down a high-tech shield to plant yourself in front of a control objective; another can pull out a limited-time grenade launcher with five cluster-explosion rounds; and still another can send a healing wave to nearby allies. Think of these as kill-streak-caliber abilities that even your worst teammates (the ones who never rack up enough enough UAV-enabling points) can eventually access in the heat of battle. They're infrequent, they spice up beat-by-beat gunplay, and they don't otherwise interrupt the tight, close-corridors combat that CoD has refined for so many years. Those class-specific ""grenade"" abilities vary widely, as well, and they open up combat possibilities that resemble some of Lawbreakers ' most creative twists. One class gets a grappling-hook ability, which can grab onto distant walls and speed you all the way down a giant hallway (which I found was awesome to use while assaulting the back half of a control point). Another lays down a barbed-wire trap that feels inefficient at first but ultimately proved useful in both attack and defend modes, once I got the hang of a particular map. You can latch onto more traditional grenade-and-blasting classes, obviously, but hats off to Treyarch for splitting its classes between traditional and strategic flavors. And a new stimpack—is it enough? Our demo hall inside of a private aircraft hangar. (We had to crop out any image of the game itself.) PlayStation 4 controls. Each class's ""specialist weapon,"" which takes longest to recharge, is activated with L1 and R1 simultaneously. Default PC control mapping. An arguably bigger mechanical change comes from a new, dedicated button, assigned to L1/LB on console gamepads: a stimpack. The run-away-and-heal archetype established so many years ago by Halo is now toast. In its place is the ability to fully recover your health whenever you want, with two exceptions. First, you have to get through a stimpack-injection animation, which means you cannot shoot or reload a gun while recovering (and you can also get shot to death before sticking the needle in). Second, once you've used the stimpack, you have to wait for your next dose to regenerate before you can heal again. I loved the beat-by-beat choices the stimpack system forced me to make inside of precarious map choke points. It's a pretty loud example of how the Black Ops fork can shine by weaving a mix of familiar, accurate, and unrealistic elements into each successive entry. (I also liked what seemed like a slight boost to health per respawn, but with only four matches under my belt, making a call about that kind of in-game math is hard to do.) This praise comes with a big catch: we've more-or-less played this Call of Duty before. Five-on-five combat. Flat, cramped maps with a twisting, snaky slew of run-and-turn options. An immediate range of solid, math-balanced guns that let virtual soldiers find their favorite balance of accurate, quick-shooting, and ammo-eating firepower. Hero classes, health-system tweaks, and even a new fun ""shoot a gun while swimming"" option are a welcome coat of frosting on top of BLOPS4 's cupcakes. But if you'll forgive my continuing this metaphor, I went hands-on with conventional gameplay cupcakes—the kinds you might find at a grocery store. I didn't really doubt that BLOPS4 could nail five-on-five combat once more. But it's curious that this big reveal event included zero gameplay from this sequel's zombies or battle royale modes. Since BLOPS4 has chosen to punt any scripted single-player content (and since Treyarch representatives are now describing zombies as the sequel's primary ""narrative"" experience), those other modes' depth and variety will need to pick up the slack to convince fans to spend no less than $60 (or likely more, depending on whatever season pass or microtransaction plans are eventually announced).","Treyarch still knows its five-on-five combat, adds smart tweaks.

Christopher Woody,"With more Chinese submarines roaming the Pacific and the Trump administration pushing US-made hardware, Japan is putting into play a new piece of gear that may give its subs an edge at sea and keep its defense firms afloat. On October 4 in the city of Kobe, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launched the Soryu-class diesel-electric attack sub Oryu, the 11th sub in the class and the first to be equipped with lithium-ion batteries. The Oryu has a number of upgrades over previous Soryu-class boats, which are the biggest diesel-electric subs in the world, but the biggest change is the batteries. The JSMDF submarine Oryu at its launch on October 4, 2018. JMSDF/Twitter Diesel-electric subs use power from their diesel engines to charge their batteries, which they switch to during operations or in combat situations in order to run quietly and avoid detection. The lithium-ion batteries in the Oryu — which store about double the power of the lead-acid batteries they replace — extend the range and time the sub can spend underwater considerably. Mitsubishi turned to Kyoto-based firm GS Yuasa to produce the new batteries. The latter company said in February 2017 that Japan would be the first country in the world to equip diesel-electric attack subs with lithium-ion batteries, putting them on the final two boats in the Soryu class: the Oryu, designated SS 511, and its successor, designated SS 512. Japanese officials at the launch of the JSMDF submarine Oryu, October 4, 2018. JMSDF/Twitter Previous Soryu-class subs used two Kawasaki diesel generators and two Kawasaki air-independent propulsion engines. (AIP allows nonnuclear subs to operate without access to atmospheric oxygen, replacing or augmenting diesel-electric systems.) Both platforms have a top speed of 12 knots, or about 14 mph, on the surface and of 20 knots, or 23 mph, while submerged, according to Jane's. Soryu-class subs are outfitted with six tubes in their bow that can fire Japan's Type 89 heavyweight torpedo. They can also fire UGM-84C Harpoon medium-range anti-ship missiles against targets on the surface. Construction started on the 275-foot-long Oryu — which displaces 2,950 metric tons on the surface and 4,100 metric tons underwater — in March 2015. It's expected to enter service with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force in March 2020. JMSDF sub Wakashio surfaces off Sagami Bay, south of Tokyo, October. 14, 2012. AP Photo/Itsuo Inouye The Oryu's launch comes as Japan's military and defense industry face pressure from two vastly different sources. The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more US military hardware, which Trump sees as a way to cut the trade imbalance between the two countries. Japan, which has tried hard to court Trump, has beefed up its purchases of US-made gear. Tokyo spent about $3.5 billion through the US's Foreign Military Sales program in the most recent fiscal year, after never spending more than about $880 million a year through fiscal year 2011, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Those acquisitions have helped Japan get sophisticated US hardware but have been of little benefit for Japan's defense industry, which has struggled to export its own wares. Additional purchases from the US are likely to leave Japanese firms with fewer orders. Facing pressure from US military imports and with Chinese and South Korean firms gaining an edge in commercial shipbuilding, subs are the only outlet left for Japanese heavy industry, which has specialized technology and strong shipbuilding infrastructure, according to Nikkei. A Chinese Shang-class (Type 093) nuclear-powered attack sub in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku Islands, January 2018. Japanese Ministry of Defense The Oryu also launches amid rising tensions in the East and South China Seas, where a number of countries have challenged Beijing's expansive claims and aggressive behavior. China has put "" growing emphasis on the maritime domain,"" the Pentagon said earlier this year. Beijing can now deploy 56 subs — 47 of which are believed to be diesel or diesel-electric attack boats. That force is only expected to grow. While those subs need to surface periodically, they can still operate quietly and strike with long-range anti-ship missiles — capabilities that likely weigh on the minds of US and Japanese policymakers. Of particular concern for Tokyo is Chinese submarine activity in the East China Sea, around the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which Japan controls but China claims. In January, a Chinese Shang-class nuclear-powered attack sub was detected in the contiguous zone around the islands — the first confirmed identification of a Chinese sub in that area. The presence of a concealed sub was seen by Japan as a much more serious threat than the presence of surface ships, and Tokyo lodged a protest with China. Japan is using its own subs to challenge Beijing. In September, JMSDF Oyashio-class attack sub Kuroshiro joined other Japanese warships for exercises in the South China Sea — the first time a Japanese sub had done drills there, the Defense Ministry said. The drills, done away from islands that China has built military outposts on, involved the Japanese sub trying to evade detection.","Japan launched its latest Soryu-class diesel-electric attack sub this month, the Oryu.

Sam Machkovech,"Enlarge / Much like this space-defense mission, EA's launch plans for the Star Wars: Battlefront II economy seem to be blowing up. reader comments 9 Before we deliver a proper verdict for Star Wars: Battlefront II, we want to take a moment to talk about the game's troubling, multilayered economy. The online multiplayer shooter is now officially available for paying EA Access subscribers, which offers a 10-hour trial of the game ahead of its November 16 launch on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Fans are already biting into that game-economy burrito, and it sure seems like a seven-layer thing, made up of loot boxes, battle points, credits, crystals, crafting parts, and star cards (which themselves come in two types and four tiers). The whole thing already looks confusing and messy, and fans have pointed out major issues with how the economy debuted in the game's paid EA Access launch this weekend. EA has since responded to fans' most heated complaints, both in ridiculous and seemingly sensible ways. But even EA's best response belies a glaring truth: nothing short of a full rewrite will undo the damage of real money to Battlefront II 's gameplay mechanics. Cards, tiers, credits, boxes, crafting parts... Before we get to the rage and EA's public response, let's start by making sense of this game's economy. Sit in a comfortable chair and maybe make a nice cup of tea or coffee. This will take a minute. Pretty much every major online shooter from the past decade has tried to keep players hooked with some sort of ""progression"" system. This practice was arguably popularized in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, which rewarded players with new gameplay options the more (and better) they played. BFII has a few progression systems, and the first comes in the form of Star Cards. 35 selectable classes in all, broken down between basic troopers, vehicles, and ""hero""-class characters and ships. Each class gets three unique abilities, which can be altered by......Star Cards! Use these to either enable a bonus or to replace one of your three unique abilities. Here, we replace one unique ability for another. Here, we simply boost an existing stat. This isn't unlocked yet. Unlocking isn't enough; you can also craft your way to bumping it from tier-1 to tier-4, and you can see how much better it gets with each tier in that ""blast radius"" count in gray text. Yoda has only unlocked one Star Card at this point, and it's a tier-one Star Card. That means his Star Card level is... 1. The math of how Star Card levels are accumulated is explained below. It's weird. The idea: every character, ship, ""hero,"" and machine in the game—35 in all—has three card slots, and players can slap bonuses into each slot so long as they unlock specific Star Cards for that specific unit. Want your assault-class soldier to enjoy reduced recharge times for special abilities or swap out its default grenade for a grenade launcher? Should you get the corresponding card, you can slap that bonus into one of the unit's open slots. (If you get more Star Cards, you can freely switch them around; they aren't permanently spent.) How do you get Star Cards? The most direct way is to use a particular character or class until you complete a milestone. Kill 50 enemies using grenades, for example, and you'll receive a ""thermal detonator crate."" This path requires being particularly good with a certain character or maneuver, however, and if you find any requirement difficult, or just plain annoying, Battlefront II offers the alternate, roundabout path of loot boxes (which the game calls ""crates""). BFII 's loot boxes contain a variety of contents (including other currencies) and can be purchased in multiple ways. You can purchase loot boxes with ""credits,"" which are primarily earned by playing the game but are also given out if a loot box contains a duplicate card. (This, of course, is in place of EA and DICE simply prohibiting duplicate items from appearing.) You can also purchase loot boxes with ""crystals,"" which can only be purchased with real-world money. You'll find the following inside of BFII 's loot boxes: Star Cards, those Star Cards' higher ""tier"" upgrades, credits, ""crafting parts,"" weapons, outfits, emotes, and victory poses. The first time I logged in to the game, I was greeted with a ""Founder's Crate."" It contained the following: two cosmetic items, one tier-3 Star Card (which is pretty high), and some credits to be spent on... more loot crates. Or unlocking pricey heroes. A few days later, I was greeted with this surprise collection of unlocks, as my review copy apparently came with a bunch of loot boxes. And these loot boxes were waaaay better than any I'd bought with credits. Since I unlocked a bunch of tier-4 cards here, that means I got a few classes up to the Star Card level of 5 or more, which unlocked a second Star Card slot. That makes a big difference in terms of mathematical bonuses to gameplay. I could also just buy a bunch of loot boxes with real money to get those Star Card levels up for so many of the game's classes. By the way: instead of waiting for your dream Star Card's base version or ""tier"" upgrade to appear, you can spend the aforementioned crafting parts—which are either awarded via select milestones or given out in loot boxes—to make and upgrade exactly what you want. This partially addresses a major loot box issue of making players rely on random chance to get major in-game options. However, crafting parts are slow to earn, both in loot boxes and via milestones, and they can't be used to unlock other parts of the game. To unlock new weapons for each class, you must either complete specific milestones or hope the weapons appear in loot crates. For specific, high-level heroes, like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, you can only get them by spending credits, not with crystals or crafting parts. Again, you can either earn credits slowly in the course of normal play, or buy so many loot crates with cash that more credits appear in place of duplicate Star Cards. Buying your way to instant power Are you still with me? Rather than narrow all of this down to a single currency or unlock model, EA has already created this bonkers schism of multiple currencies and progressions and what each can and cannot do. It only gets worse from here. Look at how much better that regeneration stat gets as you crank up this Star Card's tier. Having more slots just makes you more powerful, period. And those tier-4 Star Cards only compound the sheer strength you can reach very quickly by simply buying a ton of loot boxes with real cash. Again, you can slot up to three Star Cards on a particular class, but you only get one Star Card slot per class at the outset. To attach more Star Cards to a class, you have to unlock and craft cards to reach a high enough ""card level"" for each class. Each Star Card counts as a card level point; each card's tier adds another point. So, three tier-1 cards and a tier-3 card count as six points... so long as all of those cards are for the same class. You'll need five points per class to unlock your second card slot and another five points per class for its third card slot. You'll receive roughly 4.5 cards per loot box, by the way, and not all of these will be Star Cards, since they're sometimes full of credits, crafting parts, outfits, and other cosmetics. If you pre-order the game or buy a ""starter"" card pack, you can expect some card packs at the outset, but this is still quite the grind to get all three slots unlocked, let alone pack them with valuable, higher-tier cards. The performance divide between ""only one low-tier Star Card"" and ""three souped-up Star Cards"" can be substantial. Star Cards let you do things like speed up health recovery, reduce damage taken, increase damage output, and upgrade special abilities. Plus, each card can be enhanced by jumping up to a new ""tier"" (represented by blue, green, and purple colors, à la World Of WarCraft item ranks). You can either luck into higher tiers via loot box earnings or craft them with those crafting parts, which exist primarily in loot boxes. There is one incredibly fast way to rack up Star Cards, bump their tiers, and get that all-important number-of-slots upgrade for the class you love, and it's by paying out for loot boxes. Enlarge / Look at all those savings if you're an EA Access member, though! They're practically giving crystals away. The first problem with this whole system is that it affords more performance bonuses to anybody who either spends time or money. Compare that to series like Call of Duty or Battlefield. In those games, more experienced players can unlock a variety of weapons, items, and perks, but generally, they add gameplay styles, not mathematical advantages. But every single Star Card and every bump in a Star Card's tier only adds boosts to each class' default loadout, with only a few of these fairer, ""mathematically equivalent"" unlockables. So long as BFII 's starting players all suffer with fewer slots and lower-tier cards—and so long as many of the most noticeable boosts can be paid for with nary a minute of gameplay—the performance divide is spoiled. Let's add another complication. Just like in 2015's Star Wars: Battlefront, you can use in-match ""battle points"" (BP) to get access to a high-level hero. During a match, you earn BP by killing foes, completing objectives, and doing other mode-specific tasks. These BP must be spent by the end of the match, and you spend them to respawn as a recognizable, super-powered hero—like, say, Darth Maul or Yoda—for one life. However, some of the most recognizable and powerful ""hero"" characters, like Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Leia Organa, and Luke Skywalker, cannot be accessed at all without permanently spending a lot of the game's ""credits"" currency. The game's original ask for Luke and Vader was shelf-clearingly insane: 60,000 credits each. One Reddit user's analysis estimated nearly 40 hours of standard gameplay to earn that many credits—and that count includes milestone-related credits and choosing not to spend credits on loot boxes. Grinding players with Vader on their mind can't even dip their toes into that all-important Star Card system. Should you opt to spend your credits on loot boxes instead of higher-level heroes, by the way, you may very well earn Star Cards for those locked-up heroes, and you can't trade those cards in for other currencies. They'll just be sitting there, taunting you until you pay up for the heroes in question. (You cannot unlock these high-credit heroes themselves with random loot box Star Cards.) Way to bring “armchair” back EA responded in a few ways, and the first was mind-bogglingly out of touch: a response from a DICE developer on Sunday that simply read, ""The armchair developers on the Internet."" The offending tweet has since been deleted, but Reddit's major BFII community now includes a ""flair"" option that reads ""armchair developer."" It's already proving pretty popular. One fan in particular outed himself as a developer and developed an auto-playing script as both an eff-you to the line and a commentary on EA's design decision. The company's longer response on the aforementioned Reddit thread was quite possibly more alarming. After mentioning a goal of adjusting and fine-tuning currency and economy counts based on how the community plays the game, an EA representative added, ""The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes."" The community almost immediately jumped down EA's throats for this line, and not only by downvoting the comment into negative-number oblivion. One angry fan bemoaned the insane imbalance between saving credits to spend on a single, popular character and spending them on seemingly required loot boxes. After describing the amount of time he already has to devote to real-life obligations like work and family, he said, ""I shouldn't require a sense of pride and accomplishment to play as a hallmark character in my favorite franchise."" Another commenter cut right through some currency confusion to make a point: ""This is a joke, right? You have the same currency tied to unlocking crates as you do to unlocking heroes."" One day later, EA announced a ""credit price"" drop for its biggest heroes, particularly Vader and Luke, who each dropped to 15,000 in-game credits. The company did not address whether the average credit-climb would go any faster, however, which may mean they each now require approximately 10 hours of gameplay to unlock. Which, for primary heroes already on the disc and expected by fans, is quite a bit of time to devote solely to those unlocks and not to any other seemingly necessary consumables like loot boxes. I previously pointed to a change that came as a result of the game's beta-test period. The game's highest-tier Star Cards can no longer be randomly gained in loot boxes, and they aren't available for crafting until a player reaches a certain experience level. What I have since realized is that this change isn't enough. It doesn't take much play to reach the corresponding level, and even before that point, you can still buy your way to a suite of powerful tier-three bonuses. Can we flatten? Enlarge / We'll have more on the game's polish and battling in a review. So far, it's running mostly silky smooth on Xbox One X in near-4K resolution. What, really, can EA and DICE do at this point? It's hard to say. I feel more confused, not less, having typed this entire explanation out, and I don't look at the progress I've made thus far in the game's EA Access period with any sense of pride or accomplishment. I just have a scant number of Star Cards unlocked, spread fruitlessly along a ton of classes, along with an uneasy feeling that choosing to buy loot boxes means I'm down a bunch of valuable credits, and thus, another few hours away from getting to play as Luke Skywalker. The only exception is the tier-3 and tier-4 stuff I've unlocked... which I got because my copy of the game included pre-order and special-edition codes. These popped up with zero play with the classes and heroes in question. Without upending the entire game, the first solution, as far as I'm concerned, is a flattening of the Star Cards' impact. At the moment players boot the game, give them all three Star Card slots for every class, along with a pre-determined Tier-4 Star Card to slap into each of them. This way, like in every other shooter game that doesn't suck, players all start at nearly the top of the mathematical possibilities, and they can dig further to earn, customize, and tweak their favorite classes' and heroes' loadouts. More importantly, this entire tier system, which rewards true mathematical bonuses either for playing or for paying, is a hot, wet fart of an idea and should go right into the toilet. From there, EA could flatten the currencies so that players earn and spend one thing for every aspect of the game. If you want to nickel and dime players over a long span of time, don't split up their purchase potential. This is a well-known trick to get players stuck on the bean-counting half of a free-to-play game. We don't pay $60 to walk into that mess. I'm not against having extra hero characters be unlocked by an in-game progression system, and flattening currencies would help with this issue. Fighting games like Street Fighter V and Killer Instinct have experimented with added characters that can either be bought or earned, and so long as the path toward each end of the unlock spectrum is made clear, that's acceptable. You're either paying with money or with keeping the game's servers populated, which are both valuable for an online game. But as other, bigger Star Wars nerds have already pointed out, charging full retail price for a ""classic, all-universes"" Star Wars battling game and then putting the series' most beloved characters behind a confusing paywall is the Darkest of Dark Side moves. Assuming EA does not take my sage advice in redeeming BFII 's economy, this will likely serve as another example of a publisher trying to convince fans that paying $60 for a game isn't enough. Rather than demand up-front price increases or subscription fees, however, EA seems committed to squeezing a few more bucks out of players in unsavory ways: mixed currencies and dopamine-filled, random-item loot boxes. But EA has an uphill battle to climb in terms of convincing anybody that these economies, should they not be flattened to an acceptable degree, are worth anybody's money. Ideally, by paying more than $60 per copy, we're puffing up a game's lifespan. That's money that can go into, say, more levels, characters, and modes. After all, unlike the last Battlefield game, there will be no season pass charge to divide the playerbase (which is one reason that game's primary servers quickly turned into ghost towns). But what's the guarantee that BFII really lives all that long or delivers so much content? We're only two years out from the last Battlefield entry. It's hard to believe that BFII won't see a successor perfectly timed for the launch of Star Wars Episode IX or, heck, a next-gen gaming console. We also have to trust EA and DICE's word about responding to player feedback and keeping fans busy with fresh content that's worthy of further dives into various economies, both paid and earned. That's a word that we're already unsure of thanks to this week's total misunderstanding of what gamers and series fans are mad about. There may be a fun and polished game in here, but right now, it sure seems to be breathing heavily through an unattractive, black mask.",Rant: Loot boxes are just the beginning of EA's worst-ever dive into pay-to-win.,2017-11-14T14:10:19Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Can EA fix what’s broken with Star Wars: Battlefront II’s economy?,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/can-ea-fix-whats-broken-with-star-wars-battlefront-iis-economy/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/STAR-WARS™-Battlefront™-II-16-760x380.png,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-4,1
"A.E. Dwyer on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Chicken stew on toast, however delicious, lacks sophistication. Now pour that stew into an elegant edible vessel? Thrilling. Crisp. Like a golden chalice of cream sauce. Now thats downright ladylike. The good news is even if youre not feeling particularly ladylike, this dish is scrumptious to all manner of persons. Meet Chicken à la Kinga dish so old, its new again.
According to The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, Chicken à la King was not made for royalty, but rather the lunch set of Philadelphias fashionable Bellevue Hotel in the early 1900s. William King, a cook at the hotel, created the version that became his namesake, a dish that included truffle, red and green peppers. It was particularly appealing to the ladies who frequented the tea room, seen as a dainty dish that didnt require a knife to eat. Little did they know it contained about as many calories as a large cheeseburger.
My great-grandmother was a renowned family cook, who had attended The Antoinette Pope School of Fancy Cookery in Chicago. (Fun fact: Pope only charged 75 cents per class when she opened in 1930.) My great-grandmothers chicken creaming skills filtered down through her culinary education to my grandmothers dinner plate. And it stuck. After some tweaks, Chicken à la King became the default fancy dish made for Dwyer-family wedding buffets, elegant lunches, even the occasional Easter.
This recipe call for puff pastry shells, a nod to French pastry vol-au-vent: whisper-thin pastry cases used to contain rich bites of meats and creamed things. To me, they are a requirement to enjoying Chicken à la King, at least the first time around. The second day (when youre out of shells) youre allowed to go for a thick slice of toasted white bread. As kids, we would watch in awe as the pastry shellsor nests as they were marketed to usemerged from the oven, tall, golden and flaky. My sister and I managed to denude nest after nest of their small golden hats before we got caught.
The appearance of Chicken à la King is important: tender white meat chicken, silky white sauce, bright accent vegetables. No unsightly brown and grey bits of dark meat, nor even black pepper flakes, are allowed to besmirch the creamy whiteness. If you have it and you like it, use white pepper. Green peas add a fresh, sweet snap and pimentos add a subtle piquancy to the sauce. Drain those suckers wellwe dont want a pink tinted final dish, please.
Poaching in broth infused with carrot, celery, onion, peppercorn and thyme saves the chicken breast from being dry and flavorless. Bonus: Youll end up with tasty leftover stock, which can be chilled and frozen for soupy emergencies. 
Thickening with egg yolks became outmoded, when eggs were deemed pariahs for selfishly inflicting their cholesterol on our unwitting population. Now that yolks are cool again, I say bring them back as a thickener. Ill take my Vitamin D, lipids, and choline from yolks over canned soup goo any day.
So go ahead and make a fancy lunch for your friends. Make them my Chicken à la King, and put your best chicken foot forward.
1 package of Puff Pastry Shells (6 count), baked according to package instructions
For the chicken and poaching liquid:
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 bouillon cube or 4 cups chicken broth
1 small stalk celery, chopped in large chunks
1 small carrot, chopped in large chunks
1 wedge of onion, skinned
A few peppercorns or grinds of fresh pepper
A few thyme sprigs
Salt to taste
For the cream sauce:
1 stick of butter
1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 cup whole or 2-percent milk
2 1/2 cups of reserved chicken poaching liquid
2 small jars of pimentos (2 oz. each), well drained
1 cup of frozen peas
2 egg yolks
1/2 cup heavy cream
Salt to taste
Ground white pepper (optional)
Bring four cups of broth (or water with chicken bouillon cube added) to a simmer in a wide shallow pot with the lid. Add celery, carrots, onion, salt, pepper, and thyme and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and reduce heat to very low. After 15 minutes, check to see if chicken is cooked through, and remove the breasts from the broth. Continue cooking for another five minutes if chicken is not quite done yet.
Strain the broth and set aside 2 1/2 cups for your cream sauce. Discard the solids. 
Melt one stick of butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, then whisk in flour. Whisk thoroughly to combine, then let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes, whisking occasionally. Pour in milk and broth, and whisk to incorporate, making sure to whisk in any flour from the sides of the pan. Let cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened. Reduced the heat to keep the mixture warm.
In a bowl, combine the egg yolks and heavy cream, then slowly stir in 1/3 cup of the hot milk-broth mixture, mixing well. Pour this mixture back into your pot with the broth and whisk quickly to combine. This step will prevent the yolks from curdling. 
Cube your cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Add chicken, pimentos, and peas to the broth mixture and stir, letting everything warm through. Taste and season with salt, adding a pinch of ground white pepper if desired.

THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,"Trump has no answer for that. He doesn’t believe the climate science that NASA is telling him is true. He is trying to bring back coal precisely when wind, solar and efficiency are becoming cheaper, cleaner, healthier alternatives — precisely when four of the five biggest wind states are red states and precisely when China has committed itself to owning the clean power and electric car markets of the future! He’s trying to force the U.S. auto industry to bring back gas guzzlers when the last time we did that — from the 1980s to the 2000s — Japan and Korea bankrupted Detroit and we enriched petro-dictators from Venezuela to Russia to the Arab world to Iran. Trump is the president who’s throwing away our umbrella right before the storm. Sure, Trump will sneer that “green” is girlyman, uneconomic, unpatriotic and vaguely French. But Democrats can easily counter that green is globally strategic, locally profitable and working class — green is the new red, white and blue. That message can play today in Rust Belt battleground states like Michigan and Ohio. One recent clean energy industry study found that 714,257 people in 12 Midwestern states work in renewable energy generation, clean transmission, energy efficiency, clean fuels and advanced transportation. Some 108,000 in Ohio alone do, compared with 38,000 in the coal, oil and gas fields. The Democratic message could start with some simple math: There are currently 7.6 billion people on the planet, and in 2030 there will be 8.6 billion — another one billion in just over a decade! If even half of them get cars, have air-conditioners and eat high-protein diets like Americans now do, we will devour and burn up the planet beyond recognition. So what does that mean? It means clean energy and efficiency have to be the next great global industry or we’re going to be a bad biological experiment, whether there is climate change or not. Does anyone — other than Trump — believe that America can continue to dominate the world economy and not lead the next great global industry, but leave that to China? The Democratic strategy should be built around putting together the performance standards, research and carbon pricing to achieve what Energy Innovation C.E.O. Hal Harvey calls “the four zeros.” These are, Harvey explains: 1. “A zero-carbon grid. Right now, Republican states like Texas and Wyoming dominate the U.S. wind industry and are reaping most of the jobs and environmental benefits. That should go national. 2. Zero-emission vehicles. When you combine a zero-carbon grid with electric vehicles, bingo, you have zero-carbon transportation. 3. Zero-net energy buildings. What if you could build a well-insulated home, put today’s inexpensive solar panels on the roof and, over the course of a year, produce as much energy as you consume? Fantastical? No. It’s now the law in Santa Monica, and getting most of the way there is already feasible — and cost-effective — throughout the country. 4. Zero-waste manufacturing. New techniques in manufacturing, such as 3-D printing or advanced chemistry, can slash waste — and waste is a tax on both the budget and the earth.” Now that’s a platform worth running on, and it’s one that can do what Democrats need most: make them the party of strengthening the working class and American security. Clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing and efficient buildings make everything we want to achieve in our society easier. They can lower our health care costs, lower heating bills for the poor, drive 21st-century innovation, foster decent jobs, mitigate climate change, create more competitive export industries, weaken petro-dictators — and enhance U.S. national security and moral leadership. Let Trump fight that idea. If Mother Nature keeps on this destructive track into 2020, well, Trump’s favorite mantra about strong women, “lock her up,” will look awfully silly.

Julia Horowitz,"In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, the tribe alleged that Wells Fargo -- the only national bank that services its territory -- preyed on people by opening unauthorized bank accounts and debit cards, and by pressuring people, particularly the elderly, to enroll in services they did not need. ""Under intense pressure from superiors to grow sales figures, Wells Fargo employees lied to Navajo consumers, telling elderly Navajo citizens who did not speak English that in order to have their checks cashed, they needed to sign up for savings accounts they neither needed nor understood,"" the Navajo Nation said in its complaint. Representatives of Wells Fargo ( WFC ) ""stalked local events like basketball games and flea markets"" to sign up as many customers as possible for ""unnecessary accounts,"" the complaint continued. The ""unlawful sales practices"" are said to have been employed between 2009 and 2016. Related: Trump vows to punish Wells Fargo for 'bad acts' The Navajo Nation spans Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Wells Fargo has five branches across the Navajo Nation and is its ""predominant provider of banking services,"" according to court documents. Wells Fargo, in a statement, said it couldn't comment on details regarding pending litigation. ""At Wells Fargo, we are focused on rebuilding trust and building a better bank. Over the past year we have taken significant steps to make things right for our customers, including members of the Navajo Nation, who may have been affected by unacceptable retail sales practices,"" the company said. Wells Fargo's aggressive sales practices first attracted scrutiny in September 2016, when the bank said it had fired 5,300 workers for creating fake accounts. In August, Wells Fargo said it had uncovered a total of up to 3.5 million potentially fake bank and credit card accounts. As a result, Wells Fargo has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars. The company agreed to a $142 million national class action settlement, as well as millions of dollars in refunds for affected customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also levied a $185 million fine. Still, new scandals keep emerging. Wells Fargo has admitted that some mortgage borrowers were charged inappropriate fees, while other customers were charged for auto insurance they didn't need. The company is also accused of overcharging small businesses on credit card fees, and of signing up customers in California for insurance policies they didn't want.

Steve Dent,"Fujifilm X-H1 Fujifilm's $1,900 X-H1, announced just last month, is a big leap over the X-T2, especially when it comes to video. It's Fujifilm's first camera with 5-axis in-body stabilization and can shoot photos at 14fps and handle true DCI 4K video (4,096 x 2,160). It has a brand-new, class-leading 3.69-million-dot EVF, excellent handling, thanks to dual dials and a chunky new grip, and a ""near-silent"" shutter mode. As for drawbacks, it lacks the 10-bit, 4:2:2 video of the like-priced GH5, and is a lot heavier than Sony's A6500. If that's too much : For a bit less, the $1,600, 24.3-megapixel X-T2 is essentially the predecessor to the X-H1 and offers similar performance and excellent handling, but no image stabilization. Panasonic GH5 I liked the $2,500 GH5s a lot, but as a video-specific camera, it's hard to recommend it to photographers. The $2,000 GH5, however, does both things well for less money. You can shoot DCI 4K video (and even 6K anamorphic) with 10 bits (billions) of colors and a 4:2:2 gamut, the best specs for a consumer camera. And with a 20.1-megapixel sensor and 12fps shooting speed, it won't limit photographers, either. As for shortcomings, the GH5 has mediocre contrast-detection autofocus and a smallish Micro Four Thirds sensor. If that's too much : The $1,700, 20.3-megapixel G9 is now Panasonic's flagship photography camera, offering 20fps shooting with continuous autofocus, 5-axis stabilization and, of course, 4K video -- without the GH5's 10-bit color and HDR. DSLRs Nikon D850 The $3,300 D850 is Nikon's first full-frame 4K camera, but it was worth the wait. With a 45.7-megapixel sensor, it's among the highest-resolution DSLRs on the market, bested only by Canon's 50.6-megapixel, $3,500 5Ds models. That gives the D850 unsurpassed image quality, but you still get decent speed (7fps burst shooting) and an excellent phase-detect autofocus system. The main negatives of the D850 are mediocre 4K video quality, slow and indecisive contrast-detect autofocus in live and video mode and autofocus tracking that's a step below Nikon's (excellent) D5. If that's too much : Consider Nikon's D7500. For just $1,200, you get excellent image quality from the 20.6-megapixel, DX (APS-C) sensor, decent 8fps shooting speeds and 4K video (with a 1.5X crop of the already-cropped DX sensor). If you don't mind an older camera, Nikon's $1,800 D750 offers a full-frame sensor, fast shooting speeds and great autofocus for nearly half the price of the D850. Canon 5D Mark IV Having arrived in 2016, Canon's 5D Mark IV is due for a refresh, but it's still one of the top enthusiast DSLRs on the market. The 30.4-megapixel full-frame sensor with dual-pixel autofocus provides excellent quality for professional portrait or landscape work, and it performs well even at high ISOs. For video, you get 4K with autofocus tracking that's widely considered the best in the business. A big downside for video, however, is the 1.64x crop factor in 4K and lack of a flippable screen for vlogging. If that's too much : Canon's $1,200 80D offers excellent Dual Pixel autofocus for video and live view, 7fps shooting speeds and, for video shooters, microphone and headphone ports. Sony Alpha A99 II Yes, Sony does make a DSLR, albeit one with an SLT translucence mirror that doesn't flip out of the way when you shoot, as on Nikon or Canon DSLRs. The $3,200 A99 II 's hybrid-like nature gives it some incredible specs, like a 12 fps shooting speed with eye tracking -- not bad for a camera with 42.2 megapixels of resolution. You also get 5-axis image stabilization, DSLR-like handling and excellent-quality 4K video. On the downside, the autofocus system, especially the subject tracking, doesn't work so well for video, and because of the SLT mirror, the A99 II doesn't perform as well in low light as the A7R II and III models. If that's too much : Take a look at Sony's aging $1,200 A77 II APS-C SLT camera. It offers equally quick 12fps shooting speeds with 24.3 megapixels of resolution, in-body stabilization and an effective autofocus system. Compact cameras Fujifilm X-100F Fujifilm's compact, fixed-lens cameras have been popular since the original Finepix X100 launched nearly seven years ago. The latest model, the $1,300 X-100F, has refined the formula to a T. You get a 24.3-megapixel X-Trans CMOS III sensor (with no low-pass filter), an f/2.0 35mm (full-frame equivalent) lens, more ergonomic button layout and gorgeous looks. All of that comes in a pocketable size, making it an ideal street-photography or vacation camera. There's no 4K video, but it can handle 1080p 60fps shooting, and video is not really the point anyway. Sony RX10 Mark IV The 20.1-megapixel RX10 Mark IV with a Type 1 (1-inch) sensor is not pocketable and, at $1,700, ain't cheap either. But it's incredibly fast and versatile for a compact superzoom, with a 24–600mm (full-frame equivalent) f/2.4–f/4 lens and unbelievable 24fps RAW shooting speed. Naturally, it shoots 4K and slow-motion video at up to 960fps (912 x 308). If you can handle its large form factor and price, you'll be able to shoot both landscapes and the look on your kids' faces when they score a goal -- even if you're in the nosebleed section. Sony RX1R II For $3,200, the Sony RX1R II is clearly not for everyone. But it's the only compact camera on the market with a full-frame sensor (other than the 24-megapixel, $4,000 Leica Q), and it packs an incredible 42.4 megapixels of resolution. With a 35mm f/2.0 Zeiss lens, retractable 2.4-million-dot OLED viewfinder and 102,400 max ISO, this is aimed at street photographers. As such, unlike with other Sony compacts, you don't get 4K video, and will have to settle for 1080p at 60fps. Wrap-up Enthusiast cameras do offer it all, but in different doses, depending on what you want. More so than any category, pure photographers might want to focus on DSLRs, while videographers will probably run toward mirrorless cameras. Specs aside, for either category, you'll want to choose a system with autofocus that works best for your needs. Considering the money you'll be spending, it might be best to rent or borrow a camera before buying to ensure that it does what you need.","When photography or filmmaking becomes a consuming passion or a career rather than a hobby, you might look longingly at fancier equipment.

Jake Holmes,"It's already been four years since Mercedes-AMG started producing its GT sports car, and this week the company kicked off production of the refreshed 2020 model, the company announced Thursday. As before, the Mercedes-AMG GT is built at the automaker's factory in Sindelfingen, Germany.
A freshly built AMG GT R Pro.
Mercedes-Benz
While every version of the AMG GT line has been updated for 2020, perhaps the most exciting addition is the new GT R Pro. It builds on the standard, 577-horsepower GT R with revised suspension, retuned engine and transmission mounts, lightweight wheels and, of course, a unique wrap with loud racing stripes.
The remainder of the 2020 Mercedes-AMG GT coupe and Roadster line gets a handful of visual and equipment tweaks. For starters, there are new headlights with redesigned LED running lights, as well as a new rear bumper, new steering wheels and new wheel designs. A 12.3-inch color instrument cluster now comes standard, as do front and rear parking cameras.
As to performance, the AMG GT line now adopts the AMG Dynamic Select system, with Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport Plus, Race and Individual driving modes. On top of that, it adds the AMG Dynamics traction-control system, which features Basic, Advanced and Pro modes -- and the GT C and GT R even add a ""Master"" mode.
For 2020, the AMG GT ditches its prior 515-hp ""S"" trim level and will be offered instead in three power levels. The standard AMG GT extracts 469 hp and 465 pound-feet of torque from its 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. That'll get the car to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and on to top speed of 189 mph. The AMG GT C bumps those output figures to 550 hp and 502 lb-ft, dropping the acceleration time to 3.6 seconds and boosting top speed to 196. Finally, the GT R and GT R Pro boast 577 hp, 516 lb-ft, a 3.5-second dash to 60 and a terminal velocity of 198 mph.
In addition to the two-door AMG GT models, the Sindelfingen plant builds the AMG GT 4-Door, the E-Class, the CLS-Class, the S-Class, the Mercedes-Maybach and the GLA-Class.",The entire lineup was updated for the 2020 model year.,2019-03-29T19:07:27Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Mercedes kicks off production of refreshed AMG GT in Germany - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2020-mercedes-amg-gt-production-start/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/0rKmJW7ontgneF-6r-svfYOlGhk=/2019/03/29/bf41f267-c6cd-45f9-ba70-cf826ed560e4/mercedes-amg-gt-r-pro-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,class-4,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Everyone from Margot Robbie to Mary J Blige gathered in Los Angeles on Monday for the traditional Oscars ""class photo"". This year's Academy Awards contenders rubbed shoulders at the annual nominees' luncheon, which took place four weeks before they will regroup for ceremony itself. While the catering team at the Academy are probably getting sick of the sight of Meryl Streep, we certainly aren't. And nor do we ever tire of the irregularities and intriguing outfits which are always provided by the class photo. Here are 11 things we spotted this year. (Fortunately, Vanity Fair's Photoshop editor wasn't there to help so this is one Hollywood photo where nobody was given an extra leg.) 1. Firstly, is that... a cardboard cut-out? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes, yes it is. At 89 years old, Agnes Varda has already become the oldest nominee in Oscars history. The Belgian-born director is nominated in the best documentary film category for Visages Villages [Faces Places]. Sadly, Agnes couldn't make it to the luncheon in person. So her co-director JR held up a cardboard cut-out of her instead. We don't know why nobody has thought of this before - just think of all the weddings she must get out of attending. (Actually, does anybody know where you order one of these?) 2. Hey look it's Mitzeee from Hollyoaks Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk We don't often use the words ""Hollyoaks"" and ""Oscars"" in the same sentence. But, there she is, third row from the front and fourth from the right: Rachel Shenton. The Silent Child, written by Shenton and directed by another former Hollyoaks actor, Chris Overton, is nominated for best live action short film. ""I don't class myself as a writer so I felt grossly underqualified doing this,"" she said last month. But she certainly isn't out of place in this year's class photo. 3. This chap has been going to the gym and he'd like you to know about it Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk ""Oh this? Oh it's just my bicep. I'd totally forgotten it was there! Goodness gracious, what am I like, eh?"" That's Dunkirk cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema in the back row. 4. Eric Fellner would make a poor spy Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk The co-chairman of Working Title films might have managed to stay behind the scenes as a producer of Victoria &amp; Abdul but had less success going undetected here, peering out from behind the giant statuette. Of course, he may have been placed there deliberately given his uncanny resemblance to Oscar himself. 5. Basketball injuries went unnoticed Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's Common in the back row, nominated for best original song alongside Diane Warren for Stand Up For Something from the film Marshall. The rapper was looking so dapper you probably wouldn't notice he was actually trying to hide a black eye. He wore a pair of glasses in the hope of trying to hide the bruise he sustained after a basketball mishap at the weekend. 6. Not everybody was successful in looking at the camera Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk There's always one. Or, in this case, two. We've all been Mudbound director Dee Rees at some point and managed to blink at the precise moment a photo is being taken. (Although in our case it only affects our 62 Instagram followers rather than the millions of people that will see an iconic and significant piece of film history.) Sam Rockwell did keep his eyes open, but smiling and looking at the camera proved too much. 7. People in Los Angeles really need to stop using Justin Timberlake's tailor Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk After last year's trouser-gate, we really thought 2018 would be different. Not only is Raphael Saadiq sporting a rather brave beige trousers/grey socks combo, but the tailor had clearly run out of fabric by the time the music producer got round to ordering an outfit. WHEN WILL THEY LEARN? *shakes fist* 8. It wasn't all grey Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk In a sea of dull suits and generic ties, a few brave souls stood out from the crowd with a splash of colour. We particularly salute make-up artist Daniel Phillips, Lady Bird star Saoirse Ronan and The Big Sick writer Emily V Gordon. We don't care if they don't win any actual trophies - they have already won this year's photo. 9. Quite a lot of men aren't there? Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Yes. 126 to be precise. With 46 women. (And one of them is a cardboard cut-out.) It's an issue Academy president John Bailey is aware of, making reference to the gender imbalance when he spoke at the luncheon. ""The Academy is at a crossroads of change,"" he said. ""We are witnessing this motion picture academy reinvent itself in front of our very eyes, and a greater awareness and responsibility in balancing gender, race, ethnicity, and religion."" 10. Kobe Bryant is sitting down Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk Which is a very sensible idea, given that he's six-and-a-half feet tall. Had he been allowed to stand up, he certainly would have obscured Breadwinner director Nora Twomey and make-up artist David Malinowski at the very least, who were right behind him. They probably could have sat him on the floor and he'd still tower over half the people there. 11. But which nominees are missing from this photo? Image copyright Getty / PA Well, Daniel Day-Lewis is absent, because of course he is. (Possibly because he was busy ordering a bigger trophy cabinet from Ikea.) He wasn't the only Phantom Thread star who didn't make it though - best supporting actress nominee Lesley Manville is nowhere to be seen either. Elsewhere, Christopher Plummer was also absent from the luncheon, although he could probably be edited in later. Denzel Washington and Woody Harrelson, nominated in the best actor and supporting actor categories respectively, also sent their apologies. Perhaps one of the most notable absentees is best actress favourite Frances McDormand, who's nominated for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Bonus: The 'alternative' picture Image copyright Todd Wawrychuk As is tradition, the photographer also took a ""fun"" version of the photo, where the nominees were encouraged to pull funny faces or different poses. Several just applauded, others put their thumbs up, but full marks go to Watu Wote: All of Us director Katja Benrath, in the front row, for the slightly-more-original rock on hand sign, and Dear Basketball animator Glen Keane for managing to obscure his own face with his arm while waving from the fifth row.

Dell Cameron,"Marriott, the worlds largest hotel chain operator, has been slapped with a class-action lawsuit over the data breach now said to affect upwards of 300 million people. The suit, brought by more than 150 past hotel guests, according to Vox, is at least the second to surface since the breach was disclosed in late November.
Filed in Maryland federal district court on January 9, the massive suit includes plaintiffs in dozens of states where it alleges laws were violated. It accused Marriott of involvement in deceptive, unconscionable, and substantially injurious practices. In addition to seeking compensatory damages and other forms of relief deemed appropriate by the court, the suit seeks an injunctive relief to prohibit Marriott from continuing to engage in unlawful acts, omissions, and practices...
The plaintiffs are represented by five law firms: DiCello Levitt &amp; Casey LLC; Hausfeld LLP; Cohen Milstein Sellers &amp; Toll PLLC; Cohen &amp; Gresser LLP; and Kramon &amp; Graham PA.
Gizmodo has reached out to Marriott for comment on the lawsuit and will update when we hear back.
In its most recent update on January 4, Marriott International said the personal information of fewer than 383 million former guests may have been accessed without authorization. The company has yet to provide any details regarding the cause of the breach, but it said roughly 345,000 unexpired payment cards stored in its database may also be compromised. The initial intrusion is said to date back to 2014.
The breach of Marriotts Starwood reservation system is one of the largest in recent history, potentially dwarfing the 2017 Equifax incident by more than a hundred million victims. The hotel chain operates over 6,700 properties in nearly 130 countries and territories, according to the company.
Marriotts disclosure, as is customary now after a breach of this magnitude, prompted renewed calls for Washington lawmakers to address the need for a national data privacy law, something Democrats have said is a top priority in 2019 following the partys takeover of the House of Representatives.
Marriott was previously sued in Maryland by a separate law firm, Morgan &amp; Morgan, in late November. John Yanchunis, an attorney for the firm, told Gizmodo it was both shocking and horrifying that it took years for the company to detect the breach.
Large, sophisticated companies like Marriott are not blind to the risks posed by cyber criminals, who are constantly attempting to infiltrate corporations that store sensitive consumer information, he said.","Marriott, the world’s largest hotel chain operator, has been slapped with a class-action lawsuit over the data breach now said to affect upwards of 300 million people.

MARC TRACY,"Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.
College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.
The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyers seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (only) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.
But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyones league.
Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.
Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last years runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Hermans.","Alabama can, in fact, get pummeled, Urban Meyer is not beyond judgment, and other valuable nuggets that will make the game different in the fall.",2019-01-11T18:40:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On College Football: What We Learned About College Football in the Past Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/sports/2018-college-football-season.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/sports/13oncollege1/merlin_148723005_9ea6bf1d-3d88-4c1b-9974-8eb6225b1b5f-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-4,1
Greg Rasa,"Here, now, is a legal defense that only makes sense if you are drunk in a bar instead of standing before... that other kind of bar: A San Antonio man sought to overturn his fourth conviction for driving while intoxicated by arguing that the legal limit of 0.08 percent blood-alcohol content discriminates against alcoholics. How's that? To elaborate: In hopes of overturning his four-year prison sentence, Ralph Alfred Friesenhahn argued that, because chronic alcoholics have a higher tolerance for alcohol, the 0.08 limit was basically child's play for them, and a ""protected class of alcoholics"" was being prosecuted without the state proving that they (he) had indeed lost any of their mental and physical faculties. In other words, it's the ""I'm fine!"" defense. Not surprisingly, Texas' 3rd Court of Appeals rejected this argument on Friday, pointing out that a standard that applies to everyone does not unfairly single out alcoholics. Plus, Friesenhahn failed to prove alcoholics are a protected class under the Americans with Disabilities Act. There is, of course, a bigger problem with Friesenhahn's argument. Let's play along and assume for a moment that his alcoholism does in fact equip him with a sort of superpower, and that he was in full command of his abilities at a blood-alcohol level of 0.08. Unfortunately for sake of his argument, Friesenhahn went way, way past 0.08: HIs 2016 arrest came after he rolled his car over on a country road and blew a 0.29, nearly four times the legal limit. The argument didn't work with the trial judge when Friesenhahn's attorney, Gina Jones of New Braunfels, tried using it to quash his felony indictment. And clearly, it didn't work on appeal, either. His previous DWI convictions were in 1985, 1990 and 1998. Based on those, his fourth case was a felony charge with prison time. Prosecutor Sammy McCrary called the argument ridiculous. ""You're not being punished for being an alcoholic. It's the driving that's the problem,"" McCrary said. ""It's making the decision to get into a 3,000-pound vehicle... after drinking.""

Bryan Menegus,"Amazon has finally confirmed that Long Island City, Queens, and the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, have both earned the dubious honor of hosting glorified branch offices for the e-commerce giant. Hiring is slated to begin next year. The Long Island City office is set to occupy 4 million square feet, with the option to expand to 8 million square feet in the future, and employ 25,000 Amazonians. According to the companys own estimation, New York State will pay $1.525 billion in performance-based incentives for the privilegenearly as much as Amazon has received across all prior subsidies combined, according to watchdog group Good Jobs First. Arlingtons footprint and workforce are predicted to be about the same, albeit the city is only on the hook for $573 million in incentives. Salaries are still expected to average around $150,000 annually, which is around double the median household income in New York Citya metropolitan area currently struggling with rising rents and failing infrastructure. These two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come. The team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities, Bezos is quoted as saying in his own Day One blog. Despite the massive year-long bake-off that preceded this announcement and mundane results, many are wondering if the requests for HQ2 bids werent a sly ploy to collect data on cities for other purposes. One such ancillary project was revealed by todays press release: a new base of operations for customer fulfillment, transportation, supply chain, and other similar activities expected to employ 5,000 Tennesseeans. Amazons maps for these three locations do not have street names included. The Long Island City headquarter appears to be on Vernon Boulevard between 45th Avenue and 45th Rd.; the Arlington headquarters looks to be on Jefferson Davis Highway near South Hayes Street; and the Nashville center correlates to the intersection of Church Street and 10th Ave. North.

"Steve Garrison steve.garrison@nwi.com, 219-853-2563","CROWN POINT — A man faces charges after his toddler daughter shot her pregnant mother with his gun Tuesday outside Plato's Closet in Merrillville, court documents state. Menzo M. Brazier, 21, of Michigan City, was charged Thursday in Lake Criminal Court with two counts each of criminal recklessness and neglect of a dependent. Police were dispatched about 3:38 p.m. Tuesday to Plato's Closet, 359 E. 81st Ave., for reports of a gunshot wound. Officers found Brazier at the store holding a blood-soaked towel against his pregnant girlfriend's chest, according to court records. The woman had a gunshot wound that entered the upper right side of her back and exited near her collar bone. The woman was transported to Methodist Hospitals Southlake Campus and then Loyola University Medical Center in Illinois, where she was treated in their intensive care unit, records state. She told police in a statement her 3-year-old daughter accidentally shot her with her boyfriend's gun. The father told police his girlfriend was sitting in their vehicle with their children, ages 3 and 1, while he was shopping for pants inside Plato's Closet. He said he did not want to bring his loaded 9 mm handgun into the store, so he put it between the front passenger seat and center compartment. He said he was inside shopping when someone entered the store and said a woman outside was bleeding. He went outside and found his wounded wife leaning against the side of their car. Brazier allegedly admitted the gun was loaded, but claimed a bullet was not chambered. He said he told his daughter not to touch his guns or knives, records state. Brazier was wanted by police on a warrant for failure to appear in Porter County Superior Court on traffic violations, records state. The defendant was arrested on the warrant. He remains held without bond at Lake County Jail, records state.

"Christine Burke on Offspring, shared by Christine Burke to Lifehacker","When I look back on my pictures from 7 th grade, I cringe. Not because my mouth is full of metal and my face is full of acne but because these days, I know just how much braces and orthodontic care cost. Sorry about that, Mom and Dad. It can come as a surprise to find out just how much it costs to replace that retainer that wound up in the cafeteria garbage can. As expected, both of my children needed orthodontic treatment thanks to their mothers genes. And, Ive learned a few tips and tricks along the way that will not only help your wallet but also your sanity. 1. Dont be afraid to shop around Orthodontic treatment is big business. In fact, statistics show that 4 million people in the U. S. wear braces, and about 75% of them are teens, which means you likely have several orthodontists in your area who will be happy to treat your kids dental needs. But, dont be afraid to shop around for the best deal. Most orthodontists offer free consultations, and visiting a few offices will give you a feel for the friendliness of the office staff, the cleanliness of the office and the capabilities of the orthodontist to improve your kids smile. You might be shocked at the differences in price, too. 2. Pick an office close to home One of the biggest surprises for me when it came to my kids having braces is just how much time I actually spend in the offices for appointments and repairs like snapped wires and broken brackets. My sons orthodontist is located in a quaint downtown area about 20 minutes from our home and about 30 minutes from his school. I quickly realized that a quick trip to have a bracket repaired could take upwards of almost an hour and a half with traffic, waiting room time and the repair. And, since kids usually need to be seen every 6-10 weeks for monitoring, you wind up spending a lot of time reading People magazine in the waiting room. If you choose an orthodontist thats close to home who fits your budget, you wont be sorry. Because brackets only seem to break when you are about to leave on vacation or on a Friday afternoon. 3. Ask about appointment availability before you sign the contract While we were satisfied with my sons orthodontic care, scheduling appointments was tricky as the orthodontist and his staff split their time between two offices during the week. Because the second office was almost an hour away, we were limited to being able to schedule appointments on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which sometimes threw a wrench into our chaotic life. Ask your prospective office manager about not only availability of appointments but also when they schedule the appointments during the day. My daughters orthodontist requires that certain procedures can only be done during the day, which means I have to take a day off from work and she has to miss school time. Knowing ahead of time that an orthodontist has weekend, evening and flexible scheduling hours should be a key factor in your decision process. 4. Determine whether traditional braces or tray systems are the best choice for your teen These days, braces have come a long way from the grey metal brackets we wore in the 80s. Nowadays, while the metal brackets are still available, teens also have the choice between ceramic (clear) brackets and tray systems. Because there are so many choices and options, its important to find an orthodontist who will be honest with you about what will be the best for your kid. If you have a teen who is forgetful, removable trays that he has to replace every two weeks might not be the best option. And, while those ceramic braces look good for class pictures and are less noticeable, theyll add several hundred dollars to your bottom line. 5. Ask About Retainers While Your Kids Teeth Are Still Crooked Braces are not cheap and investing in your kids smile is a major financial decision. Once their teeth are perfectly aligned, you are going to want them to stay that way. One of the mistakes I regret the most was not asking up front about the types of retainers orthodontists use post braces. My sons orthodontist firmly sticks with removable retainers, similar to the ones we all used as kids, which I found out when his braces were removed. Replacement retainers are not covered under our original contract and the cost is a staggering $250 to replace one. Further, his orthodontist suggests that he wear his retainers until hes 25, so means he has to keep track of his retainers for ten years, which seems impractical. My daughters orthodontist uses permanent retainers for both the top and bottom rows of teeth. To me, that feels like a better overall value for our money, and I wish I had known to factor the cost of my sons lost retainers into our budget. Of course, every childs orthodontic plan is different, but its best to know up front what to expect when youre about to grit your teeth and fork over major bank for your kids to have straight teeth.","When I look back on my pictures from 7 th grade, I cringe.

Harish Jonnalagadda,"Best overall Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 See at Flipkart The Redmi Note 4 is the phone to beat in the budget segment. It features a 5.5-inch Full HD display with 2.5D curved glass, a premium design with an all-metal chassis and contoured edges, and class-leading battery life. And with Xiaomi issuing a permanent price cut, the Redmi Note 4 is much more pocket-friendly. The variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage is now selling for ₹9,999, making it the best deal in the budget segment. If you need more memory and storage, Xiaomi is offering the model with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage for ₹11,999. The phone is now receiving the stable build of MIUI 9, which is based on Android 7.0 Nougat. If you're new to the MIUI ecosystem, there's plenty to look forward to: the custom ROM comes with a slew of useful features, and you can alter the look of the interface through a varied selection of themes from the store. The camera has received a sizeable upgrade as well, and it now takes great images in daylight conditions. Overall, you're getting a phone that offers an incredible amount of features for not a whole lot of money. Bottom line: A premium aluminum design, great battery life, decent camera, and attractive pricing make the Redmi Note 4 the standout device in this category. For its price, there really isn't another device that gives you more. One more thing: The Redmi Note 4 is available online and from thousands of retail stores across the country. Why the Redmi Note 4 is the best Xiaomi has figured out the formula to succeed in India's competitive budget segment: offer devices packed to the gills with features, and price them lower than the rest of the market. It's no wonder, then, that the Chinese manufacturer currently fields three of the best-selling phones in India in the Redmi Note 4, Redmi 4, and the Redmi 4A. The Redmi Note 4 is at the pinnacle of budget phones. You get a 5.5-inch Full HD IPS LCD display, Snapdragon 625 with eight Cortex A53 cores, a 13MP rear camera with PDAF and dual-tone LED flash, 5MP front camera, and a massive 4100mAh battery. The design is much more premium than its predecessor, and the camera is of a higher quality. You even get an IR blaster that lets you control appliances in your house. The Redmi Note 4 has a premium design and outstanding battery life. The phone has recently picked up the MIUI 9 update, which introduces a bevy of new features. You get a brand-new image editor that lets you remove elements from the background, a notification pane with bundled notifications, system-wide optimizations to make the UI feel smoother, native split screen mode, a new video player, and so much more. Another area where the Redmi Note 4 excels at is battery life. With a 4100mAh battery under the hood, you routinely get screen-on-time of over eight hours on a full charge. While there's no fast charging available, you're guaranteed to get two days' worth of usage from a single charge. There's no dearth of features on the Redmi Note 4, and all things considered, you're getting a lot for your money. Best small phone Xiaomi Redmi 4 See at Amazon If you're looking for a device with a 5.0-inch form factor, then the Redmi 4 is right up your alley. The device is a bargain for ₹8,999, offering a 720p display with a built-in blue light filter, Snapdragon 435, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, and a massive 4100mAh battery. The compact size and the huge battery make the Redmi 4 a great option if you're in the market for a device that can last two days between charges. The Redmi 4 also has a 13MP camera with an f/2.0 lens and PDAF, and you get the usual bells and whistles in the Mi Camera app: Panorama, burst mode, HDR, real-time filters with previews, and face recognition. You can also use Xiaomi's Beautify effects in conjunction with the 5MP front shooter. Bottom line: The Redmi 4 gets the basics right at an unbeatable price tag. One more thing: The phone is available in gold and black color options, and should pick up the update to MIUI 9 shortly. Best selfie phone Xiaomi Redmi Y1 See at Amazon The Redmi Y1 shares a lot of similarities with the Redmi 4, including its ₹8,999 price tag. The phone also comes with the Snapdragon 435, and has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. Where the Y1 differs is the front camera, which is a 16MP offering with a dedicated selfie flash. The flash kicks in automatically in low-light conditions, and Xiaomi's Bestufy 3.0 feature automatically ""enhances your natural beauty"" to get that perfect selfie. The Y1 isn't just about the front camera; the phone also features a 5.5-inch 720p display, a design aesthetic that's similar to that of the Redmi Note 4, and a 3080mAh battery that gives you all-day battery life. The MIUI 9 stable build is also making its way to the device. Bottom line: The Redmi Y1 is your best option if you're looking for a device with a great selfie camera. One more thing: The Y1 comes with a dedicated microSD card slot along with a dual-SIM card tray, so you don't have to choose between using a secondary SIM card or an SD card. Conclusion Right now, it feels like Xiaomi is the only manufacturer that's serious about the budget segment. Lenovo has released several devices in this category this year, including the likes of the K8, K8 Plus, and the K8 Note. Although the company made the switch to stock Android, the devices won't be receiving the Oreo update until June 2018 at the earliest. Then there's Motorola, which rolled out the Moto E and Moto C in this segment. The Moto E4 Plus is particularly interesting thanks to its 5000mAh battery, but the phone isn't confirmed to receive the Oreo update. For a device that's just three months old, that's inexcusable. Simply put, if you're looking for a phone that offers the most value for your money, then the Redmi Note 4 should be at the top of that list. The recent price cut makes it a much more enticing option, with the 3GB variant now available for just ₹9,999. For that price, you get a great design, incredible hardware, amazing battery life, and a camera that holds its own in this category.

"Emanuella Grinberg and Amir Vera, CNN","(CNN) Linda Brown, who as a little girl was at the center of the Brown v. Board of Education US Supreme Court case that ended segregation in schools, has died, a funeral home spokesman said. Brown died Sunday afternoon in Topeka, Kansas, Peaceful Rest Funeral Chapel spokesman Tyson Williams said. She was 75 years old. Brown was 9 years old when her father, Oliver Brown, tried to enroll her at Sumner Elementary School, then an all-white school in Topeka, Kansas. When the school blocked her enrollment her father sued the Topeka Board of Education. Four similar cases were combined with Brown's complaint and presented to the Supreme Court as Oliver L. Brown et al v. Board of Education of Topeka, Shawnee County, Kansas, et al. The court's landmark ruling in May 1954 -- that ""separate educational facilities are inherently unequal"" -- led to the desegregation of the US education system. Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP's special counsel and lead counsel for the plaintiffs, argued the case before the Supreme Court. Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer acknowledged Brown's contribution to American history. ""Sixty-four years ago a young girl from Topeka brought a case that ended segregation in public schools in America. Linda Brown's life reminds us that sometimes the most unlikely people can have an incredible impact and that by serving our community we can truly change the world."" Brown was a student at Monroe Elementary School in 1953 and took a bus to school each day. ""My father was like a lot of other black parents here in Topeka at that time. They were concerned not about the quality of education that their children were receiving, they were concerned about the amount -- or distance, that the child had to go to receive an education,"" Brown said in a 1985 interview for the documentary series ""Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years."" ""He felt that it was wrong for black people to have to accept second-class citizenship, and that meant being segregated in their schools, when in fact, there were schools right in their neighborhoods that they could attend, and they had to go clear across town to attend an all-black school. And this is one of the reasons that he became involved in this suit, because he felt that it was wrong for his child to have to go so far a distance to receive a quality education."" Monroe and Sumner elementary schools became National Historic Landmarks on May 4, 1987, according to the National Park Service. President George H.W. Bush signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site Act of 1992 on October 26, 1992, which established Monroe as a national park.","Linda Brown, who as a little girl was at the center of the Brown v.

TIMOTHY P. CARNEY,"And what is that signal, and what exactly is the discontent that is driving these voters frustration with the governing party? After all, Pennsylvania and Michigan enjoy unemployment of 4 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively. Wisconsin has a stellar 3 percent unemployment. Ohio is the worst of the bunch, but still has a historically low 4.6 percent unemployment rate. To understand the discontent, though, you have to look deeper than economic woe. Counties that flipped from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump looked bad on broad measures of well-being, according to one typical study that asked residents about their overall happiness and optimism. Tellingly, counties where respondents were most dissatisfied with the place where they lived were the counties that swung the most from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump. Not surprisingly, the guy who said the American dream is dead overperformed in the crumbling communities where the American dream really was dead. Sawyer County in northwestern Wisconsin, which saw nearly a 20-point swing from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump in 2016, also had the states highest rate of drug overdose deaths that year. Or consider Fayette County, Pa., south of Pittsburgh. Its definitely working class: Only 15 percent of the countys residents over age has a bachelors degree, half the national rate. Mr. Obama and John McCain basically tied in this white, rural county in 2008. In 2016, Mr. Trump won it by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, pulling off a 22-point swing. I visited Uniontown, Fayettes county seat, just before the 2016 election, and found a uniformly pro-Trump clientele at Smittys Bar and Restaurant. I also found widespread alienation. The cliché of small-town rural Americas neighborliness wasnt evident here. Heroin and pills, thats all Fayette County is, one patron told me. I dont talk to none of mine, the bartender said of her neighbors. I got one who lives behind me who I think deals drugs. I got quacks who live below me. I got a loaded.22 right by my door, a man said over his vodka and tonic. I dont trust nobody in my apartment complex. Fayette County posts the sixth lowest social capital score out of Pennsylvanias 67 counties, according to Congresss Joint Economic Committee. The other five rural Pennsylvania counties at the bottom also saw double-digit swings toward Mr. Trump in 2016.",Why is the Rust Belt trending blue for the midterms?

Nick Douglas,"Hi! You didn’t come here to avoid studying, did you? Well, at least you’ll learn how to study better when you’re done with this little break. These are Lifehacker’s most popular study tips from the last five years. It’s Freshman Orientation Week at Lifehacker! This week, we’re covering ways to snap out of your summer haze and into an autumnal blitz of activity, whether you’re actually heading to campus for the first time, getting your own kids ready for school, or looking for ways to just be more productive in the classroom of life. So velcro up your Trapper Keepers, students. Class is now in session. 1. Study Less, Study Smart In an hour-long lecture, psychology professor Dr. Marty Lobdell lays out study techniques and habits. Among them: use a designated study area, study a half hour at a time, and divide what you learn into facts and concepts. (Facts might require tricks or mnemonics to memorize; concepts stick with you.) When you're learning new material, it can be overwhelming when you think about how much time… Read more Read 2. The Feynman Technique “Once you can explain an idea in simple language, you have deeply understood it, and will remember it for a long time,” says this two-minute video from the educational YouTube channel Sprouts. In the Feynman Technique, named after the plain-spoken physicist, you study by teaching, or pretending to teach, the material. You know you’ve learned something when you can explain it to a new student. Richard Feynman was a famously good professor, as he could explain physics simply and entertainingly. Just watch him do it, it’s astounding. Even his lectures are satisfying to read. That’s the promise of the Feynman Technique. You can read something and hope that it’ll all be beamed into your brain for future… Read more Read 3. Video Game Music OK, the original post is just an advice animal from Reddit, reading “Looking for good music to work to? Try video game soundtracks. The music’s designed to provide a stimulating background that doesn’t mess with your concentration.” But we’ve raved about video game music a lot on Lifehacker. We love the soundtrack to pixel platformer Celeste, and we appreciate Spotify’s game soundtrack portal. Our readers love game music too, and it shows up in our collection of readers’ favorite work and study music. Lots of different sounds can make you more productive while you work or study (particularly music… Read more Read 4. Flashcard Apps If you just cannot use a damn index card, here are eight flashcard apps to study with. Some are free, some come with study games, some offer huge packs of pre-written cards. Just, you know, don’t spend an hour picking apps instead of studying. Flashcards unexpectedly found their way into the public discourse last week when Counselor to the… Read more Read 5. Take Study-Worthy Lecture Notes This post by Lifehacker founder Gina Trapani dates back to 2006, but thousands of people are still learning from it. Gina explains the Cornell Notetaking Method, which includes layout and conceptual organization. She tells you how to study those notes and links to some template resources. This is some real meaty study advice. by Gina Trapani Read more Read 6. Study Before Bed Another classic post, this one explains the results of a scientific study, which indicates that when you’re studying unfamiliar material, you might get a boost by studying before bed—instead of, say, the morning. It's not news that sleep is tied to learning—even a 90-minute nap can significantly help boost … Read more Read 7. Bad Study Habits “Highlighting and re-reading don’t really help you retain any information. They’re like liking a charity’s page on Facebook: it might look good and make you feel like you’re helping, but in reality it’s a big waste of time.” This Adam Ruins Everything -style video lists bad habits to avoid, then good ones to replace them with. Remembering details and information is tough for anyone, but when you're in college it pretty… Read more Read 8. Retain Information Four tips pulled from some of the methods above, like self-quizzing, visualization, and making metaphors to understand concepts. Whether you’re studying for an exam or learning on your own, you want to do more than just re-read… Read more Read 9. Classical Music Study Playlist Classical music is a great study genre, if you know what pieces to pick. You don’t want Beethoven’s Fifth. That’s why we love this six-hour playlist curated by classical record label NAXOS. When it’s time to cram for that exam, you need a playlist that can help you stay motivated without… Read more Read 10. Study Tips Educational YouTube channel AsapSCIENCE gives study tips based on science, like “make your own flashcards” and “make practice tests.” Everyone has their methods for cramm—I mean, studying for tests. I barely scraped by with mine… Read more Read 11. The Case for Silence The best study music might be no music, according to scientific research. Subjects performed better on demanding cognitive tasks without music or background noise. For less demanding tasks, music can help. But for a particularly tough topic, see how long you can study in silence without getting bored. The Mozart Effect suggests that listening to some types of music can help with certain mental… Read more Read We write new study advice nearly every day, so check out our studying tag for more distractions from studying uh we mean HELPFUL STUDY STRATEGIES.","Hi!

Jon Russell,"Crypto represent a ‘border-less’ that anyone can own, but actually getting hold it isn’t easy for everyone. Amun, a company that wants to make buying crypto as easy as stock, has pulled in $4 million in funding to offer more established channels for crypto ownership.
The startup currently offers punters an ETP (exchange-traded product) on the Swiss Stock Exchange that pulls together five of the most popular crypto assets: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, XRP and Litecoin. ‘HODL’ — as it is called after ‘holding’ crypto rather than selling it (‘LOL’) — can be purchased just like any stock.
That five-crypto basket is just the start for Amun, which is developing ETPs for other crypto assets individually. The first one is for Bitcoin — ABTC — with others planned to come soon, you’d imagine the usual suspect such as Ethereum and co will follow. Indeed, Amun has licenses to the five crypto assets in HODL as well as EOS.
While the products are ETP and not covered by Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA), they are protected in custody and by insurance. They are collateralized and backed by an identical amount of crypto assets.
Personally, I’ve been able to buy crypto — just base tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum rather than company-specific ICO tokens — but it certainly true that it takes some learning. While, speaking for me and likely many others, exchange-based products aren’t easier to me, it does appeal to more institutionally-minded individuals or companies for whom holding an account with an exchange or a crypto wallet isn’t feasible. That’s the target that Amun has in mind, as well as outlier cases, too.
Amun CEO and co-founder Hany Rashwan told TechCrunch that growing up in Egypt, he saw the government ban Bitcoin despite the fact that it offered an alternative to the Egyptian pound, which saw its valuation tank massively in 2016. He believes that products like Amun allow anyone to take part in crypto even when they face local restrictions, as was the case in Egypt and other countries.
“We want to make investing in crypto as easy as buying a stock. Institutional investors around the world are looking for a secure, easy, and regulated way of accessing the crypto asset class. Amun’s products do that at a low price in one of the most reputable financial hubs in the world,” Rashwan told TechCrunch.
Investors share his optimism and those who took part in this round include Boost VC founder Adam Draper — son of outspoken pro-Bitcoin VC Tim Draper — Graham Tuckwell, founder of ETFS Capital who built ETF products for gold, and Greg Kidd, co-founder of investment firm Hard Yaka. Four undisclosed family offices also took part.
One reason for their optimism is the fact that Amun is developing technology that could, in theory, be licensed out to allow others to develop their own ETFs
“We invest a ton of resources in both our product development and underlying tech infrastructure. This allows us to come up with innovative but professional and safe ways of accessing the crypto asset class, as well as do all this on a tech platform that can be used by not just us, but any issuer that wishes to do the same as well,” Rashwan said.
“The world needs a company like Amun to make crypto as easy as buying a stock. Now that they were the first to do that, they can now provide the toolset and be the de-facto platform for anyone else looking to take their crypto assets/securities to the public markets,” Draper added.
Still, just giving people access doesn’t guarantee returns, that’s on the crypto market itself.
Last year was a dud across the board in terms of pricing as Bitcoin, for example, plummeted from a record high of nearly $20,000 at the end of 2017 to $3,930ish at the time of writing. Plenty in the industry are optimistic that will change as genuine value comes out of blockchain technology.
HODL itself debuted at $15.64 last November, today it is at $12.83

Enough to gain an understanding, not enough to change a life.","Crypto represent a ‘border-less’ that anyone can own, but actually getting hold it isn’t easy for everyone.

Rina Raphael,"ClassPass, like its customers, wants to be more flexible. On Thursday, the fitness membership startup announced the elimination of studio limits and the ability to roll over up to 10 unused credits, meaning more workouts for the same price. Previously, customers were restricted to three classes each month at a specific location. The floodgates are now open for fitness enthusiasts to frequent their favorite boutique gym class. In addition, ClassPass added premium class spots to cater to high demand and peak class times, thereby offering more booking options. The new credits system starts at roughly $40 a month for 21 credits, which equates to 2-4 classes (prices vary depending on location). “In keeping with our mission to inspire people to live their most active lives, these new features will imbue ClassPass members with more flexibility and freedom than we’ve ever been able to offer before,” said Payal Kadakia, founder and chairman, in a press statement. “By enabling studio loyalty and providing more bookable class options, we hope members feel that their opportunities to work out with ClassPass are limitless.” Currently, ClassPass offers over one million classes, with over 45 million reservations to date.

AUDRA D. S. BURCH and PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“If I don’t make it,” she wrote, “I love you and I appreciate everything you did for me.” Some of the alarming videos of the mass shooting were passed around via text message, while others quickly made their way to Twitter, where they triggered “sensitive material” warnings. One video showed officers with guns drawn, rushing into a classroom full of cowering students. The officers told students to put up their hands. One officer bellowed: “Put your phones away! Put your phones away!” “The Safest Community in the County” Parkland is the type of community where affluent young parents move to find verdant parks and pristine sidewalks for their children. Most everybody knows somebody at Stoneman Douglas High, home of the Eagles. A famous alumnus of M.S.D., as the school is widely known, is Anthony Rizzo, who plays first base for the Chicago Cubs. Sheriff Scott Israel, who was briefing journalists on the tragedy inside the school, has triplets who graduated from M.S.D. and played football and lacrosse and ran track there. Sheriff Israel said one of his deputies had learned that his son had been injured in the attack. State Representative Jared Moskowitz, who graduated from M.S.D. in 1999, sends his 4-year-old to a preschool down the street. The high school, with more than 3,000 students, is almost a city within a city, with airy breezeways and an open courtyard. It bears the name of Stoneman Douglas, the famed environmentalist who crusaded against paving over the Everglades. “It’s surreal,” Mr. Moskowitz said. “People don’t come to Parkland to open a business. They come to Parkland to raise a family. They come to Parkland to send their child to an A-rated school. They come to Parkland to live in the safest community in the county.” A Day That Began With “Life” Every morning at Stoneman Douglas High begins with an affirmation, which is read over the intercom. On Wednesday morning, the affirmation began with the word life. “Life supports me in every way possible,” were the first words students heard that day. The announcement went on to speak of Valentine’s Day, and how everyone “deserves a safe and healthy relationship.” The Astronomy Club announced that it was celebrating Black History Month on Thursday night with a showing of the movie “Hidden Figures.” But that event was postponed, as Stoneman Douglas canceled all school events and called in grief counselors. The Drill That Wasn’t Was it another drill? There had been a fire drill earlier that day. Some weeks back, there had been an active-shooter drill. Alarms were blaring on Wednesday afternoon. Students were scurrying around. Some were convinced it was one more readiness test. “When we first heard the two gunshots, nobody did anything because we thought that was a drill,” Masiel Baluja, a student, told CNN. Confusing the situation, a fire alarm had been activated shortly before the shots began, perhaps an effort by the assailant to sow confusion. Gabriella Figueroa, 16, a junior, had been in geometry class working on angle bisectors when the alarm sounded. As she neared the exit doors, she heard the first gunshots and ran back to class. “I was shaking and praying and saying, ‘God, please get me out of here,’” she said. Melissa Falkowski, a teacher, told CNN, “We could not have been more prepared for this situation, which is what makes it so frustrating.” She continued: “We have trained for this, we’ve trained the kids for what to do, and so the frustration is that we’ve done everything we were supposed to do.” And still people died, 17 of them, children and adults, most of them unidentified by the authorities as of Wednesday night. One of the complications, the sheriff said, was that the students’ identifications were still in their backpacks, which they had left behind in the havoc.

christian_delmarter,"This is a project for my Creative Technologies class called Hackathon. The basic idea of this class is that one Friday a month the class gets together and each of us makes something in 4 hours. So for the first project of the semester, I wanted to start off simple. What I decided to do was make bookmarks. The idea behind this particular project was that I wanted to get more experience with 2D design and Inkscape. I got different stencils off of google images and used text boxes on Inkscape to create the designs.
To get the bookmarks, I laminated a piece of 17x11 piece of paper and used the laser cutter available to me to cut out my bookmarks and etch my designs. I used 100 speed and 30 power for the laser cutter. If I were to do this again, I would definitely use at least 110lb cardstock instead of the normal paper I used, and I would probably slow it down to about 90 speed. The parts of design with less detail tended to get passed over much too fast and not etch well (hence the need for a slower speed), while the more detailed lettering parts had tiny holes that burned through (hence the thicker paper needed).
All in all, this was a very good project for me to work on the basics of 2D design, Inkscape, and using the laser cutter.",<!--dda7bd42579b4dc0937c45f979fc5c69-->This is a project for my Creative Technologies class called Hackathon.

AJ Dellinger,"Agents for the United States Customs and Border Patrol seized at least two dozen iPhones screens and other components that were on their way to a prominent phone repair expert and “right to repair” advocate, according to a report from Motherboard. The so-called “grey market” parts commonly used by third-party repair shops were picked off by the government agents at a shipping facility. Jenna Jones, the purchaser of the goods, has been one of the most vocal supporters of laws that would allow consumers to repair their own goods without having to go through first-party manufacturers. According to a CPB letter provided to Motherboard by Jones, agents seized a total of 24 iPhone LCD screens and 4 other LCD displays, valued at $262.57. Jones disputes the account and claims a number of other components were swept up by CPB. Motherboard reported an invoice from Jones showed a total of 38 screens for the iPhone 6, 6S, and 6+ were taken, as well as an iPad mini digitizer and several logic board chips. Jones reportedly paid $1,727 for the parts. The screens, which were seized from a DHL building located in Rochester, New York, seem to be the primary concern. They were purchased from a supplier in China that sells original, refurbished, and aftermarket screens. According to CPB, the displays may be counterfeit and in violation of trademark law. “Customs and Border Protection Regulations provide that any article imported into the United States bearing a counterfeit trademark shall be seized and, in the absence of the written consent of the trademark owner, forfeited for violation of the Customs laws,” the letter from the agency read. While the seized screens represent just a small portion of the $3.3 million worth of products stopped by CPD agents every day, Jones thinks there may be some foul play afoot. She told Motherboard that she believes Apple may have targeted her specifically because of her role as an expert witness in a recent class-action lawsuit filed against the company. (A judge decided earlier this week not to certify the class involved in the suit, and CPB told Motherboard Apple was not directly involved in the seizure of the screens—though companies can dictate what types of products the agency should keep an eye out for.) Jones, the owner of iPad Rehab in Mendon, New York, has made a successful career out of serving as a third-party repair expert. She operates a YouTube channel with more than 65,000 subscribers and has become a go-to voice in the right to repair movement. Just last week, prior to the seizure of the iPhone screens, Jones spoke at a press conference at the New York state capitol, where she advocated for a right to repair law in the state. Right to repair bills have garnered increased interest in recent years as consumers have searched for alternatives to service their damaged electronics. Eighteen states in total have proposed such laws, which would require manufacturers to make repair specifications available so owners can purchase and install replacement parts on their own or go to a third-party repair shop like the one Jones operates. Without such a bill, Jones and others like her are forced to operate in a grey area. While they can get authorized by manufacturers, they are limited with regard to the parts they can use and repairs they can make. Operating as an independent repair provider allows them to perform a wider range of services, but presents challenges like part seizures—a practice many companies use to maintain their hold on the repair market. Unsurprisingly, Apple is one of the staunchest opponents of the right to repair laws. Microsoft and Sony have also expressed their disinterest in allowing such bills to go into effect. With the cash to drop money into the pockets of lawmakers through lobbying efforts and the apparent ability to use trademark law to prevent parts from ever making it to third-party repair pros, it seems like the tech giants will continue to get their way.

Shana Lebowitz,"Japan is facing a fertility crisis — and these efforts could help. Carl Court/Getty The Atlantic recently reported on Ikumen classes in Japan, or classes that teach men how to be better fathers. The catch? At least in the session that Atlantic reporter Stephen Marche attended, none of the men in the class were dads or expecting dads. Some weren't even dating anyone. The idea is at least partly to impress women with the fact that they have some fatherhood experience. Men in the class practice bathing fake infants and wear weight suits to simulate a woman's pregnant body — but they also learn other ways of being better husbands and fathers. The teacher in Marche's class recommended that the men compliment their wives (and potential future wives) with comments like: ""This is delicious"" or ""Your outfit looks cute today!"" Those are suggested as alternatives to comments like, ""Why did you sleep in so late?"" A more public spectacle of wife-appreciation is Japan's annual ""Beloved Wives Day,"" in which men stand up in public and shout into a microphone how much they adore their wives. Beloved Wives Day, which has been celebrated in January for about a decade now, is the brainchild of Kiyo Yamana, the founder of the Japan Aisaika Organization. (""Aisaika"" means ""adoring husband."") JAO's ""5 Golden Rules of Devoted Husbands"" are: 1. Go home early, before 8 p.m. 2. Create a relaxing atmosphere 3. Call your wife by her name 4. Look into her eyes 5. Listen to what she has to say As Kiyo's wife, Kimi, told Christiane Amanpour in the CNN series ""Sex and Love Around the World,"" she and Kiyo have abided by these rules since they got married — and they explain why the couple are so happy. Ikumen classes and Beloved Wives Day come at a time when Japan is facing a fertility crisis — or what economists call a ""demographic time bomb."" The Atlantic previously reported that a lack of job opportunities for men could be to blame. Japanese men are still expected to support their families, and both men and women may be reluctant to marry and have children if they know it will be financially difficult. And as Business Insider has previously reported, work in Japan can be so demanding that young people often have no time to date or to start a family. Meanwhile, JAO suspects that the Aisaika lifestyle could be an ""unknown traditional culture of Japan."" The JAO website also reads: ""The Aisaika group has been initiated by middle-aged men who had come to think that good and sustainable marital relationship may very well lead to the world peace and preservation of the global environment.""","Japan has begun offering classes and celebrating holidays that encourage men to appreciate their wives.

"Obum EkekeHead of Computer Science Education Programs, UK & Africa","Advancing our students’ understanding of the principles and practices of computing is critical to developing a competitive workforce for the 21st century. In every field, businesses of all sizes are looking to hire people who understand computing, so we need more students to leave school confident in skills like coding, computational thinking, machine learning and cybersecurity. The U.K. has already led the way in preparing for this future by making computer science education a part of the school curriculum in 2014. But we know there is more to do to ensure young people in every community have access to world-class computer science education. A recent report from the Royal Society found that despite the good progress in recent years, only 11 percent of Key Stage 4 pupils take GCSE computer science. The majority of teachers are teaching an unfamiliar school subject without adequate support. These teachers are eager to offer computer science to their students but they need access to subject area training to build their confidence. The U.K. government’s announcement that they’re investing £100 million for an additional 8,000 computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing is an encouraging step forward. It builds on the progress that’s been made since computing was added to the curriculum in 2014 by helping to ensure teachers have the specialist training and support they need to educate the next generation of British computer scientists. We want to continue to play our part too. Today we're announcing £1 million in grants to support training for secondary school computing teachers in the U.K. The Google.org grant will allow the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the British Computer Society and the National STEM Learning Centre to deliver free computer science and pedagogy training for thousands of key stage 3 and key stage 4 teachers in England over three years, with a specific focus on disadvantaged areas.","Advancing our students’ understanding of the principles and practices of computing is critical to developing a competitive workforce for the 21st century.

Task & Purpose,"via Wikimedia The Department of Defense's fiscal year 2019 budget includes a hefty chunk of cash for a fourth Ford-class aircraft carrier, but the Navy may have to wait a little bit longer to see its dreams of an 11-carrier fleet truly realized. Among the slew of vessels included in the Navy portion of President Donald Trump's planned boost to the US armed forces budget are three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, two Virginia-class submarines, and the ""first year of full funding"" for the now-unnamed CVN 81 aircraft carrier, a younger sibling to the brand-new $13 billion USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), which the Navy (and Trump) commissioned last July. But as it turns out, the Pentagon's latest technical assessment of the next-generation (and urinal-less ) supercarrier reveals a warship currently incapable of performing basic functions during routine operations; the service on Feb. 7 reportedly appealed to Secretary of Defense James Mattis to delay critical shock testing of the new carriers until the second Ford-class hull, USS John F. Kennedy, comes available in 2024 — the same stress-testing for which lawmakers let the Navy off the hook in June 2017. The DoD's intensive assessment of the Ford, conducted by the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation and published last month, along with its other 2017 technical analyses, reveals ""poor or unknown reliability"" among many of the Ford's essential systems, including newly designed catapults, arresting gear, weapons elevators, and radar."" Sailors man the rails of the USS Gerald R. Ford during its commissioning ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Julio Martinez Martinez These systems aren't just high-profile (see: that steamless catapult ) but critical for the vessel's roles in counterterrorism and great-power deterrence. ""[The limitations] could affect the ability of CVN 78 to generate sorties, make the ship more vulnerable to attack, or create limitations during routine operations,"" the report states. ""The poor or unknown reliability of these critical subsystems is the most significant risk to CVN 78."" Among the most glaring problems facing the vessel: those ""goddamned"" electromagnetic catapults. While the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft experienced ""excessive airframe stress"" on launches, according to the DoD report, the Navy also ""identified an inability to readily electrically isolate Electromagnetic Aircraft Launching System (EMALS) and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) components to perform maintenance"" — a complication that means sailors could find themselves unable to perform underway maintenance or repairs on one of the ship's most critical systems. Daniel Brown/Business Insider This isn't just real pain in the ass when something goes wrong during a sustained bombing campaign against, say, forces hostile to US personnel downrange in Syria: It renders the whole system functionally useless. At the current reliability, Ford's cats only have ""a 9 percent chance of completing the 4-day surge and a 70 percent chance of completing a day of sustained operations as defined in the design reference mission without a critical failure."" That's on a good day, with a deck full of trained-up sailors; the Ford class was designed to reduce manning requirements but is ""sensitive to manpower fluctuations"" simply because the next-generation technologies it embraces ""are not well understood,"" the report states More concerning are the shock tests the Navy is delaying on the Ford, in which light charges would be set off in the water around the ship to test its systems' reliance under stress. In recent years, DoD regulations stipulated that Full Ship Shock Trials, designed to test hull resiliency, are should be conducted at ""two-thirds of the shock level that ships are required to survive""; the service's push to delay even such nominal tests raises questions about officials' confidence in their new supercarrier.

Steve Guttenberg,"I reviewed Schiit's overachieving $699 Freya all-tube preamplifier last weekend, now it's the matching $699 Vidar solid-state power amplifier's turn, and it's a honey! Let's start with a quick rundown of the things that set Vidar apart from similarly priced amps, first it's a Class AB, not 'D amp, and audiophiles such as myself tend to prefer the sound of AB designs. Vidar doubles its power output from 100 watts into 8 ohm speakers to 200 watts per channel into 4 ohm speakers. Again, 4 ohm drive capability isn't a sure thing for amps in the Vidar's price class. And it's made in the US, with parts mostly sourced from US companies. The Schiit Vidar power amplifier. Lee Shelly Connectivity is straightforward, there's a pair of RCA inputs, one XLR input for mono operation, and a pair of speaker wire binding posts. One snag, the power on/off switch is inconveniently located on the amp's rear end. You can start with one Vidar, but if you crave more power you can buy a second Vidar to use the two of them as single channel mono amps each delivering 400 watts into 8 ohm speakers (there's no 4 ohm power rating). The two amps won't take up that much space, Vidar is considerably more compact than average, it's just 9 by 13 by 3.8 inches. It's a beefy, little guy. I used Vidar with the Schiit Freya preamp with an Oppo BDP-105 Blu ray player, Schiit Bifrost or Mytek Brooklyn digital converters, and switched between Magnepan.7 and KEF LS50 speakers for all of my Vidar listening tests. Vidar comes with a five-year warranty, and it's sold direct from Schiit with a 15 day return policy. Listening to Schiit sound Vidar was a perfect match with the Magnepan.7 flat panel speakers, so that's what I used for my first round of auditions. Bingo, the best of the.7s sound -- transparency, big as outdoors soundstage, gorgeous midrange -- they were all there, and I noted the treble was better than I've heard in a while. Magnepan treble can sound soft, but here with Vidar the cymbals were brilliant. Vidar's skillset dazzled with the Magnepans, and it's rare to hear such an affordable amp do this well with these speakers. The Schiit Vidar's rear panel Lee Shelly The KEF LS50 speakers also loved the Vidar, and bass output of this little speaker really surprised me. With Kid Koala's sampled and synthesized ""12 Bar Blues"" CD the LS50s low-end slam belied their size. With the stereo mix on Kraftwerk's ""3D"" Blu ray the soundstaging was in fact remarkably three-dimensional, and the palpable textures of the synths and their super tight basslines demonstrated Vidar's grip on the LS50s' woofers, It's a great recording. Staying with German prog rock I played Can's ""Future Days"" CD, and the hallucinatory soundscapes occupying my listening room made me smile, this 1973 masterpiece still surprises me. Pair the Vidar with Schiit's smaller tube preamp, the $349 Saga, and that pair together runs just over $1,000. Add a set of $500 ELAC Uni-Fi UB5 monitor speakers, and that would be a hell of a system!","The Audiophiliac checks out another piece of Schiit audio gear, the Vidar stereo amp.",2017-11-11T19:47:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",An affordable audiophile amplifier wows the Audiophiliac - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/news/this-affordable-audiophile-amplifier-wows-the-audiophiliac/,https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/F4r7SDNDK1rm8zV4H4m9x1LgAJI=/670x503/2017/11/09/be0f4145-6b9c-4941-840f-ba071b7e828d/vidar-front-1920.jpg,,Cnet.com,class-4,1
David Schmalz,"Editor's Note: Updates to this story are below the original post. At approximately 1:20pm March 13 at Seaside High, Dennis Alexander, a math and administration of justice teacher who is also a Seaside city councilman and a reserve officer for Sand City Police Department, accidentally discharged his firearm during a gun safety demonstration. According to a statement from Seaside Police, no one was seriously injured in the incident, although Seaside Police Chief Abdul Pridgen says a male student was struck in the neck by ""debris or fragmentation"" from something overhead, and was transported to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula for treatment. He emphasizes that it was not a bullet, and was ""not life threatening."" UPDATE 4:05pm: Monterey Peninsula Unified School District sent out the following statement today to the parents of students in the classroom: ""We want to make you aware of an accident that occurred in the Administration of Justice class today at Seaside High School. As some of you may know, the teacher is a reserve police officer. Today, during class, the teacher accidentally discharged his firearm during a lesson while it was pointed at the ceiling. Debris from the ceiling then fell. Upon learning of the incident, our Human Resources department, school site administration and the Seaside Police Department immediately began investigating the incident, including interviewing students in the class. In discussion with your student, if he/she has information to share that has not already been shared, please direct the student to me. We will also have counseling services available for students. Due to the nature of this personnel incident, we are unable to share any other details. The teacher has been placed on administrative leave for the duration of the on-going investigation. The safety of your student is always our top priority, and we will continue to remain vigilant in our efforts to keep them safe while they are under our care."" UPDATE 5pm: Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante says that Alexander had his last gun safety training ""a little less than a year ago."" He says his department will do an administrative investigation of the incident once Seaside PD completes its investigation. Ferrante adds that Alexander has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of his department's investigation, which will determine if any of the department's policies regarding the safe handling of firearms were violated. UPDATE 5:30pm: MPUSD superintendent PK Diffenbaugh confirms that incident took place during an administration of justice class, a career pathway class that is unique to Seaside High in the school district. He adds that, "" Clearly, we will revisit this incident to ensure that something like this would never happen again."" The administration of justice class has been offered at Seaside High at least since Diffenbaugh came to the district in June 2014, though he adds it has since been expanded to two classes—administration of justice 1 and 2—due to student demand. UPDATE 6:45pm: Diffenbaugh, in a follow up conversation, says it's against state law and district board policy to have a non-authorized individual carry a firearm on campus, and that Alexander was not authorized by the school district to have one. ""We'll need to revisit protocol to make sure all staff members understand that is the policy,"" Diffenbaugh says. Editor's Note 5:30pm: This story has been updated from its original form to reflect that Alexander teaches administration of justice in addition to mathematics.","Monterey County Weekly (blog) Seaside teacher, councilman and reserve officer accidentally discharges weapon in gun safety demonstration.

"AP, AP","CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — New York Yankees pitcher Luis Cessa made his first game appearance in nearly two months, struggling with his control as he allowed two runs over 1 2/3 innings for the Class A Tampa Tarpons in a 4-1 loss to Philadelphia's Clearwater Threshers on Monday night. Cessa, a 26-year-old right-hander, pitched four innings over three relief appearances in early April, then went on the disabled list with a left oblique strain. In his first outing since April 17, Cessa gave up three hits and four walks, allowing a run-scoring forceout and an RBI single. He threw 19 of 46 pitches for strikes. New York is looking for starting pitching. No. 5 starter Jordan Montgomery had Tommy John surgery last week and Masahiro Tanaka will be sidelined for at least several weeks after injuring both hamstrings running the bases Friday. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

I’m a writer and teacher. I got here through a lot of hard work, some luck, hardcore ambition, a capacity to tolerate a lot of rejection blah blah blah blah. I also went to school for a long time. Take us through a recent workday. It really depends. On teaching days, I spend my morning preparing for class, printing out any handouts I need, checking my campus mail, holding office hours, grading, and then I teach, generally a three hour seminar, and then I go run errands, and get to writing stuff in the evening. On non-writing days, it depends on whether I am traveling, having an event or free to actually sit down and get some reading or writing done. I don’t really have a schedule or routine. I do what I can when I can. What apps, gadgets, or tools can’t you live without? I cannot live without my phone, Gmail, Word, Google Docs, and Dropbox. What’s your workspace setup like? I have a lot of different workspaces. I do most of my writing from my couch but in each of my homes I also have an office with a desk, printer, space for my laptop or desktop, lots and lots of bookshelves, a shelving system for supplies and such and a chair. It’s not super interesting. What’s your best time-saving shortcut or life hack? I haven’t found one yet. How do you keep track of what you have to do? I use a Google spreadsheet with all my outstanding writing work. My calendar is also a critical tool for getting things done. What everyday thing are you better at than everyone else?

What do you do when you want to forget about work? I don’t know. I need to figure this out, ASAP. What’s your favorite side project? My favorite side project is a new comic book project I am working on. What are you currently reading, or what’s something you’d recommend?

Soraya Ferdman,"Come this new school year, consider taking time to help teachers in underfunded schools meet their students' needs. In the past decade, U.S. public education has undergone massive budget cuts, leaving many classrooms without fundamental resources. A recent study published by the American Federation of Teachers, a nationally organized union, cites a decrease in teacher's salaries and an increase in teacher-to-student ratios. And yet, the vast majority of teachers still spend their own money on classroom supplies. According to the United States Department of Education, 94% of teachers report paying for school supplies, without reimbursement. The same study calculated teachers spend on average $479 annually of their own money on classrooms, with 15 percent reporting closer to $800 annually. SEE ALSO: Teachers make their own epic version of Carpool Karaoke with yodelling and floss dancing ""Great classrooms don't just happen"" said Chris Pearsall, vice president of brand and communications at DonorsChoose, a nonprofit organization that has helped crowdfund over 600,000 classroom project requests. ""Teachers rarely have more than a few supplies left from the previous year, so back-to-school season is when a lot of them stock up."" As students return to school, here are some ideas for how you can help teachers. 1. Expand classroom libraries Help teachers expand their classroom libraries. Books are the most popular request on the DonorsChoose website. A lot of teachers love to request graphic novels or books that are coming out as movies (like Wonder or The Hate U Give ), so that their students can connect with the material on multiple levels. Scholastic also has ""ready-to-go"" classroom libraries for each grade level. You might consider partnering with other parents to purchase a collection for a local teacher. 2. Cover classroom basics Classroom basics are often the first items teachers pay for out of pocket: pens, pencils, erasers, paper, cleaning supplies... they quickly add up, but they're must haves for a successful classroom. 3. Provide a 21st century education ""More than anything else, teachers crave technology for their classrooms,"" Pearsall said in a blog post for DonorsChoose. According to the company's findings, teachers consistently rank technology as the most urgent expenditure schools can make. Look through requests for tablets, smart boards, and more here. As many students have limited or no access to technology at home, their school becomes crucial for acquiring modern computer skills. Getting early exposure to technology can help them prepare for future careers, and it also supports students with different, specialized learning needs. Accessibility is key, and tech helps teachers who have students with disabilities. Image: DonorsChoose 4. Help teachers start a school garden Class gardens teach students about life cycles, nutrition and health, sustainability, and the environment, as well as responsibility, observation, and teamwork. If you want to do more than donate to a class garden project at DonorsChoose and bring an outdoor garden to your school, consider talking to school officials and plan to take on the responsibility of organizing the project, as not to put extra labor on already over-stretched school faculty. Use these talking points and this starting guide for those who need convincing. You can also get in contact with Real School Garden, an organization that partners with high-poverty schools to build community gardens. 5. Support the arts Support art teachers in need of construction paper, paint brushes, instruments, and more. Funding for music and visual and performing arts is often one of the first departments to get cut from a school budget. Many students also don't have the money for instruments or expensive arts supplies, and so rely on their school for these opportunities. 6. Help teachers take students on an adventure Teachers are constantly thinking of ways to expand learning outside the classroom, but it is not so easy to make this happen. Field trips can be time consuming to plan and expensive to execute. To help teachers broaden their student's experiences, check out these projects on DonorsChoose. 7. Support students who are struggling with poverty A lot of teachers pay out of pocket for food and even clothes, shoes, and personal hygiene items for their students. With the right essentials, students can come to school clean, comfortable, fed, and confident, focused on their school work. This DonorsChoose link connects you with teachers raising money for their low-income students. Another option is to contact your local food bank (which you can use this link to find). Feeding America, an anti-poverty organization with a network of 200 food banks across the country, has a BackPack Program that prepares bags of food for low-income children. ""For more than 15 years, the Feeding America BackPack Program has been helping children get the nutritious and easy-to-prepare food they need to get enough to eat on the weekends,"" according to Feeding America. 8. Help teachers instruct their students on tolerance and diversity Teachers need help preparing students for an inclusive, diverse society. There are several crowdfunding projects on DonorsChoose focused specifically on tolerance and diversity. One teacher has asked for funding for a project that celebrates students' heritages and diversity while another asks for picture books about tolerance. With recent teacher protests - most notably in Oklahoma, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Arizona - shedding light on the degree to which public school teachers are struggling to meet their children's needs, it is perhaps time for citizens step up and show their support.","Come this new school year, consider taking time to help teachers in underfunded schools meet their students' needs.

It follows a similar protest in November, and was inspired by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has been protesting outside of the Swedish parliament every Friday since September.
On Thursday, Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian lawmakers for her efforts.
The lead-up to the protest was met with some discouragement from politicians and pundits in Australia, imploring them to stay in school and strike outside of school hours.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern struck a different tone. She attended a rally in New Plymouth, and spoke to students.
""Thank you for raising the awareness, not just here in New Zealand but from around the world. It's your future and you're fighting for it,"" Ardern said, according to Stuff.co.nz.
""My message to you is that here in New Zealand we hear you, we know we need to act and we are. But keep doing everything that you can to bring people with you because we cannot do this alone.""
Elsewhere in New Zealand, Wellington students showed up in force, and of course, they wielded many excellent signs.
While in Auckland, thousands of protestors made their voices heard.
Over in Australia, the School Strike 4 Climate took place in 60 cities and towns across the country.
The demands of protests were as follows: Stop the Adani coal mine, set to be the largest in the country, no new coal or gas projects, and a commitment to 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.
The rallies will continue around the world, with students in more than 100 countries and in 2,000 locations set to skip class to make their voices heard.

Keith Richards apparently included a bangers-and-mash recipe in his autobiography, and we’ll be sure to feature the famous Elvis fried banana and peanut butter sandwich. Hey, even original One Day At A Time star and Van Halen ex Valerie Bertinelli has a cooking show nowadays. (And if you have any celeb recipes you’d like to see us cover, please feel free to suggest them in the comments!) To kick things off, we decided to go with the greatest celebrity recipe of them all: Katharine Hepburn’s brownies. This recipe was first published in The New York Times after Hepburn’s death in 2003, and has a pretty terrific story behind it. Turns out writer Heather Henderson’s father lived in the same new York neighborhood as Miss Hepburn. When Heather wanted to drop out of Bryn Mawr, her father got his famous neighbor and fellow Bryn Mawr alumna to talk her out of it, and they became if not friends, then friendly acquaintances. When Miss Hepburn suffered a fall, Mr. Henderson brought her some brownies. His charity was immediately greeted with a critique that his brownies were too floury by the famously brusque and candid star, who quickly rattled off her own brownie recipe, repeated below. We can only imagine that a force of nature like Katharine Hepburn—fond of brisk, miles-long walks in the woods, never slowing down for an instant—did not have a ton of time to mess around in the kitchen. Subsequently, her brownies are simple, no-nonsense, and can be thrown together in about 15 minutes. But like her, simple does not mean plain here, but classic: The immediacy and brevity of these brownies does nothing to deter how wonderful they are. The melting of the butter means they couldn’t be easier to stir together, and the minimal flour does indeed result in brownies that are exceptionally chewy and moist, almost fudgy. They’re a little hard to handle, but delicious—just like Kate The Great herself. We don’t favor walnuts, which Hepburn probably harvested herself from her own New England farmland, but threw in some mini-chocolate chips instead. We might be tempted to add some heavy-duty cinnamon if we weren’t afraid that she would come back from the grave and haunt us for messing with her famous recipe. Since the ingrates we live with are going to demolish anything chocolate-related, we took Miss Hepburn’s brownies to the Onion staff for a more discerning opinion. They were as big a hit at the office as they were as home. Our colleagues agreed that the brownies tasted fudgy, “velvety,” “torte-like,” “like a cross between fudge and a brownie”; one taster rightfully called them “medium rare.” Another enthused over that softness of the brownie, as “most are over-baked”; this one “tastes the way a brownie should,” a “grown-up brownie” (that our kids loved anyway). Likely the most inspired comment came from the taster who surmised that the recipe was obviously from “someone with class.” We couldn’t agree more. 1/2 cup cocoa 1 stick butter 2 eggs 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup flour 1 cup broken-up walnuts or pecans (and/or chocolate chips) 1 teaspoon vanilla pinch of salt Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Melt butter in saucepan with cocoa and stir until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes. Mix in eggs, one at a time. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, flour, nuts, vanilla and salt, and add to the egg/chocolate mixture. Pour into a greased 8""x8"" square pan. Bake about 35 minutes, being careful not to overbake; they should be gooey. Let cool and cut into bars. This is a small batch, makes about 12.","In Celebrity Recipes, we tackle a favorite recipe from a beloved star, past or present.

Vivek Maskara,"Vivek is an engineer at Zeta. More about Vivek … Frameworks such as Espresso and Mockito provide easy-to-use APIs that make writing tests for various scenarios easier. Let’s cover the fundamentals of testing and frameworks which developers can use to write unit tests. In app development, a variety of use cases and interactions come up as one iterates the code. The app might need to fetch data from a server, interact with the device’s sensors, access local storage or render complex user interfaces. The important thing to consider while writing tests is the units of responsibility that emerge as you design the new feature. The unit test should cover all possible interactions with the unit, including standard interactions and exceptional scenarios. In this article, we will cover the fundamentals of testing and frameworks such as Mockito and Espresso, which developers can use to write unit tests. I will also briefly discuss how to write testable code. I’ll also explain how to get started with local and instrumented tests in Android. Recommended reading : How To Set Up An Automated Testing System Using Android Phones (A Case Study) Fundamentals Of Testing A typical unit test contains three phases. First, the unit test initializes a small piece of an application it wants to test. Then, it applies some stimulus to the system under test, usually by calling a method on it. Finally, it observes the resulting behavior. If the observed behavior is consistent with the expectations, the unit test passes; otherwise, it fails, indicating that there is a problem somewhere in the system under test. These three unit test phases are also known as a rrange, a ct and a ssert, or simply AAA. The app should ideally include three categories of tests: small, medium and large. Small tests comprise unit tests that mock every major component and run quickly in isolation. Medium tests are integration tests that integrate several components and run on emulators or real devices. Large tests are integration and UI tests that run by completing a UI workflow and ensure that the key end-user tasks work as expected. Note: An instrumentation test is a type of integration test. These are tests that run on an Android device or emulator. These tests have access to instrumentation information, such as the context of the app under test. Use this approach to run unit tests that have Android dependencies that mock objects cannot easily satisfy. Nope, we can't do any magic tricks, but we have articles, books and webinars featuring techniques we all can use to improve our work. Smashing Members get a seasoned selection of magic front-end tricks — e.g. live designing sessions and perf audits, too. Just sayin' ! ;-) Explore Smashing Wizardry → Writing small tests allows you to address failures quickly, but it’s difficult to gain confidence that a passing test will allow your app to work. It’s important to have tests from all categories in the app, although the proportion of each category can vary from app to app. A good unit test should be easy to write, readable, reliable and fast. Here’s a brief introduction to Mockito and Espresso, which make testing Android apps easier. Mockito There are various mocking frameworks, but the most popular of them all is Mockito : Mockito is a mocking framework that tastes really good. It lets you write beautiful tests with a clean &amp; simple API. Mockito doesn’t give you hangover because the tests are very readable and they produce clean verification errors. Its fluent API separates pre-test preparation from post-test validation. Should the test fail, Mockito makes it clear to see where our expectations differ from reality! The library has everything you need to write complete tests. Espresso Espresso helps you write concise, beautiful and reliable Android UI tests. The code snippet below shows an example of an Espresso test. We will take up the same example later in this tutorial when we talk in detail about instrumentation tests. @Test public void setUserName() { onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText(""Vivek Maskara"")); onView(withId(R.id.set_user_name)).perform(click()); onView(withText(""Hello Vivek Maskara!"")).check(matches(isDisplayed())); } Espresso tests state expectations, interactions and assertions clearly, without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure or messy implementation details getting in the way. Whenever your test invokes onView(), Espresso waits to perform the corresponding UI action or assertion until the synchronization conditions are met, meaning: the message queue is empty, no instances of AsyncTask are currently executing a task, the idling resources are idle. These checks ensure that the test results are reliable. Writing Testable Code Unit testing Android apps is difficult and sometimes impossible. A good design, and only a good design, can make unit testing easier. Here are some of the concepts that are important for writing testable code. Avoid Mixing Object Graph Construction With Application Logic In a test, you want to instantiate the class under test and apply some stimulus to the class and assert that the expected behavior was observed. Make sure that the class under test doesn’t instantiate other objects and that those objects do not instantiate more objects and so on. In order to have a testable code base, your application should have two kinds of classes: The factories, which are full of the “new” operators and which are responsible for building the object graph of your application; The application logic classes, which are devoid of the “new” operator and which are responsible for doing the work. Constructors Should Not Do Any Work The most common operation you will do in tests is the instantiation of object graphs. So, make it easy on yourself, and make the constructors do no work other than assigning all of the dependencies into the fields. Doing work in the constructor not only will affect the direct tests of the class, but will also affect related tests that try to instantiate your class indirectly. Avoid Static Methods Wherever Possible The key to testing is the presence of places where you can divert the normal execution flow. Seams are needed so that you can isolate the unit of test. If you build an application with nothing but static methods, you will have a procedural application. How much a static method will hurt from a testing point of view depends on where it is in your application call graph. A leaf method such as Math.abs() is not a problem because the execution call graph ends there. But if you pick a method in a core of your application logic, then everything behind the method will become hard to test, because there is no way to insert test doubles Avoid Mixing Of Concerns A class should be responsible for dealing with just one entity. Inside a class, a method should be responsible for doing just one thing. For example, BusinessService should be responsible just for talking to a Business and not BusinessReceipts. Moreover, a method in BusinessService could be getBusinessProfile, but a method such as createAndGetBusinessProfile would not be ideal for testing. S OLID design principles must be followed for good design: S : single-responsibility principle; O : open-closed principle; L : Liskov substitution principle; I : interface segregation principle; D : dependency inversion principle. In the next few sections, we will be using examples from a really simple application that I built for this tutorial. The app has an EditText that takes a user name as input and displays the name in a TextView upon the click of a button. Feel free to take the complete source code for the project from GitHub. Here’s a screenshot of the app: Large preview Writing Local Unit Tests Unit tests can be run locally on your development machine without a device or an emulator. This testing approach is efficient because it avoids the overhead of having to load the target app and unit test code onto a physical device or emulator every time your test is run. In addition to Mockito, you will also need to configure the testing dependencies for your project to use the standard APIs provided by the JUnit 4 framework. Setting Up The Development Environment Start by adding a dependency on JUnit4 in your project. The dependency is of the type testImplementation, which means that the dependencies are only required to compile the test source of the project. testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12' We will also need the Mockito library to make interaction with Android dependencies easier. testImplementation ""org.mockito:mockito-core:$MOCKITO_VERSION"" Make sure to sync the project after adding the dependency. Android Studio should have created the folder structure for unit tests by default. If not, make sure the following directory structure exists: &lt;Project Dir&gt;/app/src/test/java/com/maskaravivek/testingExamples Creating Your First Unit Test Suppose you want to test the displayUserName function in the UserService. For the sake of simplicity, the function simply formats the input and returns it back. In a real-world application, it could make a network call to fetch the user profile and return the user’s name. @Singleton class UserService @Inject constructor(private var context: Context) { fun displayUserName(name: String): String { val userNameFormat = context.getString(R.string.display_user_name) return String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, userNameFormat, name) } } We will start by creating a UserServiceTest class in our test directory. The UserService class uses Context, which needs to be mocked for the purpose of testing. Mockito provides a @Mock notation for mocking objects, which can be used as follows: @Mock internal var context: Context? = null Similarly, you’ll need to mock all dependencies required to construct the instance of the UserService class. Before your test, you’ll need to initialize these mocks and inject them into the UserService class. @InjectMock creates an instance of the class and injects the mocks that are marked with the annotations @Mock into it. MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this); initializes those fields annotated with Mockito annotations. Here’s how it can be done: class UserServiceTest { @Mock internal var context: Context? = null @InjectMocks internal var userService: UserService? = null @Before fun setup() { MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) } } Now you are done setting up your test class. Let’s add a test to this class that verifies the functionality of the displayUserName function. Here’s what the test looks like: @Test fun displayUserName() { doReturn(""Hello %s!"").`when`(context)!!.getString(any(Int::class.java)) val displayUserName = userService!!.displayUserName(""Test"") assertEquals(displayUserName, ""Hello Test!"") } The test uses a doReturn().when() statement to provide a response when a context.getString() is invoked. For any input integer, it will return the same result, ""Hello %s!"". We could have been more specific by making it return this response only for a particular string resource ID, but for the sake of simplicity, we are returning the same response to any input. Finally, here’s what the test class looks like: class UserServiceTest { @Mock internal var context: Context? = null @InjectMocks internal var userService: UserService? = null @Before fun setup() { MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) } @Test fun displayUserName() { doReturn(""Hello %s!"").`when`(context)!!.getString(any(Int::class.java)) val displayUserName = userService!!.displayUserName(""Test"") assertEquals(displayUserName, ""Hello Test!"") } } Running Your Unit Tests In order to run the unit tests, you need to make sure that Gradle is synchronized. In order to run a test, click on the green play icon in the IDE. making sure that Gradle is synchronized When the unit tests are run, successfully or otherwise, you should see this in the “Run” menu at the bottom of the screen: Large preview You are done with your first unit test! Writing Instrumentation Tests Instrumentation tests are most suited for checking values of UI components when an activity is run. For instance, in the example above, we want to make sure that the TextView shows the correct user name after the Button is clicked. They run on physical devices and emulators and can take advantage of the Android framework APIs and supporting APIs, such as the Android Testing Support Library. We’ll use Espresso to take actions on the main thread, such as button clicks and text changes. Setting Up The Development Environment Add a dependency on Espresso: androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.1' Instrumentation tests are created in an androidTest folder. &lt;Project Dir&gt;/app/src/androidTest/java/com/maskaravivek/testingExamples If you want to test a simple activity, create your test class in the same package as your activity. Creating Your First Instrumentation Test Let’s start by creating a simple activity that takes a name as input and, on the click of a button, displays the user name. The code for the activity above is quite simple: class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { var button: Button? = null var userNameField: EditText? = null var displayUserName: TextView? = null override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) AndroidInjection.inject(this) setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) initViews() } private fun initViews() { button = this.findViewById(R.id.set_user_name) userNameField = this.findViewById(R.id.name_field) displayUserName = this.findViewById(R.id.display_user_name) this.button!!.setOnClickListener({ displayUserName!!.text = ""Hello ${userNameField!!.text}!"" }) } } To create a test for the MainActivity, we will start by creating a MainActivityTest class under the androidTest directory. Add the AndroidJUnit4 annotation to the class to indicate that the tests in this class will use the default Android test runner class. @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class) class MainActivityTest {} Next, add an ActivityTestRule to the class. This rule provides functional testing of a single activity. For the duration of the test, you will be able to manipulate your activity directly using the reference obtained from getActivity(). @Rule @JvmField var activityActivityTestRule = ActivityTestRule(MainActivity::class.java) Now that you are done setting up the test class, let’s add a test that verifies that the user name is displayed by clicking the “Set User Name” button. @Test fun setUserName() { onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText(""Vivek Maskara"")) onView(withId(R.id.set_user_name)).perform(click()) onView(withText(""Hello Vivek Maskara!"")).check(matches(isDisplayed())) } The test above is quite simple to follow. It first simulates some text being typed in the EditText, performs the click action on the button, and then checks whether the correct text is displayed in the TextView. The final test class looks like this: @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class) class MainActivityTest { @Rule @JvmField var activityActivityTestRule = ActivityTestRule(MainActivity::class.java) @Test fun setUserName() { onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText(""Vivek Maskara"")) onView(withId(R.id.set_user_name)).perform(click()) onView(withText(""Hello Vivek Maskara!"")).check(matches(isDisplayed())) } } Running Your Instrumentation Tests Just like for unit tests, click on the green play button in the IDE to run the test. Large preview Upon a click of the play button, the test version of the app will be installed on the emulator or device, and the test will run automatically on it. Large preview Intrumentation Testing Using Dagger, Mockito, And Espresso Espresso is one of the most popular UI testing frameworks, with good documentation and community support. Mockito ensures that objects perform the actions that are expected of them. Mockito also works well with dependency-injection libraries such as Dagger. Mocking the dependencies allows us to test a scenario in isolation. Until now, our MainActivity hasn’t used any dependency injection, and, as a result, we were able to write our UI test very easily. To make things a bit more interesting, let’s inject UserService in the MainActivity and use it to get the text to be displayed. class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { var button: Button? = null var userNameField: EditText? = null var displayUserName: TextView? = null @Inject lateinit var userService: UserService override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) AndroidInjection.inject(this) setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) initViews() } private fun initViews() { button = this.findViewById(R.id.set_user_name) userNameField = this.findViewById(R.id.name_field) displayUserName = this.findViewById(R.id.display_user_name) this.button!!.setOnClickListener({ displayUserName!!.text = userService.displayUserName(userNameField!!.text.toString()) }) } } With Dagger in the picture, we will have to set up a few things before we write instrumentation tests. Imagine that the displayUserName function internally uses some API to fetch the details of the user. There should not be a situation in which a test does not pass due to a server fault. To avoid such a situation, we can use the dependency-injection framework Dagger and, for networking, Retrofit. Setting Up Dagger In The Application We will quickly set up the basic modules and components required for Dagger. If you are not familiar with Dagger, check out Google’s documentation on it. We will start adding dependencies for using Dagger in the build.gradle file. implementation ""com.google.dagger:dagger-android:$DAGGER_VERSION"" implementation ""com.google.dagger:dagger-android-support:$DAGGER_VERSION"" implementation ""com.google.dagger:dagger:$DAGGER_VERSION"" kapt ""com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:$DAGGER_VERSION"" kapt ""com.google.dagger:dagger-android-processor:$DAGGER_VERSION"" Create a component in the Application class, and add the necessary modules that will be used in our project. We need to inject dependencies in the MainActivity of our app. We will add a @Module for injecting in the activity. @Module abstract class ActivityBuilder { @ContributesAndroidInjector internal abstract fun bindMainActivity(): MainActivity } The AppModule class will provide the various dependencies required by the application. For our example, it will just provide an instance of Context and UserService. @Module open class AppModule(val application: Application) { @Provides @Singleton internal open fun provideContext(): Context { return application } @Provides @Singleton internal open fun provideUserService(context: Context): UserService { return UserService(context) } } The AppComponent class lets you build the object graph for the application. @Singleton @Component(modules = [(AndroidSupportInjectionModule::class), (AppModule::class), (ActivityBuilder::class)]) interface AppComponent { @Component.Builder interface Builder { fun appModule(appModule: AppModule): Builder fun build(): AppComponent } fun inject(application: ExamplesApplication) } Create a method that returns the already built component, and then inject this component into onCreate(). open class ExamplesApplication : Application(), HasActivityInjector { @Inject lateinit var dispatchingActivityInjector: DispatchingAndroidInjector&lt;Activity&gt; override fun onCreate() { super.onCreate() initAppComponent().inject(this) } open fun initAppComponent(): AppComponent { return DaggerAppComponent.builder().appModule(AppModule(this)).build() } override fun activityInjector(): DispatchingAndroidInjector&lt;Activity&gt;? { return dispatchingActivityInjector } } Setting Up Dagger In The Test Application In order to mock responses from the server, we need to create a new Application class that extends the class above. class TestExamplesApplication : ExamplesApplication() { override fun initAppComponent(): AppComponent { return DaggerAppComponent.builder().appModule(MockApplicationModule(this)).build() } @Module private inner class MockApplicationModule internal constructor(application: Application) : AppModule(application) { override fun provideUserService(context: Context): UserService { val mock = Mockito.mock(UserService::class.java) `when`(mock!!.displayUserName(""Test"")).thenReturn(""Hello Test!"") return mock } } } As you can see in the example above, we’ve used Mockito to mock UserService and assume the results. We still need a new runner that will point to the new application class with the overwritten data. class MockTestRunner : AndroidJUnitRunner() { override fun onCreate(arguments: Bundle) { StrictMode.setThreadPolicy(StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder().permitAll().build()) super.onCreate(arguments) } @Throws(InstantiationException::class, IllegalAccessException::class, ClassNotFoundException::class) override fun newApplication(cl: ClassLoader, className: String, context: Context): Application { return super.newApplication(cl, TestExamplesApplication::class.java.name, context) } } Next, you need to update the build.gradle file to use the MockTestRunner. android {... defaultConfig {... testInstrumentationRunner "".MockTestRunner"" } } Running The Test All tests with the new TestExamplesApplication and MockTestRunner should be added at androidTest package. This implementation makes the tests fully independent from the server and gives us the ability to manipulate responses. With the setup above in place, our test class won’t change at all. When the test is run, the app will use TestExamplesApplication instead of ExamplesApplication, and, thus, a mocked instance of UserService will be used. @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class) class MainActivityTest { @Rule @JvmField var activityActivityTestRule = ActivityTestRule(MainActivity::class.java) @Test fun setUserName() { onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText(""Test"")) onView(withId(R.id.set_user_name)).perform(click()) onView(withText(""Hello Test!"")).check(matches(isDisplayed())) } } The test will run successfully when you click on the green play button in the IDE. Large preview That’s it! You have successfully set up Dagger and run tests using Espresso and Mockito. Conclusion We’ve highlighted that the most important aspect of improving code coverage is to write testable code. Frameworks such as Espresso and Mockito provide easy-to-use APIs that make writing tests for various scenarios easier. Tests should be run in isolation, and mocking the dependencies gives us an opportunity to ensure that objects perform the actions that are expected of them. A variety of Android testing tools are available, and, as the ecosystem matures, the process of setting up a testable environment and writing tests will become easier. Writing unit tests requires some discipline, concentration and extra effort. By creating and running unit tests against your code, you can easily verify that the logic of individual units is correct. Running unit tests after every build helps you to quickly catch and fix software regressions introduced by code changes to your app. Google’s testing blog discusses the advantages of unit testing. The complete source code for the examples used in this article is available on GitHub.

Chloe Bryan,"Unless you're a professional masochist, there are very few good things about flying — especially if you're flying economy or basic economy. The only balm for your in-flight misery is often a single bag of pretzels and a half-can of soda. And that is why it's so devastating when the free snack and beverage offerings on your flight are... less than great. We want you to know what kind of snack situation (snacktuation) you're getting into when you fly, so we've evaluated and ranked each major U.S. airline by its complimentary snack and beverage offerings on domestic/North American flights. (We're sticking to the options for economy class, because that's where the snacks really count.) SEE ALSO: Costco food court items, ranked Remember: you can always ask for the full can of soda, even if they don't give it to you at first. 10. Allegiant Allegiant does not offer complimentary snacks or beverages on its flights. Also, it does not offer WiFi. Also, according to a FOIA request from 60 Minutes in April of this year, Allegiant flights are three-and-a-half times more likely to suffer an in-flight breakdown than flights operated by five of its competitors. But, hey, this is about snacks! 9. Spirit No free snacks. A wasteland. 8. Frontier Nothing is free. Your flight might be cheaper, though. Please pack a snack. 7. Southwest Southwest offers free peanuts and pretzels as well as the standard beverage service. Their coffee is from Community Coffee. It's all perfectly fine. Also, these cookies look good. 6. Alaska Alaska Airlines offers a standard beverage service, Starbucks coffee, and free pretzels and cookies. Not bad. 5. United United has abandoned the stroopwafel and is dead to me. (They did backtrack on tomato juice, though — is there hope yet?) Okay, fine. You can read about its snack offerings here. 4. Delta In its main cabin, Delta currently offers almonds, a pretzel-based snack mix, KIND Dark Chocolate Chunk bars, and Biscoff cookies. The greatest of these, of course, are the Biscoff cookies. (Ever had Trader Joe's cookie butter? They're that in solid form.) In the beverage department, they have Starbucks coffee and the standard soft drink selection. Not bad! 3. American Passengers on flights within North America get complimentary beverages (tea, coffee, juice, Coca-Cola products, etc.). The coffee is Illy, which is very good coffee. Best of all, though, American offers the aforementioned stroopwafel: two thin waffle cookies with a caramel sauce in between. The stroopwafel is the perfect morning plane snack, and here's why: when you receive your stroopwafel, you can place it atop the lid on your cup of Illy coffee. The caramel will melt slightly, and the cookie will become warm, rendering an already-delicious treat even better. Reader, I have bitten into the gooey center of a stroopwafel and felt my eyes fill with tears. And it wasn't because they were dry from plane air! The stroopwafel is the perfect morning plane snack. American also offers pretzels and nuts, which are less important. 2. JetBlue JetBlue has good snacks, particularly on the savory side of things. Unfortunately, they do not have stroopwafels or Biscoff cookies, but they do have pretzels, PopCorners chips, TERRA chips, chocolate chip cookies, and, most importantly, Cheez-its. Their coffee is from Dunkin' Donuts. Does anyone have strong feelings about Dunkin' Donuts coffee? I do not. It is fine, and it tastes like coffee. Here's the magical thing, though. JetBlue is also home to one of the greatest phenomena of modern day air travel: the snack zone. (Technically, it is called the ""Inflight Marketplace,"" but snack zone is a better name.)

Heather Dockray,"Adolescence can last anywhere from three years to 65 — at least in the case of the Trump administration. Events of the past week have firmly placed the entire Trump White House in the ""middle school drama"" category on Netflix. Between Kelly, the loyal best friend forced to warn Tillerson about his upcoming breakup via tweet, a president who expresses his angst on social media in CAPS LOCK, and Jared being constantly in and out of the Principal Mueller's office, the parallels are just too alarming to ignore. SEE ALSO: Trump reportedly fired Rex Tillerson on Twitter. Ouch. It's worth noting that the Trump administration doesn't actually take place in a binge-able Netflix universe but in real life, where decisions have material consequences outside of ""Benny's going alone to the school dance."" Whatever. Adolescent psychodrama is alive and well in our nation's capitol. Let's analyze these stunted tweens for all they're worth. (Temporary bemusement.) 1. General Kelly is the loyal best friend forced to manage his crazy BFF's drama Everyone knew of a friend pair in middle school where one friend took on the role of the ""personality"" while the other played the ""responsible friend who cleans up their shit."" Loyal BFF Kelly reportedly had to inform Rex Tillerson recently that Trump was planning to fire him using Twitter. He's also tried to push Trump away from bad influences like Omarosa and get him to focus on the after-school activities they both love, like deporting grandpas and separating immigrant mothers from their children at the border. 2. Kellyanne Conway is the resident mean girl who'll always go to bat for the most popular boys in school, especially when they're accused of drunk driving Image: giphy You've got to hand it to Kellyanne — despite her chronic deceitfulness, imaginary massacres, and full-on, multi-agency ethics investigations — this lady has hung on. Kellyanne is the popular girl who's smarter than you think (she ran a respected polling outlet before joining the Trump campaign) and therefore painfully, persistently powerful. 3. Sarah Sanders is the nerd who dropped her musical friends in order to hang with the ""cool Steves"" — Bannon and Miller While you might disagree with everything Sarah Sanders has ever said or done in her life, her performance isn't the same crippling source of humiliation as Spicer's was. Every afternoon I watch Sarah on YouTube and think, ""Everything she just said was a lie,"" followed up with, ""Great use of independent clauses."" Sanders scored an A on all of her midterms and recently took a chastity pledge. Go Sarah! 4. Steve Bannon dropped out of high school after reading a book of Nietzsche quotes he shoplifted from Urban Outfitters Resident gossip and self-identified Leninist Steve Bannon loves nothing more than throwing around words that make him seem like an intellectual: Jumos, globalists, force multipliers. Stevie dropped out of school because it was ""too easy"" for him, but can't stop hanging around school (aka the White House) because the Italo Calvino-inspired ""groundbreaking philosophical novel"" he's working on, is, uh... in development. 5. Jared Kushner is the kid whose mom writes angry letters to his English teacher because she refuses to give him an A ""Critics call my book report on 'Ramona Quimby, Age 8' groundbreaking"" Image: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images Middle East Peace Prince Jared Kushner is still getting app platters with foreign dignitaries despite having a downgraded security clearance and absolutely no knowledge of what he's doing. He's clearly the middling middle school student whose parents harass his nice English teacher into giving him an A on all on his Babysitter's Club book reports because of his ""prescient precocious intellect."" 6. Robert Mueller is the principal who wants to retire but can't because everyone who'd replace him is too dumb Robert Mueller left the FBI five years ago, but came back to be special counsel because no one else in Washington is competent enough to do it. Mueller *is* the middle school principal that's been there since the school's founding and will never, ever retire, despite pushback from conspiratorial parents on the school board. 7. Jeff Sessions is the tiny friendly popular kid who committed a horrible crime in the forest ""Where was I last night? Oh, you know. Just hanging out by the river."" Image: win mcnamee/Getty Images Jeff Sessions, with his Southern charm and throwback ideology, has always been an alt-right darling. Sessions could easily double as the polite popular teacher's pet who committed a horrible crime in the woods one day after school. Don't check his sock drawer! 8. Ben Carson is the kid who overperforms on standardized tests despite saying continuously crazy shit in class The pyramids stored... what? Image: jabin botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images Carson killed his PSAT in math, but oh man, you do *not* want to know the explanation he gave for the pyramids on his social studies test. Also, why does he always insist on having the best desk in class? 9. General McMaster is the kid who is smarter than everyone else and is waiting for the day he can leave this small, dumb town General McMaster reportedly thinks Trump has the intelligence of ""a kindergartener "" and is in a constant internal meltdown. Teenage McMaster is just waiting for his acceptance to a private school, where his genius can finally be recognized and he can launch his dream club, ""Young Resentful Neocons of America."" 10. Mike Pence is the quarterback who's so bland, the director had to make him a secondary character As a servant in an administration surrounded by swamp monsters, you'd imagine that Mike Pence would at least be the *fun* kind of evil. Instead, he's become the kind of leader who gets into kerfuffles with teenage ice skaters. Netflix teen comedy Mike Pence would probably have *one* dramatic episode where he stands aside as his friends beat up a gay kid after school. 11. Ivanka Trump is the B student who is now leading her school's Model UN designation because her dad is the coach Afterwards, Ivanka took the whole crew out to Pizzeria Uno. Image: mark wilson/Getty Images When Ivanka Trump delivered her speech at the RNC in 2016, it was absolutely totally fine — nothing brilliant — but fine. Now, she's representing the United States at G20. Teen drama Ivanka similarly dominates her school's Model UN designation despite her lackluster oratory — but only because her father is the team coach. Sally Yates would thrive in that role, if only she hadn't been kicked off the team for standing up to her teacher. 12. Donald Trump is the class clown who accidentally sets fire to the whole school Do not give this man a lighter. Image: kevin diestch-pool/Getty Images Teen Trump hates doing school work, prefers watching TV to reading, and thinks all of those students/cabinet advisors with powerpoints are suck-ups. This is why he's not allowed to go into any room unmonitored. Otherwise, he gets on the phone and kicks up drama with his ""best friends""/allies, or he cyberbullies his teachers/the media from his Twitter account. If only the school had nominated Hillary Clinton to be their Student Body President. But ah! Her emails.","Adolescence can last anywhere from three years to 65 — at least in the case of the Trump administration.

Matthew Humphries,"September 27, 2018 2 min read This story originally appeared on PCMag If you happen to be in the New York neighborhood of SoHo today, on Spring Street between Crosby and Lafayette Streets, you'll be able to visit the latest Amazon brick-and-mortar store concept. It's called Amazon 4-Star. The idea of 4-Star is simple: create a physical store where customers will be offered a range of products which all have a four star or higher rating on Amazon.com, class as top-sellers and are new/latest models. The products available come from Amazon's most popular shopping categories including Amazon's own devices, consumer electronics, kitchen, home, toys, books and games. We're used to seeing other products recommended on Amazon.com under the headings of ""Most Wished For"" and ""Frequently Bought Together,"" and Amazon is extending this idea in-store so you'll see products stacked next to each other on the shelves if they are bought together regularly. As it's a New York store, there's also a product area for ""Top-Selling Around NYC"" suggesting that if 4-Star is popular, each store will cater somewhat to its location with product availability. Such is the wealth of data Amazon has access to, it can even state what the average review rating of all products in the 4-Star store is. On opening day, it's 4.4 stars apparently. There's also little cards next to products with reviews taken from Amazon.com listings. If you'd like to visit Amazon 4-Star, the store is open 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday to Saturday and then 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sundays. Be aware, though, that every product in the store has two prices. If you're a Prime member you'll pay the Amazon.com price, but non-Prime members will pay list price. Of course, I'm sure there will be a lot of encouragement to sign up for Prime while you're there.","In case the name isn't a big enough giveaway, the only products you'll find in this brick-and-mortar store have a four star or higher rating on Amazon.

Sarah Perez,"Crackle sells to Chicken Soup for the Soul. That’s not an early April Fool’s joke, but rather the news that Sony’s aging streaming service Crackle has now found a new home with Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, or CSS Entertainment – the same company that today runs the streaming service Popcornflix and other streaming channels. (And yes, is also behind the well-known book series.)
The news was first reported by Variety, and further detailed in a press release issued this morning.
CSS Entertainment will now be the majority shareholder in the new joint venture, rebranded as “Crackle Plus.” Sony, meanwhile, will receive 4 million five-year warrants to purchase Class A common stock of CSS Entertainment, Variety’s report says.
Sony first acquired Crackle in 2006, making it one of the older free, ad-supported streaming services on the market. However, it has struggled to grow amid competition from sites like Netflix and the billions it and others – like Hulu, Amazon, and now Apple – are investing in original content. That led Sony to announce last year it would seek out new strategic partners to help it run Crackle.
The transfer of ownership for Crackle, however, arrives at a time when ad-free streaming services like this are seeing newfound interest, with Amazon’s launch of IMDb’s FreeDive, Roku’s The Roku Channel, Walmart’s Vudu, Viacom’s new addition Pluto, Tubi, and others now making gains.
As part of the deal, Sony will contribute its U.S. assets, including the Crackle brand, user base and ad rep business to the new venture, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It will also license movies and TV shows from the Sony Pictures Entertainment library to Crackle Plus, as well as Crackle’s original programming, like its shows “Start Up” and “The Oath,” for example.
CSS Entertainment will bring six of its ad-supported networks – including Popcornflix, Popcornflix Kids, Popcornflix Comedy, Frightpix, Espanolflix, and Truli, plus its subscription service Pivotshare – to Crackle Plus.
The combination will lead Crackle Plus to become one of the largest ad-supported video-on-demand platforms in the U.S., the companies claim, with nearly 10 million monthly active users and 26 million registered users. The new service will also have access to over 38,000 combined hours of programming, over 90 content partnerships, and over 100 networks.
Our joint venture will position Crackle Plus as a leading AVOD streaming platform with nearly 10 million active users on our owned-and-operated networks. This will result in a manyfold increase in our recurring revenue from online networks,” said CSS Entertainment Chairman and CEO William J. Rouhana, Jr., in a statement. “We plan to build Crackle Plus aggressively and profitably through organic growth and acquisitions.
Current Crackle GM and Sony chief digital officer Eric Berger will exit Crackle when the deal closes.","Crackle sells to Chicken Soup for the Soul.

Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday defended a Republican tax-cut plan against Democratic charges that it favors the rich, saying it will be “one of the great Christmas gifts” for the middle class with just days to go before Congress votes. With a vote on the biggest tax rewrite in three decades set for Tuesday, Republicans were working to ensure party members were holding the line in favor of the legislation against entrenched Democratic opposition. The plan was finalized on Friday after Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker pledged their support. Three Republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a Senate that Trump’s party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and Mike Lee. Passage in Congress would provide Republicans and Trump with their first major victory since he took office in January. “It’s going to be one of the great Christmas gifts to middle-income people,” Trump told reporters at the White House before he boarded a helicopter for meetings at Camp David. “The Democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about,” he added. U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he talks to the media on South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., before his departure to Camp David, December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas The proposed package would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy Americans. Under an agreement between the House of Representatives and the Senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media on South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., before his departure to Camp David, December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Democrats have slammed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. For months, Trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. Studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately. Trump repeated on Saturday that the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from U.S. companies. The tax plan proposes new rules for repatriating cash held overseas. “This is going to bring money in. As an example, we think $4 trillion is going to be flowing back into the country,” he said. “That’s money that’s overseas that‘s stuck there for years and years.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Writing by Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Mary Milliken","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday defended a Republican tax-cut plan against Democratic charges that it favors the rich, saying it will be ""one of the great Christmas gifts"" for the middle class with just days to go before Congres…",2017-12-16T19:32:55Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Trump defends tax plan as 'great Christmas gifts' to middle class,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-trump/trump-defends-tax-plan-as-great-christmas-gifts-to-middle-class-idUSKBN1EA0OO,https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171216&t=2&i=1214999917&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEDBF0HA,reuters,Reuters,class-4,1
DAVID BROOKS,"This is raw carnage, caused by a culture that leads to self-isolation, conflict and a crisis of connection. What bothers me most on campus is not the assaults on free speech; its that some students are brutal with one another. They play games of moral one-upsmanship that leave others feeling desolated. And if you think the crisis of connection is limited to campus, I invite you to the American political scene over the past two weeks, with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder lining up to present their pseudo-masculine, chest-thumping displays to show how much they hate the other side. The good news is that, according to a study by More in Common, two-thirds of Americans are exhausted by the partisan charade. Furthermore, many people, including many feminists, are figuring out practically how to teach empathy. One of the authors in The Crisis of Connection is Mary Gordon, who founded the Roots of Empathy project. Once a month, a parent and an infant visit a classroom of children and sit on a green blanket. The children gather around them to talk about what the infant is doing. They watch the infant try to crawl to something or reach for a toy. They are learning to put themselves in the mind of the baby, learning emotional literacy and learning what deep attachment looks like. In one class there was an eighth-grade boy who Gordon calls Darren who had watched his mothers murder when he was 4 and was put into foster care. He was bigger than everybody else since he was two grades behind. One day, to everybodys surprise, Darren wanted to hold the baby. The mother was nervous but let him, and Darren was great with the baby. He went over to a quiet corner and rocked the baby while the baby snuggled into his chest. Darren returned the baby to his mother and asked innocently, If nobody has ever loved you, do you think you could still be a good father? There it was, Gordon writes, even in traumatized soil, a bloom of empathy.","Society is getting more comfortable with the social and emotional side of life, the author writes.",2018-10-11T23:10:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Two Cheers for Feminism!,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/opinion/feminism-gender-empathy-psychology.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/11/opinion/11brooksWeb/11brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-4,1

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Once presumed to be the domain of ostentatious Wall Streeters and tech bros, the MIT Technology Review predicts 2019 will be the year the blockchain finally goes mainstream. The publication notes that the technology could soon revamp the realms of banking, healthcare, supply management, and even entertainment, making it ""more useful"" than ever before, and so popular that it becomes ""boring.""
Initially introduced some 11 years ago as a log for Bitcoin transactions, the blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger. It's structured just like a literal chain of blocks with the ""block"" being digital assets and the ""chain"" being a public database. What makes this system so unique is a trio of signature features that are intrinsic to every blockchain ever made: They're compiled and verified in real time, cannot be retrospectively edited, and don't rely on a central, overseeing authority.
It's exciting to imagine this technology's game-changing potential across various industries—and for a limited time, it's affordable to learn how to use it. On sale in the Entrepreneur Store now, our readers can enroll in the 2019 Blockchain Developer Mastery Bundle to get a leg up in the enterprising world of blockchain before it becomes the norm. Included are the following eight courses:

Virginia K. Smith,"For those of us who remember the early-ish days of the internet, today marks the official end of an era, that if we’re honest with ourselves, ended long ago: the heyday of AOL Instant Messenger. The chat service is shutting down for good today, though most of its enthusiastic early users had long since abandoned it for Gchat, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and the myriad other chat options now available to us. The citizens of the internet woke up to some shocking news this morning: AIM, a pioneer in the… Read more Read But for many of us, AIM helped us cut our teeth and feel out the still-developing etiquette of online chat; how to wield away messages for good and for evil; maintaining Snapchat-like “streaks of hours logged on; navigating group chats; sliding into the DMs of crushes (or strangers); and expressing ourselves with ever more elaborate emojis. In the name of a digital Irish Wake (BYOB, sorry), we asked you for your most potent AIM memories, and boy, did you deliver. Below, one last tribute to the chat client that started it all: You trolled your fellow students: Whenever I was in the college computer lab, I always made it a point to uninstall AIM from the station I was at. Drove the other students that used the lab to goof off insane. ﻿ You made serious missteps with screen names : I had several embarrassing stories. 2 in particular.1. I had moved to California from Texas when I was 14. All of my friends at my small private school decided to call me Tex, which I owned, despite being a short pudgy Jewish kid from the suburbs without any athletic prowess. I had created the screen name “TtoThaX.” It made much sense to me with the caps lock choices, but to everyone else, ttothax just sounded like Roger Daughtry’s “My Generation” stuttering with a lisp.2. I had gotten sick of that particular reaction so much that I was in desperate need of change. For some strange reason, my small private school wrote a school song, where one of the lines read, “More precious than a sparkling jewel.” Due to my extreme lack of self-confidence, and the unanimous “panning” of the song from the students at my school, I thought I’d be funny, creative, and gain some high school popularity points by changing my screen name to “MorePreciousThan.” If The Hobbit, had come out in theatres that year maybe I would have gotten less ridicule, but about the nicest thing my peers could say to me was that it was a screen name for an 11-year-old girl.All in all, I’m glad we use facebook messenger where we use many real names for communication. I do miss the individuality that we could show with a screen name. Good memories of the late night, generally hormonally exciting conversations with people on the periphery of our peer group.﻿ (More than one of you did this) : I remember my screen name being something like MysticRift, as I was into the RIFTS role playing game and the Mystic class within. One chat interaction that sticks with me: I was just going back and forth with people in one of the main, general chat rooms (hey, remember those??) when this occurred: Mysticrift: I dunno, I just feel funny SomeRandomDude: *starts rubbing MysticRift to find out why she feels funny* Mysticrift: dude, 18/m/CA SomeRandomDude: No wonder you felt funny. I’m turning 38 in a few weeks, and I STILL remember how much a laughed at that. And of course, you posted~~~~ embarrassing away messages ~~~~: AIM is partly responsible for how quickly I’m able to type. Because I felt it necessary to carry on as many conversations with my friends as possible at the same time I became a really good typist. I’ve had to take typing test for jobs at which they were impressed with my speed/accuracy. I mostly have my many hours on AIM to thank for that. Beyond that, my away message and whatnot was usually some lyric because of course it was. Most likely 3rd Eye Blind or Savage Garden. But I had several different handles on there that I switched between depending on what I was needing to use it for or who I wanted to talk to. ﻿ A bunch of you found love: AIM is the reason I’m married to my husband. When I was in college I had a free Match.com account (meaning I could receive messages but not send anybody). At the time that was fine with me, because I was just curious about online dating sites but not actually interested in dating anybody through it. I might as well have been a bot, except that these days bots probably actually reply to people who send their messages. My husband had the foresight to leave his AIM username in his first message to me, which worked out well because without that I never would have talked to him.﻿ Or you found... something else: Mutual masturbation with girls in LA who are no doubt actually guys from Iowa﻿ Or you loved and lost : It was 20 years ago, we were in middle school, doing our homework together and messaging over AIM. I was fortunate enough to have a couple hour block of the line to use the dial-up, her family had two lines to the house. So it was routine of ours after our respective soccer practices to chat on AIM for a while, most of the school knew I liked her. It was one fateful fall afternoon, she teased that she liked some boy and was going to tell me at the end of my allotted dial-up time, which for once took forever to come...she messaged, “the boy I like is...[ClemsonEE]. =P” and promptly signed off. My world was spinning and I loved it. As most middle school romances go, this was special, I asked her to be my girlfriend in 7th grade, and she said no. I asked her to be my girlfriend in 8th grade, and she said no. I asked her to be my girlfriend in 9th grade, and she said no. But it didn’t stop us from talking most nights over the infallible AIM, filled with flirting and intimacy. I skipped asking her in 10th grade, took one of her friends to Homecoming instead, that was finally the tipping point, she finally was ready! We started dating the summer before junior year. The beautiful, first-love relationship. Voted class couple, went to Clemson together, left using AIM and went to G-Chat. We got married, adopted the most adorable black lab, life was looking great. Now we’re divorced, and AIM is shutting down. Good riddance AIM. (and I kept the dog)﻿ You argued with chat bots, sometimes without realizing it: Similar to SmaterChild I had found an app (wait, we didn’t call them ‘apps’ back then unless they were on the first page of the Applebee’s menu)—I found a program that was a bot that interfaced with a simple website where you could key in specific words and what the responses should be. The rest of it was up to the AI. A friend of mine at college managed to get some dormmates of his to add the bot as a friend, presumably not knowing what the setup was. I came home one night to a long drawn out argument in which the bot won. The bot was neutral, not instigating, so when it brought up its affection for the person’s mom I just about fell out of my chair laughing.﻿ You used it to get through more serious crises : on 9/11, I used it to let my friends know I was OK...and learned of several friends who were unaccounted for (later learned they didn’t make it)﻿ I remember helping a depressed guy get some treatment in the mid-90's. My wife thought it was super creepy and weird that you could chat with some stranger across the country, especially about personal things. I actually helped this guy though, and feel good about it.﻿ You hosted gift exchanges: avorite memory of AIM, group of friends, one year we all decided that we will host each other’s xmas list. One person will have another person’s list, post it on the profile, and when someone decided to get that gift, they will notify the person who has the list, and the item will be crossed out. I religiously stalked a friend’s profile to see what I am getting for Xmas. Great to be a teen again. Memory 2, how long people can stay on AIM without logging out.﻿ You pranked your friends for no reason: I remember when one of my college roomates hooked his AIM up to his phone for the first time. Shortly after, I wanted to get his attention so I just spammed him with something like 50 messages, all just “hey” or some variation of that. A minute or two later he stormed in all sorts of angry and pleading me to stop— apparently each of those messages cost him money since they were technically text messages. Whoops.﻿ You geeked out in role playing rooms: So many memories from the role playing rooms. Between the various niche communities like Xavier Institute ( X-Men RP ) and free form areas like Rhydin (Red Dragon Inn/The Forest). The place was like the nexus of existence where anyone or anything could show up. A gothic vampiress could be sipping bloodwine at the bar beside a 4 armed felidae prince who is the last of his kind while a dwarf was off in the corner snoring all cuddled up to his space pirate gf. Best memory besides meeting my first love in chat was the hour long battle I had with the Hulk that sent us from chat room to chat room crashing through the Rhydin Streets, Rhydin Falls, Rhydin Mall (I don’t know why there was a Mall but it was a hang out for skater rpers), etc. The saddest memory besides people trying to constantly force their own dice rules (your clan dice only work in your clans rooms, newb! 2d20 or GTFO) was when anime began invading. That and the realization of how many people were really just looking for cyber sex.﻿ And finally, you asked the tough questions: A/S/L?","For those of us who remember the early-ish days of the internet, today marks the official end of an era, that if we’re honest with ourselves, ended long ago: the heyday of AOL Instant Messenger.

A poster with details of a Houthi rebel attack on a Saudi Arabian frigate using an autonomously navigating small boat packed with explosives in 2017. Autonomously navigating boat components from the Shark-33 robot suicide boat. In a presentation that echoes assertions by another administration that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction, US officials have created a display of evidence that the Trump administration hopes will trigger further action against Iran. In a hangar at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, DC, today, Department of Defense (DOD) officials accompanied by US United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley put on display debris from what they claim are Iranian-built ballistic missiles and other weapons recovered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The presentation comes as the Secretary General of the United Nations is scheduled to release a report on Iran's lack of compliance with UN Security Council resolutions. Haley says the report ""describes violation after violation of weapons transfers and ballistic missile activity. Aid from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to dangerous militias and terror groups is increasing... Its ballistic missiles and advanced weapons are turning up in warzones across the region. It's hard to find a conflict or a terrorist group in the Middle East that does not have Iran's fingerprints all over it."" And those fingerprints, according to the display presented for the press today in the hangar, are all over the two ballistic missiles and other weapons. The components all bear marks tying them to manufacturers in Iran. This is proof, according to a DOD report, that Iran is illicitly shipping highly destructive weapons to anti-government forces in Yemen for use against Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Gulf as part of its efforts ""to sow instability and promote violence throughout the region."" Haley said that the US government had invited representatives from other nations, including ""the entire UN Security Council,"" to see the evidence on display. ""And we are inviting all members of Congress to view it. This evidence is part of what has led the US intelligence community to conclude, unequivocally, that these weapons were supplied by the Iranian regime. The evidence is undeniable. The weapons might as well have had 'Made in Iran' stickers all over it."" The ballistic missiles fragments were, according to DOD analysis, pieces of two Iranian Qiam missiles. The first targeted the Yanbu terminal—a major Red Sea oil facility on Saudi Arabia's west coast. It was launched July 24 and was not intercepted by Saudi missile defenses. It caused a major fire near the terminal, though there was little detail given at the time by Saudi Arabia about the damage done. The second, launched on November 5, was aimed at King Khalid International Airport near Riyadh; the Saudi Arabian government claimed to have intercepted the missile with its Patriot missile batteries, but other reports suggest that the Patriot system may have hit the falling booster of the missile after it had separated from the warhead. Saudi Arabian officials have suggested they may consider the attack on the airport as an ""act of war"" by Iran. President Donald Trump has blamed Iran for the Riyadh attack, but Mohammad Ali Jafari, the chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, disputes the claim. Video of the November 5 ballistic missile launch by Houthi forces toward Riyadh. Ansar Allah—the Houthi insurgent group­—claimed that the missiles were a domestic version of the Iranian-built Qiam, a variant of the Russian R-17M (""Scud-C"") ballistic missile. The Qiam is essentially a Scud-C without control fins. But Defense Department experts displayed components from the missiles with manufacturer stamps that show they were of Iranian origin, as were the other weapons on display. Iran is one of the few nations with an active missile development program that is not a member of The Hague Code of Conduct Against Missile Proliferation, an export control regime that prohibits the export of ballistic missile systems. (There are 138 member states, including the US.) But that's not uncommon for the region—Israel, Pakistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are all non-signatories as well. However, Iran has been specifically sanctioned by the UN Security Council for its illegal exportation of ballistic missile systems because of its nuclear program. Iran's ballistic missile development program is considered by some Security Council member states (including the US, Japan, and Sweden) to be against the spirit of the Security Council's resolution 2231, which specifically calls out nuclear weapons development, and to be ""destabilizing."" Russia and China have largely shrugged off the continued development, arguing that it's not a violation unless the missiles are designed specifically to deliver nuclear warheads. The resolution does not prevent Iran from other missile and space development. Other evidence presented by the DOD included Iranian uncrewed vehicles designed to act as weapons. One, the Qasef-1 uncrewed air vehicle, is a surveillance drone that ""can be used as a one-way attack drone,"" said Defense Department spokesperson Laura Seal, ""diving on targets Kamikaze-style and detonating its warhead upon impact. It is a member of the Ababil UAV family, designed and produced by the Iranian government.” The other autonomous weapon of Iranian origin presented was the Shark-33 ""explosive boat""—or rather, several components of it. The Shark is a high-speed small boat that carries an anti-ship payload. ""There are more than half a dozen pieces of evidence demonstrating that these components are directly traceable to Iran,"" Seal said. ""What makes the Shark 33 so dangerous isn't just that it can explode. It has a guidance system allowing it to track and hit a moving target without an operator on board, so the boat can be deployed to blow up a ship without sending someone on a suicide mission. The computer and sensors serve as that unmanned guidance system for the Shark 33—and they are supplied by Iran."" DOD officials say that the Shark-33 was used to attack a Saudi naval vessel, the frigate HMS al Madinah, off Yemen in February, blowing a six-and-a-half foot hole in its side and killing two crewmembers. It had previously been thought that the Houthis had made the attack with an anti-ship missile.

Credit Sarah Blesener for The New York Times After years of competing and touring, Sasha Cohen, the 2006 Olympic silver medalist in figure skating, rarely sets foot in the rink. But she’s watching the Olympics in Pyeongchang with great interest, as she is scheduled to spend a week in South Korea representing the U.S. Olympic Committee later this month. Ms. Cohen graduated from Columbia University in 2016, and currently works for Morgan Stanley as a disruptive change analyst. She has also been contributing to “ The Weight of Gold,” a documentary currently in production about the struggle Olympians face as they transition to the real world. In addition, she is interviewing individuals who are reinventing themselves for an upcoming podcast. Ms. Cohen, 33, recently moved to NoHo, where she lives alone. LUXURIATING IN SLEEP (AND LAUNDRY) Depending on how late my Saturday was, I wake up around 9 or 10. I love to get my sleep. I have an espresso machine at home and I’ll make an almond milk cappuccino. Then I’ll throw a load of laundry in the machine.

I have to feed it once a day, which is making me nervous because I’m about to go on a long trip. You know shoplifting? I’m thinking of droplifting it at the pet store. I don’t want a dead fish on my conscience. SKY AND WATER Even if there’s snow on the ground I’ll go on a run — about three miles or so. To me it’s such amazing therapy to see sky and water. I’ll run to the West Side Highway, do yoga and stretch on the piers, and maybe end with a meditation session. I’m not a person that can be cold. I’ll wear two pairs of pants — leggings and sweatpants — and a T-shirt, a heat thermal, a cashmere turtleneck, a fleece zip up, maybe a windbreaker, gloves and a full on hat. JUST SAY NO I’ll go home after I run, take a shower, listen to a podcast, and make a pot of tea. I’m on a complete Tim Ferriss kick right now. I appreciate “The 4-Hour Workweek,” but he’s so much more than that. I have huge admiration for the life he set up and the questions he asks. How do you learn to say “no?” I’m trying to say no to things, I’m trying to transition. Photo Yoga class at Woom Center. Sometimes Ms. Cohen goes for a run, sometimes, it’s yoga.

Credit Danny Ghitis for The New York Times Name Naomi Watanabe Age 30 Hometown Ibaraki Prefecture, about two hours northeast of Tokyo. Now Lives Tokyo Claim to Fame With more than 7.6 million followers on Instagram, Ms. Watanabe is one of the most popular social media celebrities in Japan. She is an actress, comedian and fashion designer who is perhaps best known for her skits imitating Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and other pop stars, in which she exaggerates their dance moves while lip-syncing their songs on TV variety shows. 渡辺直美ビヨンセ共演が実現naomi and beyonce Video by 小林旭 Big Break A lifelong comedian who enrolled in a Tokyo comedy school when she was 18, Ms. Watanabe made her television debut in 2007 on “ Waratte Iitomo! ” (“It’s O.K. to Laugh”), a daily hourlong variety show that ran for 32 years before ending in 2014. The show, which was broadcast live, featured a roster of regular performers including, at one point, Ms. Watanabe, who did impersonations. Fun facts: Ms. Watanabe was once called the Japanese Beyoncé, and the show set the Guinness Book of World Record title for the longest running live TV variety show on the same channel (8,054 episodes). Photo Ms. Watanabe in her dressing room. Credit Danny Ghitis for The New York Times Latest Project In addition to comedy, Ms. Watanabe was always interested in fashion but had a hard time finding plus-size clothes in Japan. As a teenager she would improvise by shopping in men’s stores, or by buying a dress and wearing it as a T-shirt. In 2014, Ms. Watanabe started a clothing line called Punyus (it means “chubby” in Japanese) that includes plus-size pieces for women like herself. Twice a year she introduces a new collection with a stadium-size runway show. She modeled the show after Victoria’s Secret, but instead of big-name artists like the Weeknd performing, she is the main attraction. “I’m like a fake musician,” she said through a translator. Next Thing Ms. Watanabe plans to spend more time in New York this year, with ambitions to open a Punyus store. She won’t be a total stranger in the city: She was recently featured in a Gap Logo Remix ad, dancing alongside MetroBoomin, SZA and Bria Vinaite, an actress from “The Florida Project.” Class Clown As a child, Ms. Watanabe would study television skits with Ken Shimura, a Japanese comedian known for his expressive faces. She would, in turn, practice her own funny faces whenever she could, including in the school cafeteria. “As soon as my classmates would take a sip of their milk, I would make a crazy facial expression and see if they would squirt out milk,” she said.

Ingrid Lunden,"As Disney gets closer to launching a shiny new video service and continues to ramp up efforts in other new streaming areas like gaming, it looks like it might be winding down one of its more legacy bets. Babble, a parenting blog that Disney acquired reportedly for about $40 million to help it target hipster parents, quietly ceased publishing in the middle of December, TechCrunch has learned.
“For everything there is a season, and after more than a decade of serving as a community and resource for parents, Babble will be saying goodbye,” reads a post from the site’s editors. “To all the moms, dads, family, friends, writers, and readers who supported us thank you. We are so grateful for the time spent sharing your stories and your lives, through all the ups and downs of raising tiny humans.”
When Disney acquired Babble — originally spun out from a (now-defunct) dating website called Nerve.com — in 2011, it was part of a bigger push at the media giant to built up a stock of content properties to target younger parents, the kind that turn to online media for parenting advice and inspiration.
The idea was that Disney would populate the site with lots of evergreen content aimed at savvy middle class parents — recent articles included a post on soft-serve pickle-flavored ice cream and kids nailing 80s-style Halloween costumes — to help it build a connection to these consumers that would lead, over time, to trusting and using and exposing kids to other Disney products as they grew up.
But times have changed. The Disney Interactive Media Group that housed Babble doesn’t exist as such anymore — and Babble’s two founders, Rufus Griscom and Alicia Volkman, moved on years ago from Disney.
And while (I’ve been told) hipster parents definitely still do turn to digital media to answer questions, get inspiration, or just waste time under the guise of doing something constructive, I don’t think that their focus has consolidated on a single destination to do that, but rather a plethora of sources that include other parenting-focused blogs, BuzzFeed-style viral sites that source stories from whatever is trending on social media, YouTube, apps like Pinterest and Facebook and more.
Sometimes, parents even meet other parents in real life, and talk and listen to each other that way.
It’s also not clear how much Disney had been investing in building out the Babble brand and site over the years. When it was acquired, it was on a growth tear, expanding 100 percent year over year with 4 million uniques. However, it hasn’t had much buzz or evolution since.
We’ve reached out to Disney to ask for more details, but in any case, this is far from being one of the biggest acquisitions to get shuttered by the company after things fizzled out. Club Penguin, a kids-focused gaming platform Disney acquired for around $700 million, shut down its main site in 2017, and its remaining app last year.","As Disney gets closer to launching a shiny new video service and continues to ramp up efforts in other new streaming areas like gaming, it looks like it might be winding down one of its more legacy bets.

Quentyn Kennemer,"Battlefield fans rejoice: the series is returning to World War 2, but this time with the power of the Frostbite engine behind it. This should make for the most realistic and action-packed World War 2 multiplayer shooter we've ever seen. Everything you need to know about Battlefield V is straight ahead. What is Battlefield V? We weren't sure which direction DICE would go with Battlefield V after the previous entry - Battlefield 1 - took the series back to its World War 1 roots. With a new mainline entry, we thought the company might look to go with a more modern approach or go a completely different direction with a war they have yet to explore, but it appears they were eager to apply their World War 2 expertise to the new Frostbite engine. Battlefield V will be a familiar game in that regard. It'll be a beautiful first-person shooter that should capture that old wartime feeling like no other. The game will be all about multiplayer, but there's still a bit of fun to be had for those who aren't in it for the competitiveness. Single Player With Battlefield 1, DICE tried something a bit different with their single-player component. Instead of a single lengthy campaign that follows one story that retells the same iconic battles that have been told 100 times, it focused on smaller multiple stories, ones which don't often get the same kind of attention as, say, the D-Day landings in World War 2. Expect that to continue in Battlefield V. We're not yet sure which stories will be told, but if Battlefield 1 is anything to go by then we know they'll often follow individual soldiers or smaller brigades. DICE is likely to use each individual campaign as an opportunity to deliver vastly different gameplay experiences. One might have you marching on the frontlines to storm an enemy foothold, while you might be taking to the skies to dogfight in another. We're also getting a cooperative mode called Combined Arms, a separate set of stories designed to be played with up to four people. Multiplayer As you'd expect, multiplayer will be the bread and butter of Battlefield V. There aren't many games that deliver the level of large-scale that these games do while maintaining a high level of immersion. In typical Battlefield fashion, a mix of infantry and vehicular combat will make for unpredictable and exciting matches. It'll have all the staple elements of the series, including massive maps, tons of players, and destructible environments. You'll do battle on a variety of game modes, including Domination, Conquest, Frontlines, Team Deathmatch and Breakthrough. Grand Operations, an epic, large-scale warfare mode, also returns. Our own Reb Valentine spent time with the mode at E3 2018. As she describes it: Grand Operations is a massive battle that takes place over three days. Your team's success, either as attackers or defenders, will determine your resources on subsequent days, such as troops, ammo, and medkits. On the final day, no one is able to respawn, allowing the fight to determine the ultimate victor of the battle. Battlefield V: Everything you need to know about Grand Operations Fans of Battle Royale games like Fortnite and PUBG will be happy to learn that Battlefield V will have a Royale mode of its own. We're told to expect all the classic tropes of the genre, but with all the stuff that makes Battlefield special. While multiplayer elements mostly remain unchanged - you defend or capture some sort of objective, or simply aim to kill everyone in sight - there is one new mechanic worth pointing out. You can now build fortifications such as trenches, sandbag walls, and barbed wire hazards. Another change is that the revive mechanic can now be used by any class, and you can drag your teammates to safety before going to revive them. Class changes A big part of Battlefield are the various classes you can play as in the game. You have Assault, Medic, Support, and Sniper. The Support player specializes in building fortifications, repairing vehicles, and supplying ammo to teammates. In previous games, the ammo supply mechanic wasn't handy for anything other than replenishing your explosives, as firearm rounds were plentiful. DICE is looking to lessen the amount of starting ammo you get to make the class more meaningful (though players can also pick up extra ammo off of fallen enemies and comrades). You'll be able to build advanced fortifications that other classes can't, such as a machine gun nest. Medics are still focused on healing or reviving allies. Any player can revive a teammate, sure, but that teammate has to be in your squad, and they'll only get a partial health pool on recovery. Only the medic can revive or heal a teammate to full health using their medkit. Their healing action will also be faster, giving you an excellent reason to play the role if you want to keep your squad healthy. DICE hasn't detailed changes to the other two classes, but Snipers are typically only focused on picking off foes from afar and will have a range of tools to keep them safe wherever they decide to hole up. The Assault class, meanwhile, will provide the best balance of firepower and utility. You can customize classes by changing your exact gear, guns, loadouts, and attachments, but there are also new cosmetic customization options that'll let you stand out even more. You can now change your gender, race, add face paint, change clothing, and use cool new headgear. You can also give your vehicles a different look with skins and modifications. Free DLC Battlefield V will have free post-launch DLC, DICE has confirmed. That means new maps and modes will be accessible to all players without the need to buy them individually or buy a season pass. This is a great move that will solve the issue of community fragmentation. DICE plans to make up for the money lost through battle packs, which is their cute name for loot boxes. These should only offer cosmetics for the class customization options mentioned above. Where to pre-order Pre-ordering Battlefield V?

We Are The Mighty,"A US sailor fires a shot line from amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard to the fleet replenishment oiler USNS Yukon for underway replenishment, July 1, 2013 Petty Officer 3rd Class MICHAEL ACHTERLINGS When the Navy announced plans to retire a system in August of 2018, not a lot of media outlets paid attention. Despite its failure to make headlines, the system that's on the way out is actually one of the most important in the Navy. We're talking, of course, about the Standard Automated Logistics Tool Set, or SALTS. Developed in the space of just three weeks during the run-up to Operation Desert Storm, this system has been with the Navy for 27 years — and it makes sure that the personnel in the fight have what they need by rapidly moving data on required parts and available inventory to and from the battlefield electronically. There is an old saying, ""amateurs discuss tactics and strategy, while professionals talk logistics."" Think of it this way: How can the pilot of a F/A-18E Super Hornet be expected to blow an enemy MiG out of the sky if his radar doesn't work? Yes, launching skilled pilots on the right mission at the right time is critically important, but nothing happens if the moving pieces aren't in order. The fighters on a carrier, for instance, need spare parts to work (just like your car). US Navy It's not just the super-complex fighters. Even the M16 rifles and M4 carbines used by SEALs will need spare parts or replacement magazines (which are often ejected and left behind in firefights) — not to mention ammo. Then there are the many other needs of the Navy: Food for the sailors, fuel to keep ships and planes running, the list goes on and on. SALTS enabled sailors on the front to handle Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) in minutes as opposed to weeks or days. It also could fix some mistakes in seconds. Not bad for a solution that was designed and implemented in three weeks. SALTS, though, was running up against advancing computer technology and new cyber-security threats. There is a new system known as One Touch Support, or OTS, that will take over for SALTS. And yes, just like its predecessor, OTS isn't likely to make headlines, but will play a crucial role for the Navy.","Petty Officer 3rd Class MICHAEL ACHTERLINGS When the Navy announced plans to retire a system in August of 2018, not a lot of media outlets paid attention.

RONNIE KOENIG,"One neighbor, Irene Taylor, 74, a retired New York City schoolteacher, noticed the day care and decided to get involved. “I introduced myself to Wendy, started talking to her and giving her advice. And I started to interact with the kids and talk to some of the parents. I see what she’s doing for the kids in the neighborhood.” Ms. Taylor, known as “Mama” by the locals, has lived in Bed-Stuy since she was 16, with a foray to Georgia after she retired. “Without places like this, I don’t know what the neighborhood would be like,” she said. A community facility like a day care is often permitted in a residential zone, said Rachaele Raynoff, press secretary at the Department of City Planning. But, she added, “regulations may differ based on the zoning district in which a building is located.” Of course, day care centers aren’t always as a welcome addition to a neighborhood. Jaime Lathrop, a lawyer in Park Slope, Brooklyn, who handles real estate litigation and transactions, said that parents, and particularly mothers, often see day care centers as appealing business ventures that make it possible to work while they have small children, and that might be eligible for state subsidies. But for some homeowners, it comes as an unhappy surprise when what they thought was a strictly residential building is suddenly home to a business that operates from early morning into evening. “This is one of the many drawbacks to owning,” Mr. Lathrop said, as it is difficult to escape a home day care that opens in your building. “If you were renting, you could simply move without all the costs and headache and indirect taxation through transfer taxes.” Photo Kara Turrisi Greenwood, right, opened Wee Ones Club, on the ground floor of several connected townhouses in Murray Hill. Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York Times According to the state Office of Children and Family Services, any day care program that serves three or more children for more than three hours a day must obtain a license or registration certificate, and must show that it meets certain requirements related to its space and the ratio of students to staff. The state agency’s preliminary 2017 data show that out of approximately 10,500 day care centers operating in New York City, 6,720 were home-based. In the Murray Hill section of Manhattan, Kara Turrisi Greenwood, 40, lives above Wee Ones Club, a preschool that she started as a Mommy and Me class in 2004 in the front room of the townhouse that her family owns. Initially, older community members in the neighborhood were not thrilled by the prospect of the Mommy and Me class. “They kept saying, ‘There’s an illegal day care running!’ Then the city would come in and say, ‘This is clearly not a day care, have a nice day,’” Ms. Turrisi Greenwood said. The Mommy and Me class did not allow drop-off, diaper changing, food prep or dispensing of medication, activities that would require a license for the facility to either operate as a family day care that serves up to eight children, or a group-family day care that can accommodate up to 16 children. Still, there were plenty of families in Murray Hill looking for the kind of services Ms. Turrisi Greenwood offered, and she had a hit on her hands. So she decided to expand, and obtained her license to run a group child care service. Then during a marathon two years of work and study, she earned a master’s degree in education at Bank Street College. Earning the degree seemed more cost-effective than hiring a salaried employee with the credentials, which allow her to enroll students from nursery school up to second grade. Soon she found she needed to expand into two neighboring townhouse buildings, which she bought. She connected the ground floor spaces by adding internal doorways. Ms. Turrisi Greenwood has rented out the second and top floors of the buildings to other tenants. “You buy it, you mortgage it, you rent it out,” she said matter-of-factly. During her time running Wee Ones Club, she married Kurt Greenwood, 42, a stay-at-home father to their sons, Fisher Greenwood, 6, and Hunter Greenwood, 4. Fisher graduated from Wee Ones Club, which Hunter currently attends. Living directly upstairs from the school can sometimes blur the lines between work and home life, but she wouldn’t have it any other way. Photo Children dance and play in a class at Wee Ones Club in Murray Hill. Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York Times “When they were young I would run up and nurse the boys,” she said, “and then run downstairs and see, what cool thing can we do now?” She has also formed close relationships with her tenants, including Stephanie Weldon Leimbacher, a psychotherapist and learning specialist in private practice, who occupies the top floor of the townhouse where Ms. Turrisi Greenwood lives. “The preschool was one of the reasons I wanted to move here,” Ms. Weldon Leimbacher said. “It’s one thing if you’re in your 20s and you’re changing apartments all the time and going roommate to roommate. It’s another when you’re an adult and you need a space you can feel stable in.” Another family, who opened an in-home day care center in their high-rise building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, also initially met with resistance, but was eventually embraced by the community. Jordana Levine’s landlord at first did not like the idea of her running a day care out of the apartment she shares with her husband, Glen Ross, 61, who now helps run the school, and their 10-year-old twins, Beriah and Mordechai Ross. “He worried the neighbors might be upset,” Ms. Levine, 51, said of her landlord. There was good reason to be skeptical, since the couple lived on the third floor of the building, with neighbors above and below. “Then an apartment on the ground floor became available and he asked if we would be interested. We saw it and realized it would be great.” The couple opened Morah Jordana’s Schoolhouse (Morah means teacher in Hebrew), accommodating no more than 12 children a day, from ages 6 weeks to 3 years old. All of their advertising has been word of mouth, and if a spot opens up, it is quickly filled. “The vision I had in mind was very warm and like a home,” she said. Of course, this has meant making some alterations to their two-bedroom apartment. “We don’t have any adult furniture,” she said, explaining that the family uses a fold-up Ikea table that does double duty as a safety gate blocking off the kitchen when school is in session. “It’s a land of kids.” For the first three years, Ms. Levine used her bedroom as a nap area, but now the bedrooms are no longer a part of the school. “One day it hit me, this is a crazy quality of life for me and my husband,” she said. She also stopped storing day care items in the twins’ room, reorganizing the hallway closet to suit her needs. Ms. Levine, who described herself and her husband as “not neat,” said the day care has forced them to be more organized. Pack n’ Plays are stored in the hallway closet and brought out during rest time. When a baby fussed before falling asleep one recent day, she pulled out a large cardboard room divider to create a more tranquil area — and it worked. The day care uses the building’s communal gated playground during the day, making sure to store all of the ride-on toys at the end of the day in an unfinished basement room that the building’s porters let them use. An older neighbor across the way often keeps her door open to feel more connected to the children, and has read to them on occasion. Likening the operation of the day care to a theatrical performance, Ms. Levine said she and her husband set the stage each night so that they can open the doors in the morning, ready to greet their small customers. “Every day we have to be bright and create this loving atmosphere,” she said. Photo The balcony of the Lower East Side apartment that Kevin Brosnan shares with two roommates overlooks All My Children Daycare. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Getting the license to operate a day care has been life-changing for the couple as well. “This is the first time we’re self-supporting since we’ve been married. And that’s what I’ve wanted my whole life as an adult,” Ms. Levine said. Now that her children are older, she hopes to get a commercial license to operate in a nonresidential space so she can move the business out of the apartment. Even some young, single men see the benefits of living in a building with a day care center on the ground floor. On the Lower East Side, Kevin Brosnan, 23, a client strategy manager at BounceX, saw the All My Children Daycare on the first floor of his six-story building as a boon. His roommates, Dennis Kennelly, 23, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, and Matthew Killip, 24, a paralegal at Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel LLP, agreed. The roommates attended high school together in Manhattan and then reconvened post-college to rent their first apartment together. “Our favorite neighborhood is the Lower East Side, and we really wanted our first apartment to be there, but we didn’t want to live above a bar,” Mr. Brosnan said. Their balcony overlooks the backyard where the children play, so if one of them is home from work during the day, he is likely to hear the high-pitched squeals of tricycle-riding children. For the three men, living above a day care center is just another one of those unique New York things. “When people visit us, we tell them to look for the All My Children day care,” Mr. Brosnan said. “When the kids are coming in, it feels like being back in school. We saw the day care as a positive.” Continue reading the main story","More than half of the day care centers in New York City are home-based, which means toddlers often get dropped off in residential buildings.",2018-01-19T10:00:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Don’t Mind the Day Care Downstairs,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/realestate/the-day-care-downstairs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/21/realestate/21daycare-sub2/21daycare-sub2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-4,1

In this article, you can learn how to build the animated note display from the Awwwards website. It discusses the HTML5 SVG circle element, its stroke properties, and how to animate them with CSS variables and Vanilla JavaScript.
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it is a standard XML-based markup language for vector graphics. It allows you to draw paths, curves, and shapes by determining a set of points in the 2D plane. Moreover, you can add twitch properties on those paths (such as stroke, color, thickness, fill, and more) in order to produce animations.
Since April 2017, CSS Level 3 Fill and Stroke Module allow SVG colors and fill patterns to be set from an external stylesheet, instead of setting attributes on each element. In this tutorial, we will use a simple plain hex color, but both fill and stroke properties also accept patterns, gradients and images as values.
Note: When visiting the Awwwards website, the animated note display can only be viewed with browser width set to 1024px or more.
A demo of the final result (Large preview)
File Structure
Lets start by creating the files in the terminal:
 mkdir note-display
 cd note-display
 touch index.html styles.css scripts.js
HTML
Here is the initial template that links both css and js files:
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Note Display&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""./styles.css""&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
 &lt;script src=""./scripts.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Each note element consists of a list item: li that holds the circle, the note value, and its label.
List item element and its direct children: .circle, .percent and .label. (Large preview)
The .circle_svg is an SVG element, that wraps two &lt;circle&gt; elements. The first is the path to be filled while the second is the fill that will be animated.
SVG elements. SVG wrapper and circle tags. (Large preview)
The note is separated into integer and decimals so different font sizes can be applied to them. The label is a simple &lt;span&gt;. So, putting all of this together looks like this:
&lt;li class=""note-display""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=""label""&gt;Transparent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
The cx and cy attributes define the circles x-axis and y-axis center point. The r attribute defines its radius.
You have probably noticed the underscore/dash pattern in classes names. Thats BEM, which stands for block, element and modifier. It is a methodology that makes your element naming more structured, organized and semantic.

To finish the template structures, lets wrap the four list items in an unordered list element:

 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You must be asking yourself what the labels Transparent, Reasonable, Usable and Exemplary mean. The more acquainted you get with programming, you will realize that writing code is not only about making the application functional, but also assuring that it will be long-term maintainable and scalable. That is only achieved if your code is easy to change.
The acronym TRUE should help decide if the code you write will be able to accommodate change in the future or not.
So, next time, ask yourself:
Transparent: Are code changes consequences clear?
Reasonable: Is cost benefit worth it?
Usable: Will I be able to reuse it in unexpected scenarios?
Exemplary: Does it present high quality as an example for future code?
Note: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz explains TRUE along with other principles and how to achieve those through design patterns. If you havent taken some time to study design patterns yet, consider adding this book to your bedtime reading.
CSS
Lets import the fonts and apply a reset to all items:
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nixie+One|Raleway:200');
* {
 padding: 0;
 margin: 0;
 box-sizing: border-box;
}
The box-sizing: border-box property includes padding and border values into an elements total width and height, so its easier to calculate its dimensions.
Note: For a visual explanation on box-sizing, please read Make Your Life Easier With CSS Box Sizing.
body {
 height: 100vh;
 color: #fff;
 display: flex;
 background: #3E423A;
 font-family: 'Nixie One', cursive;
}
.display-container {
 margin: auto;
 display: flex;
}
By combining the rules display: flex in the body and margin-auto in the .display-container, its possible to center the child element both vertically and horizontally. The .display-container element will also be a flex-container; that way, its children will be placed in the same row along the main axis.
The .note-display list item will also be a flex-container. Since there are many children for centering, lets do it through the justify-content and align-items properties. All flex-items will be centered along the cross and main axis. If youre not sure what those are, check out the alignment section at CSS Flexbox Fundamentals Visual Guide.
.note-display {
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-items: center;
 margin: 0 25px;
}
Lets apply a stroke to the circles by setting the rules stroke-width, stroke-opacity and stroke-linecap that altogether style the stroke live ends. Next, lets add a color to each circle:
.circle__progress {
 fill: none;
 stroke-width: 3;
 stroke-opacity: 0.3;
 stroke-linecap: round;
}
.note-display:nth-child(1) .circle__progress { stroke: #AAFF00; }
.note-display:nth-child(2) .circle__progress { stroke: #FF00AA; }
.note-display:nth-child(3) .circle__progress { stroke: #AA00FF; }
.note-display:nth-child(4) .circle__progress { stroke: #00AAFF; }
In order to position the percent element absolutely, its necessary to know absolutely to what. The .circle element should be the reference, so lets add position: relative to it.
Note: For a deeper, visual explanation on absolute positioning, please read How To Understand CSS Position Absolute Once And For All.
Another way of centering elements is to combine top: 50%, left: 50% and transform: translate(-50%, -50%); which position the elements center at its parents center.
.circle {
 position: relative;
}
.percent {
 width: 100%;
 top: 50%;
 left: 50%;
 position: absolute;
 font-weight: bold;
 text-align: center;
 line-height: 28px;
 transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
.percent__int { font-size: 28px; }
.percent__dec { font-size: 12px; }
.label {
 font-family: 'Raleway', serif;
 font-size: 14px;
 text-transform: uppercase;
 margin-top: 15px;
}
By now, the template should be looking like this:
Finished template elements and styles (Large preview)
Fill Transition
The circle animation can be created with the help of two circle SVG properties: stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset.
stroke-dasharray defines the dash-gap pattern in a stroke.
It can take up to four values:
When its set to an only integer (stroke-dasharray: 10), dashes and gaps have the same size;
For two values (stroke-dasharray: 10 5), the first is applied to dashes, second to gaps;
The third and forth forms (stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 and stroke-dasharray: 10 5 2 3) will generate dashes and gaps in various sizes.
stroke-dasharray property values (Large preview)
The image to the left shows the property stroke-dasharray being set from 0 to 238px, which is the circle circumference length.
The second image represents the stroke-dashoffset property that offsets the beginning of the dash array. It is also set from 0 to the circle circumference length.
stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset
 properties (Large preview)
To produce the filling effect, we will set the stroke-dasharray to the circumference length, so that all of its length gets filled with a big dash and no gap. Well also offset it by the same value, so it gets hidden. Then the stroke-dashoffset will be updated to the corresponding note value, filling the stroke accordingly to the transition duration.
The properties updating will be done in the scripts through CSS Variables. Lets declare the variables and set the properties:
.circle__progress--fill {
 --initialStroke: 0;
 --transitionDuration: 0;
 stroke-opacity: 1;
 stroke-dasharray: var(--initialStroke);
 stroke-dashoffset: var(--initialStroke);
 transition: stroke-dashoffset var(--transitionDuration) ease;
}
In order to set the initial value and update the variables, lets start by selecting all .note-display elements with document.querySelectorAll. The transitionDuration will be set to 900 milliseconds.
Then, we iterate through the displays array, select its .circle__progress.circle__progress--fill and extract the r attribute set in the HTML to calculate the circumference length. With that, we can set the initial --dasharray and --dashoffset values.
The animation will occur when the --dashoffset variable gets updated by a 100ms setTimeout:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
 progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = 50, 100);
});
To get the transition starting from the top, the .circle__svg element has to be rotated:
.circle__svg {
 transform: rotate(-90deg);
}
Stroke properties transition (Large preview)
Now, lets calculate the dashoffset value — relative to the note. The note value will be inserted to each li item through the data-* attribute. The * can be switched for any name that suits your needs and it can then, be retrieved in JavaScript through the elements dataset: element.dataset.*.
Note: You can read more about the data-* attribute on MDN Web Docs.
Our attribute will be called data-note:
&lt;ul class=""display-container""&gt;
+ &lt;li class=""note-display"" data-note=""7.50""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""circle""&gt;
 &lt;svg width=""84"" height=""84"" class=""circle__svg""&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--path""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;circle cx=""41"" cy=""41"" r=""38"" class=""circle__progress circle__progress--fill""&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;
 &lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;div class=""percent""&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__int""&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=""percent__dec""&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

The parseFloat method will convert the string returned by display.dataset.note into a floating point number. The offset represents the percentage missing to reach the maximum score. So, for a 7.50 note, we would have (10 - 7.50) / 10 = 0.25, which means the circumference length should be offset by 25% of its value:
let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
Updating the scripts.js:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
 let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
 let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
 progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
});
Stroke properties transition up to note value (Large preview)
Before we move on, lets extract the stoke transition to its own method:
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
- let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
- let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
- let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
- let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
- progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
- progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
- setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ strokeTransition(display, note);
});
+ function strokeTransition(display, note) {
+ let progress = display.querySelector('.circle__progress--fill');
+ let radius = progress.r.baseVal.value;
+ let circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
+ let offset = circumference * (10 - note) / 10;
+ progress.style.setProperty('--initialStroke', circumference);
+ progress.style.setProperty('--transitionDuration', `${transitionDuration}ms`);
+ setTimeout(() =&gt; progress.style.strokeDashoffset = offset, 100);
+ }
Note Value Increase
There is still the note transition from 0.00 to the note value to be built. The first thing to do is to separate the integer and decimal values. We will use the string method split() (it takes an argument that determines where the string will be broken and returns an array containing both broken strings). Those will be converted to numbers and passed as arguments to the increaseNumber() function, along with the display element and a flag indicating if its an integer or a decimal.
const displays = document.querySelectorAll('.note-display');
const transitionDuration = 900;
displays.forEach(display =&gt; {
 let note = parseFloat(display.dataset.note);
+ let [int, dec] = display.dataset.note.split('.');
+ [int, dec] = [Number(int), Number(dec)];
strokeTransition(display, note);
+ increaseNumber(display, int, 'int');
+ increaseNumber(display, dec, 'dec');
});
In the increaseNumber() function, we select either the .percent__int or .percent__dec element, depending on the className, and also in case the output should contain a decimal point or not. Weve set our transitionDuration to 900ms. Now, to animate a number from 0 to 7, for example, the duration has to be divided by the note 900 / 7 = 128.57ms. The result represents how long each increase iteration will take. This means our setInterval will fire every 128.57ms.
With those variables set, lets define the setInterval. The counter variable will be appended to the element as text and increased on each iteration:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
 element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Infinite counter increase (Large preview)
Cool! It does increase the values, but it kind of does it forever. We need to clear the setInterval when the notes achieve the value we want. That is done with clearInterval function:
function increaseNumber(display, number, className) {
 let element = display.querySelector(`.percent__${className}`),
 decPoint = className === 'int' ? '.' : '',
 interval = transitionDuration / number,
 counter = 0;
let increaseInterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {
+ if (counter === number) { window.clearInterval(increaseInterval); }
element.textContent = counter + decPoint;
 counter++;
 }, interval);
}
Finished project (Large preview)
Now the number is updated up to the note value and cleared with clearInterval() function.

The evaluation of answer copies of Class XII was started from March 2, 2019 at 136 evaluation centres in Bihar and it was concluded on March 20, 2019. The exam was conducted from February 6 to 16, 2019. 
This time, the Board deputed the computer operators at evaluation centres for tabulation work. All the computers are attached to the BSEB headquarters in Patna which automatically receives all information, including marks, related to a student.
The Bihar class 12 result has been announced after the board made sure that there will be no face loss after the declaration of results. The toppers of each stream (science, commerce and arts) were called at the BSEB office for physical verification, IQ test and their hand-writing were matched with their respective answer-copies by the experts before finalising the topper's list.
The early declaration of Class XII results will help the aspiring candidates to get admission in institutions of national repute including Delhi and other states, the favourite for Bihari students.
According to sources at BSEB, thousands of students miss chance for admissions due to delay in publication of Class XII results but this time they will be ready with the results when the admission session will begin in premiere institutes.
The parents of the candidates who were apprehensive that the results will get delayed due to Lok Sabha elections, now heaving sigh of relief with the announcement of dates of Class XII results.
The top five rank holders of each stream would get the scholarship under Desh Ratan Dr Rajendra Prasad Medha Chatravriti and would also get the cash prize and other incentives.
Around 13, 15,371 students had written their examination at 1339 centers across the state. In state capital alone 71,313 students of all the streams wrote exams at 82 different examination centers. Around 573 examination centers had been allotted only for female examinees across the state. Practical examinations were held in January. 
The Intermediate exams for Bihar Secondary Examination Board (BSEB) were conducted from February 6 to 16, 2019 for all Arts, commerce, Science and vocational streams. The exams were conducted in two different shifts morning as well as afternoon.
This year the students, who appeared for the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), did not require to write their names, roll number, registration number, year of examination and subject code on the answer-sheets as these information were already there in their answer-sheets.
The Bihar Board intermediate Result 2019 would be released on March 30, 2019 on the official websites - biharboardonline.bihar.gov.in and bsebssresult.com.

Andrew Krok,"Mercedes-Benz's interiors are some of the best in the industry, and its design language moves quickly across the entire lineup -- even to a brand new electric SUV that very well could have carved its own separate path. Mercedes-Benz put out a new teaser for its EQC electric SUV. Whereas the first two focused on the outside (the front and back, respectively), this latest teaser goes inside. Surprisingly, it carries many of the same design elements as the latest Mercedes-Benz vehicles, such as the cascading dashboard shape and the two giant screens that combine to a single massive expanse of glass. Just like the A-Class before it, the EQC will carry MBUX, Mercedes-Benz's new infotainment system. With a built-in assistant that understands natural language, a slick new interface and a screen that finally responds to touch, it's shaping up to be a pretty solid upgrade over the previous COMAND system. We won't have to wait too much longer to see the EQC.

Natasha Lomas,"London-based edtech startup, pi-top, has unboxed a new flagship learn-to-code product, demoing the “go anywhere” Pi-powered computer at the Bett Show education fare in London today.
Discussing the product with TechCrunch ahead of launch, co-founder and CEO Jesse Lozano talked up the skills the company hopes students in the target 12-to-17 age range will develop and learn to apply by using sensor-based connected tech, powered by its new pi-top 4, to solve real world problems.
“When you get a pi-top 4 out of the box you’re going to start to learn how to code with it, you’re going to start to learn and understand electronic circuits, you’re going to understand sensors from our sensor library. Or components from our components library,” he told us. “So it’s not: ‘I’m going to learn how to create a robot that rolls around on wheels and doesn’t knock into things’.
“It’s more: ‘I’m going to learn how a motor works. I’m going to learn how a distance sensor works. I’m going to learn how to properly hook up power to these different sensors. I’m going to learn how to apply that knowledge… take those skills and [keep making stuff].”
The pi-top 4 is a modular computer that’s designed to be applicable, well, anywhere; up in the air, with the help of a drone attachment; powering a sensing weather balloon; acting as the brains for a rover style wheeled robot; or attached to sensors planted firmly in the ground to monitor local environmental conditions.
The startup was already dabbling in this area, via earlier products — such as a Pi-powered laptop that featured a built in rail for breadboarding electronics. But the pi-top 4 is a full step outside the usual computing box.
The device has a built-in mini OLED screen for displaying project info, along with an array of ports. It can be connected to and programmed via one of pi-top’s other Pi-powered computers, or any PC, Mac and Chromebook, with the company also saying it easily connects to existing screens, keyboards and mice. Versatility looks to be the name of the game for pi-top 4.
pi-top’s approach to computing and electronics is flexible and interoperable, meaning the pi-top 4 can be extended with standard electronics components — or even with Littlebits‘ style kits’ more manageable bits and bobs.
pi-top is also intending to sell a few accessories of its own (such as the drone add-on, pictured above) to help get kids’ creative project juices flowing — and has launched a range of accessories, cameras, motors and sensors to “allow creators of all ages to start learning by making straight out of the box”.
But Lozano emphasizes its platform play is about reaching out to a wider world, not seeking to lock teachers and kids to buying proprietary hardware. (Which would be all but impossible, in any case, given the Raspberry Pi core.)
“It’s really about giving people that breadth of ability,” says Lozano, discussing the sensor-based skills he wants the product to foster. “As you go through these different projects you’re learning these specific skills but you also start to understand how they would apply to other projects.”
He mentions various maker projects the pi-top can be used to make, like a music synth or wheeled robot, but says the point isn’t making any specific connected thing; it’s encouraging kids to come up with project ideas of their own.
“Once that sort of veil has been pierced in students and in teachers we see some of the best stuff starts to be made. People make things that we had no idea they would integrate it into,” he tells us, pointing by way of example to a solar car project from a group of U.S. schoolkids. “These fifteen year olds are building solar cars and they’re racing them from Texas to California — and they’re using pi-tops to understand how their cars are performing to make better race decisions.”
pi-top’s new device is a modular programmable computer designed for maker projects
“What you’re really learning is the base skills,” he adds, with a gentle sideswipe at the flood of STEM toys now targeting parents’ wallets. “We want to teach you real skills. And we want you to be able to create projects that are real. That it’s not block-based coding. It’s not magnetized, clipped in this into that and all of a sudden you have something. It’s about teaching you how to really make things. And how the world actually works around you.”
The pi-top 4 starts at $199 for a foundation bundle which includes a Raspberry Pi 3B+,16GB SD card, power pack, along with a selection of sensors and add-on components for starter projects.
Additional educational bundles will also launch down the line, at a higher price, including more add ons, access to premium software and a full curriculum for educators to support budding makers, according to Lozano.
The startup has certainly come a long way from its founders’ first luridly green 3D printed laptop which caught our eye back in 2015. Today it employs more than 80 people globally, with offices in the UK, US and China, while its creative learning devices are in the hands of “hundreds of thousands” of schoolkids across more than 70 countries at this stage. And Lozano says they’re gunning to pass the million mark this year.
So while the ‘learn to code’ space has erupted into a riot of noise and color over the past half decade, with all sorts of connected playthings now competing for kids’ attention, and pestering parents with quasi-educational claims, pi-top has kept its head down and focused firmly on building a serious edtech business with STEM learning as its core focus, saving it from chasing fickle consumer fads, as Lozano tells it.
“Our relentless focus on real education is something that has differentiated us,” he responds, when asked how pi-top stands out in what’s now a very crowded marketplace. “The consumer market, as we’ve seen with other startups, it can be fickle. And trying to create a hit toy all the time — I’d rather leave that to Mattel… When you’re working with schools it’s not a fickle process.”
Part of that focus includes supporting educators to acquire the necessary skills themselves to be able to teach what’s always a fast-evolving area of study. So schools signing up to pi-top’s subscription product get support materials and guides, to help them create a maker space and understand all the ins and outs of the pi-top platform. It also provides a classroom management backend system that lets teachers track students’ progress.
“If you’re a teacher that has absolutely no experience in computer science or engineering or STEM based learning or making then you’re able to bring on the pi-top platform, learn with it and with your student, and when they’re ready they can create a computer science course — or something of that ilk — in their classroom,” says Lozano.
pi-top wants kids to use tech to tackle real-world problems
“As with all good things it takes time, and you need to build up a bank of experience. One of the things we’ve really focused on is giving teachers that ability to build up that bank of experience, through an after school club, or through a special lesson plan that they might do.
“For us it’s about augmenting that teacher and helping them become a great educator with tools and with resources. There’s some edtech stuff they want to replace the teacher — they want to make the teacher obsolete. I couldn’t disagree with that viewpoint more.”
“Why aren’t teachers just buying textbooks?” he adds. “It takes 24 months to publish a textbook. So how are you supposed to teach computer science with those technology-based skills with something that’s by design two years out of date?”
Last summer pi-top took in $16M in Series B funding, led by existing founders Hambro Perks and Committed Capital. It’s been using the financing to bring pi-top 4 to market while also investing heavily in its team over the past 18 months — expanding in-house expertise in designing learning products and selling in to the education sector via a number of hires. Including the former director of learning at Apple, Dr William Rankin.
The founders’ philosophy is to combine academic expertise in education with “excellence in engineering”. “We want the learning experience to be something we’re 100% confident in,” says Lozano. “You can go into pi-top and immediately start learning with our lesson plans and the kind of framework that we provide.”
“[W]e’ve unabashedly focused on… education. It is the pedagogy,” he adds. “It is the learning outcome that you’re going to get when you use the pi-top. So one of the big changes over the last 18 months is we’ve hired a world class education team. We have over 100 years of pedagogical experience on the team now producing an enormous amount of — we call them learning experience designers.”
He reckons that focus will stand pi-top in good stead as more educators turn their attention to how to arm their pupils with the techie skills of the future.
“There’s loads of competition but now the schools are looking they’re [asking] who’s the team behind the education outcome that you’re selling me?” he suggests. “And you know what if you don’t have a really strong education team then you’re seeing schools and districts become a lot more picky — because there is so much choice. And again that’s something I’m really excited about. Everybody’s always trying to do a commercial brand partnership deal. That’s just not something that we’ve focused on and I do really think that was a smart choice on our end.”
Lozano is also excited about a video the team has produced to promote the new product — which strikes a hip, urban note as pi-top seeks to inspire the next generation of makers.
“We really enjoy working in the education sector and I really, really enjoy helping teachers and schools deliver inspirational content and learning outcomes to their students,” he adds. “It’s genuinely a great reason to wake up in the morning.”","London-based edtech startup, pi-top, has unboxed a new flagship learn-to-code product, demoing the “go anywhere” Pi-powered computer at the Bett Show education fare in London today.

Jake Holmes,"Kia's new diesel mild-hybrid powertrain will launch in the Sportage in Europe, but it's not currently planned for US consumption. Kia Kia is combining two fuel-efficient technologies into one with the launch of a new diesel mild-hybrid powertrain in Europe. Set to launch this year in the Sportage, the technology uses 48-volt hybrid technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 7 percent. The mild-hybrid technology, which Kia calls EcoDynamics+, uses a 0.46-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack and a belt-driven motor-generator that can add up to 10 kilowatts (13 horsepower) of assistance to the diesel engine. It recharges the battery during braking or deceleration. Further, a Moving Stop &amp; Start function allows the diesel engine to be turned off briefly when the car is coasting, then restarted quickly if the driver accelerates. Though miles-per-gallon numbers aren't available, Kia says adding the mild hybrid cuts CO2 emissions by 7 percent on the New European Drive Cycle test and by 4 percent on the new, stricter Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). Kia says that this 48-volt mild-hybrid system is compact and can be easily, affordably adapted to existing models. The Euro-market Kia Sportage gets the technology this year as an option, followed by the Kia Ceed in 2019. Kia also promises that gasoline mild-hybrid powertrains will follow. US availability of the powertrain technology sounds unlikely. A Kia spokesman in the US said, ""We have nothing to announce at this time."" He also noted that while diesel engines have proven popular in the Sportage in Europe, none are currently offered here.

Associated Press,"Lt. Joseph Maxwell and Chief Petty Officer Shawn Kumagai inspect hairstyles of female sailors during a personnel inspection at the Presidio of Monterey, November 10, 2018. US Navy/Petty Officer 2nd Class Steven Shepard PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The Navy says it will now allow servicewomen to sport ponytails and other hairstyles, reversing a policy that long forbade females from letting their hair down. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said it makes the Navy more inclusive. Many black women had asked for changes to the female grooming standards. A female sailor, Yeoman First Class LaToya Jones, announced the new policy during a Facebook Live event Tuesday with Richardson. The new standards went into effect Wednesday. Lock hairstyles, or ropelike strands, are also now allowed. Wider hair buns too. And women can wear ponytails while in uniform. Capt. Thurraya Kent is the senior member of the working group that recommended the changes. The group told the Navy that adding grooming options would eliminate a distraction, be more inclusive of different hair textures and enable people to keep their hair natural instead of processing it chemically. Kent, who has been in the Navy for nearly 26 years, said her hair has been an issue throughout her career, whether it's figuring out what to do with it while she's deployed or trying to quickly make sure it conforms to regulations after exercising. Senior Chief Musician Amy Jarjoura adjusts the new female combination cover during a test fitting at the US Naval Academy, April 9, 2014. US Navy/Mass Comm. Specialist 2nd Class Jonathan L. Correa She recalled being told to take out her braids early in her career even though her hairstyle was allowed. ""Because of the texture of my hair, it stood straight up,"" Kent said. ""It was a very embarrassing moment that stays with you."" She said she's very encouraged that Navy leaders both listened and understood. At the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, on Wednesday, women said they're excited to switch from buns, which don't fit well under helmets. Legalman First Class Tamatha Schulmerich said she has to twist and wrap her hair into a bun because it goes down to her lower back. She said it was uncomfortable to wear that way when she had to wear a flight deck helmet in a previous assignment. Lt. Cmdr. Jess Cameron said while allowing new hairdos may seem like a small thing, it sends a larger message. ""I think it's a step forward,"" she said. ""They're getting more female feedback in the service, and updating what I think are somewhat antiquated guidelines that maybe no longer serve their purpose in today's society, today's military."" The Navy said it had the standards in place because of safety concerns and to ensure everyone maintained a uniform, professional look. Though the new rules permit ponytails, there will be some exceptions when working around heavy machinery.","US Navy/Petty Officer 2nd Class Steven Shepard PROVIDENCE, R.I.

John Burns Real Estate Consulting,"The widening gap in income distribution trends in the US has significant implications for home buying activity and homeownership. The shrinking size of the American middle class (those who make between two-thirds and double the median US household income*) has resulted in: More rental demand More demand for homes at the highest and lowest price points Less demand for median-priced homes Among households headed by those under age 65, middle-income households plunged from 57% of American households in 1970 to only 45% today—a decline of 12%. (Though today's 45% is up slightly from an average of 43% over the previous seven years.) The result has been a: 7% increase in the percentage of households who earn more than double the US median income, from 12% in 1970 to 19% in 2016 4% increase in the percentage of households who earn less than 80% of the US median income, from 31% in 1970 to 35% in 2016. John Burns Real Estate Consulting What do these income trends mean for housing? More rental demand and downward pressure on homeownership. With 35% of working-age households earning less than 2/3 of the US median income, compared to 31% in 1970, a lower percentage of households are able to qualify to purchase a home, and thus more will rent. More demand for lower-priced homes. The lowest-priced homes in the market have even more demand. In most markets, the months of supply and days on market of the lowest-priced homes are extremely low. Less demand for median-priced homes. The shrinking middle class (down 12% in share of households and 22% in share of aggregate income) creates less demand in the middle of the market. More high-end home demand. With a larger share of households having more than double the median income and a rising share who are buying later in life due to delays in marriage and having children, a rising percentage of households are buying a more expensive than usual first-time home. In our experience, this isn't showing up in the very highest price points, but rather for homes priced up to 50% higher than the median home price in a market. Home builders in particular have benefitted from this demand, selling higher-density new homes in great locations to first-time buyers.",Flickr / Robyn Gallant The shrinking middle class is creating more demand for rentals.

Mark Sullivan,"To say Facebook is having a rough few days is becoming a bigger and bigger understatement. After revelations this weekend that a Trump campaign data analytics firm had accessed the Facebook data of some 50 million unwitting users, Facebook’s stock took a dive on Monday, dropping 5.2% to $175.41. The stock shed another 2.6% of value Tuesday, closing at $168.15, after a Bloomberg report said the Federal Trade Commission is now investigating Facebook’s data privacy practices. [Chart: Google] Shareholders don’t like to see all of a stock’s 2018 growth vaporized in one day. Sometimes they get mad enough to file suit, which is exactly what a class action full of Facebook shareholders did in a federal court in San Francisco Tuesday. The shareholders claim Facebook is negligent for failing to fix privacy and data security issues it cited in an annual report filed in February 2017. So any shareholder who bought Facebook stock since then can join the class action. The Trump campaign’s data analytics firm–Cambridge Analytica–acquired the Facebook data through a Cambridge researcher who harvested the user data via a Facebook app and a common developer API. That API, until 2015, allowed developers to collect data on a user’s friends, without their knowledge. The class action suit says Facebook violated its own data privacy policies by “allowing third parties access to personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent.” Regulators and lawmakers in D.C. have taken a keen interest in talking to both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about the matter, which may relate to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Channel 4 also spoke to Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) about the questions that the House Intelligence Committee would like to ask the two companies. “The dark arts have arrived in full force online and they need to be ferretted out,” he said. The House committee has already interviewed executives from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. But in an undercover Channel 4 News report, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix, said Republicans on the committee were indifferent toward his testimony. “After five minutes — done,” Nix said of his testimony. “They’re politicians, they’re not technical. They don’t understand how it works,” he said in the exchange. The Cambridge Analytica board of directors suspended Nix this afternoon amid a growing controversy over the firm’s election practices and investigations in the U.K. and abroad. Meanwhile, by Tuesday evening, there was still no word from chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. MS","To say Facebook is having a rough few days is becoming a bigger and bigger understatement.

NOEL MURRAY,"Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here. Are “sophomore slumps” real? That’s the question faced by this April’s television lineup, as three highly acclaimed shows — HBO’s “Westworld,” FX’s “Legion” and Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” — all try to follow stellar first seasons with equally strong second ones. Other questions to ask this month: Can “Bosch” and “Brockmire” continue their under-the-radar excellence? Will work by the authors Ian McEwan and E.M. Forster translate well to the small screen? And can Netflix finally make a “Lost in Space” that becomes must-see TV? There’s a lot to ponder this spring. Here’s some of what’s in store: ‘The Child in Time’ Aired: April 1, on PBS Save to Watch Like Benedict Cumberbatch is both the star and a producer in this Masterpiece movie, based on an early Ian McEwan novel about a successful children’s author whose child is abducted. Kelly Macdonald plays his estranged wife, who years after the kidnapping is having trouble coming to grips with what happened. “The Child in Time” promises to touch on themes typical of McEwan’s writing: contextualizing the extremes of human experience and showing how even the most mundane moments shape how we react to tragedy. — ‘The Crossing’ Started: April 2, on ABC Save to Watch Like Like many sci-fi sagas, ABC’s new time-travel drama “The Crossing” uses a fantastical premise to comment on the real world of its time. Steve Zahn stars as a small-town Oregon sheriff who finds himself at the center of an unexpected crisis when dozens of strangers spontaneously appear on a nearby shore, claiming to be American refugees from a war they say will happen 180 years from now. As the visitors from the future share news of a divided world to come, the country of today grapples with how these newcomers — some of whom have special abilities — fit into an already fractious society. — ‘The Last O.G.’ Started: April 3, TBS Save to Watch Like Tracy Morgan returns to television in this broad but quietly ambitious sitcom, playing an ex-con who comes back to Brooklyn after 15 years in prison — only to find that both his old neighborhood and the culture at large are very different. “The Last O.G.” was created in part by the newly minted Oscar-winner Jordan Peele; it also features Tiffany Haddish as the hero’s ex-girlfriend, who tries to help him adjust — even though she has changed a lot, herself. This is ultimately Morgan’s show, however, and it rises and falls on his character’s alternately outraged and wistful reactions to a world where “Brooklyn” has become an adjective. — ‘ Legion ’ (Season 2) Started: April 3, FX Save to Watch Like The first season of this mind-bending Marvel Comics superhero show from FX introduced David Haller (played by Dan Stevens), a telekinetic mutant so powerful that he can’t always tell whether he’s mentally ill or he can actually warp reality with his mind. By the end of the first eight episodes, the hero and his allies had at least temporarily fended off the shadowy government agents and the supernatural villain hounding them. For Season 2, the writer-producer Noah Hawley plans to expand this quasi-psychedelic, prog-rock-inspired universe while taking further advantage of his appealingly eccentric supporting cast — which includes the magnificent Aubrey Plaza as a slippery chaos agent. — ‘Howards End’ Starts: April 8, Starz Save to Watch Like The multi-Oscar-winning 1992 movie version of E.M. Forster’s novel “Howards End” was one of the most popular films from the producing-directing-screenwriting team of Ismail Merchant, James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and it helped initiate a wave of high-class literary adaptations and period dramas. This new four-part TV mini-series — already acclaimed during its BBC run last year — was written by Kenneth Lonergan and stars Hayley Atwell as a freethinking aristocrat who attempts to bridge the gap between her old-money and working-class friends. As with the film and the book, the TV adaptation concerns the inequitable distribution of privilege, between classes and genders. — ‘Killing Eve’ Starts: April 8, BBC America Save to Watch Like The British writer and actor Phoebe Waller-Bridge is best-known for creating and starring in the slice-of-life comedy series “Fleabag,” but her new show “Killing Eve” is a real change of pace. Based on the work of the novelist Luke Jennings, this cat-and-mouse thriller stars Sandra Oh as a meticulous secret agent whose latest assignment involves chasing down a skilled but psychopathic assassin (Jodie Comer) whom she secretly admires. Although “Killing Eve” is about two women trying to murder each other, expect Waller-Bridge to spend at least some time each episode exploring how people become trapped by their own senses of self. — ‘Bosch’ (Season 4) Starts: April 13, Amazon Save to Watch Like In its first season, this Amazon adaptation of the novelist Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch police procedurals came across more like a heavy prestige drama than the sophisticated genre show it was always meant to be. Seasons 2 and 3 corrected its course, leaning more on Connelly’s clever plotting and his eclectic cast of characters, many of whom represent conflicting aspects of the Los Angeles criminal justice system. The sense that law and order in Los Angeles is a delicate structure held in place by bitter rivalries should be a prominent element of Season 4, which is based on the book “Angels Flight,” wherein Detective Bosch investigates the murder of a crusading, anti-cop attorney. — ‘Lost in Space’ Starts: April 13, Netflix Save to Watch Like The original 1960s version of “Lost in Space” was cheap-looking and hopelessly square, but still found a devoted fan base, thanks in large part to its depiction of a loving family — and their helpful robot — surviving the universe’s dangerous unknowns by sticking together. Judging from the early trailers, Netflix’s remake is going to be much more special effects-driven, and hipper to boot, with Molly Parker taking the lead as the Robinson clan’s matriarch and Parker Posey playing the morally ambiguous opportunist Dr. Smith. — Save to Watch Like HBO has had a tough time producing another series as talked-about and internationally successful as “Game of Thrones.” But given how much chatter the first season of “Westworld” generated, it is likely that Season 2 — arriving nearly a year and a half later — could become a sensation. After a finale in December of 2016 that spilled some big secrets and shook up the power structure at the show’s futuristic, robot-populated theme park, the story seems poised to move into another phase, expanding the action to incorporate new locations, new characters and new mysteries for fans to argue about online. — Save to Watch Like One of the 2017 TV season’s most pleasant surprises, the raunchy comedy “Brockmire” took what seemed like a thin concept — an alcoholic former major league baseball announcer tries to resuscitate his career in the minor leagues — and gave it unexpected depth and soul. Last year ended on a mini-cliffhanger, as that comeback threatened the budding romance between Jim Brockmire (Hank Azaria) with the woman who helped save him: a sports-loving small-town entrepreneur played by the excellent Amanda Peet. Fans of Season 1 are no doubt looking forward to more of Jim’s rich-toned, colorfully phrased vulgarity, along with more of the show’s nuanced understanding of what “success” means in 21st-century America. — Save to Watch Like Season 2 of this Hulu adaptation of the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood will have a hard time topping Season 1, which scored an Emmy for best drama series (unprecedented for a streaming series) and also became a relevant conversation piece in a year when sexist privilege made international headlines. But on the assumption that Elisabeth Moss will continue to give a superb performance as a sex slave in a theocratic society — and with Marisa Tomei, Cherry Jones and Clea DuVall joining the cast — there’s plenty of reason to believe this show will keep going strong, even as it moves further beyond the source material. — Also of interest: “King in the Wilderness” (HBO, April 2), “Famous in Love” (Freeform, April 4), “National Treasure: Kiri” (Hulu, April 4), “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” (MTV, April 5), “The Boss Baby: Back in Business” (Netflix, April 6), “Paterno” (HBO, April 7), “An American Murder Mystery: The Staircase” (ID, April 8), “Unforgotten” (PBS, April 8), “New Girl” (Fox, April 10), “Rellik” (Cinemax, April 13), “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas” (HBO, April 13), “The Circus” (Showtime, April 15), “Fear the Walking Dead” (AMC, April 15), “Civilizations” (PBS, April 17), “Into the Badlands” (AMC, April 22), “The 100” (The CW, April 24), “Genius” (Nat Geo, April 24), “Archer” (FXX, April 25) and “Dancing With the Stars” (ABC, April 30).","“The Handmaid’s Tale” and “Westworld” are back, along with a fresh crop of promising new drama, comedy and sci-fi series.",2018-04-05T15:47:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",11 Shows We’ll Be Talking About in April,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/watching/westworld-handmaids-tale-whats-on-tv.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/watching/april-tv-watching/04americans-slide-GXL1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,class-4,1
George Dvorsky,"An analysis of recently declassified U.S. military documents confirms suspicions that, during the late stages of the Vietnam War, a powerful solar storm caused dozens of sea mines to explode. Its a stark reminder of the Suns potential to disrupt our technological activities in unexpected ways. As part of Operation Pocket Money, the U.S. Navy planted a series of Destructor sea mines near strategic ports off the coast of North Vietnam. A few weeks later, on August 4, 1972, crew members aboard U.S. Task Force 77 aircraft suddenly observed a batch of explosions south of Hai Phong. In all, some 20 to 30 explosions were documented in just 30 seconds. Another 25 to 30 patches of muddy water were also observed, indicative of further explosions. It was a bizarre occurrence, as there was no reason why the mines should have gone off. Almost immediately, U.S. officials began to contemplate extreme solar activity as the cause, as revealed in newly declassified U.S. Navy documents. New research published last month in Space Weather, a publication of the American Geophysical Union, agrees with this 46-year-old assessment, while providing new details about this particularly nasty solar storm, which disrupted more than just naval mines. The studys authors, led by Delores Knipp from the University of Colorado and Brian Fraser from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, say the historical event should serve as a call to action. The bombs that exploded were magnetic sea mines, a weapon that dates back to the First World War. When a ship passes above, the mine senses a change to the magnetic field density, triggering a detonation. Within days of the August 1972 incident, U.S. military officials began to wonder if solar activity might have been responsible for the unanticipated mine detonations. As RMIT senior lecturer Brett Carter reports in The Conversation, scientists in the 1970s were already aware of the Suns potential to trigger magnetic field changesthey just werent sure if it was strong enough to induce the mines into detonating. As part of its investigation, the U.S. military sent officials to the Space Environment Laboratory at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) near Boulder, Colorado. After consulting with scientists, the investigators concluded with a high degree of probability that solar storm activity was responsible for the seemingly spontaneous destruction of the magnetic mines. Buried for nearly 50 decades, these now declassified documents were re-analyzed by the Knipp and Fraser team. Indeed, August 1972 experienced an intense period of solar activitysome of the strongest ever recorded. Between August 2 and 4, sunspot region MR 11976 shot out a series of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and clouds of charged particles (which were called plasma drivers back in the 1970s). The coronal mass ejection that caused the sea mines to explode reached Earth in just 14.6 hoursa record for such an event (it normally takes a full day or two for these electromagnetic pulses to reach our planets geomagnetic field and produce magnetic storms). The reason for the speed, the authors say, is that two prior pulses from the Sun on August 2 cleared the path to our planet, resulting in the ultra-fast mass ejection on August 4. In addition to the detonation of the mines, the solar storm caused power disruptions and telegraph line outages, as Carter reports. Based on the evidence presented, we submit that the 4 August 1972 event was a Carrington-class storm, the authors write in the study. The transit time for this event was shorter than the Carrington event. Our planet is due to be hit with a powerful solar storm, an event that happens about once every Read more Read By Carrington event, the researchers are referring to a powerful geomagnetic solar storm that occurred in 1859. It remains one of the most powerful solar storms on record. A similar event today would cause severe disruptions, knocking out satellites, power grids, and, as the new study points out, technologies we dont even know are vulnerable. In closing, the study authors say the 1972 storm is worthy of further examination and suggest that other researchers to pool their archival information together in an effort to learn more. No doubt, the more reliant we are on technology, the more vulnerable we become to these extreme solar events. Knowing as much as we can about geomagnetic storms could prevent a lot of grief.

Reader's Digest,"Some terms are considered too improper to be spoken by royalty. In her book ""Watching the English"", social anthropologist Kate Fox explains which words are banned from the royal family's vocabulary and the surprising reasons why. 1. Tea FYI, we're talking about the meal, not the soothing, healthy drink. In many parts of the U.K., the evening meal that takes place between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. is called tea. However, this term is typically associated with the working class. Members of upper social classes, including the royal family, call this meal dinner or supper. 2. Portion The royals don't watch their portion sizes to lose weight. Instead, they watch their helping sizes, using another upper class term. Do you know the right serving sizes for your favorite foods? Take our portion distortion quiz to find out! 3. Pardon If and when (we can be optimistic!) you get the honor of meeting anyone in the royal family, you'll want to act on your most polite behavior, excusing yourself when necessary. But whatever you do, don't say ""pardon."" We may think it's formal, but apparently it's like a curse word to the royals. Instead, say ""sorry"" or ""sorry, what?"" After all, it is the magic word that will make you more trustworthy. 4. Toilet Blame this word's French origin for why it's banned in royal circles. ( However, everyone should know these important French phrases.) If you're looking for a restroom in Buckingham Palace, ask for the loo or the lavatory. Don't expect to hear any British slang words from a royal. WPA Pool/Getty Images 5. Lounge While some Brits use the phrase ""living room"" to describe a main front room, the more common term is lounge. The royal family, on the other hand, uses neither. They refer to it as a drawing room or sitting room. 6. Perfume When your friend says she found the secret to making perfume last longer, stop her mid-sentence. The royals don't say ""perfume,"" remind her. They say ""scent,"" as odd as that might sound.

SAM ANDERSON,"I’ve been around. Once, in the middle of Marrakesh, a man threw a monkey on my back. I kept walking, pretending there was no monkey, until eventually it jumped off. I have eaten ant eggs in Mexico City, paella in Seville, fried squash blossoms in Florence and thick mouthfuls of Guinness in Dublin. I was once publicly scolded, in florid Italian, for almost being pickpocketed by a child in Rome. On the 22nd floor of a Tokyo hotel, I was shaken awake at 4 a.m. by an earthquake. I have walked under bright midnight skies in Reykjavik and stood in Edinburgh gaping at an extinct volcano with a castle on top. None of these exotic places, however, has captured my imagination quite like the humble outpost of Oklahoma City. We tend to approach cities with a mental checklist of urban greatness. We want streets visibly teeming with life. We want world-class museums, immense parks, rare shops, grand boulevards. We want strong coffee and dedicated bike lanes, major concert halls and interesting jobs. We want deep history — the overwhelming feeling that a city has built itself up, layer by layer, over the course of countless generations. Oklahoma City has none of these things, at least not obviously, not at any kind of major scale. If there is a Mount Rushmore of great world cities, O.K.C. is nowhere near it; it’s more like the discount parking lot in the next town, with intermittent shuttle service. The place sits way out in the middle of the Great Plains, profoundly landlocked, 1,300 miles from both Los Angeles and Washington. It is home not to the Getty or the Smithsonian but to the American Banjo Museum. If someone tells you she is from Oklahoma City, your brain will process that information in the same area it uses to process different shades of brown socks or clouds that almost look like something but don’t. Even the name “Oklahoma City” sounds like something a panicked kid would make up on a pop quiz about state capitals. Before I went there, I had basically no interest. On the rare occasions when Oklahoma City passed through my mind, I pictured a generic everyplace — the sort of beige and blocky cityscape (warehouse, shed, warehouse, garbage can, shed) that a 1980s video-game designer might have invented for characters to fight in. But I was wrong. In 2012, this magazine sent me — quite innocently — to Oklahoma City to write about its ascendant basketball team, the Thunder. I became obsessed not only with the team but also with the city — so obsessed, in fact, that I spent the next five years writing a book about it. Oklahoma City, it turned out, was the most secretly interesting place I had ever been.

Joshua Calixto,"Hearthstone games rarely go according to plan. Sometimes you draw the wrong cards and have to make the most of the situation. Sometimes your opponent discards your most important combo piece and you have to find a new way to win the game. Once you play the game enough, you start to get familiar with the decks youre facing and you learn to avoid your opponents potential disruptions. But there is a card that throws that all out the window, and its the backbone of Hearthstone s most unpredictable deck. Every thirty days, we take a close look at a card thats been getting a lot of buzzgood or badin the world of competitive Hearthstone. Its called Academic Espionage, and for 4 Mana, it shuffles 10 random cards from your opponents class into your deck. This alone wouldnt be too helpful, but heres the kicker: better, The cost of all those cards is changed to 1 mana. If you play two Academic Espionage cards in the course of a game, youve got a ton of potential for drawing a huge board-swinging card thatll instantly win a match. The problem with decks built around Espionage is that most of the other cards are meant to accomplish two things: help you survive until your Espionages get rolling, and draw as much as possible once the Espionage cards are actually live. Since the Rogue class doesnt have great survivability on its own, most Academic Espionage decks lack the initiative to stay alive against more aggressive decks. Even against more late-game oriented opponents, theres no guarantee that the cards you draw from Academic Espionage will be good enough to justify the cost of a 4-mana spell that doesnt immediately impact the board. But when it works, boy does it feel good. Theres nothing quite like playing a huge card-draw tool like Sprint and pulling a trio of immediately-playable board-swinging Legendaries and watching the opponent slowly lose hope. Decks that use the card take some skill to play, too, which is always a plus when discussing a cards fun factor over time. Do you rely on Academic Espionage for your board swings, or do you go all-in on a card like FalDorei Strider, which shuffles three 4/4 minions into your deck that are immediately summoned when drawn? You might be better off focusing on a non-Espionage strategy if youre against a class like Warlock, whose cards are typically of lower quality than other classes. In the games where you do get the chance to play Academic Espionage, everything feels wonderful. Your deck turns into a treasure box full of possibilities. The act of drawing a card feels like opening a gift on Christmas morning. And then, when you sift through a few just-ok Espionage cards and finally pull a 1-mana Ultimate Infestation or Frost Lich Jaina, you crack an involuntary smirk. You play a bunch of small stuff and wait until your very last Mana to destroy your opponents morale.

Timothy B. Lee,"Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. reader comments 4 Tesla’s factory in Fremont is a “hotbed for racist behavior,” according to a a legal complaint filed in California's Alameda County Superior Court on Monday and reported by Bloomberg. Marcus Vaughn is an African-American who worked on Tesla’s factory floor from April to October of this year. Vaughn charges that workers and managers on the factory floor routinely used the n-word within his earshot. When he complained to the human resources department, Vaughn says, he was fired for “not having a positive attitude.” According to Bloomberg, Vaughn is seeking to be the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of more than 100 black Tesla workers. The lawsuit was filed by Lawrence Organ, the same civil rights lawyer who sued on behalf of three other black Tesla workers for racial discrimination last month. Those men also said they routinely heard people on the factory floor using racial epithets. A third lawsuit, alleging similar facts, was filed in March. The complaint also quotes a May e-mail from CEO Elon Musk that seemed dismissive of problems at the factory. “Part of not being a huge jerk is considering how someone might feel who is part of [a] historically less represented group,” Musk allegedly wrote. “Sometimes these things happen unintentionally, in which case you should apologize. In fairness, if someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology.” “The law doesn’t require you to have a thick skin,” Organ told Bloomberg. “When you have a diverse workforce, you need to take steps to make sure everyone feels welcome in that workforce.”",Worker says he routinely heard the n-word at Tesla’s Fremont factory.,2017-11-14T20:00:42Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Tesla facing potential class-action lawsuit for racial discrimination,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/tesla-facing-potential-class-action-lawsuit-for-racial-discrimination/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/8763130149_403887bf29_z-640x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,class-4,1
Stephanie Schomer,"September 4, 2018 5 min read In the Women Entrepreneur series My First Moves, we talk to founders about that pivotal moment when they decided to turn their business idea into a reality -- and the first steps they took to make it happen. You might not know Lauren Kleban, but you definitely know her clients. Celebrities including Emmy Rossum and Busy Phillips have become fans and genuine brand advocates of LEKFit, the dance-inspired fitness method Kleban, a trained professional dancer, developed to satisfy her own workout cravings. What started as a side hustle following the birth of her first child has blossomed into a fitness craze, attracting women from Hollywood and well beyond. Here’s how Kleban did it. 1. Solve your own problem. The early part of Kleban’s career was as a professional dancer, but after she became a mom, life on the road as part of a tour was no longer a stable option. “I started teaching dance at studios in Los Angeles, and I always found myself doing multiple workouts,” Kleban says. “I’d teach a class, then go to Runyon Canyon for a run. I never felt like I was getting enough, but I also didn’t have time, as a mom, to spend two hours working out every day.” So she set out to create a fitness program that would serve all her needs -- in under an hour. She wanted to fuse the benefits she got from both ballet or yoga and running, in one contained class. “That’s where the rebounder came in,” Kleban says of the mini trampoline her workouts utilize. Once she found a formula she liked, she’d test it out on her fitness clients. RELATED: The Founder of Miss Jessie's Got Retail Placement by Asking a Stock Boy for Intel. 2. Find a home base -- anywhere you can. As her program developed, Kleban realized that there was a larger desire for these kinds of workouts than she had even anticipated, and she and her husband agreed to give it a go and invest in the program as more than just a side hustle. “We moved to a new house in Hollywood and intentionally bought a property with a yard that could accommodate a trampoline,” she says. “We built out a space for classes without really knowing what was going to happen.” The classes started maxing out -- fast. “The studio is in our garage and the guestroom is the dressing room, waiting area, and shower,” Kleban says. We’ve already had to revamp the space a few times.” 3. Ignore the naysayers. Given the high demand of her classes -- which accommodate a small number of clients, about nine per class -- Kleban was eager to find ways to reach more people. “My husband has a tech background and suggested putting the content online,” Kleban says. But plenty of people advised her against it. “People in the health space, other entrepreneurs, was like, ‘Don’t put it online, that’s a horrible idea!’ But we did it anyway -- and it was immediately crazy and has grown ever since. And we’ve done zero paid advertising.” Streaming the classes helped reach women far outside of L.A., and thanks to some celebrity clientele that regularly post videos from Kleban’s in-person classes to social media -- Busy Phillips is a well-known devotee -- fervor for LEKFit rapidly grew beyond the Hollywood Hills. RELATED: How This Founder Bootstrapped an Office Furniture Company That Targeted What Other Furniture Companies Are Missing. 4. Troubleshoot. Putting workout classes online, however, is easier said than done, and perfecting the model took a lot of trial and error. “At first it was just me facing the camera, and we quickly realized that people don’t want that,” Kleban says. “We also did short pieces of content, thinking people would want to piece their own workouts together. But they didn’t want that either.” Kleban and her husband brought in a proper production manager, lit the studio and started filming 50-minute classes from beginning to end, capturing the participants in addition to Kleban and her growing roster of instructors. 5. Expand your operation when the time (and location) is right. “At this point, there are people walking through my backyard that I don’t know,” Kleban says about her homegrown business. Now the mother of two, she’s ready to move the operation outside of her home and is preparing to open the company’s first flagship location in Los Angeles -- and spent a long time hunting for the perfect spot. “Parking in L.A. is a very big deal, and it’s very difficult, and there are different laws in different areas,” she says, laughing. “We’ve been in deals and found out there was no parking, and we’ve found spaces that appear to have parking, but the actual lot was sold 25 years ago. So we had to keep going until we found what made sense for us and our clients.” RELATED: The Founder of a Macaron Bakery Used Her Past Experience as a Photo Editor to Build Her Instagram-Ready Brand. 6. Never stop evolving. Kleban changes the content of her classes every week. “The concept stays the same, but the content is fresh,” she says. “I test [each new class] on my Saturday classes, to make sure that people are happy and that the workout feels good. We shoot it, upload it and it’s ready for viewers on Wednesday morning.” And the cycle never stops.","Lauren Kleban's fitness classes are beloved by Hollywood tastemakers, but she found a larger audience by filming and streaming her content.",2018-09-04T13:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",How the Founder of Fitness Craze LEKFit Built a Business From Her Backyard,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/318932,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20180823173509-LEKfit-25.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,class-4,1
Daniel Gessner,"The following is a transcript of the video.
Narrator: German aftermarket supplier Klassen builds only what can be described as private jets on wheels. The company takes premium vehicles and turns them into deluxe stretch limousines that cater to the demands of the most high-level clients. This rendering illustrates just how far the company lengthens factory vehicles in order to provide the space and comfort their customers desire. This Mercedes-Benz stretch V-Class van is a prime example. Inside passengers will find a huge flat-screen monitor with built-in PlayStation 4 and multimedia system, automatic folding tables, Champagne flutes, a coffee maker, a humidor, a biometric safe for your valuables, and more. In addition, everything from the interior lighting to the cabinets can be controlled remotely via iPad. 
 Klassen's COO Samuel Klassen describes just what goes into designing these tricked-out vehicles. 
Samuel Klassen: Typically the time to build a van takes approximately 3 to 4 months. It depends which options the customer would like to have. Sometimes we have requests from customers to install a toilet, special multimedia systems, or extra controls. Sometimes they want to have the whole interior covered by special leather. We also have in our product range stretch cars and armored vehicles. Time to build a car like this can take approximately as one year. 
Narrator: As luxurious as Klassen's stretch V-Class is, it may not even be the most impressive offering in the company's extensive catalog which includes a stretch Mercedes-Maybach sedan and a Range Rover over 1 meter longer than its production model. 
Samuel: The most expensive vehicle we build for now is the Range Rover Autobiography. We stretch it by 1 meter, make it armored, and add many options that make for comfortable travel and luxury. And the price of this car is more than 1 million. 
Narrator: Klassen isn't done adding to its arsenal just yet. On the way is a stretch Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV equipped with all new technology from the luxury tuner. 
Samuel: We are still working on it. So we will stretch it by 1 meter and make it armored. And also, we will install our new technology that we have already developed so that the interior will be controlled by voice control. 
Narrator: So who can afford such an elaborately customized car? Let's just say it's not your average car shopper. 
Samuel: So we cannot talk about our customers' names, but our customers are presidents, famous people, and big business people listed on the Forbes list.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / The Google Pixel and Pixel XL reader comments 4 The same San Francisco law firm that recently settled arbitration claims against LG over the ""bootloop"" issue has now filed a new proposed class-action lawsuit against Google. This time, the firm is alleging manufacturing defects in the microphone on Pixel and Pixel XL handsets. The firm's clients—Patricia Weeks of Florida and Waleed Anbar of California—say that they both purchased Pixel phones in 2016. However, months after their purchases, they both said that they experienced a defective microphone. The case, Weeks v. Google, was filed Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California. When they approached Google's customer service, they were told that Google would not refund them or offer a replacement. ""Dr. Weeks did not know that the Pixel phones have defective microphones when she bought her phone. Had Google disclosed the defect to her, she would not have bought a Pixel or would have paid substantially less for it,"" the complaint states. Both plaintiffs are being represented by Girard Gibbs. Other users began reporting faulty microphones around the same timeframe, not long after the Pixel's launch in October 2016. The lawsuit claims that, among other allegations, Google is in breach of its own warranty, which states that the company, ""will in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by law either repair your Phone using new or refurbished parts, replace your Phone with a new or refurbished Phone functionally at least equivalent to yours, or accept the return of the Phone in exchange for a refund of the purchase price you paid for the Phone.""

Bukaty) The Navy's futuristic destroyer Zumwalt is some two years away from being ready for battle — but service leaders still don't know what to load in its main weapon. In late 2016, the service canceled plans to buy the long-range land attack projectile, or LRLAP, a round designed to be fired from the ship's massive 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems weapon. At about $800,000 per round, the ammo was just too pricey to load up on the three ships in the limited Zumwalt large destroyer class. But it's now 2018, and the ship is expected to reach initial operational capability by fiscal 2020. And there's still no substitute round for the AGS. In a briefing at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium, Capt. Kevin Smith, Major Program Manager for the DDG-1000 [Zumwalt] Program Office, said the Navy continues to monitor future technologies and watch industry for a solution. ""The threat's always changing out here and the requirements that the U.S. Navy's looking at, as I said, this is a multi-mission ship,"" Smith said. ""There's lots of things this ship can do but, right now, we're going to be looking hard at what is the best technology to meet the requirements for the gun."" An SH-60R assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 21 flies near USS Zumwalt as the ship travels to its new home in San Diego, California. US Navy/Liz Wolter Each of the destroyers costs roughly $4 billion. The USS Zumwalt, the first in class, was commissioned in late 2016; its successor, the Michael Monsoor, is expected to be delivered to the Navy in March. The final ship, the Lyndon B. Johnson, is set for delivery by 2020. Capt. James Kirk, the first commanding officer of the Zumwalt, indicated that the designated purpose of the ship itself might be affected by its lack of a working mega-weapon. ""We're going to be looking at shifting the mission set for this ship to a surface strike, land-and -sea-strike surface platform,"" he said. ""We're predecisional on budget... but that's what the focus is going to be, on a long-range surface strike platform, in contrast with previous focus on a littoral volume suppressive fires, in close to land."" The USS Zumwalt. Raytheon The AGS is designed to deliver a high rate of fire, as well as precision strikes. As it stands, the Zumwalt is not without weapons: It's built to carry RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles; Tactical Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles; Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Missiles; and two MK-46 30 mm chain guns. Officials have discussed the possibility of arming the AGS with a hypervelocity projectile, such as the one the Navy is currently testing out with its futuristic railgun prototype, but a decision on whether to move forward has yet to be made. ""We're monitoring that technical maturation to see do we get that to get the kind of ranges and capabilities that we want, what's the right kind of bang for the buck in cost and capability for the Navy,"" Kirk said. ""We're monitoring that, but we have not made a decision on that.""","(AP Photo/Robert F.
