Mallory Locklear,"If you want to avoid the fee, you'll have to select another showing, but if you stick with the high-demand showtime, whatever credit card you have on file with MoviePass will be charged. Tapping on the Peak Pricing showtime will display what the added fee is, but the amount will depend on the movie, the time and the level of popularity. After selecting a showtime in Peak Pricing, the app will take you to a confirmation screen that shows the details of the added charge. In the coming weeks, MoviePass says it will begin offering a Peak Pass that will let users waive one Peak Pricing fee per month. Customers with an annual pass won't be subject to Peak Pricing until their subscription renews. ""The new peak pricing feature is aimed at providing additional flexibility for us and our users around popular movies and times for which there is limited inventory,"" MoviePass' website says. ""We are building peak pricing to be flexible and will be able to tweak it as needed based on the community's response."" The company also takes aim at AMC's new subscription offer saying the theater chain's plan ""means you pay more for way fewer options.""

Shannon Liao,"Tumblr’s ban on adult content is now in effect and users will begin to see explicit posts disappear from public view. Media showing sex acts, exposed genitals, and “female-presenting” nipples will be hidden. All posts that are currently flagged as explicit are now being hidden from view, according to Tumblr, and that includes posts that users are in the process of appealing. In addition to what’s already gone, more adult content is going to be flagged in coming weeks, Tumblr says, and it hopes that the automated tools will be more accurate at picking out what counts as explicit. Tumblr announced the ban on December 3rd to immediate backlash. Users began to mourn the site’s diverse sex positive communities and massive archives of explicit content. Some began to share a guide posted to Github for exporting Tumblr blogs on Windows, while others wrote eulogies for the site. Tumblr is acknowledging users’ reactions while not changing the policies In a blog post that went up today, Tumblr apologized to users: “We are sorry that this has not been an easy transition and we know we can do a better job of explaining what we’re doing.” It said the change would be a slow process that involves “flagging tens of billions of GIFs, videos, and photos.” Many users also criticized Tumblr’s decision to consider “female-presenting nipples” as explicit, while male-presenting nipples were still okay. Some pointed out that in the case of non-binary, genderfluid, or trans individuals, it would be confusing where the line would be drawn on whose nipples would be considered explicit. In its blog post today, Tumblr has added the caveat, “yeah, we know you hate this term,” but maintained the language and distinction. After Tumblr initially announced the ban, users immediately began to see innocuous posts of turtles, dogs, and dolls all flagged as explicit. Photos containing a bit of skin in leather tights or cleavage such as in a Fashion Week show were also flagged, despite not fitting Tumblr’s definition of adult content. Whether these posts are hidden from view today depends on whether users’ appeals were processed in time. “We understand and agree that there have been too many wrongfully flagged posts since we announced the policy change,” says Tumblr. But if users don’t appeal their posts, then they’re out of luck. That could also be a problem for popular older accounts, which may not have anyone monitoring them to appeal the overly aggressive moderation. Flagged content will be hidden, but not deleted, Tumblr emphasized. That will allow posts to be appealed even after they’re removed from public view. This is explicit content. WILL SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN!! #Tumblr pic.twitter.com/WQ5WCq3fgb — Emily | Animator & Illustrator☃️ (@EDAnimation) December 4, 2018 Tumblr says that its automated tools are getting smarter over time, so even if this cute photo of a dog is censored for now, eventually the tools should learn better. It also reassures bloggers that “all appeals will be sent to a real, live human who can make the appropriate call.” More clarity was given on Tumblr’s nipple ban, with Tumblr saying nipples would be allowed in depictions of gender-confirmation surgery, breastfeeding, post-mastectomy surgery, and other health-related situations. Nudity in politics, sculptures, and illustrations are likewise allowed. But users will still need to appeal if their posts are misclassified, or they’ll remain hidden.","Tumblr’s ban on adult content is now in effect and users will begin to see explicit posts disappear from public view.

Josh Ocampo,"Headed to the airport this morning? You might want to double-check (and even triple-check) your flights departure time before settling at the gate.
Today, major airlines including American, Delta, Jetblue, Southwest, and United Airlines are reporting system-wide operating issues, causing delays as long as two hours for some passengers stranded on the tarmac.
Last weekend, some 250 passengers on a United flight headed to Hong Kong from Newark, New Jersey
Read more Read
In a tweet, American Airlines said the issue involved an AeroData outage, software that measures weight and balance so that a flight can depart safely. Southwest, however, has said that issues have since been resolved and Delta confirmed that data is now operating normally, with no cancellations planned.
Still, in response to the news, the FAA has tweeted that passengers should contact their airline directly for flight information and any necessary updates (and one airport in Florida reported as many as 55 delays this morning, alone).
What should you do before making your way to the airport? Call your airline and download your airlines app for any updates as soon as possible. Checking Twitter for your airport isnt such a bad idea eitheryou might come across some angry fliers with helpful information.

Nick Douglas,"I’m a big Instapaper hoarder. I once racked up an unread list of over 500 articles, essays, stories, and other short-form pieces (plus a couple novels) in that app. I was never going to read everything I’d saved. It was time to clean out my Instapaper. And if you have a clogged reading list on your Instapaper, your Pocket, or your Evernote, it’s time to clean out yours too. Like any to-do list, a reading list often represents outsized aspirations. When you save a story, you’re imagining yourself as the person who’s read that story: a person who understands Bitcoin, a person with opinions on Lady Bird, a person who’s been emotionally moved by “Cat Person.” But we can’t always be all these people. (For example, no one will ever understand Bitcoin.) We’re all very busy, and every day there are more articles published online than one person could read in a lifetime. If you hope to read what’s really important, you need to narrow your definition of important. Here are three strategies for trimming your list: Strategy 1: The Marie Kondo Method In The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, Marie Kondo recommends holding each of your possessions against your chest and asking, “Does this spark joy?” You can try the same with your reading list: “Will I enjoy reading this?” Don’t think about how it feels to have read the article. It always feels good to have read something. What matters is how it feels to read it. And “enjoy” doesn’t have to mean “feel happy.” You can “enjoy” reading a grueling piece about war or depression, by learning from it or soaking in whatever strong emotion other than boredom. You can “enjoy” required reading, by feeling prepared for your meeting or midterms. If that feels too abstract, ask this instead: “Can I get away with not reading this article?” Is the relevant news cycle already over? Will someone publish a simpler recap of this piece later? Will someone publish a deeper dive? In any of these cases, archive that article. One last question to ask yourself: “Why did I save this?” If you don’t recall, and the article doesn’t sound particularly fascinating, ditch it. There are some things you really do have to read: Things for work, for school, for your friend who asks you every day whether you’ve read their novel. But if all you feel is some vague sense that “everyone is supposed to read this,” I’m giving you permission right now to archive that sucker. When people ask if you read it, say “Sorry, I was busy!” When people argue about the article, don’t join them. You might feel left out, but is that really worse than plodding through that boring article? Probably not! I love books. I can’t leave a bookstore without at least one. But I also have a tendency to buy… Read more Read Strategy 2: The Speed-Read At the start of one typical reading session—your commute, your lunch break, your kids’ nap—check how many pieces are in your reading list. Then guess how many of them you could skim through, just to “get the gist,” before your session is over. Now try to beat that guess. You might get “bogged down” in actually reading one of the articles. That’s not terrible; it’s kind of the goal of this whole exercise. But if you notice yourself doing it, hold onto that article for later—it passed the test—and find something more skimmable. I’ve been both a student and an instructor, and I totally get it. Textbooks are dry and hard to… Read more Read Strategy 3: The Great Sort If you’re too timid for the methods above, but you still feel anxious over your pile of unreads, make a “long-term” folder. Any time you’re reading an article and you’re tempted to switch to another, or even to Twitter, move that article to the long-term folder. If you have a few old articles at the top of your list that you always scroll past, move them to the long-term folder. Everything you’re at all tepid about, move it to that folder. Then you can read all the fun stuff in the home folder (your “inbox” folder), before moving back to the long-term folder and digging through that as you please. It’s possible that you’ll never get around to opening that long-term folder. If so, that’s great! You were probably never going to read those pieces anyway—which is fine —but they’re still there if you change your mind. Maintaining Sanity I don’t believe Marie Kondo’s promise that if you clean out your home once, you’ll never fill it with junk again. You’re not going to magically stop saving boring articles. But you can get better at archiving them. Sort your articles oldest to newest, and don’t let yourself skip past articles (if you keep skipping one, archive it). To stay aware of your backlog, enable the “unread items” badge on your reading app. Whenever that count gets too high, do a skim session. Test different methods and pick whatever works for you. But whatever method you use, remember: No one reads everything. And no one should.","I’m a big Instapaper hoarder.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times A day later Oprah Winfrey came to document the dig-out with a camera crew. In a community filled with celebrities, her estate is one street over. The bucket brigade has dug out both mansions and modest bungalows. They are also trying to save oak trees from suffocation. Among the diggers is Carol Bartoli, 73, a chef and caterer, who has outlasted some of the younger volunteers. After the mudslide, “the attitude was if the mud is on your property it’s your responsibility,” she said. “I just thought, I’m going to help.” With the rainy season all but over, the group works under bright blue skies. But in the hills above Montecito, boulders are perched precariously as if waiting for their cue to tumble. “If you live between the mountain and the ocean it’s almost par for the course,” said Josiah Hamilton, a real estate agent and a leader of the bucket brigade. “It’s something you have to be prepared for.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

But after mud crashed through the house in January, blowing the front door off its hinges, there was one item she hoped to retrieve: a portrait of her late mother drawn by a Canadian artist, Frederick Varley. Four days after the mudslide she returned with a sheriff’s deputy, wading through thigh-deep mud that was as sticky as peanut butter. Among tree roots and shards of glass, Ms. Morrow spotted the corner of the picture frame.

Jon Fingas,"The channel launched in December 2006 and was Nintendo's first big foray into a digital media download service on its consoles. It reflected Nintendo's perpetual caution around online features (hence the Wii Points system), but it also freed you from having to buy physical copies at a time when that was still a novelty for many gamers. How many Wii owners remember downloading their first WiiWare title or Virtual Console flashback? It even became a bit of a cultural phenomenon -- there's a good chance you remember the Wii Shop Channel's synth-laden bossa nova soundtrack by heart.
You probably won't wax nostalgic for too long if you own a Wii U or Switch. The channel's successor, the eShop, is clearly an improvement with direct purchases and a catalog that includes more of the games you see in retail stores. Even so, we wouldn't blame you for shedding a few tears. While the Wii enjoyed one of the longest runs in console history (you can still buy new games for it), it's that much closer to fading away.","It's a sad day for loyal fans of the original Wii.

Kris Holt,"Echo Dot The revamped Echo Dot has a new look, with rounded edges, and packs more punch, with a 1.6-inch driver delivering 70 percent louder audio than the previous model. Amazon says the speaker has lower distortion and enhanced bass. Of course, it can connect to other speakers and other apps and devices over Bluetooth. Amazon claims Echo Dot is the best-selling speaker ever, and will hope to continue its success when the latest version ships in October. You can pre-order one for the same $50 price as the last model. Echo Sub If you're craving more low-end tones from your Echo setup, you might consider the Echo Sub. It delivers down-firing, 100W of bass through its 6-inch woofer, and you can pair it with an Echo or two to create a 2.1 stereo system. Echo Sub will set you back $130 (or you can bundle it with a pair of Echo speakers) and pre-orders are open now. Echo Plus Amazon updated its Echo Plus, which includes a smart hub for a range of connected devices. This time around, it has revamped speakers and a feature called local voice control, which lets you adjust your various smart home devices even if your internet connection is down. There's a temperature sensor too, so Echo Plus can tell smart thermostats to turn up the heat when it gets a little chilly. You can pre-order one now for $150, and it starts shipping in October. Echo Input Not to be outdone by Chromecast Audio, Amazon has its own audio dongle called Echo Input, including Bluetooth, a microphone and a 3.5mm jack. It doesn't have a speaker, so you'll need to connect it to your existing audio setup. It's a way to add Alexa connectivity to audio gear you may already own. It costs $35 and pre-orders are open, but it ships later in the year. Echo Link and Echo Link Amp New arrivals to the Echo lineup this year, Echo Link Amp and Echo Link, are for those who are more particular than most about audio quality. The former includes a 60W two-channel amplifier with digital and analog connectors. Echo Link, meanwhile, connects to your audio setup to stream high-fidelity music. That costs $200 and ships later this year, while Echo Link Amp, which Amazon will release in early 2019, costs $300. Echo Show Amazon's smart display received an overhaul, as the company beefed up Echo Show with a 10-inch display alongside more powerful speakers and mics. It has web browsers (Firefox and Amazon's Silk) this time around, along with Skype video chat support and Vevo music videos. It ships next month with the same $230 price tag. Again, pre-orders are open now. Fire TV Recast Amazon is dipping into the DVR game this year with Fire TV Recast. It works with over-the-air networks using an antenna, and will send live TV or recorded shows to Fire tablets, Fire TV, Echo Show or mobile devices. And, of course, you can use Alexa to control it. The $230 version has a pair of tuners that let you record two shows at the same time and enough storage space (500 GB) for around 75 hours of HD TV. The $280 model doubles the tuners, simultaneous show recordings and storage space. You can pre-order them now and they'll ship in November. Echo Auto It probably shouldn't come as a surprise that Amazon wants to put Alexa in your car, even if you don't have a fancy dashboard infotainment system. Enter Echo Auto. It's a dongle that connects to your audio system and uses phone's cell connection (since you need internet access for Alexa to work). Along with the conversational assistance you'd expect with Alexa, you can use Echo Auto for directions. Echo Auto isn't quite ready to hit Amazon's storefront yet. When it does, it'll cost $50, though you can request an invite to use the pre-release model later this year, which will be half the price. Smart Plugs Amazon has found a way to connect Alexa to pretty much any wall-powered device using its Smart Plugs. Once you've linked them to an Echo or the Alexa app, you can turn devices on and off, or set timers. Smart Plugs cost $25 each. Pre-orders are open and they'll ship in October. AmazonBasics Microwave So, about that microwave. Like the Smart Plugs, you'll need to use another Echo device or the Alexa app to control the AmazonBasics Microwave with your voice. It has a number of voice presets to help you cook food quickly. The best part? If you run out of popcorn, you can automatically order more in a pinch with Amazon's Dash feature. You can pre-order one now for $60 before shipments start later in the year. Echo Wall Clock For $30, you can pick up an Echo Wall Clock which, strangely enough, has Alexa connectivity. Again, you'll need to use an Echo speaker or the Alexa app to bark commands at it. It gives you a visual display of any timers you have in place using LED minute markers and a countdown for the last 60 seconds. The clock updates to the correct time automatically, and it will ship later this year.

According to Space, SpaceX was commissioned to make a secretive payload mission by defense technology company Northrop Grumman. The space world just found out about the move earlier this week, just a few days before it was to launch. It has since been delayed multiple times, and SpaceX is ""preserving its range opportunity"" for Friday, November 17, which basically means it might decide to launch after all.

ADAM NAGOURNEY and THOMAS FULLER,"In Sacramento, the former governor — and occasional actor — broke with national Republicans (at least of today) when he championed environmental protection efforts, including stringent emission controls. In sentiments also reflected by Mr. Kasich and Mr. Mayes, Mr. Schwarzenegger said the Republican Party had to be “environmentally progressive, socially liberal and fiscally conservative” in order to be competitive. “Our party is giving them Twitter fights instead of answers,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said. “And it is sinking us. It is time to return to the issues.” “The politics of division and anger and resentment can drive a strong base to the polls, yes,” he said. “But it is tearing our country apart at the seams. And nothing is getting done.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

JILL COWAN,"Those affected by the smell say it is much more potent than the pot cloud above a Grateful Dead concert or the medicinal smell of a cannabis dispensary.
In the case of the Uppal family, the cannabis was being grown in greenhouses nestled in the vineyard several hundred feet away. One member of the Uppal family with muscular dystrophy, Jiwan, had trouble breathing and was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital.
The smell was so bad we couldnt even go outside, Ms. Uppal said.
The smell stretched to the nearby Old Adobe Elementary Charter School, where children playing outside asked what the odor was, according to the schools principal, Jeff Williamson.
Some parents were really upset about it, Mr. Williamson said.
With three other families in the neighborhood, the Uppals sued the pot grower, Carlos Zambrano, who was found to be operating without a license, according to the Uppals lawyer, Kevin Block.
The Uppals and their neighbors sued in federal court under the RICO Act the decades-old law designed to prosecute organized crime to stop the cannabis operation and recover $60,000 they paid in legal fees so far.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"“And it’s not just the individual, either; we go to work and our families always have in the back of their minds that something can happen,” Mr. Feyh said. “My wife had her worst nightmare come true.” Ashley Iverson lost her husband, Cory, in December while he was fighting the Thomas Fire in Ventura County. Mr. Iverson, a fire apparatus engineer with CalFire, had already worked a 24-hour shift but was helping put out spot fires when he became trapped in a gulch. The fire reached him before he could escape. Thousands honored his sacrifice at a funeral in San Diego, his hometown, just days before Christmas. Ms. Iverson was four months pregnant at the time, and today is caring for their two daughters. Sometimes she is overcome by pain, she said. “How can I raise my kids without my best friend? Why don’t they get to have him in their lives?” Ms. Iverson hopes to turn her husband’s tragic death into something positive. She is laying the groundwork for a foundation in his name that will advocate expanding mental health awareness among fire responders and firefighters. She said she finds comfort in knowing that he had dedicated himself to helping people. “After it happened, I took a breath. O.K., the worst has happened. Now what? Where do we go from here?” Ms. Iverson said. “A lot of widows, their life is over. I feel like Cory has given me legs. I’m just so damn proud of him and everything he did.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)","Monday: A longer and more intense wildfire season, a divisive rent control initiative, and Berkeley on a budget.",2018-07-30T13:14:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Increasing Strain on State Firefighters,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/us/california-today-firefighters.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/world/30caltoday-2/30caltoday-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
GABRIELLE GUZ and ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"It depends on what your first language is: It’s easier for an adult to learn another language that comes from the same language family as one’s first language, Mr. Liu explained. How can adult learners practice a second language outside the classroom? Find ways to immerse yourself in the language, said Elizabeth Zackheim, chief executive of ABC Languages, a language-learning center in Midtown. “Next time you visit a country where the language is spoken, sign up for a course at a local language school or hire a tutor to work with you daily for a couple of hours,” Ms. Zackheim advised. “The most important thing is to get out there and use your language as much as possible and have fun with it.” She added: “Success happens every day you show up for class or create a moment of connection in your foreign language. Speaking ‘correctly’ is nice, but you don’t have to be perfect to make a moment happen.” If you’re considering learning another language, look no further than our backyard. A few options in New York: independent schools, like ABC Language in Midtown or Bell Language in Midwood, Brooklyn; and free courses, online learning platforms or conversation groups (in English and other languages) at various branches of the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Library systems.

JENNIFER MEDINA and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up.) Will Los Angeles public school teachers go on strike? It has been nearly two months since the citys teachers union overwhelmingly voted in favor of one. Since then, district officials and the union, United Teachers Los Angeles, had three negotiating sessions with a state mediator and are not any closer to an agreement than when they began. Now, with the failed mediation behind them, they are in the midst of independent fact-finding, which will give an analysis of the financial state of the district. School officials all over the district are readying for what many believe is an inevitable strike, this week sending parents a guide to prepare. Under state law, the union cannot strike until after the financial analysis is completed a process that will last several weeks. But union leaders have repeatedly said that the contract talks, which have already gone on for 18 months and stalled again in July, have dramatically disintegrated. Alex Caputo-Pearl, the unions president, seems ready to call for the first teacher strike in Los Angeles in nearly 30 years. Union officials have been particularly incensed in the months since Austin Beutner, a former investment banker, took over as superintendent. Mr. Beutner and members of the school board say that the district would go broke if it accepted what the union called its last, best and final offer.","Tuesday: United Teachers Los Angeles negotiates with district officials, a tech-themed crossword, and In-N-Out Burger turns 70.",2018-10-23T12:59:42Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Los Angeles Teachers Prepare to Strike,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/california-today-los-angeles-teachers-strike.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/us/23californiatoday1/23californiatoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"The problem is that we still have folks who refuse to get their children vaccinated, Dr. Barbot said, and that has consequences. Five of the infected were unvaccinated, and one was too young to have been vaccinated. (In New York City, Dr. Barbot added, nearly 99 percent of school-aged children are vaccinated.) How contagious are the measles? Highly. Typically, it is transmitted by airborne particles, droplets or direct contact, Dr. Barbot said, so it could be transmitted as easily as you being in a room with someone who has measles and being close to them, but not having to touch them. What are the symptoms? Dr. Barbot said that measles usually presents with a viral illness type of condition where an individual can have a cough, runny eyes, fever and then the typical rash that starts at the head and then progresses downward and also includes the palm and the sole. It can last several days. The reason why were so concerned, she said, is because there can be health consequences, including things like pneumonia and things like inflammation of the tissues and the brain.","Monday: An update on the outbreak, and a winter weather outlook.",2018-10-22T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Measles in Brooklyn,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/nyregion/new-york-today-measles-in-brooklyn.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/nyregion/22nytoday1/22nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"Good morning on this damp Monday. Now that fall weather is upon us, here are some things were excited about: Cooler subway platforms. Halloween movie marathons. And a new season for the arts. We asked our culture critics and writers at The Times for their best picks this season and heres what they said: Theater Ben Brantley, The Timess co-chief theater critic, recommended two shows coming from London. The Ferryman is a sprawling, energy-packed cornucopia of a drama, he told us, set in a rural Irish homestead haunted by ghosts of crimes past during the Troubles. The Jungle, Mr. Brantley said, provides an immersive tour through the fabled, divisive refugee camp in Calais. Both plays are bursting with a sense of unquenchable, present-tense life, he said. The subjects are tragic, yet you leave these shows fully energized. Comedy Sopan Deb, who writes about comedy for The Times, recommended The Play That Goes Wrong on Broadway. Ive seen it multiple times and my stomach hurt each time from laughing so hard. Its quite literally a play that goes wrong set pieces fall off, actors forget their lines and the lighting designer falls asleep. Mr. Deb also said the two-man improv show Trike at the Magnet Theater is one of the best in the city. Dance Marina Harss, who writes about dance for The Times, recommends Voice of My City at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The exhibition explores the work of the choreographer Jerome Robbins, who did so much to imprint an idea of New York, rough-edged and electric, in works like Fancy Free and West Side Story, Ms. Harss said. She also recommended Judson Dance Theater: The Work is Never Done at the MoMA. This event attempts to capture the moment choreographers, dancers, composers and visual artists began to ask themselves, What is dance, really? The show includes dance performances twice a day.",Monday: What to see in this new season for the arts and Halloween-themed events.,2018-10-15T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Fall Culture Preview,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/nyregion/new-york-today-fall-culture-preview.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/15/nyregion/15nytoday/merlin_145246941_97b860c2-5fdb-4e01-a9dd-270624b900eb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"(She calls that chalking back.) After Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to Dr. Blaseys sexual assault allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Sandberg said she had been receiving up to 20 new messages a day, many of them about harassment in schools. (Before that, she would receive fewer than five.) Its been blowing up because what happened with Kavanaugh and Ford was back in high school, whether this is verbal harassment boys making comments about girls bodies or physical harassment, said Ms. Sandberg, who has been adding the hashtag #stopharassmentinschools to catcalls submitted by students. ( One example : The teacher said, Its your fault. Wear something appropriate next time.) Emily May, the executive director and a co-founder of Hollaback, a global anti-street-harassment group based in Brooklyn, said the organization saw a 20 percent increase in stories of harassment shared through its site and app after the 2016 election. In terms of the current situation in the Supreme Court, she added, what I have seen broadly is there being a lot of folks who are having flashbacks and being re-traumatized by the hearing and by the allegations, and that translates into a shift of the experience of harassment: If youre having flashbacks and are traumatized by your sexual assault, your experience of being degraded and sexualized on the street can hit even harder. The majority of those who write to Ms. Sandberg are female many of them young girls but she has also heard from members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community and men who have been harassed because of their gender identity, expression or sexuality.","Wednesday: A spike in reports of street harassment around the city, and today’s test presidential alert.",2018-10-03T10:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Catcalling on Sidewalks,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/nyregion/new-york-today-catcalling.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/nyregion/03nytoday01/03nytoday01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

JONATHAN WOLFE and ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Here’s what the law means for New Yorkers. Will there be fewer ride-share vehicles? No. The number of vehicles in the city will be capped at its current level — around 100,000. The new law limits new ride-share vehicles for a year as the city studies the environmental and economic impact of ride-sharing services. Yesterday was the last day that a driver could register a vehicle with a ride-hailing service, although the law allows companies to add wheelchair-accessible vehicles. What will change for riders? The mayor’s office said that riders should not see a change in service and should not notice any significant increase in wait times. The mayor’s office also doesn’t expect to see a significant increase in fares. Uber, however, argues that the cap will mean fewer cars for passengers who want them, especially in the boroughs outside Manhattan. “We’re worried the impact will be felt the most in areas not well served by mass transit and where taxis refuse to travel,” said Jason Post, director of public affairs for Uber. Mr. Post said prices for Uber riders would not rise immediately, but could go up in the future. What does it mean for drivers? Aside from capping the number of vehicles, the package of bills signed yesterday also raised the minimum wage of drivers to $17.22, after expenses. The new minimum wage would bump driver’s incomes by about 23 percent, on average. Many yellow-cab and Uber drivers support the cap and say they hope that the new law will translate into less competition, more customers and higher incomes. What’s next? After a year, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission will be allowed to regulate the number of for-hire vehicles on the road. Presently, up to 40 percent of ride-sharing vehicles are unoccupied at any given time, according to a study commissioned by the T.L.C. Those empty cars add to the street congestion and increase competition among drivers. The city is considering establishing an occupancy rate that is healthier for the city, said a spokesman for the mayor’s office. If successful, the law could become a model for other cities or states that want to regulate the industry.",Wednesday: Limiting ride share vehicles and New York’s Little League World Series contenders.,2018-08-15T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Capping Uber,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/nyregion/new-york-today-sunglasses-eye-safety.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/15/nyregion/15nytoday/15nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Experts also worry that not enough attention is given to all the ways people have made the problem of wildfires worse. Population growth in California means there are more people on the roads — cars are a prime culprit in wildfires — and more homes built in wilderness areas. “It would be easy to throw our hands in the air and say it’s just climate change, and we can’t do anything about it,” said Jennifer K. Balch, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder and an expert on wildfires. “But actually we are starting the majority of wildfires, and we can do something about it.” Another factor, many experts say, are policies in California that protect forests from timber harvesting and a reluctance to set off controlled fires to burn vegetation. William Stewart, an expert on forestry at the University of California at Berkeley, said that part of the California dream was keeping “nature as it is,” with minimal management of forests. With so many fires burning so often, Stephen Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University, worries the public has become accustomed to disaster, unwilling to have difficult conversations about where houses are being built and whether controlled burns are a good idea.","Thursday: How people start or exacerbate blazes, a sudden opportunity for Duncan Hunter’s challenger, and a teetotaler’s guide to Sonoma County.",2018-08-23T13:00:46Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Human Element in California’s Wildfires,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/california-today-fires-humans.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22caltoday/22caltoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"What are some of the signs that a colleague is hitting a breaking point? The signs are usually emotional. “You can see people get angry, short, and start to resent the people who don’t work as hard,” Ms. Lechner said. Another telltale sign: sloppiness. But it’s important to understand what messy work means, she added. “People who become overburdened, and therefore become sloppy, are usually your best employees. Weak employees drop off the bus quickly. The best employees are the people who get assigned more and more work. An overburdened employee is a reflection of bad management.” What are the best ways to personally prevent a breaking point? Avoidance and engagement. “Avoid being on the grid 24-7,” Ms. Lechner said. “Carve out for yourself the three or four hours that you need every day to get off the grid and relax and teach the rest of the world, as well as yourself, that not all hours are email hours.” And engage more effectively. “Learn to collaborate better. When you learn the skill of collaboration, or working together, the work naturally gets distributed more effectively,” she said. How can I help a struggling colleague? Talk, listen and lend a hand. Get the person to talk. “Corporate life is very taxing and doesn’t usually come with a safe space,” Ms. Lechner said. “People are afraid to talk because they cannot afford to show their weakness because there are some people who are going to take advantage of that. Getting the person to talk is the first step to isolating the problem.” Listen. “When you are talking to someone who is overburdened, become a sounding board for what needs to be renegotiated,” she added. “It gives the other person the space to think about the boundaries of the work that was assigned and what can be renegotiated.” Maybe they need more time? Or more resources?

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Good morning on this boiling Tuesday. Broadway theaters will dim their lights on Thursday to honor Neil Simon, one of the most successful playwrights of our time. Mr. Simon died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 91. [ Read his obituary here. ] At the height of his work, between 1965 and 1980, Mr. Simon’s shows were performed on New York stages more than 9,000 times; he produced nearly 30 plays throughout his career. But it was more than Mr. Simon’s achievements on Broadway that made him a true New Yorker. He was born in the Bronx in 1927, before moving to Washington Heights as a toddler. (Family struggles during Mr. Simon’s childhood — his parents constantly fighting, and his father in and out of the picture — would later inspire his autobiographical comedy “Lost in Yonkers,” which won a Tony Award for best play and the Pulitzer Prize.) Mr. Simon graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and attended New York University. After his service in the Air Forces Air Reserve, Mr. Simon started his career as a clerk at Warner Bros., where he and his older brother, Danny, began writing scripts and comedy sketches together.","Born in the Bronx, raised in Washington Heights and a longtime resident of Greenwich Village, Neil Simon was a New Yorker through and through.",2018-08-28T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Neil Simon’s New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/nyregion/new-york-today-neil-simon.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/28/nyregion/28nytoday1/merlin_108976927_52d5a53e-3b32-446c-9b1c-fa5985c893db-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
THOMAS FULLER and INYOUNG KANG,"Residents of Atlanta, Dallas or New York may be thousands of miles from areas at most risk for earthquakes. But they are exposed, Mr. Lehmann argues, because Fannie and Freddie would most likely need a bailout of taxpayer money after a big earthquake. Only 13 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, raising questions on whether earthquake insurance should be mandatory for mortgage holders. In a response to questions, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae emailed a statement that said while Fannie encourages borrowers to obtain earthquake insurance, it is “unaffordable for many.” In the Bay Area, earthquake insurance for a home that would cost around $500,000 to rebuild has an annual premium of about $3,000 per year with a 5 percent deductible, according to the California Earthquake Authority. Mr. Lehmann says that he recognizes the high cost of insurance but that the government should study ways to make it more affordable — and to lower the risk to a national mortgage system still recovering from the financial crisis a decade ago.","Tuesday: Protecting U.S. taxpayers from the next big one, aiming for 100 percent renewable energy by 2045, and a high school photo delights N.F.L. fans.",2018-09-11T12:33:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Who Owns the Risk for Earthquakes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/california-today-earthquake-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/11caltoday_quake/11caltoday_quake-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"(Under New York election laws, the Democratic Party was allowed to handpick his replacement — if he won.) And before the first ballot was cast, there was a scramble to replace him. “This is just such a bloodless business, politics,” State Senator Franz S. Leichter told The Times. “The man just died and people are asking if I am going to run.” In the end, Mr. Weiss won the primary and five candidates, including Mr. Weiss’s widow, put their hands up for the job. His successor was chosen during a Democratic committee meeting of more than 1,000 members, which The Times described as “a classic night of West Side politics, mixing the sound and fury of the women’s movement, environmentalism and antiwar sentiments that have defined the district for two decades with the clubhouse rough and tumble of an earlier era.” Jerrold Nadler, a state assemblyman from the Upper West Side, was chosen to succeed Mr. Weiss and won the general election that fall. He still holds the seat. New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

IVAN PENN and INYOUNG KANG,"A trip down Highway 1 meant self-discovery and a search through memory for a travel writer, whose drive down the coast was marked by childhood scenes and a renewed sense of self. It wasnt that I was looking to reclaim the highway, or the state, when I embarked on the trip, Mac McClelland writes. I didnt have a strict agenda. I was open, as one needs to be here, to where I would end up. And California turned out to be a sanctuary, too.

AZI PAYBARAH and ANDY NEWMAN,"Nearly 100 years after its 1922 debut, the film Nosferatu is, according to one of our film critics, among the scariest vampire movies ever made. Another called it, simply, one of cinemas most beautiful horror movies.
Even nonmovie buffs may have seen one notable scene from the film: A terrified woman sitting on her bed convulses into submission after the shadow of a hand seizes into a fist over her heart.
Like many silent classics, Nosferatu is sometimes screened with live-music accompaniment. That usually happens around Halloween, but if you cant wait that long for such an experience, youre in luck.
The movie is showing, for free, at Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan Thursday at 7:30 p.m. A live score will be performed by the Irish composers Irene and Linda Buckley. Its part of Brookfields Silent Films / Live Music series, held inside its indoor market.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"The Democratic Partys cash advantage stretches far beyond California. In an election season that appears likely to shatter midterm fund-raising records, Democrats outraised their Republican opponents in 32 of the closest 45 House races by a total margin of $154 million to $108 million since November 2016, our colleagues Ken Vogel and Rachel Shorey write. You dont buy your way into office, but this kind of money makes victory possible in scenarios where it otherwise might not have been, Bob Biersack, a campaign finance expert, told The Times. The trend did not hold in Californias 21st District, which Hillary Clinton won in 2016. There, Representative David Valadao, a Republican, raised nearly $1.7 million while his Democratic opponent, T.J. Cox, raised just $500,000. And the scale of fund-raising last quarter did not always match the extent to which the races are considered competitive. In Representative Devin Nuness district, Californias 22nd, both candidates raised enormous sums even though Mr. Nunes, a Republican, has been widely considered safe by political watchers. Mr. Nunes raised about $3.2 million while his challenger, Andrew Janz, raked in $4.4 million. Mr. Nunes, however, had more than $5 million left in his campaign chest as of Sept. 30.

Nina Browne, Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s community program manager, who has overseen the competition for years and trains the judges, told us that this year’s winner “ticked all the boxes!” “What stands out is that it is a really long block, so they have a lot of ground to cover and a lot of neighbors to involve,” she said. “Participation rate is one of the metrics used in judging the Greenest Block in Brooklyn, and you can see a very high rate of participation on this block from corner to corner.” This was the block’s fourth time entering the annual contest, and participants incorporated feedback from earlier attempts to win this year. “They created a children’s garden and got children on the block involved,” Ms. Browne said. “There’s a sense of whimsy on their block in the use of upcycled materials, like old baby carriages and amps as planters that make you smile as you walk down the street. And their use of educational signage means that every passer-by will learn something, too!” Job well done.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"[ Read Ms. Bellafante’s story on the suggestions here. ] We thought we’d share a few more with you. Margaret Cochran Corbin (1751-1800) During the Battle of Fort Washington, in what is now Washington Heights, Ms. Corbin, known as “Captain Molly,” dressed as a man and joined the fight. During the battle, her husband, John Corbin, was shot and killed while manning a cannon. Ms. Corbin stepped into his place, loading the cannon until she was wounded. She was captured by the British but later released. She was the first American woman to receive a military pension, although it was half the amount given to male soldiers. Elizabeth Jennings Graham (circa 1830-1901) Ms. Graham was a young black schoolteacher who refused to give up her seat on a horse-drawn streetcar while on her way to church in 1854. She was eventually thrown out by a policeman, and then sued the city with the help of Chester A. Arthur, who would later become the president. She won, and the ruling eventually led to the desegregation of our city’s public transit. She also founded the city’s first kindergarten for black children. Margaret Sanger (1879-1966) Ms. Sanger, a nurse, coined the term “birth control” during her decades-long fight to legalize contraception. She founded the magazine Woman Rebel, which was often banned by the post office. She was charged with sending information about contraception through the mail. She fled to Europe but retuned to New York when the charges were dropped. In 1916, she opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Other suggestions from readers for statues of inspiring women include: Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman (1864-1922), known as Nellie Bly, was an American journalist whose trailblazing work in journalism often influenced public policy.","Friday: Notable women who merit statues, and an asbestos update.",2018-07-27T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Monumental Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/nyregion/new-york-today-monumental-women.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/27/nyregion/27nytoday1/27nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"It’s often what psychologists call “the bystander effect.” “It’s a general term for people not reacting, when they’re in a group, to some sort of situation that might call for a reaction — where responsible intervention would be the right call, but no one is intervening,” said Katherine Fox-Glassman, a lecturer in the department of psychology at Columbia University, whose research has focused on judgment, decision-making and risk perception. The 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese — who was attacked and stabbed repeatedly on her way home from work — is one of the most cited references to the bystander effect in New York City’s history, even though the role of the witnesses was greatly disputed in later reflections and reporting. The bystander effect can happen most anywhere — after a bike accident, a fight on the train or a fender bender. But do cellphones exacerbate the phenomenon? Though it could simply be “morbid curiosity,” Ms. Fox-Glassman explained, it could also be bystanders wanting video of an event, as in cases of possible police brutality. “The many recent examples of people having film evidence of an event that was later contested — evidence allowing us to see what the truth was — that might be encouraging more people to film situations that seem ambiguous,” she said.","Monday: A common phenomenon in New York, and staples for a city picnic.",2018-07-30T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: The City’s Bystander Effect,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/nyregion/new-york-today-bystander-effect.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/nyregion/30nytoday/30nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"Discarded syringes have become a significant concern for the town’s residents, who worry that the needles pose a threat to children and tourists. Those syringes are a symptom of a broader, systemic issue. Steve Shockley, a Eureka resident who is homeless, said he “converted” to using heroin a few years ago after years of drug abuse. Like many other longtime intravenous drug users in the area, he now prefers heroin to meth, though he uses them both regularly. Stacy Cobine, who said she worked as a nurse’s aide for many years, says that many drug users are getting abscesses from syringes; she said she had taught younger drug users proper needle technique to avoid infections and other complications. “You would not believe the dirty using practices I’ve seen,” she said. “I just cringe thinking about it.

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"“The problem is that the public in general and building owners in particular really think that when they get a building to code they are going to get a building that is going to perform fine in an earthquake,” said Mary Comerio, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a proponent for stronger earthquake protections. “The message to the public is that existing buildings are going to be damaged. That’s built into the calculations,” Professor Comerio said. “They are designed to help you get out of the building but you may not be able to go back in.” A debate over the longstanding “life safety” philosophy of the building code — meaning that it is designed to protect your life but not much more — was central to discussions at the conference. A bill in Sacramento that could potentially strengthen the code to a “functional recovery” standard is moving through committees in the State Legislature. But proponents of more resilient buildings and infrastructure like water, gas lines, the power grid and cellphone systems say more can be done even within the existing code. Maryann Phipps, a structural engineer who gave the keynote address to conference participants on Thursday, urged engineers to explain to their clients that by spending an additional one or two percent a building is more likely to be usable after an earthquake.","Friday: Communicating earthquake safety, a leap in online privacy, Norman Pearlstine speaks, and finally, a tribute to The Capital Gazette.",2018-06-29T13:05:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Making Earthquake Safety More Intelligible,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/us/california-today-earthquake-safety.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/28/us/28earthquakes-01/28earthquakes-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

JONATHAN WOLFE,"We interrupt your summer to bring you some dreary news. There’s a chance we’ll see rain every day this week, with some heavy downpours, and it will be uncomfortably humid. But don’t let the rain put a damper on going out. May we suggest a film series to entertain you? “ Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers ” at BAMcinématek in Downtown Brooklyn is screening films from some of the first female moviemakers. The series includes the films “ When Little Lindy Sang ” (1916), which touches on racial prejudice and tells the story of a black girl in a white classroom (today at 7 p.m.), and “ ’49-’17 ” (1917), thought to be the first western directed by a woman. On Wednesday, the series screens the films of Mable Normand, a largely overlooked silent-era comedian who had equal success as a dramatic actor. And the series wraps up on Thursday with a screening of Alla Nazimova’s “ Salomé ” (1923), an adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play of the same name.

AARON ROBERTSON and ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Permit or not, many New Yorkers are using the stands to do good in the community. Kathy Price, a mother in Brooklyn, and her two young children plan to give their lemonade stand revenue to Stand for Kids, which uses proceeds from stands to support 14 groups working to keep immigrant children with their families. The “Lemonaid” program at the Robin Hood Foundation, an anti-poverty organization based in Lower Manhattan, encourages its vendors to offer lemonade for free and request donations, as does Alex’s Lemonade Stand, a nonprofit that promotes cancer research. Dina Bean has run a booth near Central Park with her children, Anabelle and Daniel, in support of Alex’s Lemonade Stand for the last eight summers. Only once have they encountered an angry retailer who threatened to call the city. “The ironic part is that we probably bring so many people there because people always come to check out what’s going on,” Ms. Bean said. Tensions eased once the Bean family explained that they were fund-raising for a pediatric cancer charity. “We’ve never really had anyone complain except for that one guy, but this year they were super nice.” Yes, obtaining the proper permit will give you the legal assurance you need to set up your booth, but it may mean losing some of that 1950s charm of setting up a makeshift stand on a whim.","Friday: Permits for a summer rite of passage, and the Little Red Lighthouse.",2018-07-06T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Are Lemonade Stands Allowed?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/nyregion/new-york-today-lemonade-stands.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/06/nyregion/06nytoday/06nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

JONATHAN WOLFE,"We found it on the sidewalk in an industrial part of the neighborhood. “This is what we’d call a desert,” Mr. Kazimirov said as we picked up the bike. “You can see there’s not much traffic here.” Then a distress call came in about a bike in Far Rockaway. “It looks like someone complaining that the bike is in front of their house,” Mr. Kazimirov said. After a bit of searching, we found the bright green bike in a driveway on Beach 64th Street. Mr. Kazimirov quickly diagnosed the problem: a broken lock, probably jammed with sand. The bike was loaded into a white van and taken to the company’s warehouse in Bay Ridge for repairs. So far, Mr. Kazimirov said, he hasn’t had to rescue bikes from trees or bodies of water — as dockless bike operators have had to do in other cities. And over the last few weeks, the types of complaints have changed, he said. “When we first put them out, people would call in and say there was an abandoned bike, thinking that someone would steal them,” he said. “We’d arrive and there’d be nothing wrong. “It takes awhile for people to realize that, oh, the bike can just be there and it doesn’t have to be in a dock,” he added. “Eventually, they will just become part of the scenery.” Here’s what else is happening:",Thursday: Running a dockless bike program and an Italian festival in Harlem.,2018-08-09T10:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Balancing Bikes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/nyregion/new-york-today-dockless-bikes-italian-festival.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/09/nyregion/09nytoday/09nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
LISA FRIEDMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. So did the president capture the causes of the California wildfires accurately? Lisa: The president’s tweet said that the California wildfires were worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Virtually every scientist and forest management expert agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweet was scientifically and factually inaccurate. Mr. Trump’s other admonition that California “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” raised fewer objections. But, state officials pointed out, California devoted more than $250 million in state funds this year alone on efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires. How about the president’s point about water policy? How is that related to wildfire management and firefighting? Is there any connection, as the president suggested?","Wednesday: Hazardous air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, accusations of slogan-stealing in the 10th district, and LeBron James excites bike activists.",2018-08-08T13:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Your Questions About Fires and Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/california-today-fires-and-climate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/us/07CALTODAY-01/merlin_142056570_ff8f2de5-3943-43a0-894e-84c0995be321-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE and LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ,"“One is that more landowners have joined the ranks of making maple syrup,” she said, with an estimated 2,000 producers across the state. “But the bigger reason is that techniques for producing syrup have gotten better, so that all of us who make syrup now make more syrup per tree than we did 10 or 15 years ago. We’ve also added taps.” Maple season is in the early spring — “that’s when the tree is taking the ‘food’ stored in its roots as starch and converting it into sugars,” Ms. Thomas explained — but this week included the inaugural Maple Day at the Great New York State Fair. Visitors in Syracuse watched cooking demonstrations and sampled syrup-soaked pancakes, maple sausage, maple milk, maple doughnuts and maple cotton candy. Maple Day was certainly cause for celebration, but the activity continues year-round. Producers like Ms. Thomas — whose farm near Buffalo, Maxon Estate Farms, has been in the family for 200 years — spend the fall in the woods preparing equipment. In the late winter and early spring, they are drilling holes into trees, inserting tap spiles and monitoring sap flow. Ideal weather for getting the job done is 40 degrees by day and 25 by night, Ms. Thomas said, so when the time is right, farmers must collect the sap quickly, several times a day, and then boil and process it immediately to prevent it from spoiling. At the rate they’re going, Ms. Thomas said, New York’s maple producers hope to catch up with Vermont. (Behind us: Maine.) “Our industry is still very different from the Vermonts and the Maines because we’re still very much small family farms doing it,” she told us.","Friday: An uptick in maple syrup production in New York, and a question for Catholics.",2018-08-31T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: A Maple Syrup Boom,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/nyregion/new-york-today-maple-syrup-boom.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/27/nyregion/27nytoday/27nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

They want to honor the people who came before them at the site of that persons first steps in America, said Stephen A. Briganti, president of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation Inc.
The monument serves as both tribute to immigrants and fund-raiser for the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration and the Statue of Liberty. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan wanted to preserve the site, but without spending taxpayer money. The solution: build a wall and charge people to add names to it. It opened in 1990.
It costs $150 to put one name on the wall and $225 for two names, with more expensive options as well (because this is, still, New York City). So far, the wall has raised more than $80 million.
The wall is filling up the number of inscriptions rose sharply in 2017 and again last year. There are only five empty panels left, enough for about 3,300 names.

AZI PAYBARAH,"How did these animals come to be? The zodiac has its roots in an ancient story. One childrens book that explains it is The Race for the Chinese Zodiac, which The Times reviewed in 2014.
According to that story, heaven and earth were ruled by the Jade Emperor, who held a competition: The first 12 animals to finish a race to cross a river would be rewarded by having a year dedicated in their honor. Large animals like the horse and the tiger easily made it across. Smaller animals, like the rat and the cat, hitched a ride on the back of the ox. As the story goes, in the center of the river, the rat kicked the cat overboard.
What does that matter? Well, 2020 is the Year of the Rat, and there is, sadly, no year of the cat, ever.
Sarah Harrison Smith wrote in her Times review of The Race that what makes the zodiac different from many such stories, however, is that bad behavior like Rats isnt penalized. Cat loses his place in the zodiac despite being the victim of Rats duplicity; the Jade Emperor does not intervene.
It also explains why, to this day, cats hate rats.

Mr. Semprevivo is an outsourcing executive from Los Angeles and another parent charged in the case.

Ms. Loughlin had already agreed to the million-dollar bail, but Mr. Semprevivos lawyers asked for their clients to be set at a quarter of that.
But Alex Wyman, an assistant United States attorney, argued that the defendant had been accused of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and the bail amount needed to be significant enough to make an impression.
So the judge set it at $1 million, too. Both Mr. Semprevivo and Ms. Loughlin are due in court in Boston later this month.

When I think about homelessness in California, I often picture more urban or suburban areas. Who were the people living in Butte County without housing?

More than three-fourths of them had been in the county for upward of three years, and more than half had been there for more than 10, according to a 2017 report. The area was largely a retirement community. With 14,000 residences lost, is there any plan for replenishing the housing stock?

Here’s what one participant, Margaret Ecker, a retired nurse, shared: “To be peering into the dark, looking for a person, trying to imagine, as we had been told to do, where we would look for a place to rest if we were homeless… it’s a surprising experience of intimacy. What if we had agreed to peer into every well-lit living room, counting how many people were seated around the living room table or what the kids are watching on TV. But we were trying to peer into lives very different from our own.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and THOMAS FULLER,"Q: What did you take away from the last few days? A: Of course the Clark shooting is the immediate cause and source of real and deep trauma but it’s about so much more than that. It’s about people’s lives. It’s about how communities of color feel about their lives here. Here’s what I know: There is a big disconnect between our renaissance in Sacramento, which is very real, and people struggling in our neighborhoods and in our communities. People who are having a hard time paying the rent, whose kids are having a hard time in school, whose lives are tough every single day.

The bodies of three of their adopted children were found nearby but another three children were still missing late Wednesday. “An entire family vanished,” Tom Allman, the Mendocino County Sheriff, told reporters in a briefing on Wednesday. [ Our article on the car crash can be found here. ] One of the missing children, Devonte Hart, was the subject of a viral photograph in 2014 that captured him hugging a Portland, Ore., police officer during the nationwide protests over the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. The sheriff said there were no skid marks or indications that the car had tried to stop before falling 100 feet to the edge of the ocean. But he also said the police had found no evidence that it was an “intentional act.” The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported Wednesday that the Washington State Department of Social Services had opened an investigation into the family last Friday based on reports of potential abuse or neglect.

[ The New York Times ] Photo Rain clouds over San Francisco earlier this month. Credit Jeff Chiu/Associated Press And Finally... The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things, but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system: “atmospheric river” and “Pineapple Express.” So which one is it? “Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast,” said Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist affiliated with U.C. San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “About 15 years ago we recognized that there’s a broader definition called an atmospheric river, and those happen all over the planet.” For non-scientists, atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually. “If you look from space from a satellite, it does look like a sinuous river,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A. “It’s a colorful term, and it’s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process.” But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers, not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms. The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands, hence the playful “Pineapple Express.” Not everyone agrees, though, that this storm falls under that category. “I wouldn’t call this one a Pineapple Express. The storm is coming from the West, but the tail of this atmospheric river didn’t come from Hawaii, it came from east of Hawaii,” Mr. Ralph said. “But I’m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this. The modern term is atmospheric river.” Nomenclature aside, Mr. Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue. Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard, it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County. The forecast is severe, and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides. “The forecast is for a really, really big rain,” he said. “Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity. Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"“They literally go out and stick a ruler in the snow,” said Carlie Buccola, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Technically, it’s a little more complicated than that. Before a snowstorm, spotters place a white board faceup on the ground. As the last flakes fall, they insert a ruler, measure and then wipe the board clean for future measurements. Spotters can also track rainfall amounts, barometric pressure and tree and property damage, which are used to verify the National Weather Service’s weather advisories. All of this made us think: If a snowflake falls in Brooklyn, and no one is there to measure it, does it leave a record? Not according to the National Weather Service. “People call in and ask why their city or town is not on the snowfall list,” Ms. Buccola said. “It’s likely because nobody there sent in a report.” You can represent the microclimate of your block this weekend by submitting your own freelance storm report to the weather service. You can also train as a spotter this spring or join a network of observers. We don’t have any formal schooling, but here’s our submission: Umbrellas up, it’s soggy till Sunday.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"A winter weather advisory is in effect until 2 p.m., which means roads could be slippery and visibility may be reduced. But whatever you do, don’t call this storm a nor’easter. While we may have just celebrated a rare “four’easter,” with four nor’easters pummeling our region within a month, today’s storm will not be the fifth. “The magnitude of this storm is not quite up to par,” said John Murray, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. For a storm to qualify as a nor’easter, he explained, it must meet a few conditions, including sustained winds of 34 knots, or around 39 miles per hour. Wind gusts today are expected to reach only 25 miles per hour, leaving the storm with the less-sexy label of “quick-moving low pressure system.” Which is a mixed blessing. The storm is not strong enough to postpone the Yankees home opener against the Tampa Bay Rays, but it’s also not dumping enough snow to upset alternate side parking, which is in effect today. Expect to forget all about it by this afternoon, when we should see sunshine and a high of 44. April showers — two days of them — start tomorrow.

Photo Love is in the air. Credit Daniel Barry for The New York Times Mayor de Blasio isn’t the only New Yorker feeling rejected these days. Just ask Dora the red-tailed hawk. For the last few days, a torrid love affair has been playing out among a threesome of red-tailed hawks in Tompkins Square Park, much to the dismay and delight of neighborhood bird-watchers. Here’s the gist: First, there were Christo and Dora. The pair of hawks have lived in the park and had 10 chicks together over five years. But three months ago, Dora was taken to rehab for an injured wing, and in swooped another bird whom the locals called Nora (for “Not Dora”). After months of rehab, Dora was released last week, and “all hell broke loose,” wrote Laura Goggin, who has been documenting the drama on her blog. “All three hawks flew around the park screaming, as did all the people who were running around trying to keep track of all of them!” Ms. Goggin wrote. The three are still getting used to each other, and in the days since, Christo has been spending time with both females, according to The Post. You can watch the drama unfold on Ms. Goggin’s blog or at the Urban Hawks blogs. Mating season is on the horizon. (P.S.: Consider us #TeamDora.)

AZI PAYBARAH,"In Brooklyn, Al Smiths mother, Katherine, waited until after breakfast before leaving the Brooklyn Heights home she shared with her daughter to vote for her son whom, she recalled telling doubters when he first dabbled in politics, he would amount to something some day youll see. Women flocked to the polls early that day, including Mary Garrett Hay, a suffrage leader on Manhattans West Side who spent two minutes at the polls and reported that she had split her ticket. It seemed as natural as breathing, she said, and I felt as though I had always voted.

JONATHAN WOLFE and BENJAMIN WEISER,"Good morning on this radiant Wednesday. It has been a bruising, expensive and drawn-out election season here in New York, and it finally came to an end last night. Here are the big takeaways. Andrew M. Cuomo slides to victory Mr. Cuomo won a third time in the race for governor of New York, easily beating his Republican rival, Marcus Molinaro. He ran on his record, which includes same sex-marriage, gun control measures and paid family leave. Just like his father, Mr. Cuomo won a third term as governor, and just like his father, he has denied that he has presidential ambitions. [ Read more about Mr. Cuomos win.] Democrats take New York seats in the House New York State had nine incumbent House Republicans, out of 27 total House representatives. Yesterday, three of those Republicans lost their seats. The most notable was John J. Faso, a Republican who represented New Yorks 19th Congressional District, whom Antonio Delgado defeated. Here in the city, Max Rose defeated Representative Dan Donovan in Staten Island, and in central New York, Anthony Brindisi beat Representative Claudia Tenney. Democrats seize control of the State Senate Democrats won control of the New York State Senate for the first time in nearly a decade. The Democratic senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins is slated to become the next majority leader, which would make her the first black woman to lead the Senate, and the first woman to lead the State Senate or Assembly.","Wednesday: Who won in New York, bright skies, and Cesar Sayoc’s bond hearing.",2018-11-07T11:05:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Election Takeaways,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/nyregion/new-york-today-election-takeaways.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/07/nyregion/07nytoday/07nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

The bullets knocked him over backward,” The Times reported at the time. He was 39. Although Malcolm was born in Nebraska, he spent much of his life in New York City, where he ascended to the local Harlem spotlight and became a national media figure. In the early 1950s, he founded and preached at the Mosque 7, now a Sunni Muslim mosque in Harlem called Masjid Malcolm Shabazz. Malcolm and his family lived in a house at 23-11 97th Street in East Elmhurst in Queens. The house was firebombed a week before his murder. He was assassinated by three members of the Nation of Islam, a religious movement with which he had cut ties a few months earlier. “I’m a marked man,” Malcolm told a Times reporter a week before his death. “No one can get out without trouble, and this thing with me will be resolved by death and violence.” New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"Fabscrap’s founder, Jessica Schreiber, is expecting a glut of new stock, “because after Fashion Week everyone cleans out.” When we visited this week, volunteers picked fabric from garbage bags piled 12 feet high. Cotton, wool and spandex are separated, and smaller scraps are sent out to be made into fire blankets, insulation and car-door lining. The good pieces are meticulously organized by color and neatly folded in Fabscrap’s retail space. Photo Jessica Schreiber, the founder of Fabscrap. Credit Holly Pickett for The New York Times Last year Fabscrap collected 68,000 pounds of fabric — enough to fill 13,600 shopping bags or create an equal number of head-to-toe looks. Ms. Schreiber, 29, a former senior manager at the city sanitation department and self-described “trash nerd,” founded the nonprofit after noticing that New York’s clothing recycling program didn’t accept fabric. “The city collects reusable clothes and takes it to Goodwill,” she said. “It didn’t really fit their model.” She started driving a U-Haul van around Midtown picking up 50-pound bags of fabric from designers. “I got to know a lot of the freight elevator operators in the garment district,” she said. She was often told, “You work like a man.” She took it as a compliment. Ms. Schreiber’s goal is to one day collect scraps from clothing producers, which generate a lot more waste than designers. “That’s where you have the potential to make a real impact,” she said. But for now, she’s looking to expand her network of over 600 volunteers, who get free fabric and an important lesson. “When you walk in and see this pile of waste it’s such an educational moment,” she said. “There’s no better way to change what someone thinks about waste than for them to see it and put their hands on it.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Yesterday’s slush is but a memory. It will be sunny and dry, but temperatures might not get above freezing. Wrap a fabric scrap around your neck: The wind could make it feel like 15 on your commute.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"People have been hurt. Last month, Chris Wilson, 39, a software developer, needed eight stitches after slipping on the escalator at the South Ferry station. “I wasn’t walking down,” he said. “I wasn’t actually doing anything. My foot just sort of slipped out from under me. It was definitely the slickness on the floor.” Theories have emerged. Some blame ice melt, which can leave an oily residue when tracked in from the street. Others have suggested car exhaust or discarded fried chicken grease. We asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Shams Tarek, a spokesman, said the slippery floors are from the combination of rain and snow tracked in from the street, other substances brought in on shoes, and high humidity in stations that traps moisture. The buildup on the subway floor — from shoes, trash, spills and exhaust — contains substances that dissolve in water, like salt and sugars, along with oily compounds, which don’t, explained Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University. You just don’t notice the oily stuff until it rains or snows because it’s caked together on the subway tile with everything else. “Once you add water, whatever didn’t dissolve is going to be oily,” Professor Kumar said. On nonporous subway tiles, where hardly anything is absorbed, the slick stuff just sits on the surface. As for why floors can seem more slippery on snowy days than on rainy days, Professor Kumar theorized, “It’s easier to carry snow in on your shoes, so you’ll have more water on the snowy days.” For now, the M.T.A. said it would continue to mop aggressively after both snow and rain — the latter of which is expected to fall in profusion today once the snow changes over in late morning.

Sarah Steinhardt, an organizer from the Women’s March Alliance, said she was marching in New York Citybecause there has not been enough change in the past year. When asked how she defines “change,” she told us: “Seeing our elected officials advocating for laws that protect women and empower women.” Stephanie Bazirjian, 62, a New York City resident, is marching here “for the DACA people, for minorities, for hard-working immigrants, for women.” Ayesha Hamilton, 45, a New Jersey resident who plans to March in Morristown, said, “I march because the women’s movement needs momentum and energy, because our daughters and their daughters should not have to worry about equal pay or assault in the workplace.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Hello, weekend. You look great. We’ll be graced with sunshine and blue skies for the next few days. Today will be chilly, but temperatures should climb to the 50s on Saturday with highs in the 40s on Sunday.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"“But that pattern is starting to break down,” Mr. Homenuk added. Today’s mild temperatures are thanks to warm air that moved in from the south. But you can expect a blast of cold air again soon. “The atmosphere is always trying to reach an equilibrium, and right now were seeing a battle between warm and cold,” said Faye Morrone, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. For the next few days, we’re looking at temperatures in the 50s. Rain will begin tomorrow, before the mercury plummets below freezing again on Sunday. The National Weather Service and the governor’s office are warning about potential flooding today and through the weekend as snow melts and rain causes the rivers to rise. “When you have this extra water content in snow and ice, and then warm things up, and then put heavy rain onto it, that leads to an enhanced threat of flooding,” Mr. Homenuk said. That includes the streets of New York, if on a smaller scale. “You can expect a lot more water on the New York City sidewalks than from a normal rain event,” Mr. Homenuk said.

Is this where you want to raise your kids?’” Both initiatives failed, but Mr. Duskin says the threat of further votes against skyscrapers led city officials to impose height limits in residential areas. Mr. Duskin continued his career as an activist, campaigning against nuclear power and promoting wind energy.

[ The Sacramento Bee ] And Finally... The imminent closing of Virginia Bakery, an East Bay store beloved for its cakes and sweets, has been met with an outpouring of tributes from people who swear by its treats, some of whom have shopped there for decades. “We will miss you, but it’s time to retire. We hope to see you sometime before we close,” the bakery’s owners, John and Anne Erdmann, wrote in a short post on Facebook on Monday. A small sign in the shop, in pink type, bade adieu to its customers. “It has been an honor and a privilege to be part of your family celebrations.” The Erdmann family, which has run the bakery for 65 years, said it would close April 28. News of the closing has spread widely, and the bakery has seen a run on its products since the announcement. “It’s bittersweet, you know,” Ms. Erdmann told ABC 7. “We’re doing what’s right for ourselves and our family but we also realize that we have a big Virginia Bakery family.” The bakery’s Facebook page has transformed into something of a memorial. “Tragic!” Harris Brody wrote. “My parents brought me and my brothers all the time as kids and now we bring our kids. So many fond memories. Enjoy retirement but know that you will be incredibly missed.” “Thank you for all the beautiful birthday cakes since my first child as born on 1975, topped by my daughter’s wedding cake six years ago,” Heidi Sanders wrote. “We will miss your love, friendship and your shop that makes Berkeley a better place.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

JESS BIDGOOD and TIM ARANGO,"(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) If you are a big-city mayor thinking of running for higher office, you’ve no doubt noticed the crash-and-burn campaign for governor waged by Antonio Villaraigosa, the former two-term mayor of Los Angeles. Mr. Villaraigosa came in third; Gavin Newsom, the Democrat lieutenant governor, came in first, followed by John Cox, a Republican. Which brings us to Eric M. Garcetti, the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, who is considering a run for president. Mr. Garcetti has some thoughts on why his successor at City Hall lost, which he shared with our Jess Bidgood, who caught up with him at the International Mayors Climate Summit in Boston last week. Mr. Garcetti said much of the blame should be placed with charter school supporters — including Eli Broad and Michael Bloomberg — who set up an independent committee and spent millions of dollars on behalf of Mr. Villaraigosa. “His allies overplayed the importance of an old educational debate and spent $23 million on ‘are you pro-charter, pro-reform,’ versus pro-teacher, pro-union, which was a stupid and silly waste of money,” he said. “If, you know, I had that much money to spend, I would have been spending it differently.” He also said that Mr. Villaraigosa sent a muddled, who-am-I message to voters, many of whom did not know him outside of Los Angeles.","Monday: Mayor Garcetti gives his take on the governor’s race, a debate over A.I. in Silicon Valley, another title for the Warriors and remembering Anthony Bourdain at a taco stand in Los Angeles",2018-06-11T13:16:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Garcetti Muses on Villaraigosa’s Defeat,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/us/california-today-garcetti-muses-on-villaraigosas-defeat.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"New York voters’ turnout for federal elections was only slightly better: About 57 percent of registered voters voted in the 2016 general election, according to the United States census. Only seven states had lower turnout rates than New York. So why is that? “The turnout is exceptionally low because — I hate to use the word — our stupid policy,” Mr. Muzzio said. New York is one of the few states that doesn’t allow early voting ( 37 others do ). The state also doesn’t have same-day registration. The absentee voting system here is outdated and it doesn’t accept online requests. And the cutoff to change party affiliation to vote in the tomorrow’s primaries was in October. “New York is certainly behind the times and has not gone the route of modern election reform,” said Jonathan Nagler, a professor of politics at New York University. “And there’s no political will to do this in the state legislature.” Many New Yorkers choose not to vote in the primaries because they assume a Democrat will ultimately win the general election. But that’s exactly the reason you should vote, Mr. Muzzio said. “In New York City, the primaries are often the general election,” because there’s usually low competition between the parties in the general election. (And with such a low turnout, your vote is worth even more.)","Monday: Examining our low voter turnout, immigrant comedians, and awaiting a corpse flower.",2018-06-25T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Why We Don’t Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/nyregion/new-york-today-why-we-dont-vote.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/nyregion/25nytoday-03/25nytoday-03-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"Good morning on this feverish Tuesday. We are a week away from the primaries. Democrats and Republicans in New York are holding nominating contests next Tuesday for federal seats, including the House and the Senate. (State primaries, which include the governor’s race, will take place in September.) To get us up to speed on the most important and interesting races in the state, we spoke to Shane Goldmacher, the chief political correspondent on The Times’s Metro desk. Here’s what he’s watching: A heated race in New York City’s Trump Country. “The most interesting Republican primary, certainly in New York, possibly in the country, is in Staten Island,” Mr. Goldmacher said. Michael Grimm once represented the 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn, but resigned the seat in 2014 after pleading guilty to tax fraud. (He served seven months in prison.) Now, he’d like his old job back. He’s challenging Representative Dan Donovan, and the two are competing to see who’s more aligned with President Trump — the president endorsed Mr. Donovan, but the swaggering Mr. Grimm is the more Trump-like figure. Democratic upstarts in the city. A group of incumbent Democrats in New York are facing primary challengers, many of whom are first-time candidates under the age of 35. Representative Joseph Crowley, who some see as possibly replacing Nancy Pelosi as the head of the House Democrats, is being challenged for the first time since 2004, by the progressive candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Representatives Carolyn Maloney (Manhattan’s East Side and parts of Queens), Eliot Engel (the Bronx), Yvette Clarke (central Brooklyn) and Gregory W. Meeks (southern Queens) are also facing insurgents within their party.","Tuesday: A primer on next week’s primaries, Night at the Museums, and celebrating Juneteenth.",2018-06-19T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Primary Races to Watch,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/nyregion/new-york-today-primary-races-to-watch.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/19/nyregion/19nytoday1/19nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Good morning on this summer Thursday. As classrooms around the city empty out for summer, we learned about a group of students who recently completed a more unorthodox curriculum: tending to a local graveyard. The landmark Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn hosted 10 apprentices for a monthslong masonry restoration program, teaching the art of repairing and preserving historic monuments and buildings. After finishing the course, which began in March and was supported by the World Monuments Fund, the graduates are now adept at nursing old structures made of marble, granite, brownstone and brick. “It’s not in high demand; everybody goes the typical construction route,” said Tiara Campbell, 24, a mason from East New York, Brooklyn, who discovered the program through Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow. “Concrete workers, carpenters, plumbers and electricians, that’s what everybody goes for, but what about the historic buildings?” He and his cohorts worked on one of the more than 700 mausoleums in Green-Wood: the two-story marble Miller Mausoleum, one of the cemetery’s largest, built around 1870 for the congressman William Starr Miller II and his family, who owned the Fifth Avenue mansion that became the Neue Galerie.","Thursday: Learning to restore historic structures, where to watch the World Cup and the summer solstice.",2018-06-21T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Graduating From a Graveyard,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/nyregion/new-york-today-graveyard-masonry-program.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/21/nyregion/21NYToday1/21NYToday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
MOLLY HORAN and ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Good morning on this feverish Thursday. Spotify users have created more than 20 playlists for the sole purpose of getting through the New York City commute. From Drake, Kanye and Cardi B to easy listening melodies, like Bon Iver, Enya and Norah Jones — the songs you listen to on the way to and from work can affect your mood and overall well-being. “Research in music psychology and cognition confirms what many people already know: Loud, fast music increases heart rate, breathing and blood pressure, while slower, quieter music has the opposite effect,” said Joy Calico, a professor of musicology at Vanderbilt University. Tailoring your commute playlist to how your day is going could be a benefit. “If the workday has been exhausting and you are now trying to get up the energy to go to the gym, that’s one playlist,” Ms. Calico explained. “If you leave work furious with a co-worker and that anger is threatening to follow you home, that’s another.” Nina Eidsheim, a professor of musicology at U.C.L.A., agreed. “If a commuter’s goal is to de-stress or to have a productive workday using music, I’d encourage them to think about what music puts them in which mood and to create their own highly personalized commuting playlist with that purpose in mind,” she told us.","Thursday: Tunes for your trip to and from work, and Grand Central Reads to whet your literary appetite.",2018-08-16T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: A Playlist for Commutes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/nyregion/new-york-today-commute-music.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/16/nyregion/16nytoday/16nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"But fame came to Bernstein through a stroke of luck. A Jewish boy from the Boston suburbs, Bernstein moved to New York City in his early 20s and spent time playing piano at the Village Vanguard in the West Village and working at a music-publishing house. At 25, he was hired as an assistant conductor at the Philharmonic. “Normally all the assistants did was to get the scores ready, read the mail, do the chores, take notes, that sort of thing,” Mr. Burton said. But one snowy Sunday afternoon in 1943, the guest conductor from Germany was sick, and Mr. Bernstein took over the program, to great success. “Lenny rode his luck and he was front-page news from then on,” Mr. Burton said. Later, as the Philharmonic’s musical director, he turned it into the best orchestra in America, Mr. Burton added. “He used it as a political instrument,” Mr. Burton said. “He went to Berlin when the wall was up. He went to Russia, and made friends with the Russians — tried to as part of the Nixon peace offensive, and so on.” “And he changed the face of music, temporarily, at least, by making a generation, maybe two, very much more aware of classical music than they ever had before,” Mr. Burton said.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE and JONATHAN WOLFE,"While the risk is mostly over the long term, Dr. Brissette said, “even just a few hours of very intense UV exposure can cause damage to the eyes.” Photokeratitis, for example, is the eye’s equivalent of a sunburn. Here are some eye protection tips: Know when you’re most at risk. “Sunlight is strongest midday and early afternoon, so be conscientious of that,” Dr. Brissette said. “And it’s not just summertime; it’s any time of the year because UV and sunlight can also be reflected off snow.” Choose 100 percent protection. “Most sunglasses will have a sticker or tag indicating that they block 100 UV rays,” she said. “Sometimes it says UV 400, another indication that there’s UV protection in the sunglasses.” (Polarized lenses can cut down on glare and dark or colorful lenses may help with contrast, but neither necessarily protect your eyes from the sun, Dr. Brissette said; you’ll still need the UV protection designation.) Go bigger — it’s better. “Small sunglasses seem to be quite trendy, but they can put you at an increased risk of UV exposure. Bigger, oversized sunglasses protect the light coming in on top and sides,” Dr. Brissette said. “You’re protecting not only the eyeballs, but also the eyelids, because you can get a number of skin cancers on the eyelids and it’s difficult to apply sunscreen there.”",Tuesday: Eye safety measures and a beach in Manhattan.,2018-08-21T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Protecting Your Eyes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/new-york-today-protecting-your-eyes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/21/nyregion/21nytoday/21nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
ALEXANDRA YOON-HENDRICKS and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The earthquake that struck eastern Los Angeles County on Tuesday caused little damage, but it was a reminder of the seismic volatility in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Forty-seven years ago, a much more powerful earthquake struck Sylmar — about an hour’s drive from the epicenter of Tuesday’s earthquake — killing 65 people and severely damaging four hospital campuses. The consequences of that disaster are still being felt. A law passed in 1973 that ordered hospitals to strengthen their most vulnerable buildings has had unintended consequences across the state. To Nancy Skinner, a state senator in the East Bay, the seismic safety law has been used as an excuse for a vital acute-care hospital, the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, to shut down services at its Berkeley location. The hospital cites financial difficulty in funding the mandated retrofit, whose deadline has been pushed back several times and is now 2020. (There is also a 2030 deadline for buildings to be able to not only withstand an earthquake, but also remain operational.) Officials with Sutter Health, the hospital system that runs the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, has reassured locals that services will remain intact and that the center will relocate several miles south to Oakland. But Ms. Skinner said the move — which will result in some ambulances and patients having to use one of the most congested highways in America — would have an “extreme” impact on her constituency. The hospital controversy underscores a recurring problem in California: Residents want safer buildings, but they fear the more immediate consequences of costly renovations.","Thursday: The effects of a 1973 law that are still being felt, new policies on campus sexual misconduct, and a special escort to kindergarten.",2018-08-30T12:57:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Costs of Making Buildings Safer,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/california-today-earthquake-retrofit-hospitals.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/30/briefing/30calitoday-bates/30calitoday-bates-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JOSE A. DEL REAL and MATT STEVENS,"The broader fight for the river, said Ms. Cordalis, is “all about cultural restoration. This is a story of cultural perseverance, and of surviving assimilation and oppression.” “I think a lot of our people who are on drugs have that same feeling: You want that culture back, because you feel it in your heart and you believe in it and you know what’s right,” she said. “Until that, I think people are really susceptible to all these bad influences.” Related efforts include the revival of their native language and the planned development of “wellness villages,” culturally appropriate sites along the river that can serve as rehabilitation homes, where basket weaving and sweathouses will play a role. Tribal leaders highlighted the success of young tribal members pursuing higher education at top tier schools, who they hope can come back home to the reservation and contribute to the cultural revival. Many struggling through drug addiction have found hope in reconnecting with traditions, like Codie Donahue, 38, who wound up homeless after he and his girlfriend became addicted to methamphetamine and heroin. Mr. Donahue, who has Yurok and Karuk lineage, recently checked into a drug rehab program in Eureka. He has been thinking a lot about the holy ceremony he once performed as a high priest for the Karuk Indians. In the ritual, he and others would pray in hopes that the river would wash away the sins of his tribe.","Wednesday: An epidemic of heroin addiction and ecological strain, an appeals court ruling on homelessness, and an L.A. chef’s Manhattan venture.",2018-09-05T13:07:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: California Tribes Confront History and Heroin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/us/california-today-klamath-river.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/21/us/00sickriver1/00sickriver1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

The actual increase in housing, which would take decades to build, would most likely be much lower. Still, the numbers show that cities across California would have to endure big changes for the state to meet its climate goals. It has long been said that the problems California deals with today are the problems America will face tomorrow. Here and elsewhere, much of the action of climate change has centered on pushing utilities and drivers to use more renewable fuels.

Credit California Highway Patrol, via Associated Press “So a horse walks onto the 91 freeway,” the California Highway Patrol began on Twitter. As the authorities in Santa Fe Springs would go on to explain, the tweet was not a joke. Last weekend, the C.H.P. tweeted several photos of an officer arresting a man on a D.U.I. charge after he apparently rode a white horse onto State Route 91 near Long Beach. The horse, Guera, was unharmed and released to the rider’s mother, KABC reported. The station also reported that it had been the rider’s birthday. “Don’t put yourself, your beautiful animal, or others in danger of being killed in traffic,” the Highway Patrol warned. A timely lesson, because, wouldn’t you know it — today is National Horse Protection Day. “We get a chuckle out of the interesting situations we encounter from time to time,” the authorities wrote, “but one thing the C.H.P. does not do is ‘horse’ around with D.U.I.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Ms. Lewis said she was raped while in the Army. After that, she said, art saved her life. “Doing my artwork, I was able to continue to deal with life itself,” she said. “I knew that I had the gift, and it helped me survive.” Sculpture is her specialty. “Sting,” a work for which she was made a finalist, brings a scorpion to life through wood carvings. “I kept going and going,” Ms. Lewis said of the six months she spent on the sculpture, “and next thing I knew, it looked like it was breathing.” Photo “We do art every day,” said Nelijah Cox. “It literally saved our lives.” Credit Elias Williams for The New York Times Ms. Cox, 60, who served in West Germany and Fort Jackson in South Carolina in the 1980s before moving to New York in 1989, said that she, too, was raped in the Army and that art had been part of her healing process. “I suffer from PTSD from sexual trauma when I was in the military — when I went to the V.A., I was very depressed, I was out of it, I was suicidal,” Ms. Cox said. She learned needlepoint through the facility’s art therapy program. “We do art every day,” she said. “It literally saved our lives. It takes your mind away from the past experiences that are not good for you.” Photo “Mystic” by Nelijah Cox.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"The two operations work in tandem to distribute news to the laps of theatergoers (Playbill’s monthly circulation is about 3.5 million ), and, increasingly, the screens in their pockets. The average Broadway audience member spends about 16 minutes in their seats before a show starts, according to Playbill’s market research, but that time is increasingly spent on phones. “If it weren’t for the online operation, we would have closed already,” said Philip S. Birsh, the president and chief executive of Playbill. Photo Playbills must be updated each week, for every show, as casts change. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Some of that success can be attributed to Mark Peikert, who was hired by the magazine in 2016 and has broadened Playbill’s coverage to include more pop culture articles and online broadcasts of red carpet events. His job lately has been to channel the “Hamilton” bump, a surge in interest in theater news after Lin-Manuel Miranda’s groundbreaking show, and reach theater obsessives from Hell’s Kitchen to Kansas. He’s also given the print Playbill a makeover. “In the past, too many times the pages would look like The New Yorker, all text,” Mr. Peikert told us. “You don’t want to sit in a dark theater and read that before the show. You want to read something quick and snappy and get a lesson or learn something.” Photo Last October, 340 versions of the magazine were printed. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times For more than a hundred years, theatergoers have almost instinctively flipped through a Playbill before a show, and then tucked it in their bag or coat pocket as a keepsake. But, we wondered, how long will that experience with a print magazine last? “Forever,” Mr. Birsh said. “For the audience it’s a souvenir, it’s a guide and it’s woven into their experience. We’re happy to provide it as long as the audience demands it.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Everything’s coming up roses. Starting here, starting now, we’re welcoming a string of sunny days that will take us through the weekend. Today’s high is 53.

The day of environmental action began in the U.S. in 1970, spurred by the countercultural movements of the 1960s, and is now the largest secular observance in the world, according to the Earth Day Network, which coordinates events. This year’s Earth Day campaign is focused on ending plastic pollution, which clogs landfills, streets and the digestive tracts of ocean wildlife. A study from last year reported that 8.3 billion metric tons of plastics have been produced since 1950, with more than half made since 2004. In an attempt to reduce plastic waste, New York City tried to enact a plastic bag fee in 2016, but it fell through. Last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio renewed calls to ban plastic bags in the city, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he is considering a similar ban in the state. While our city is doing its part to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses, you can also get involved, or simply enjoy Mother Nature, this weekend. Here are a few ways to participate in Earth Day. Today. Tour green spaces and buildings on the Earth Day 5K Green Tour. The tour kicks off from various locations, from 9 a.m. to noon. [Tickets start at $30] Tomorrow. Broadway will be emptied of cars and filled with fitness classes, discussions, tours and trivia games during the car-free streets event from Times Square to Union Square.

Extra special attention is being paid to these last two races, said Lisa Foderaro, who covers politics and government in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for The Times. [ Ms. Foderaro explored the Westchester race in depth here. ] For years, Democrats have held a majority in the Assembly and Senate, but their initiatives have been blocked by the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of eight Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans. But after seven years of infighting, the I.D.C. and the Democrats reconciled over cookies and coffee at a Manhattan steakhouse earlier this month. “Now that the breakaway Democrats have agreed to return and it looks like smooth sailing, the one final hiccup would be if one of these two seats — in the Bronx or in Westchester — were to go Republican,” Ms. Foderaro said. “If so, the Democrats’ dream of retaking the Senate would collapse because they simply wouldn’t have the numbers.” The polls are open tomorrow from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. You can look up your polling place here or call the Board of Elections at 866-VOTE-NYC.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Dear Diary: I was on an M86 bus heading west toward Central Park. As usual, the riders were insulating themselves against the world around them in one way or another. At Third Avenue, there was a noise. “Look, Daddy!” a child said to her father, pointing down. An egg carton had fallen out of a woman’s bag, off her lap and onto the floor. The eggs were rolling around every which way, up and down the aisle and underneath the seats. Yet none of them broke, and the woman seemed strangely unperturbed. Looking around, she realized what we were all thinking. “They’re all hard-boiled!” she said. Then, like a SWAT team, the people on the bus sprang into action. A man who had been dreamily stroking his beard dived for a couple of the eggs as they glided by. “Call you back!” a young woman said into her phone, putting it into her pocket and scooping up an egg as it rolled over her toe. A poodle yipped at a wayward egg meandering toward its owner, who captured it between her high heels and retrieved it daintily between two fingers. Within a few blocks, the bus was transformed into a rolling hub of community action. And before the driver could say “Madison Avenue,” all dozen eggs had been accounted for and returned to their owner, with much laughter and good will.","Monday: What to expect this week from the storm, and a month of subway delays.",2018-09-17T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Hurricane Florence Effects,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/nyregion/new-york-today-hurricane-florence-effects.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/nyregion/17nytoday1/merlin_143732445_abce1b3e-a9be-4dd6-ad37-272a12ec0598-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JENNIFER MEDINA and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) One day, it was at an intersection not far from the Veteran Affairs hospital in Westwood. “What does that man’s sign say?” she asked from her car seat. A couple of weeks later, she asked about the woman I handed a $1 bill to outside my car. Not long after that, as we got off the freeway near Venice, she spotted them before I did: “Mommy, why are there are those tents there?” she said, pointing to a grassy clearing near the off-ramp. I do not try to shield my two young children from seeing the homeless people we pass as we go about our lives in Los Angeles. And I always try to answer the many questions that come from my kids, ages 3 and 5. Still, every time I try to explain why people are homeless and what we can do about it, I find myself worrying that I am doing it all wrong. Last month, a young couple set up a tent on a corner two blocks from our home, which means my children pass it daily on the way to and from school. The kids have asked about it almost every time we see it: Why do they have a dog? How did they buy the tent? Where do they cook the food they’re eating? Even when I’m flummoxed by the questions, I silently hope that they keep coming.

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"All of this would seem to be good news for California — more people insured presumably means a steadier recovery after an earthquake. Yet the increase came with unintended consequences. For reasons related to the way the earthquake authority is capitalized, the sharp increase in customers means the authority has to buy more reinsurance — the insurance that insurance companies buy for themselves to spread risk. This means the authority will be forced to raise rates around 2 to 4 percent annually, according to Mr. Pomeroy.

Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times One downside to the warmer weather: a surge in traffic accidents, according to a new report released on Thursday by the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio. April 29 of last year, according to the report compiled by the Department of Transportation, was the second deadliest day of the (otherwise very safe ) year. Highs had climbed to the 80s after a stretch of chilly weather, and on that day, four people were killed across the city and more than 200 were injured in crashes, some of which involved speeding, the report said. This led the city to examine the correlation between weather records and crash data; the department found that drivers and motorcyclists drive more recklessly — putting pedestrians at more risk — on weekends with warmer weather. As part of the mayor’s Vision Zero campaign, all eyes will be on our roads this weekend. “N.Y.P.D. officers will be out in force on weekends to combat the behaviors most associated with traffic tragedies,” said Thomas Chan, the Police Department’s chief of transportation. “Our goal is to ensure everyone enjoys these weekends and returns home safely.” New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

VIVIAN WANG,"But the federal government could challenge the legality of these workarounds. And that’s if officials can even figure out how any of these highly theoretical, never-before-tried pitches would work. State Park at Jamaica Bay: Last month, Governor Cuomo unveiled a proposal to build a 407-acre state park on Jamaica Bay, partly atop old landfills, that he said would be the largest in the city. (That is, it would be the largest state park. Many city parks, including Central Park, are bigger.) To make the park, the state would take over a stretch of federal land near Starrett City and Spring Creek. Taxes on opioids and vapes: Mr. Cuomo has proposed a tax on prescription opioids sold in New York. The charge would be 2 cents per milligram of active opioid. All the money raised would go to a prevention and rehabilitation fund. The governor also proposed a tax of 10 cents per fluid milliliter on vapor products such as e-cigarettes. He tried a similar idea last year, but the proposal never made it out of the Legislature. Here’s what else is happening: Weather Warm and foggy. What kind of February weather is that? The record for this date is 69 degrees. We will come close, with a high of 65. The fog will lift in the afternoon but return in the evening.

Credit Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Now that the proposals have been put out there, who will actually decide if they become reality? Here’s a quick primer on the key players in Albany. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. New York has a history of powerful executives, and no doubt Mr. Cuomo will exert a heavy hand on any legislative or budget negotiations this year. Some observers believe that Mr. Cuomo, a moderate, is tacking left as he gears up for the election this fall (which he is expected to win handily). Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie. Mr. Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, leads the 150-member State Assembly, which is dominated by Democrats from the metro area. He is a moderate who assumed power in 2015, after longtime speaker Sheldon Silver was forced to resign over corruption charges, and is the first African-American speaker in the state’s history. Senate Majority Leader John J. Flanagan. Like Mr. Heastie, Mr. Flanagan, a Republican from Long Island, took the reins in the wake of scandal. He became the leader of the 63-member State Senate in 2015, after his predecessor, Dean Skelos, was arrested on federal corruption charges. Mr. Flanagan must broker deals between his party’s more moderate delegation from Long Island and more conservative senators upstate. The Independent Democratic Conference Leader, Jeffrey Klein. Only in New York would you find the I.D.C., a group of eight renegade Democratic senators who collaborate with the Republicans, solidifying their control of the chamber. That collaboration has given Mr. Klein, the group’s leader, disproportionate influence in Albany. It remains to be seen if a recent accusation of sexual assault will change that.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"When Ms. Jennings tried to hop on, the conductor stopped her and told her to wait for a car with her “people in it.” “I then told him that I had no people,” Ms. Jennings wrote, and she boarded the car anyway. Although New York had abolished slavery nearly 30 years before, many restaurants, churches, and schools were still segregated. Public transportation cars were marked with placards announcing whether African-Americans were allowed on board. Get out, the conductor ordered. “I answered again that I was a respectable person, born and raised in New York,” Ms. Jennings said, “and that he was a good for nothing impudent fellow for insulting decent persons while on their way to church.” The conductor tried to pull Ms. Jennings from the car, but she held onto the window frame. Photo The corner of Pearl and Chatham Streets, where Elizabeth Jennings hailed a horse-drawn streetcar on her way to church. Credit Emmet Collection, New York Public Library “You shall sweat for this,” he said. He drove without making stops to a corner on the Bowery and called over a police officer. The officer sided with the conductor and pushed Ms. Jennings onto the street, breaking her bonnet and dirtying her Sunday attire. The officer “tauntingly told me to get redress if I could,” Ms. Jennings wrote hours later. She filed a lawsuit against the Third Avenue Railway Company, the operator of the streetcar, with the help of a lawyer, Chester A. Arthur, who would later become our 21st president. The court ruled in her favor, granting her $225 in damages and allowing all African-Americans to use public transit, as long as they were “sober, well behaved, and free from disease.” As a result of the ruling, within five years, the city’s streetcars were largely integrated. Ms. Jennings went on to found the city’s first kindergarten for African-American children, at her home on West 41st Street. Her story of defiance may not be widely known, but in 2007 a sign reading “ Elizabeth Jennings Place ” went up at the corner of Spruce Street and Park Row — 154 years and a few blocks from where she refused to get off the streetcar.

Six people were killed, more than a thousand were injured and over 100,000 people evacuated the area.

Greenwald, president of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Last month, the museum unveiled a new installation for viewing: a roughly three- to five-foot model of the World Trade Center parking garage, designed by the F.B.I. to convey the scale of the damage created by the bomb.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"Food makes sense as a cover word for money, said Robert A. Leonard, head of the forensic linguistics program at Hofstra University: Both are desirable, and food often sounds natural in regular conversation. “The best code words are language that seem to mean something totally different than what it really means, but seems to fit into the context,” said Mr. Leonard, who testifies as an expert language witness in criminal cases. “Food is good because it’s quotidian.” The magic word doesn’t have to be a foodstuff. In a 1995 case, a former New York City transportation official prosaically referred to payoffs as “ commitments.” Farther afield, in South Africa, the code phrase was “ Eiffel Tower ”; in the Democratic Republic of Congo it was “ making a whiskey ”; and in Lebanon a common remedy for unlined pockets is “ aspirin.” Secret language often figures in perjury and bribery cases, Mr. Leonard said, because these are crimes that are often “committed via the uttering of a word.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Cloudy with a chance of meatballs.

TIM ARANGO and JULIE TURKEWITZ,"Trumpism has come to stand for many things — a tough immigration policy, a chaotic culture inside the White House, freewheeling foreign policy. “But its first expression was anti-Mexicanism,” said Harry Simon Salazar, an organizer with Union Del Barrio, which held a news conference and rally Monday in downtown San Diego, the night before the visit. Another gathering on Monday was held in Chicano Park, in the Logan Heights neighborhood of San Diego, historically an area for Mexican immigrants. The park is adorned by colorful murals honoring Mexican-American and Native American history – a lineage linked by oppression and revolt. Or, as Mr. Salazar, put it, “an unbroken chain of collective consciousness.” However, not everyone at the Trump rally was waving a Trump sign. Two Mexican-Americans were holding signs for Point Loma Electric (“hundreds of five star reviews”). They said they supported the president, and were also hoping to drum up some business.

The tour has 11 stops with titles like “the Free Speech Movement” and “Satanic Verses and Cody’s Books,” and it is narrated by people who participated in the avenue’s history. Among them is Osha Neumann, a lawyer and painter of the People’s Mural, which depicts social movements of the 1960s. This includes Bloody Thursday, a 1969 clash between students and police officers over the park that led to the death of a man named James Rector. “I painted this mural originally because I thought history was important to be remembered, and I still do that,” Mr. Neumann says. “And that’s what this mural is about, trying to keep that monument to that spirit as everything around us tries to erase it.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

ADAM NAGOURNEY and THOMAS FULLER,"The reversal comes as there has been mounting public concern — and embarrassment — over homelessness here, and frustration with city and neighborhood leaders who have been blocking such projects. Neighborhoods once objected to shelters on the grounds that they would draw homeless people to their streets. But in what advocates for the homeless say is a significant shift in public attitudes, the spread of homeless encampments means that for many neighborhoods, the choice might be homeless people camped out on the corner or living in an actual building up the street. Another factor may have been a series of Los Angeles Times editorials criticizing public officials for blocking shelters — including Mr. Huizar. The councilman, the paper reported, called “just before this series was put to bed to say he’d changed his mind and would urge the City Council to approve the Boyle Heights project.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

JONATHAN WOLFE,"The average New Yorker already works 49 hours and 8 minutes a week, longer than their counterparts in the next 29 largest cities in the U.S., according to a 2015 report by the city comptroller. And that’s not including hours spent emailing at home. A 2017 study found that, on average, workers spend an extra eight hours a week sending email after work. Research has also shown that people who responded to work communications after 9 p.m. had a worse quality of sleep and were less engaged the next day. “When you don’t have recovery and time off, it leads to more stress and ultimately burnout and exhaustion,” said Larissa K. Barber, a professor of psychology at Northern Illinois University who conducts research on work-life balance and coined a term for this phenomenon: “ telepressure.” But now that round-the-clock communications are ingrained in the way we work, some businesses might view cutting out these communications as shortening the workday, and hurting their bottom line, said Sonia Marciano, a professor of management and organizations at New York University’s Stern School of Business. The best solution to fatigue from after-work work, she said, was an honest conversation about expectations between employer and employee. Unfortunately, she said, “those conversations rarely happen.” What are your thoughts on responding to electronic communications after hours? Should we have a law in New York that prevents companies from retaliating against employees who unplug after work? Let us know what you think in the comments.

Credit Ali Asaei for The New York Times We recently asked our readers for their thoughts on after-hours emailing, and how they manage it. Here’s what they said. “I live in a multilevel private house. When I go up to my bedroom in the evening, I leave the cellphone on the charger downstairs in the kitchen. That way, I am less tempted to respond to emails or calls from my consulting clients or graduate students after the dinner hour. Of course, occasionally I take the laptop with me, which defeats the purpose.” — Melba Butler, 63, Jamaica, Queens “Being a freelancer means I don’t really have off-hours. As soon as a work-related email, text, or phone call comes in, the response clock stars ticking down. Unless I’m asleep, teaching, or playing a gig, I respond immediately.” — Jono Waldman, 36, East Harlem “I ‘ Boomerang ’ my work email as soon as I finish for the day or week, with a message to text only if something is urgent. Any emails sent after this time return to my inbox first thing on the next business day.” — Carolyn Robinson, Wooster, Ohio “A few years ago I was disgusted with myself because I’d become an addicted smartphone drone. I took the radical step of canceling my phone service and rejecting permanent connectivity. I got a computer phone number so I could get texts make calls when at a Wi-Fi hot spot, and told people to leave me a message and I’d get back to them. Business associates envied my resolve but didn’t feel it would work. It has. I am a liberated person now, free at last, free at last.” — Arthur Kaye, 67, Chappaqua, N.Y. “I’m on the clock 24/7 … but I choose to be. I didn’t move to New York to sit around and watch TV all day!” — Nick El-Tawil, 27, West Village New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Is there a new or unusual dress term you’re seeing? Wisniewski : “Dress to Impress” and “After 5.” Petit-Frère : “Diced Up” — it’s a new way of way saying “fresh” or rocking a “clean” look. How do you decode those tricky dress codes? Jones : Look at the invite itself to find subtle hints: The overall design, the time of day and the hosts themselves are some of your best clues. If the invitation to an 8 p.m. cocktail party came from your ostentatious aunt on metallic card stock, opt for an outfit on the dressier side. Bendet : I like to dress in theme specifically coordinating with décor. For my friend Amirah [Kassem] ’s Flour Shop rainbow cake store opening, I dressed in full rainbow sequins. What does ‘holiday festive’ mean? Friedman : Another way to think about it is “more fun than what you would wear to the office Christmas party.” Unless it is the office Christmas party. In which case, play it safe.” Jones : Mix brocade, velvet, metallic shine and look-at-me accessories all in one look. This is the season to pile it all on! Bendet: A velvet suit for a woman, or a chic jumpsuit, a sparkly dress. Petit-Frère: Gold and silver are also big this time of year, so go bolder with your metallic accessories. You can really push the thematic dressing with adding an ugly Christmas sweater to a tailored look, or holiday-themed socks with your dress shoes. Tam: A metallic jacquard jacket or sequin skirt paired with solid top. If wearing shine is not for you, metallic accessories are the perfect choice. Here’s what else is happening: Weather It’s Friday, and we’re chillin’. It may feel as nippy as 25 degrees as you head out this morning — the only thing taking the edge off will be the sunshine. A similar situation on Saturday, with a small chance of snow flurries in the afternoon, followed by a clear (but even colder) Sunday. Think toasty thoughts.

It’s almost a cliché to say they don’t make them like that anymore — well it is a cliché, but so what. They don’t. Mr. Brown held office before California voters adopted term limits, which meant he was able to serve 15 years leading the Assembly. All those years meant that Mr. Brown had the kind of knowledge, connection and experience that helped make him one of the most powerful leaders in California history. And his career kept going after he left Sacramento. He became mayor of San Francisco and today, at 83, he is writing political columns for the San Francisco Chronicle, where, characteristically, he has shown no reluctance in letting you know how he thinks. “Democrats needed the high road, so they ran over Al Franken,” read the headline over Mr. Brown’s weekend offering..

"CONOR DOUGHERTY, ADAM NAGOURNEY and THOMAS FULLER","Adam: The difference I notice, and maybe this is because of the history of San Francisco — the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, and the cultural turmoil in the Haight and the Castro — is that politics there have always been more intense and a bit more left. Political interest in Los Angeles has always been more intense than New Yorkers (just kidding, Mom!) might think, though I don’t think it’s quite as intense as San Francisco. (Or wasn’t that is, until last year’s presidential election). Conor: Fair enough. In the ’90s people said the NorCal/SoCal rivalry was mostly a one-sided affair in which people in San Francisco were jealous of L.A.’s status as a global capital and people in L.A. thought San Franciscans were cute. But now, with the growth of the tech industry, S.F. is taking on Hollywood and the Bay Area has become a Los Angeles-like slurb with 405-grade traffic. My overall argument comes down to this: In various ways, San Francisco and L.A. are a lot more alike now, and that makes L.A. hard to hate.

THOMAS FULLER,"“Every day we think about what happened in 2005,” Mr. Bell said on Tuesday. “We know what Montecito is going through because we lived through exactly the same thing. It was a mud flow, it was rapid-moving, it buried people.” A number of articles have been published recently about people pondering the wisdom of living in California, fire-prone and seismically volatile as it is, not to mention bank-account-emptying expensive. Photo The scene in La Conchita on March 6, 1995. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times When heavy rain comes, Mr. Bell plows mud flows off the streets with the town’s tractor the way Americans farther north do with snow. I asked him if he had a message for the grieving residents of Montecito. “Work together as a community, as a team,” he said. But the words of a 2005 United States Geological Survey report on La Conchita are equally apt. “This was not the first destructive landslide to damage this community,” the report said, “nor is it likely to be the last.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

The entire West Coast plus Nevada and Colorado had gone green. The East Coast? Only Massachusetts and possibly Maine are on track to allow recreational sales this year. But there were signs on Tuesday that the scales might eventually even out a bit. Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, who was sworn in on Tuesday, repeated his promise to legalize cannabis. “A stronger and fairer New Jersey embraces comprehensive criminal justice reform comprehensively, and that includes a process to legalize marijuana,” he said. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, outlined his budget priorities, saying he would fund a study of a “regulated marijuana program.” Where does that leave us?

Once installed (youll need to be an admin for your Slack), you can use the app to create a list for the day that truly is a list for the day. Everything on it expires in 24 hours, which in an of itself is motivation to get things done. Things can be added to your list by typing /today-add and then the task or marked complete by typing/today-complete followed by the talk you want to mark done. You can also type /today-list into any channel during the day to list all of the tasks you currently have on your list to complete. The idea here is to collect those tasks that someone mentions in Slack in real time so you dont forget them. If you find yourself losing tasks during the day it can be a quick and easy way to keep track of them.","I’m a big fan of making lists.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"During a November meeting, Jeremy Prupas, the chief veterinarian for the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services, said he spoke with clinical nutritionists, a shelter medicine specialist and a veterinary toxicologist. None of them, he said, “thought it would be a good idea to feed shelter dogs a vegan diet.” When another commissioner asked him if any other shelter in the United States gave vegan food to animals, Dr. Prupas did not hesitate: “No.” After dozens of comments supporting the change, the commission asked for a formal analysis on the benefits and risks of moving dogs in the shelters to a vegan diet. Staff members are expected to deliver the report in February. Still, the proposal to go vegan has attracted several high-profile supporters, including Moby, the musician who also runs a vegan restaurant in the Silver Lake neighborhood. “If we adopt this, it’s one more thing that proves to the world that Los Angeles really is the progressive capital,” Moby said during the meeting last month. Critics point to two primary reasons to keep the omnivore diet: expense and digestion. Moving to a vegan diet with higher fiber is likely to mean frequent doggy diarrhea, said Madeline Bernstein, the president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles, which would make it difficult for staff to maintain the health of thousands of dogs. (Ms. Bernstein described herself as “an occasional and conscious” meat-eater and said the group is careful to have vegan food at staff meetings and events.)

Here are some excerpts: — I’ve always thought that the Bay Area was politically more liberal and culturally more conservative while SoCal was politically more conservative and culturally more liberal. This is less pronounced now but still true. The new division is more urban/rural, coastal/inland, east/west than north/south. — Terry Burnes — NorCal folks tend to be more intense — about everything. Food, recycling, art, politics. There is a seriousness to all aspects of life. SoCal lives up to its reputation as being generally more chill. Angelenos are like the catering trucks to San Francisco’s four-star dining. They’re just as awesome, only a bit messier. The two areas are like siblings; competitive, bickering, supportive, loving siblings. — Rachael Cudlitz — Having lived many years in both Northern and Southern California, I think what is most striking is how oblivious the two halves are to each other on a day-to-day basis. In each place, the other is talked about very much like one would report on events on the other side of the country. — Marcia J. Bates — It is no surprise that San Francisco and L.A. don’t see a north-south rivalry. The are both highly democratic, densely populated, commercialized areas which impose taxes for their pet projects on the rest of the state. These areas control the state budget without needing or wanting any input from rural areas. If you really wanted to know about schisms in California you should have asked a reasonable State of Jefferson supporter. — Anita Paque. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Aimée Lutkin,"Spring is here, which means its once again for the most wonderful day of the year: Free Cone Day at Ben &amp; Jerrys.
For those not already familiar with the annual ice cream event, the franchise opens its doors once a year to offer a free cone to anyone willing to stand in line. In the past, Ben &amp; Jerrys has also used the day to register new voters, as one of the companys pet political agendas is battling voter disenfranchisement. Theyve even sent out trucks to give out free ice cream in Florida and inform voters about the measure to restore voting rights to former felons in the state (which passed!), as the New Times reported.
So, the cone isnt entirely without strings, but theyre ones Im happy to have pulled. And Thrillist shared this warm quote from their CEO about their motivations:
Were nothing without our fans, CEO Matthew McCarthy said in a statement. This is one of our favorite days of the year. Its a special tradition, and I cant wait to see all the smiles and happiness Free Cone Day brings. Its all about saying thank you to our fans.
Ben &amp; Jerrys locations all over the world are supposed to be participating; as a frequent enjoyer of Free Cone Day, my recommendation is to get your ice cream early and to tip the scoopers.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Of the many, many articles Ive read and written about setting goals over the past few years, the one thing thats stuck with me, thats worked in my own life, is to focus on small actions you can accomplish today.
You should absolutely set long-term goals and plans, but to be successful in accomplishing them, you need to take it step by step. 
In a way, its the opposite of dont miss the forest for the trees. You dont want to get too caught up in meaningless details that you cant finish anything. But by zeroing in on what you can feasibly do in any given day, youre lessening the stress of thinking about all of the things you must do, and just, well, doing them.

This is particularly true of financial goals, which almost always seem overwhelming and actually make a difference in our lives each and every day. Right now, for example, Im working on ratcheting up my emergency fund. If I think about the total number I want to reach$20,000its overwhelming and can even be a deterrent. But by breaking that down into daily or weekly actions, Ive been able to make some headway. Not much, mind you, but some. And it feels pretty good.
Now consider something like retirement. If youve read an article that says you should have $1 million to retire comfortably, you might be put off from saving all together. It seems like such an enormous, out-of-reach figure, one thats even a little hard to comprehend fully. But if you can put that aside for a moment and think about a small, concrete step you can take todaysay, open a Roth IRA and invest $100 to get startedyoure closer to reaching that goal than you were.

David Murphy,"Right on cueit being Apple announcement day and allthe services-oriented tech giant has released the latest version of its iOS operating system. If you dont already have it, or have yet to receive the notification that an iOS update is available, simply tap on your Settings app &gt; General &gt; Software Update to begin the download. Itll take a while; it took me about an hour or so to download and install the update on a reasonably fast internet connection.
While you wait, here are some of the big features you can look forward to with the update. 
Apple News+
You can now pay Apple $10/mo to consolidate your many magazine subscriptions into a single digital package. If youre on the fence about Apples offering, you do get a one-month trial to play around with the new service. Dont forget to cancel it if you dont want it, however, as youll automatically be billed for the next months subscription if you forget. And, as Apple noted today, you can share your subscription with up to six family members via Apples Family Sharing feature. Anyone feel like adopting me?
Canada finally gets Apple News
Stop the presses. Canadian Apple fans can now read the news via Apples self-titled appeither in French or English, of course.
More silly Animoji
If you like turning your head into animals and sending quirky little virtual videos (or pictures, if you just tap your fake noggin) to your friends, youre in luck. You now get a giraffe, a shark, a warthog, and an owl. 
(Hey, Apple: Open up an App Store for Animoji and let other people create safe-for-work virtual creations. You could probably make even more services revenue.)
Siri and Apple TV
Update your Apple TV to tvOS 12.2, and your iOS device(s) to iOS 12.2, and youll be able to control whats on your Apple TV with a lot more granularity. As MacRumors notes:
tvOS 12.2, when paired with iOS 12.2, is designed to allow users to ask Siri to play specific media on an Apple TV from an iOS device. You can, for example, ask Siri to play Modern Family on the TV in the living room, or Pitch Perfect on the TV in the bedroom. This feature is available for music, TV shows, and movies. 
That 5G E icon
If youre an AT&amp;T subscriber, you might see a new 5G E icon in the upper-right corner of your iPhone. You can now brag to your friends that you have an even better mobile connection than they do, and they can remind you that 5G E is just AT&amp;Ts bullshit way to say faster LTE, since your iPhone (as of when we wrote this) doesnt actually support 5G connectivity whatsoever. Isnt friendship grand.
Higher-quality audio Messages
This is a simple one, but Apple has boosted the quality of the audio messages you leave in Messages by adopting a different codec (Opus) at 24000 Hz instead of the previous AMR Narrowband codec at 8000 Hz. Neat.
More specific screen Downtime
You can now customize which days and times you want to schedule Downtime via iOS Screen Time feature. As a reminder, if your phone is in Downtime mode, youll only be able to use certain apps (you choose) and your devices Phone app. Thats it. Sorry, Facebook.
Group Facetime is back!
Yes, that horrible Group Facetime bug that allowed others to eavesdrop on what you were doing is gone, and the feature is back for all to use. Enjoy your Brady Bunch-like conversations.
Promotions for subscription apps
Apple is now allowing app developers to offer promotional pricing for subscriptions, so youll want to be a bit more judicious about when you sign up for that which you want to pay a recurring fee to access. As Apples iOS 12.2 release notes describe:
...apps with auto-renewable subscriptions can provide a discounted price for a specific duration for existing and previously subscribed customers. You can use subscription offers to help win back subscribers who have canceled their subscriptions or promote an upgrade to another subscription at a special price. Customers can accept the offer even if theyve already completed an introductory offer.
Air Quality in Apple Maps
If you live in a location thats prone to problems with air quality (hi, Northern California), youll now be able to view the air quality index right within Apple Maps. Alas, you cant superimpose some colorful filter over your map to see what the air is like for specific locations, but youll get a little indicator in the lower-right corner for whatever location youre viewing (when zoomed in enough).
You can also toggle this, or the weather conditions, on and off via the Settings app.
More support for Apple stuff (or stuff that works with Apple protocols)
If you have a fancier AirPlay 2-friendly television, youll now be able to add it to HomeKit. Similarly, iOS 12.2 offers full support for Apples newest AirPods, as well as the Logitech Crayon (for your iPad Pro).
Telling AirPlay to chill out
Youll now be able to do other things while youre using AirPlay to cast content from an iOS device to, say, your Apple TV. As Apples description notes, AirPlay multitasking for video allows you to browse other apps, as well as play other short form audio and video files locally on your device without interrupting AirPlay.
I think Redditor rfguevar put it best: Holy hell, Im internally jumping with joy (In a meeting)
Map your latest Apple Pay transaction
Apple updated the Wallet UI a bit to make your latest Apple Pay transaction a lot more pleasant to look at. Youll see the business, the location, and the amount you spent, and tapping on the listing will take you right to a more detailed information screenincluding a map that shows you the retailers location.
The epic debut of AirPower!
Just kidding. And speaking of disappointment, Apple is also geofencing the ECG setup process for the Apple Watch in iOS 12.2, so those of you who dont live in the U.S. wont be able to initialize it. Sorry!
Marking podcasts as played
For whatever reason, Apple previously removed the ability to mark a podcast as played within its Podcasts appafter pressing-and-holding or deep-pressing a podcast episode. Well, that feature is back in iOS 12.2. 
Safari searches are easier to autofill
If you love using Safari on iOS, Apple has tweaked the autofill aspect of the address bar slightly. Start typing something. When you see the recommended search phrases appear on your screen, you can tap on the phrase itself to immediately go to the search results for that phrase. Now, however, you can also tap on a new blue arrow icon to just place that text in the address bar, in case you want to modify your search query even more.","Right on cue—it being Apple announcement day and all—the services-oriented tech giant has released the latest version of its iOS operating system.

While we can all (hopefully) agree that these arent exactly real holidays they do often equal real savings on whatever the day is celebrating, and today is National Burrito Day.
To celebrate everyones favorite tortilla-wrapped meal, a number of national chains are offering deals to enhance those celebrations. Here are the ones weve found.

El Pollo Loco
El Pollo Loco is offering BOGO burritos on Thursday. To score the deal youll need the coupon posted on the restaurants website.
Chipotle
Chipotle is celebrating the big day by teaming up with YouTuber David Dobrik to offer a National Burrito Day burrito called the Dobrik Burrito. Presumably what Dobrik himself enjoys eating, the burrito is brown rice, black beans, chicken, mild salsa, two scoops of corn salsa, a sprinkle of cheese and a side of guac for dipping.
Chipotle notes that the burrito is only available for digital orders, although you could probably just figure out how to order this one at the counter yourself. It will be on the menu through Sunday. Today you can get $0 delivery fees on the Dobrik or any other Chipotle burrito of your choosing through DoorDash as long as you spend $10 or more.
Moes Southwest Grill
Moes is celebrating the big day with $5 burritos at all of its locations nationwide.
Del Taco
Del Taco is handing out free half-pound Bean and Cheese burritos with a $5 purchase through its app.

You’re going to want to make sure to do that today before you download the update, just in case things get dicey and you end up having to unexpectedly do a hard reset on your device. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when you’re dealing with a new version of an OS. Also, keep in mind that downloads are likely to take longer than normal today right when the update drops, simply because everyone on the planet is trying to download and install the update at the same time. If you need your phone for a conference call mid-day, you may want to wait until afterwards to start the process. A good rule of thumb is to pick a time where your device can be MIA for at least an hour. If that’s going to cut things close, then wait until later. iOS 12 You’ll find iOS 12 on your iPhone or iPad by going into the Settings menu followed by General and then Software Update. Updating your device requires you to be connected to WiFi and have at least 50% of your battery charged (or have your device plugged in). watchOS 5 If you have an original Apple Watch then you’re going to be left out of today’s OS update. For everyone else, the update can be found by going to the Watch app on your iPhone and selecting General followed by Software Update. tvOS 12 You’ll find tvOS 12 by clicking into the Settings app on your Apple TV and then selecting Update Software.

Zachary Mack,"Should we break up Amazon and Facebook? Columbia Law School academic fellow Lina Khan, who wrote the impactful “ Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox ” for The Yale Law Journal, joins Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel to discuss whether Amazon and Facebook should be broken up and what it might look like if that were to happen. You can listen to their discussion about the case for breaking up Amazon and Facebook in its entirety on The Vergecast right now. Below is a lightly edited excerpt from the interview. Nilay Patel: You wrote a paper for Yale Law Review called “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Walk us through the argument you made there. Lina Khan: Sure, so the argument I made was that Amazon is a really elegant illustration of how the current framework in antitrust, the consumer welfare framework, really fails to capture forms of market power and forms of dominance that should be relevant to antitrust and do raise competition concerns. And so I was writing about Amazon because I think aspects of Amazon’s business strategy, specific practices that it used to become as dominant as it is, are a really useful vessel for talking about these broader shifts in antitrust. And so, you know, before I went to law school I was a journalist and a policy researcher and had spent some time interviewing the merchants that sell on Amazon. Just to try and understand it. You know, what are the business practices here? What are the contractual terms? What are the kind of day-to-day reality for these millions of merchants that feel dependent on Amazon, right? They feel that the only way they can really get to market in the internet age is by using Amazon, by selling on Amazon. And then also by interviewing investors, hedge funds, venture capitalists to try and see how Wall Street was thinking about Amazon and the dominance it was amassing. Those perspectives, [the] kind of people who have money on the line and interacting with Amazon and how they see the company, really helped shape how I think about the company’s power. And then thinking about how these people were thinking about Amazon and then thinking about how current antitrust law perceives Amazon just revealed this gap. I was interested in exploring this back gap and interested in thinking about how antitrust should be reformed in order to reflect the new realities of how market power gets exercised. And so the really TL;DR version of where we are right now with antitrust as a standard is something called the consumer welfare standard, which if you’ve been listening to The Vergecast, we talk about a lot actually. But it’s the notion that there’s only an antitrust problem if prices are going up, right? If companies consolidate a part of the market, they have a monopoly, they raise consumer prices, there’s some harm. We should break that up to add more competition, but if prices are stable or going down, you probably don’t have a problem. And Amazon obviously has very low prices, but they have all this ancillary power all across the rest of the internet, basically. Google’s prices are zero. So it’s very hard to articulate a harm in Facebook, right? Or we pay in data. I’m reluctant to say that there are free services. But the dollar amount we pay is zero. That’s right.","Should we break up Amazon and Facebook?

THOMAS FULLER,"Research universities like Stanford, Berkeley, U.C.L.A. and Caltech would likely be hit by the repeal of deductions for graduate students and a new tax on endowment income. Executives wanting to pursue a midcareer M.B.A. might reconsider; the House bill removes deductions for professional education courses. “These things have big consequences,” said Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “It makes the decision of staying in California much more difficult,” Mr. Rosen said. “It’s already difficult, it’s already expensive. This adds one more negative.” The potential winners in California are companies like Google and Apple, which would benefit from a slashed corporate tax rate and could repatriate billions of dollars of cash held overseas. Mr. Rosen is skeptical that the money will trickle down. “I don’t think they are going to use that money to invest more in the U.S. than they already have,” he said.

Some readers wrote of how they were worried about rising rents and home prices from the lack of available housing in their neighborhoods. Others expressed concern over the loss of community they were witnessing as a result of rapid development. Here are a few of their responses. My generation, the millennials, have fought hard to eke out a life in our urban landscape. Until we allow for apartment buildings in single-family home-exclusive districts, gentrification will continue to ravage our neighborhoods, our friends, our support networks. — Victoria Fierce in Oakland These higher-density homes and apartments have not decreased the value of the single-family homes. It’s time to realize that being a renter is not a crime and a neighborhood can support many types of housing. — Voter in the 49th in California I live around the corner from this house. People who have been here forever and can never afford to move are seeing an almost immediate turnover of their community. It’s scary for them. When Kurt talked about his vegetables he wasn’t being so literal; he was describing the loss of an old and interdependent network of supportive and caring folks: a neighborhood. — Daniel Rosenthal in Berkeley This agenda does not promote affordable housing, it promotes developer profits. The developer in this article was not content with building a $1.4 million home in Berkeley. No, they wanted to build three $1 million dollar homes on one lot, doubling their revenue, while diminishing quality of life for the neighbors. — Heather in San Francisco Traffic is already impossible in the Bay Area. Doubling or quadrupling the housing density will just commensurately increase the travel times. Trying to go somewhere on the weekends is almost impossible at this point.

THOMAS FULLER,"Ms. Shield, who earns $35,000 a year and lives in a house in Berkeley with four roommates, says the tax increase will stretch her already strained finances. “I limit myself to three coffees a week from coffee shops,” she said. She said she understands that writing a tax bill is a complex task. But removing the deduction for graduate students “just doesn’t make sense to me.” Mr. Vetri, whose taxes would increase by around 30 percent under the House tax bill, says researching the tax code was akin to exploring an alternate universe for him. “Every physicist in the world agrees on the basic mechanics of how electrons work,” he said. “There’s a lot more ambiguity in the tax code.” Mr. Vetri says the full impact of the tax law on graduate students will not be known until — and if — the Senate passes its bill and the two versions are merged into one.

Mr. Kelly made Oregon a national contender as offensive coordinator and then head coach from 2007 to 2012. His absurdly fast “Blur” schemes at first seemed like quackery, but they put points on the board — 47 per game in 2010 — and have been copied by teams ranging from Ohio State to the New England Patriots. Mr. Kelly had reportedly turned down bluebloods Florida, Nebraska and Tennessee (which is having a tougher go hiring a new coach). At a news conference Monday, Mr. Kelly addressed certain touchy subjects, including whether star quarterback Josh Rosen, a junior, will turn pro this off-season (Mr. Kelly does not know) and what he learned from a recruiting scandal at Oregon (“I take full responsibility”). But mostly he flashed an almost Groucho Marx-style sense of humor. Asked whether his Bruins teams would have the same offense as his Oregon ones did, he replied, “No, those players have all graduated.” Don’t look now, but the Trojans may be Los Angeles’ second-coolest team. — Marc Tracy California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"It is perfectly normal for distracting thoughts to enter your head, Ms. Duckworth said. Try returning your focus to your breath. Ms. Brach also offered a tip: “During practice, when you realize the mind has been distracted, pause for a moment, and without judgment, reawaken your senses. Become aware of the sounds around you, the sensations and feelings throughout your body, the feeling of your breath. Knowing how to step out of the incessant inner dialogue that perpetuates stress, and re-grounding in the present moment, brings much freshness, creativity, clarity and ease to our hearts and minds.” My boss is on his eighth egg nog at the office party, and I need to center myself. Do I need to find a quiet conference room to meditate? Distraction-free locations are not necessary for meditation, the experts said, but they are recommended for beginners. With practice, you might be able to meditate during your commute. And eventually, Ms. Brach said, “you can practice informal meditation, or meeting life with a non-judging, openhearted presence, during all the activities of life: conversations, creative endeavors, sports, eating, lovemaking and taking a shower.” Aside from filling the air with the scent of gingerbread, what is the best way to breathe during meditation? Many meditators recommend breathing in through the nose and out the mouth, Ms. Duckworth said, but there’s no right or wrong way. Really, the purpose of paying attention to the breath “is to help collect the attention, quiet the mind and more fully notice the experience of the present moment,” Ms. Brach said. “You will find that what deepens your meditation is not how you’re attending to your breath, such as breathing through the nose, the mouth, or into the belly, but the quality of the attention itself.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather If your mood depends on the weather, you might not need to assume a lotus pose today.

Adam Clark Estes,"Another iPhone day is now behind us, and even the most skeptical Apple fans might be asking themselves, “Was that it?!” We got three new iPhones and a new Apple Watch. That’s it. To be reasonable, 2018 is an off-year for Apple. It’s an “s” year, a time when the company bumps specs rather than completely overhauling its iPhones. Apple announced two new iPhones with an “s” after the name: the iPhone Xs and the iPhone Xs Max. The third device is called the iPhone XR, which represents a new naming scheme, and might be the most interesting of the bunch. And again, being reasonable, the Apple Watch did get its first ever redesign. Everything Apple announced this year still seems a little underwhelming, though‚ despite the fact that the sheer number of new specs seems a little bit overwhelming. However, Apple failed to announce a lot of things that a lot of people expected, including a new iPad Pro with Face ID, a cheap MacBook, and a release date for its long-awaited AirPower charging pad. Oh well. Let’s break down what Apple did announce. Apple iPhone Xs This is the one that had to happen. A year after Apple revealed the iPhone X before letting everyone know that it wasn’t quite ready for primetime, the company announced a solid update to the first Face ID-enabled device. The iPhone Xs looks almost identical to its predecessor. There’s the same 5.8-inch OLED display that stretches fills up nearly the entire span of the iPhone’s screen, which comes encased in stainless steel and what Apple calls “the most durable front glass ever in a smartphone.” What’s left is the now-famous notch, which houses the same Face ID hardware as before, but Apple says that new software makes Face ID faster than before. The OLED display itself is also supposed to show 60 percent greater dynamic range in HDR photos. The real gut update of the iPhone Xs is a new A12 Bionic processor that comes in the form of Apple’s first 7-nanometer chip. The new processor comes with a six-core fusion architecture, including two performance cores that Apple says are 15 percent faster. There’s also a four-core GPU that’s supposedly 50 percent faster, and an eight-core Neural Engine that can handle 5 trillion operations per second, compared to the A11 Bionic processor’s 600 billion. Those are all Apple’s bragging numbers, so we’ll have to test it out in processor-hungry environments like games and augmented reality to see if the improvements make a difference. Many trillions of processes per second sure sounds impressive, though. The other noteworthy upgrade included with the iPhone Xs involves the camera. On the outside, the new iPhone dual-camera system looks a lot like its predecessor, but the components have been updated. There are two new 12-megapixel sensors on the rear camera that are faster and include larger pixels, as well as a new True Tone flash module. Meanwhile, the new A12 Bionic chip offers better image processing, including improved low-light performance and Portrait Mode. The new iPhone Xs comes in space grey, silver, and an all-new gold finish. You can choose between a 64GB, 256GB, and a new 512GB model. Prices start at $1,000. Pre-orders start Friday, September 21, and the devices ship on Friday, September 28. Apple iPhone Xs Max This new iPhone represents a familiar trick. It’s just the iPhone Xs but bigger. The size is notable for a couple of reasons, though. First, Apple released the iPhone X in only one size: 5.8-inches. Second, the iPhone Xs Max’s 6.5-inch display is the biggest Apple has ever released for an iPhone. The device itself is about the same size as an iPhone 8 Plus, but it incorporates the same bezel-free design as the iPhone X and iPhone Xs. That means it comes with Face ID as well as all the same hardware upgrades as the iPhone Xs, including the A12 Bionic processor, improved camera, and 512GB storage option. Based on Apple’s presentation, however, the only thing that the iPhone Xs Max offers besides the bigger screen is a bigger battery. Apple says it’s the biggest one it’s ever offered on an iPhone. The iPhone Xs Max comes in all the same colors and storage options as the iPhone Xs. The device starts at $1,000 and ships alongside the iPhone Xs. Apple iPhone XR This one’s kinda kooky! Earning the famous “one more thing” billing at the Apple event, the iPhone XR looks a lot like the 5.8-inch iPhone Xs, except it’s a little bit bigger and a lot cheaper. It also comes in many colors. The iPhone XR comes with a 6.1-inch LCD display that comes in the familiar notched design, wrapped up in an aluminum frame and the new more durable glass. It’s notched because this iPhone has Face ID and no home button, just like its pricier siblings. Apple calls the new LCD a “Liquid Retina” display that’s supposed to look better than its predecessors. The iPhone XR also lacks a second rear camera, but Apple found a way to pull off Portrait Mode using software, thanks to the A12 Bionic processor which is included in this cheaper model. So the iPhone XR is a lot like the iPhone Xs, except it has an LCD screen, an aluminum frame, and only one camera. That doesn’t sound so bad when you consider the fact that this device starts at $750, which is cheaper than the launch price of the iPhone 8. (The iPhone 8 now starts at $600, and the iPhone 7 starts at $450.) You can also get the iPhone XR in six pretty colors: white, black, blue, yellow, and coral. Unfortunately, you will have to wait for this intriguing, cheaper iPhone. The iPhone XR will be available for preorder on October 19 and will hit stores on October 26. Apple Watch Series 4 This one is exciting for lovers of subtle design upgrades and heart health. The Apple Watch Series 4 comes with a thinner case, a larger screen, and a new heart rate sensor that can also do electrocardiograms (ECGs). Also, it knows if you fall down. The fourth generation Apple Watch is presented as the sleekest health device on the market. There’s an improved accelerometer that not only knows if you’ve fallen down but also how you did it (e.g. trip, slip, straight up lost it). The updated heart rate sensor, which is encased in a ceramic shell with sapphire crystal, will also tell you more about how your heart beats and will even make it easy to print out those records and take them to your doctor. The device has been certified by the FDA. On top of the health stuff, the Apple Watch is just a little better and nicer on all other fronts. It comes in slightly larger 40mm and 44mm that importantly have 30 percent more screen real estate. They also have a new Digital Crown with haptic feedback that will now buzz back at you as you turn it. The secondary button now sits flush with the case, too. The Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $400 for the GPS-only model and $500 for the GPS-plus-cellular model. (That bumps the price of the Series 3 back to $280 and up.) The fourth generation watch comes in with a silver, gold, or space grey aluminum case. You can get stainless steel in silver, space black, and a new gold color. Apple will start taking orders on the Series 4 watches September 14, and the devices will start shipping September 21.","Another iPhone day is now behind us, and even the most skeptical Apple fans might be asking themselves, “Was that it?!” We got three new iPhones and a new Apple Watch.

Adam Clark Estes,"Apples highly anticipated, celebrity-studded services event didnt disappoint in two specific regards. One, there were a lot of celebrities present. Two, there were also a lot of new services announced. Its hard to say which was more exciting.
In a way, the celebrities were an afterthought. Apple opened the event with several major upgrades to existing apps and services, starting with a new magazine and newspaper subscription offering called Apple News+. Then, came a new, apparently very slick credit card called the Apple Card. Theres also an entirely new gaming service called Apple Arcade. Then the new Apple TV app and the completely new Apple TV+ service, which was the part all the celebrities talked about.
It was a weird Apple event, if only because theres never really been one like it. While it weirdly felt like an awards ceremony at timeswith Hollywood A-listers patting themselves and Apple on the back for doing great thingssome of the new Apple services look pretty cool. Lets talk through them.
Apple News+
Tim Cook opened up the event with a cute little story about how he likes going to the newsstand and looking at all the magazine covers. This is quaint because its increasingly hard to find a newsstand, which is probably why Apple talked about enlisting over 300 magazinesincluding National Geographic, Popular Science, Billboard, The New Yorker, Sports Illustrated, New York Magazine, and Varietyfor its new Apple News+ program. Apple News+ will show up as a new tab in the Apple News app. The new tab essentially looks like a redesigned version of Texture, a digital magazine subscription service that Apple acquired last year.
Apple News+ is pretty straightforward. For $10 a month, you get access to all those magazines as well as some newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. You will not get access to The New York Times or The Washington Post, apparently, because Apple wanted to keep half of the subscription fees. Apple News+ will work on the iPhone, iPad, as well as the Mac. Apple also says the new subscription service will not allow advertisers to track what you read and target ads accordingly. 
Apple News+ will be available through a software update later today. You can get a free one-month trial once you update and, again, its $10 a month after that. You do get family sharing for up to six members included for that price, which makes the whole thing pretty darn cheap if youre a family of six people who love to read.
Apple Card
Tim Cook says that Apple Pay is incredibly successful, so successful that Apple is expanding it by offering its own credit card (with help from Goldman Sachs). For now, the new Apple Card will only exist in digital form inside of Apple Wallet and will let you it through Apple Pay. A physical card made of titanium will be available later this summer. Its all white with a little Apple logo on it but wont have your name or credit card number or anything to ensure your privacy. (This information will be available in the Apple Wallet app.)
The new Apple Card actually sounds a lot like a regular credit card. You do get some rewards: 3 percent cash back (Apple calls this Daily Cash) on Apple purchases, 2 percent on other purchases, and 1 percent on purchases made with the physical card. You also get some tools within the Wallet app that help you track and categorize your spending as well as make smart decisions when it comes to making payments. Notably, there are no annual fees, no late fees, no hidden fees, no international fees, no over-the-limit fees. According to Apple: No fees. As the fine print on Apples website points out, however, missing payments will lead to increased interest charges. Our friends over at Lifehacker say its a pretty average rewards card, and were inclined to agree.
The Apple Card will be available later this summer. You can sign up to get notified about availability on Apples website.
Apple Arcade
Because March wouldnt be complete without another video game service announcement, Apple just gave us a preview of Apple Arcade. The name is actually handily descriptive because the service is basically a whole section of games built just for Apple devices and only available on Apple devices. To be more specific, Apple Arcade will become a new section of the App Store, and for a fee, youll get access to over 100 exclusive titles made by some of the top studios. There will even be a Sonic the Hedgehog game and a new version of Frogger.
Another cool thing about Apple Arcade is that all the games work offline, so you can play on a plane or the subway. The games also work on different platforms, so you can start playing on an iPhone and then pick up where you left off with an Apple TV device. Apple Arcade games will be ad-free and wont have any in-app purchases. As far as how much the service itself will cost, however, we dont yet know. Apple says the service will go live this fall and will cost money. You will also get family sharing for up to six people included in the price.
Apple TV and Apple TV+
Okay, these were technically two separate announcements, but were rolling them into one section here because its otherwise confusing. Basically, Apple is updating the Apple TV app thats already on millions of iOS and Apple TV devices. Apple is also making a version of the Apple TV app available for Mac as well as a bunch of smart TV platforms made by companies like Samsung and LG. On top of that, Apple will also make Apple TV apps for set-top boxes from Roku and Amazon.
Apple TV+ is a whole new thing on top of the new Apple TV. Some might even say it was the star of todays event, since announcing all of the new shows and celebrities involved took like an hour and a half. The new paid subscription video service appears to resemble an HBO competitor more than, say, Netflix. It will live in the new Apple TV app. The exclusive programming frankly sounds pretty cool. Theres a Steven Spielberg-led reboot of the sci-fi series Amazing Stories; a comedy about a TV morning news shows starring Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, and Steve Carrell; something called Sea with Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard that sounds simply trippy the way Momoa described it at the event; and Little America, a show about immigrants and children of immigrants produced by Kumail Nanianji. Those are just to name a few. Oh, and Ophrah is going to do a couple of documentaries.
Again, Apple declined to offer any details about exactly how much Apple TV+ would cost. It will start rolling out this fall with new programming being added every month. There are also a lot more celebrities and TV people involved than the ones that were on stage at the event. We cant wait to see if all this very expensive-looking programming will be better than Apples first attempts at original content: Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps. Its honestly not a very high bar to clear.","Apple’s highly anticipated, celebrity-studded services event didn’t disappoint in two specific regards. One, there were a lot of celebrities present.

Beth Skwarecki,"This one is for the hardcore novel writers who are doubting themselves, the ones who committed earlier this month to writing 50,000 words in 30 days, but then...uh, something happened. Good morning, National Novel Writing Month participants! Did you do your 1667 words this morning?… Read more Read As a person who has completed this challenge ten years in a row (including my 2017 novel on Thanksgiving day), I have some important information: It is totally normal, even among National Novel Writing Month “winners” (finishers), to spend some part of the month in a word deficit that feels like a black hole you’ll never climb out of. But there’s hope. I’d venture that if you have 10,000 words or less left to go, you can bust them out today. If you’re down to 5,000, that’s gravy. Your individual writing speed may vary, but if you can get the conditions just right, words will pour out of you. Here are some things to try. Pretend You’re in Hawaii If you’re toiling away tonight, and the clock flips to midnight, that’s it—the month is over. But since the world is round (it really is, I promise) it’s always midnight somewhere. That’s why I advise you to change your time zone on the NaNoWriMo website so that you can still log a win late tonight. When it’s midnight on the east coast, it’s only 7pm in Hawaii. You buy yourself an extra five hours with this trick, which I am convinced is not cheating, it’s just virtual travel. If you already live in Hawaii, I’m afraid you are too close to the international date line to buy much time. The best you can do is pretend you’re in Pago Pago, Samoa, and that’ll buy you an extra hour. Get Suddenly Sick I’m not saying you should lie to your boss or to the friends who are expecting you at some party or funeral or whatever. But if you were to get sick, your boss or friends would totally understand that you have to stay home. Plan an Evening of Word Sprints Okay, now you have time to write, but you need some reason to stay at your desk, some engine pushing you on to actually finish this thousand words and the next thousand words. I use two things to superpower my noveling: The @NaNoWordSprints twitter account, which is staffed 24/7 by encouraging writers who announce word sprints: writing as much as you can in 15 minutes, for example. Because Twitter is social, this also gives you a place to celebrate and/or complain as you complete each spring. Write or Die, a writing tool that does bad things if you stop typing. Set it to kamikaze mode and it will erase what you’ve written as soon as your fingers are idle for a few seconds. It’s like the bus in Speed, but for writing. Freewrite Look, you’re supposed to write 50,000 words that are part of this work of fiction, but nobody says it has to be polished prose. Especially if you’re stuck on a plot point or a bit of world building, just freewrite. That’s a technical writerly term for writing down whatever you’re thinking. If you think about your novel, it looks something like this: Okay I don’t know what to do from here but Matilda has to get onto the train somehow even though she’s lost her ticket. Maybe she sneaks on. Maybe she finds a squirrel that has been stealing tickets and hiding them in a hole with acorns underneath the platform. Maybe that weird guy from Chapter 1 comes back and offers to buy her a ticket and she’s like ew but I don’t want to sit next to you and so then I can spend the whole chapter trying to get her away from him once she’s on the train. Yeah that sounds good. I’m hungry. I wonder if there are any cookies downstairs. That was over 100 words and it took mere seconds to write. I don’t even know who Matilda is. You can fill thousands this way, especially if you’re trying to feel out your character’s backstory or some aspect of the fantasy world your characters live in. When you get to a plot point you’d like to write, feel free to switch back to “real” writing mode. Find a Predictable Story Arc One thing that makes writing hard is not knowing what you’re going to write next. So find something you do know how to write. Maybe you can send a character to the doctor. That means they have to make an appointment, drive over, find parking, sign in, have an awkward conversation in the waiting room, and so on. You can spice it up however you want: they discover the doctor is really the villain they were trying to track down in the previous chapter. Whatever. Make sure to have them run errands afterward and pick up their prescription. Do Something Unpredictable Or maybe your problem is that your plot is already planned out and you are just too bored to write the next thing. So mix it up! For the next scene you have planned out, ask yourself: what is the least predictable thing that could happen here? Maybe your character was going to get in a bar fight with the tough guy that’s making trouble, but the tough guy has to leave early for his job in the morning and your character decides to follow him to see where he works. Or maybe as they’re squaring up to fight, there’s an earthquake that demolishes the bar. Even Cheaper Tricks Look, you do what you have to. Give your characters lengthier names. Search and replace. For example, Ann can become “Anna Elizabeth, who thinks she is a princess” for literally every mention of her name. If you just spent an hour on Facebook instead of writing, gather up all your comments and statuses and put them in your novel. It’s your character that’s wasting time on Facebook, not you. Anna Elizabeth, who thinks she is a princess, would like to spend a whole chapter telling the reader her political opinions. Have a two-headed character (or, fine, two separate characters) who get into arguments about everything. Write a lot of appendices. Have your characters on a spaceship? Write the ship’s technical manual. Murder mystery? Make an appendix that’s a timeline of how things actually happened and in what order. Western? List the names of all the horses in the town and what color they are. Do you know how to knit? Have one character teach another how to knit. Don’t spare any detail. Don’t delete anything, ever. Have a scene that doesn’t quite work? Well, you wrote it, so it counts. Select it and hit Format &gt; Text &gt; Strikethrough (or whatever does that job in the software you’re using) and keep counting those words. Your character’s favorite recipes and song lyrics deserve space in the book, don’t you think? You can do this. I believe in you.","This one is for the hardcore novel writers who are doubting themselves, the ones who committed earlier this month to writing 50,000 words in 30 days, but then...uh, something happened.

Now it’ll be on your terms. You can choose the topic, and pre-empt the fight you’d lose with the fight you’d win. Or you can steer away from politics or religion and toward some personal argument, taking one for the team just to avoid sinking everyone into an existential funk.

(Bonus points if you’re the only drinker in a teetotaler family.) If you’re from one of those families that don’t fight but store everything up for years, maybe it’s time to open the safety valve.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"I found a startling statistic during my research that showed 79 percent of children whose families make less than $50,000 a year cannot swim. The 2017 study by the U.S.A. Swimming Foundation also found that nearly 64 percent of black children, 45 percent of Hispanic children and 40 percent of white children nationally have little to no swimming ability. Those numbers are similar here in Los Angeles itself, according to the city. There are some stellar new options for those who cant afford pricey private lessons. SwimLA, a citywide initiative tied to the 2024 Olympics, subsidizes the cost of classes for those who can demonstrate financial need. The program is seeking to double the number of young people who get swim lessons at public pools; 36,000 Angelenos have taken lessons through the program since it began in June. (Click here for class listings.) Kids of color are less likely to have a friend with a swimming pool or the money to be able to afford classes, said Mayor Eric Garcetti, a champion of the program.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"As we continue to slide into fall, our days are getting shorter. Today in New York, well get only 11 hours and 18 minutes of sunlight, down from more than 15 hours in June. And depending on where you live, you may experience even less. To help New Yorkers understand just how much sun a potential building gets during the day, Localize.city, a website that uses public data to provide insight about city addresses, created a shade analysis of every building in the city. The analysis calculated the azimuth (or arc) of the sun across every facade in the city. It used 3-D building models and calculated how much sun exposure existed, factoring in the shadows cast by neighboring buildings. The analysis even differentiates although generally between lower- and higher-level apartments. The results, in the case of a building like the Port Authority Bus Terminal near Times Square, were tidbits like: If no surrounding buildings were in its path, this buildings southwest facade would get at least nine hours and five minutes of direct sunlight in the winter. But 81 percent of the sunlight is blocked from other buildings, making it fairly shaded, even relative to Manhattan. The western facade of the Whitney Museum of American Art in Lower Manhattan, on the other hand, offers great views of the sunset, according to Localize, especially in the summer, when theres plenty of golden light during the early hours of the evening.

JILL COWAN,"Good morning. ( Heres the sign-up, if you dont already receive California Today by email.) Last week, news that the Trump administration was moving to deport certain Vietnamese immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for decades sparked fear and anger in a community that has deep roots in California and one that includes strong supporters of the presidents hard line on immigration, as The Los Angeles Times recently reported. Katie Waldman, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that its a priority of this administration to remove criminal aliens to their home country, and that 7,000 Vietnamese people have removal orders. These are noncitizens who during previous administrations were arrested, convicted and ultimately ordered removed by a federal immigration judge, Ms. Waldman said. But the deportation of Vietnamese immigrants even ones with past deportation orders has been rare. I asked Jenny Zhao, a staff attorney with Asian-Americans Advancing Justice - Asian Law Caucus, which has advocated for immigrants, to talk about the possible changes.

JILL COWAN,"Fine.
Mr. Brown has been famously frugal. The new governor, Gavin Newsom, brings a more liberal view of the world; hes already moving to spend $1.9 billion in his first budget on preschool programs. The new Legislature will be ruled by a huge Democratic majority.
Does that worry Mr. Brown?
That pressure, its always there, he said. Pent-up demand.
Organized demand. Environmentalists. Soda companies. Real estate companies. A hundred different interests.
Mr. Brown said that the dire economic climate he encountered upon taking office eight years ago a $26 billion deficit was almost welcome. I was also able to say no, he said. But the governor is leaving a $14 billion surplus to his successor, so one big question now is whether Mr. Newsom will be able to (or want to) say no.

Here are a few of the comments we received: “My most recent memory is this past February. My mom was in at-home hospice and we were listening to Aretha Franklin’s ‘Amazing Grace’ album as we wrote down the menu and playlist for her celebration of life when she passed.” — Aliya Frazier, 46, Inwood “Aretha Franklin was the definition of blackness. From her singing at the funeral of M.L.K. to ‘the hat’ at the first Obama inauguration to singing for Carole King at the Kennedy Center Honors (but not before going back offstage to get her pocketbook, which she safely placed on the grand piano where she could watch it). She defined me, a black gay man, and she defined my entire family.” — Wesley Rowell, 57, Jersey City “Aretha Franklin was more than just music, she was pure life with a fight worth going for. She impacted every audience from African-Americans to women to aspiring musicians to everyday people. ” — Francis Asprec, 33, Park Slope, Brooklyn “As an African-American growing up in the ’60s and ’70s, Aretha was a powerhouse as a role model for teens like me who aspired to a career in music. I will always remember her singing ‘Natural Woman’ at the Kennedy Center Honors for Carole King. Thank you, Aretha, for giving all of us, especially African-American women, your music and, equally important, your example of acting with grace and demanding ‘Respect!’” — Boreta Singleton, 59, the Bronx “Aretha will be schooling the cherubs and seraphim.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"— Richard Murdocco, 31, Syosset, N.Y. Anywhere clean: “Yes of course a beach is always a lovely and attractive idea. Who doesn’t want to sit on the sand? I do think the practical issues of water currents and the cleanliness of the water is key. Also would there be public bathing, changing and toilets provided? These often a mess but could be maintained. Or would the beach serve as a place to sit and enjoy drinks with friends? This might be the best option. Enjoying the beach experience, without the swimming issues.” — Michelle Jaffé, 62, TriBeCa, Manhattan Along the Hudson River: “I think a Manhattan Beach is a great idea! If you’ve ever been to Chicago, there is nothing like walking up Michigan Avenue and running into a big, beautiful beach integrated right into the heart of the city. Ideally, the beach should be located where it would be most accessible — by walkers, joggers, residents, and tourists, and it should be close to a jogging or running trail.” — Charles Biener, 60, Larchmont, N.Y.

Or how about building more efficient express trains to take people out to Brighton Beach, Rockaways, etc.?” — Robin Greenstein, Upper West Side “Manhattan has long since lost whatever natural beaches, if any, it once had.

CADE METZ and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Self-flying cars are not here. But this past week in Tracy, Calif., a tech start-up called SkyRyse began testing a new emergency response service that it sees as a (small and careful) step toward passenger aircraft that can fly on their own. Due for launch in January, the service will shuttle police officers and medical workers across the San Joaquin Valley via a helicopter equipped with the kind of sensors that power driverless cars. A radar sensor, for instance, provides a detailed view of the aircraft’s surroundings even in bad weather, not unlike the laser sensors used by the autonomous cars that are now being tested in places like Arizona and Texas. At the moment, these sensors operate alongside seasoned pilots. But they will gather enormous amounts of flight data that can feed the creation of systems that can fly the helicopter on their own. In another echo of the work inside the makers of self-driving cars, SkyRyse engineers are using this data to build simulations of real-world flying conditions that can help test these systems. SkyRyse is just one of many companies pushing toward this kind of technology, including Xwing, another Northern California start-up, and Uber, the ride-hailing company that is also building driverless cars. Uber is one of several companies working toward a kind of “ flying taxi service.”","Wednesday: Passenger aircraft that can fly on its own, the state fully abolishes cash bail, and an odd avocado toast recipe.",2018-08-29T13:03:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Baby Steps Toward Autonomous Flying,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/california-today-autonomous-flying.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/us/politics/29aiflight1/29aiflight1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

Or was it — and the polling misfire by Crowley, who by the way used one of the same pollsters as Cuomo — a sign of what’s to come?” Attorney General: The Democratic contenders for attorney general — who are seeking to formally replace the disgraced Eric T.

Ms. James, the New York City public advocate, is backed by the Democratic Party in New York. “She has widely been seen as the front-runner,” Mr. Goldmacher said, “but in a televised debate last week, everyone was focused on Zephyr Teachout, who won the endorsement of The New York Times’s editorial board and seems to have some new energy in her campaign.” He added: “The attorney general’s race is getting less attention, but don’t forget that this is one of the single races of most interest to President Trump in the country because of all the investigation potential into his businesses and foundation.” Lieutenant Governor: Kathy Hochul is the lieutenant governor, and her Democratic challenger is Jumaane Williams. “She has had more than a million dollars in her campaign account; his campaign is basically dead broke,” Mr. Goldmacher said. “What’s remarkable is the concern that he’s competitive anyway — based partly on demographics of New York in that he is from New York City, is relatively well known for a city councilman, and is an African-American candidate in a year in which every campaign is focused heavily on turning out African-American voters.” Mark your calendars now for a debate for New York attorney general on Thursday, the Democratic primary next week and Election Day in November.","Cynthia Nixon, a Democratic candidate for governor of New York, stopped by the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn on Monday.",2018-09-04T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Your Fall Political Preview,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/nyregion/new-york-today-your-fall-political-preview.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/04/nyregion/04nytoday1/04nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

He has become one of the presidents fiercest protectors amid the Russia investigation and, in the view of The Bees editorial board, has put partisanship above serving his constituents. Mr. Nunes has launched a full-scale attack on The Bee, calling it a left-wing rag, and sending out a 40-page glossy mailer that called the newspaper a propaganda machine. Mr. Nunes has sought to discredit The Bees critical reporting on his businesses. He also tried to suggest that the newspaper, in reporting on protests against him, was somehow behind them. The Bee, in its editorial, wrote that re-electing Mr. Nunes would mean sticking with the party-above-country mode that motivates him to protect President Trump from the investigation into Russian meddling more than meet his constitutional obligations as an independent arm of government. Its unclear what effect the editorial may have on voters in his district, which is a largely conservative farming region where Mr. Nunes has remained popular. The national Democratic Party has not put resources into the race, believing that it isnt competitive. Many voters there have shrugged off Mr. Nuness role in the Russia investigation and have stuck by him because they believe he has supported local farmers and their primary concern of securing more water resources.","Friday: The congressman’s battle with his hometown paper, a typhus outbreak in L.A.

JILL COWAN,"Kyle Buchanan: Im doubtful well get a full-blown host, but I think the Academy is searching for big-name presenters who may get expanded duties more than just reading light patter and standing to the side. Id expect producers to announce those names once theyre locked in, since without a host out there giving interviews, the Oscars will need somebody to promote. Then again, the Academy has fumbled more than a few of their announcements over the past year, so maybe theyll just keep mum and well tune in with no idea what to expect.
Is there a way youll be gauging whether the Academy has been responsive to #OscarsSoWhite criticism? 
I think the #OscarsSoWhite conversation continues to be had in every part of the industry, not just the awards sector. Last year had some amazing movies directed by and starring people of color among them, Black Panther, If Beale Street Could Talk, Crazy Rich Asians, Widows and BlacKkKlansman and while not all of them found favor with Oscar, I think all the talk weve been having about representation has had a profound effect on what gets greenlit in Hollywood. And hopefully, with movies like Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians having done so phenomenally well at the box office, Hollywood has an incentive to keep backing projects like this.
And last one, just to ask: Your Best Picture winner prediction? You wrote about whether Roma can win, but it definitely has some obstacles. 
This has got to be one of the most wide-open Best Picture fields I can remember. A Star Is Born was nominated by every guild, and is the sort of film Oscar voters usually go for a critically acclaimed hit thats about the entertainment business though it hasnt been able to take home a big prize yet. Roma is the critics favorite and Netflix is spending through the nose, but a foreign-language film has never won Best Picture, let alone a black-and-white one distributed by a streaming service. And then theres Green Book, which recently took the top prize from the Producers Guild of America, the group that has the most sterling record for presaging the ultimate Best Picture winner.

JILL COWAN,"Mr. Schreiner said he often relied on the Theodore Payne Foundations wildflower hotline although its season officially kicks off in March, so it hasnt started putting out weekly reports.
Of course, the flip side to all this flexibility is that in places like Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, which has come to be known as the super bloom epicenter, reservable campsites might already be booked up. Lodging in Borrego Springs, too, is most likely to be jammed.
The nice thing about Anza-Borrego, Mr. Schreiner said, is that as long as you follow certain guidelines, you can pretty much camp wherever you want, within the park.
Alternatively, you can always plan to hike a great wildflower trail (like one of these) whenever youre available to camp and appreciate whatever you see.
No matter what, Mr. Schreiner said, be a responsible user of the outdoors. It may be tempting to plunk down right in the middle of a vast blooming field for the perfect shot, but dont crush the flowers. And stay as close to established paths as you can.

JILL COWAN,"But what are the limits of the attorney generals power? And does the office have a core mandate?
I asked David A. Carrillo, executive director of U.C. Berkeleys California Constitution Center, about the job.
Essentially, he said, its charge is very broad.
The office has a wide array of responsibilities under two broad categories: acting as the states lawyer, and as its highest law enforcement official, Mr. Carrillo said in an email. The latter gives the attorney general some power over local prosecutors, sheriffs and police chiefs.
While he wouldnt comment on any specific attorney general, Mr. Carrillo said that breadth of responsibility means whoevers in the role sets his or her own legal priorities during the term.
In the case of PG&amp;Es bankruptcy, for instance, the attorney general has the power to file lawsuits or intervene in existing actions, including appearing on Californias behalf in a federal bankruptcy proceeding, Mr. Carrillo said.
If the attorney general believes its necessary, they can also take on any criminal investigations, refer matters to county prosecutors or convene a grand jury to consider any criminal matters. In the event of a conflict of interest, the attorney general could employ a special counsel to handle a prosecution.
Finally, Mr. Carrillo said, the sheer volume of issues the attorney generals office deals with means that while battles with the federal government might be more attention-grabbing, theyre actually a sliver of the offices caseload. In fact, he said, it was recently estimated that federal cases absorb about 1 percent of the departmental budget.
Nevertheless, Mr. Carrillo said its important for states to occasionally push back against the federal government.",Monday: The district attorney won’t criminally prosecute officers who shot Stephon Clark; undocumented women face sexual assault on the border; and Zlatan Ibrahimovic,2019-03-04T14:21:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Power of the Attorney General,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/california-today-attorney-general.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/us/04stevanteclarkcatoday/merlin_151576674_9cf7843f-501a-43f9-a4b7-5159cc5c9fd1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"When: Officials will send high-priority warnings during tsunamis, blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, extreme wind conditions, storm surges, snow squalls and flash floods. In New York, flash flood warnings are the most common, said Nelson Vaz, a warning coordination meteorologist for the Weather Service. On days like today, the Weather Service’s forecasters are constantly monitoring rainfall rates and the affected environments. “If they feel the rainfall rates are going to exceed the ability of the ground to absorb that rainfall, and you’re going to see a threat to life and property from flooding, that’s when the forecaster will issue a flash flood warning,” Mr. Vaz explained. How: The warnings are issued from the National Weather Service’s offices in Upton, N.Y., using computer software called WarnGen, which allows the forecasters to create the text of the message — describing the location and hazards, for example — and to target the geographic area where the flooding is expected to happen. The technology, called Wireless Emergency Alerts, is the same tool that can push out Amber Alerts or emergency warnings from the president.

TIM ARANGO and MATT STEVENS,"“It takes your dignity away,” he said. “I’ve been called a maggot.” Indeed, as local authorities grapple with how to spend millions of dollars on housing and other services for the homeless, community leaders are also trying to address the issue at the most basic human level, urging residents to say hello and make eye contact with those living on the streets. “If you talk to most homeless people they will say one of the hardest things is they felt invisible,” said John Maceri, executive director of The People Concern, a social services agency that helps homeless people. “It is dehumanizing. You don’t have to give money to say hello to people, to acknowledge them.” He added, “Acknowledging people with a gesture, a hello, goes a long way.” To break down barriers, Pacific Palisades, an affluent neighborhood on Los Angeles’s Westside, has brought homeless people to community meetings to share their stories with residents. The result has been more empathy in the community, organizers say, and a greater willingness to help the homeless, rather than demonize them.","Rigo Veloso, 47, a painter who was formerly homeless, poses for a portrait outside of his studio, which he and the landowner built together.",2018-07-05T12:56:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: When Extreme Wealth and Poverty Collide,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/us/california-today-los-angeles-homelessness.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/05/business/05calitoday-2-sub/05calitoday-2-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

ADAM NAGOURNEY and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) When Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced this week that California would lead 16 other states in suing the Trump administration over federal efforts to roll back this state’s fuel emission standards, it was the 32nd time that California sued Washington. One would think that for Sacramento, it is all Trump all the time. But Mr. Becerra, who was appointed to the post by Mr. Brown after Kamala Harris was elected to the United States Senate, wants you to know that is not the case. In a conversation with New York Times reporters in Los Angeles the other day, Mr. Becerra said that, in fact, litigation directed at the Trump administration accounted for only a small portion of his legal energies. “It’s a fraction,” he told The Times. “Nowhere near what you think. I’ve got 1,200 attorneys. My units — my sections that do non-Trump activity — outnumber, vastly, the units that do affirmative actions against the federal government.” “Then again,” he said, “you have weeks like this one.” About half of the 32 suits filed by California against the administration are in “the environmental space,” as Mr. Becerra put it, and many of them were aimed directly at Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The rest dealt with immigration, consumer affairs and health care.","Attorney General Xavier Becerra, right, flanked by Gov.

Over the last 20 years that is what we have exorcised, after the Rodney King riots.” Ms. Rice said one of the most important changes was the shift in the demographic makeup of the force. “When I first started suing L.A.P.D. it was 70 percent white, military men,” she said. “It’s 60 percent minority now.” Ms. Rice has had a close relationship with the departing chief, Charlie Beck, who replaced the reformist William J.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Bird and Lime are among the electric scooter start-ups leading the craze in Los Angeles and San Francisco, “but in New York City, it’s still anyone’s market,” Ms. Kaufman said. The biggest obstacle here: There’s no place for scooters, physically. “They’re too fast for the sidewalk, they’re too slow for traffic, and they’re too slow for bike lanes, so there isn’t a safe space for them,” Ms. Kaufman said. (Most can go up to 15 miles per hour.) “The focus here is on backless bikes and electric-assist bikes because those are the speeds of New York.” [ Read about the new era of bike-share in our city. ] Even so, exploring travel alternatives remains top-of-mind for some city residents. With the L train shutdown less than a year away, scooters could offer “a great advantage” to those affected, according to Ms. Kaufman, who led a Rudin Center report on ways to mitigate commutes during the closure of the subway line. “We’re going to have hundreds of thousands of people needing to find new modes of transportation,” she said. “Because there will be overcrowding on other subway lines, we might as well provide a variety of modes like rideshare and bus-bridges and, of course, bike share. However, not every person can or is willing to ride a bike.” Scooters have a lower barrier to entry, she added. “You’re generally not scooting in traffic — you’re generally on the sidewalk — and it’s easier to learn to navigate a scooter, and you don’t necessarily need a helmet like you do with a bike,” she said, “so people see it as an easier mode. A faster mode than walking, but not as labor intensive or stressful as biking.”","Thursday: The city’s stance on scooters, and art for our potholes.",2018-07-19T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Are Electric Scooters Legal?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/nyregion/new-york-today-are-electric-scooters-legal.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/19/nyregion/19nytoday/19nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

JONATHAN WOLFE,"“There are no straight lines on the board, so shaping is done all by light and by feel,” he said. He then layers on sheets of fiberglass and a coating of epoxy resin in a room heated to between 95 and 100 degrees, which helps keep the syrupy resin malleable. Finally, he sands out any imperfections. The process is similar to woodworking, said Mr. Schmidt, who spent time as a young man working for a carpenter in “landlocked” Richmond, Va., where he’s from. Shaping a board also reminds him of surfing. “The work is done quietly, by yourself,” he said. “You’re connected to an object and the rhythm in your body, and you have time to think and recalibrate.” It takes him about two or three days to make a custom board, which he sells for between $600 and $1,500. “The best is when people I make boards for tell me, ‘Dude, I just had the best session of my life,’ or ‘I caught the longest wave of my life,’” he said. “I get to create something with my own hands that connects people to the ocean and water.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Good morning on this toasty Monday. The weather’s heating up, and so are our courts. Two major corruption trials are set to begin this week in New York, both featuring defendants who have worked closely with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. “It’s been the season for public corruption trials in the Manhattan federal court,” said the New York Times reporter Benjamin Weiser. He noted that these will be the third and fourth major corruption trials in just six months in the same court. In March, one of the governor’s former top aides, Joseph Percoco, was found guilty in a corruption trial. And in a widely watched retrial in May, Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker, was convicted of corruption for the second time. Mr. Silver had long been one of the so-called “three men in a room” in Albany, who were said to control decision-making in the capital. Mr. Cuomo was another. Here’s what you need to know about the upcoming trials: One: The trial of Alain E. Kaloyeros, an ex-ally of Mr. Cuomo’s and the former president of the State University’s Polytechnic Institute. At his peak, Mr. Kaloyeros, a flamboyant physicist whom the governor once called “New York’s secret weapon,” had wide sway over the Buffalo Billion, the governor’s signature upstate economic development program.","Monday: Albany trials in New York City, the Secret Science Club, and a ban on Styrofoam.",2018-06-18T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: It’s Corruption Trial Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/nyregion/new-york-today-manhattan-federal-court.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/18/nyregion/18nytoday/18nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

A woman with damp hair made eye contact with me.
Seat? she mouthed.
A man with enormous headphones and enormous sweatpants widened his eyes as if to say, I see you and began to stand.
I thanked each of them, but declined their offers. I was only going three stops.
There was more of the same on my way to and from a doctors appointment later that afternoon: eye contact and gestures from a teenage girl in a school uniform, two men in suits, an older man with a robust mustache and a woman with extravagant nails playing a casino game on her phone.
I declined each offer again. It was just two stops each way.
At 6:45 p.m., I waited on a crowded platform at the 49th Street station, ignoring the humidity and the smells of the subway.
A downtown W arrived and the doors opened. As I shuffled onto the train, I felt a hand on my elbow. A woman in a skirt suit with bags on her lap and earbuds in smiled at me and stood up.
I nodded in appreciation. I was ready to sit.

JILL COWAN,"Were subsidizing these deportation policies, said Brian Hofer, a lawyer who has pushed cities to adopt legislation that limits their business relationships with tech firms that contract with ICE.
The Berkeley City Council is expected to debate the proposed legislation this month. Berkeley, which was at the forefront of the sanctuary city movement, relies on Amazon for a range of web-hosting and infrastructure services. Now, the city is struggling to align its sanctuary traditions with its digital needs.
Dee Williams-Ridley, the city manager, recommended against the boycott because it would be too costly for the city to move off Amazon. Adoption of the proposed Amazon boycott would have a huge negative impact to the citywide operations, Ms. Williams-Ridley wrote in a memo reviewed by The New York Times. The city uses Amazon to host housing and mental health programs, do cybersecurity, and to manage city documents. It also relies on other tech companies, such as Airbnb and Nextdoor, which in turn host their services on Amazon servers.
I sort of despair about what we can do at this local level, frankly, said Kate Harrison, a member of the City Council. If we identify a company involved in data brokerage for ICE, and we have an alternative, we should take the alternative. Its a balancing act.
Mr. Hofer said that the impact would be stronger as more cities pass similar legislation and that he hoped to bring the initiative statewide. Starting in Silicon Valley is important because of the regions connection to the technology industry, he added. Its symbolic that were doing it here; were the same people that are creating the technology thats doing this, Mr. Hofer said.",Thursday: How quitting big tech companies may be harder than it seems; a former lobbyist is now a regulator; and a tiny love story — with dogs.,2019-02-14T14:21:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Can Berkeley Boycott Amazon?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/california-today-berkeley-boycott-amazon.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/us/14berkeleycatoday/merlin_62189459_34a1025e-c490-4204-9852-a5100d4e19ed-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1

AZI PAYBARAH,"On display at the Society of Illustrators is the work of Dale Messick, the grand dame of the funnies.
She got her start thanks to The New York Daily News. Sort of.
Ms. Messick, above, was born in Indiana but found her way to New York by illustrating greeting cards. While here, she saw a newspaper contest seeking a new cartoonist. Ms. Messick sent in her drawings of a character named Brenda Starr, who was a bandit.
As The Times wrote in 2005, Ms. Messick was talked into making her a reporter by an aide to Joseph Medill Patterson, the founder and publisher of The Daily News.
The Society of Illustrators offered a more nuanced version of the story. Mr. Patterson, it said, swore he would never publish a woman cartoonist and went so far as to throw away anything sent in by a woman. An assistant to Mr. Patterson, Mollie Slott, pulled Messicks work out of the trash and suggested making the character a reporter.
Brenda Starr, Reporter debuted in June 1940 and was, at one point, syndicated in 250 newspapers. The comic was made into several movies.
Ms. Starrs depictions of journalism was, perhaps, well suited for the funny pages. She once handed a story to a custodian, who somehow gets it into the next days paper, The Times wrote.
But Ms. Starrs real message was about a hard-charging woman succeeding in a mans world. At a time when women faced discrimination at almost every turn, Ms. Starr was an inspiring figure.",Thursday: 17 people will be on the ballot next Tuesday.,2019-02-21T10:34:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: N.Y.

JILL COWAN,"Good morning.
(Heres the sign-up, if you dont already get California Today by email.)
While youre still getting situated in the new year, we wanted to take another opportunity to look back at the past 12 months in California. The year was packed with huge news much of which will affect where the Golden State is headed next.
And Im not just talking about tech. Deadly fires, a mass shooting and a continuing #MeToo reckoning in Hollywood all roiled the state in their own ways.
But there were other stories, too. Some were hopeful, some highlighted communities that dont often get their due, some were just plain unexpected. My editor, Julie, and I asked a few of our correspondents in California to pick a favorite story from the past year and explain why it was important. Heres what they said:
Adam Nagourney
This story, An Urgent Debate for California Republicans: How to Get Back in the Game, signaled what was one of the big California stories of the year: The Republican Party here in crisis. It was already fading; Donald Trump pushed it to the edge of the map in November.
Thomas Fuller
There were terrifying stories about fires and shootings, warnings about earthquakes, and laments about the plight of the most vulnerable. When it feels like the world is falling apart everyone needs a good walk in the woods. I loved this piece on the reopening of the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite National Park after a three-year restoration project.","Linus Roesch, 2, briefly ducked the fence to play underneath the Grizzly Giant sequoia tree in the newly reopened Mariposa Grove in Yosemite National Park in June.",2019-01-03T13:58:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Best Stories From 2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/california-today-best-stories-from-2018.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/us/03sequoiacatoday/merlin_139650975_50a3a27b-1860-4334-81e8-7163998952fb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"• Alternate-side parking rules are suspended for snow removal. Meters remain in effect. With 12 to 18 inches of snow in the forecast, the nor’easter was expected to break the record for the largest spring snowstorm in our history. The previous record, of 10 inches, was set on April 3, 1915. A little after midnight, the ruler in Central Park read 8.2. Your snow-shoveling experience may vary. The snow fell unevenly, dropping 11.7 inches in Bedford-Stuyvesant, 12 in Queens Village, 10 in Gramercy Park, and around 8.5 inches at both La Guardia and Kennedy. “But Staten Island won the lottery,” said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Port Richmond is waking up to 13.8 inches. Even though parts of the city saw higher snow totals “the record is still going to the April storm,” Mr. Maloit said. Central Park is used for the official city total because record-keeping there is more extensive and “because, let’s face it, when you think New York City, you think Central Park, not La Guardia or Kennedy,” he said. We did set one record yesterday, though. It was the most snow seen in New York on March 21. And you can take comfort in knowing you lived through a spring snowstorm and the fourth nor’easter in one month, a super extra rare occurrence. The National Weather Service found at least one other instance of four nor’easters taking place in one month — between Dec. 30, 1986, and Jan. 26, 1987 — but that was in the dead of winter.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE and JONATHAN WOLFE,"The snowman was a serious symbol in the Middle Ages, Mr. Eckstein discovered, an early form of pornography or political commentary at a time when most people could not read or write. During the Miracle of 1511, an enormous storm in Brussels, “it snowed, and it was like art supplies dropped on everyone’s doorstep,” he said. Locals sculpted provocative scenes dealing with sex and political angst with the government and the church. These elaborate snow scenes evolved into fine art during the medieval era and later, with the help of Michelangelo (who in 1494 sculpted a snowman for the courtyard of the Medici Palace in Florence), Larkin Meade (who in 1856 created a world-famous snow angel in Vermont) and other artists. (Mr. Eckstein, though, is no fan of Frosty, whom he cites as one reason the art of making snowmen is, in modern times, “not really considered with much respect.”) Now he fears that rising temperatures are putting the very pastime in danger. “The snowman is like the duck-billed platypus of global warming,” he said. He wondered: Will Times Square panhandlers dressed as characters from “Frozen” be among the last snowmen we’ll see in New York City?

JONATHAN WOLFE,"— Amanda Maciel, 39, Park Slope, Brooklyn “A few months back I got on a 7 train at Court Square on the early side of rush hour and actually got a seat. I felt a tinge of annoyance at the man with his bike on the train sitting across from me. But I quickly noticed that he was working on his bike — removing, replacing, pumping and then reinserting a formerly flat tire, all before we got to Grand Central! I was not the only one who was impressed — practically the whole car was his audience.” — Elisa Caref, 30, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn “I was riding the F train from Brooklyn to Manhattan and saw a mother with two young kids on either side of her clearly settled into their seats for a long subway ride.

It was magical to sit in silence with the whole car of strangers and take a moment out of rushing to our next destination to sit and listen to the tale of a nervous giraffe.” — Zaneta Pereira, 24, Park Slope, Brooklyn Here’s what else is happening: Weather Feeling better about the week ahead yet? How about this: The five-day forecast calls for (mostly) beautiful weather. Today, mostly sunny with a high of 42. Tomorrow, more of the same.

And Finally... Photo Andy Payne of Oklahoma, the winner of C.C. Pyle’s Bunion Derby in 1928. Credit Bettmann, via Getty Images Ninety years ago this week, 275 runners set off on the Bunion Derby, a footrace from Los Angeles to New York City. By day, the runners would cover set distances through deserts, mountains and cities. At night, they slept in tents and were entertained with sideshows. The poorly organized, 3,485-mile race was used by the sports promoter, C.C. Pyle, to advertise everything from shoes to the new Route 66. For the racers, it meant running more than a marathon every day for nearly three months. “It got so that when I went to bed, my legs were still pumping up and down,” said Harry Abrams, a runner from the Lower East Side, in 1991. “My shins swelled up like stovepipes.” After surviving 84 days of blazing heat, dog bites, a car crash and rumors that the promoter couldn’t pay out the promised prize money, 55 participants arrived in New York, “sunburned and weather-beaten to a cindery complexion,” reported The Times. “Some trotted, some limped, some walked as on eggshells” during the last leg inside Madison Square Garden. Mr. Pyle was furious at their apathy. “Streak it boys,” he shouted from the sideline. “Show ‘em what I’ve brought to New York.” The New Yorker, Mr. Adams, finished 11th and missed out on the $25,000 first-place prize. But the following year, he ran the derby again, this time from New York to Los Angeles, and earned a citation in “Ripley’s Believe It or Not” for completing back-to-back cross-country trips.

Photo Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. Credit Universal Pictures, via Associated Press On this day in 1931, the public was introduced to “the strangest passion the world has ever known.” That, according to an ad in The Times, was the passion of Dracula for blood. The horror film, based on the novel by Bram Stoker, premiered Feb. 12 at the Roxy Theater on 50th Street, a venue nicknamed the “ Cathedral of Motion Picture ” and considered at the time the finest cinema in New York City. The ad, along with the Times review of the film, underscores that it’s a “talking film” — then a novel concept. Silent films transitioned to “talkies” with speaking, singing and dancing in the late 1920s. The movie and its sharp-toothed protagonist, now thought to be “ more comical than scary,” were described as “bloodcurdling,” “evil” and “eerie.” Fog, a highly technical special effect at the time, made it all the more spooky.

Jordan Crook,"CoD: Black Ops 4 is available today, marking yet another chapter in the franchise’s history. The Black Ops series, developed by TreyArch, tends to be one of Call Of Duty’s most popular, and Black Ops 4 doesn’t show any signs of being any different. Alongside multiplayer, Black Ops 4 also includes Zombies and Blackout, the new Battle Royale mode coming to CoD. Black Ops 4 is the first CoD installment to not launch with any campaign mode. Folks who pre-ordered the game had an opportunity to play it briefly over the past few months as part of the beta. But now the game is out there and available to all. One quick thing: Folks who buy a physical copy of the game will need to free up some space on their console, as the game requires a 50GB update to play Zombies, Multiplayer or go to the Specialist Headquarters. Luckily, you can start playing Blackout as soon as the update is 30 percent complete. In other words, if you bought the game and can’t wait to play, you should pop that sucker in and start the download ASAP.","CoD: Black Ops 4 is available today, marking yet another chapter in the franchise’s history.

Sarah Perez,"Twitter’s new prototype application is rolling out to the first group of testers starting today, the company announced this afternoon by way of a tweet. The app, which Twitter is calling “twttr” as a throwback to its original name, was first introduced at the CES conference this January. It aims to offer Twitter a more experimental testing space where the company can try out new ideas outside of its existing public network, gain feedback from testers, then develop new features as a result of what it learns.
Initially, the new twttr app will focus on testing new designs for conversations. As the company demonstrated at CES, the prototype app will show a different format for replies, where conversations themselves have a more rounded chat-like shape and are indented so they’re easier to follow. Engagements, sharing options and other tweet details are hidden from view in order to simplify reading through longer threads.
And, most notably, the different types of replies are color-coded to designate those from the original poster as well as those Twitter users you personally follow. This is meant to offer better visual cues to readers who are trying to follow a lengthier thread where often, side conversations take place, or the original poster jumps in to clarify things or respond to individual tweets.
Our prototype app, twttr, launches to the first group of participants today. #LetsHaveAConvo about new features to build a better Twitter together.
— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) March 11, 2019
Over time, Twitter may use the prototype app to test out other changes it wants to make to the product. For instance, the company has experimented with ideas around status update fields and icebreakers as your pinned tweet to encourage conversations.
Twitter has said not everyone will be accepted to the prototype app testing program. Only a couple of thousand of English and Japanese speakers will be invited, provided they follow Twitter’s Rules. However, no one is under NDA so testers will be able to discuss what they’re seeing on Twitter itself, which opens up the ideas to more feedback.
Twitter says the first group of testers will receive an email invite sometime over the next few days. Once received, users have to click a link to confirm their participation, then await another email invite from Apple’s TestFlight.
They can then download the new twttr app and use it instead of the main Twitter app, while tweeting about the new look using the hashtag #LetsHaveAConvo. Testers can also submit feedback through an online form.
The twttr app was already spotted in the wild before today’s announcement, but it hadn’t rolled out in large numbers at that time.
After all these years, Twitter is still trying to figure out how to improve conversations on its platform. Not only are they challenging to follow, visually speaking, they often devolve into trolling and abuse. That’s something other changes to the product may try to tackle, from enhanced reporting procedures to Twitter’s latest development of a “hide tweet” button.
The prototype app isn’t immediately looking to solve the problems around online abuse – though as a side effect of redesigned conversation threads, comments that contribute to instead of detract from an online conversation could be better highlighted.
Twitter says those who haven’t yet applied to test the new app can still do so. Applications opened up last month, and remain open today.
Already applied? Check your email for updates in the next few days. On the waitlist? Stay tuned, well add participants. Want in? You can still apply!

JONATHAN WOLFE,"“They make me laugh,” she said. “I love them.” Erin Quill, an original Broadway cast member of “ Avenue Q,” described the atmosphere this way: “Like a suffocating hug from people who love you just as much as if they gave birth to you.” (That’s a positive thing, she added.) While fans are always respectful, she said, she will occasionally sneak off to the green room “because sometimes you feel like, ‘Wow, I love all you guys and I know you love me, but I just need to breathe for a second.’” Ms. Quill gets it, though: Many stars were themselves superfans once — obsessing over lyrics, following casting changes and spending weekends reading soundtrack liner notes. “We were the island of misfit toys in junior high and high school,” she said. “We look at the kid that’s almost weeping, or almost hyperventilating, and think, I remember being that kid.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Not much to say about today — sunny with a high near 37 — so let’s talk about the weekend. It will feel like spring tomorrow. Expect sunshine, a strong breeze and a high near 52. Sunday looks springy, too. Rain is likely in the morning, with highs in the low 50s.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Stop by Washington Square Plaza this weekend and you’ll time-travel: Sit on the stone rim of the fountain and imagine the 1860s, when the original coping was constructed; tiptoe along its inner granite steps and return to present-day New York, on a part of the structure that was revamped within the last decade. The fountain in the park today was modeled on the original from the 1840s, Mr. Vellonakis said, with some modifications made in the 1930s and 1960s. “So it’s consolidating all the periods,” he said. The fountain runs between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m. — at the behest of timers in the park’s field house — but one of the most striking times to visit is early in the morning. “Before the jets turn on, it’s a reflecting pool,” Mr. Vellonakis told us. “When you look at the reflection in the water, you can see the Arch.” (That architectural magic was not, according to him, intentional.) And for those who aren’t early birds? Go south of the fountain, Mr. Vellonakis said, take a photograph between the fountain’s jets and the opening of the Washington Arch, and you’ll catch the Empire State Building in the background. Here’s what else is happening: Weather As they say, beauty is fleeting. Yesterday’s perfect weather has turned to rain — it’ll continue into this evening, and possibly into Saturday.

The adored local news site — which, along with DNAinfo, was suddenly shut down in November — went live again on Thursday. WNYC, New York’s public radio station, purchased Gothamist in February, breathing new life into the city’s dwindling word-on-the-street, neighborhood news market. (WNYC did not buy DNAinfo but will host DNAinfo’s archives.) In the 24 hours since relaunch, Gothamist has resumed its conversational (at times tongue-in-cheek) coverage of everything from the effect of e-bikes on immigrant delivery workers to eye-roll-inducing happenings on the subway and food recommendations. “Gothamist is a website about New York City and everything that happens in it. We also produce pizza bagel instructional videos,” the site posted yesterday. “In addition to marveling at the daily absurdities of life in this marvelous city, we believe a functional democratic society relies on an informed, engaged citizenry — if nothing else, Gothamist aspires to serve that mission on a local level.” Write on.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"“It will slow things down,” Mr. Robinson told us. “Flowers are open, but they’re not opening at the rate that they would be if it were 50-plus degrees out.” But that could mean that a stretch with high pollen levels looms around the corner. “It will only hold a lid on it for so long,” Mr. Robinson said of the cold. “And what we’ve seen in past years, when we’ve had this sort of pattern of weather, is that you’ll then get these sustained high levels of pollen for several days in a row.” The small amounts of cypress and elm tree pollen in the air now will soon be joined by particles from birch, oak, ash and beech, Mr. Robinson said.

Started in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity, Equal Pay Day is an effort to raise awareness about the gender wage gap. On average, women in the United States earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. In New York, which has the narrowest pay gap of any state, women make 89 cents for every dollar men make. ( A 2016 study commissioned by Public Advocate Letitia James found that New York City women were collectively paid $6 billion less than men each year, while women across New York State earned about $20 billion less.) A law barring employers from asking potential hires about their salary history, intended to reduce pay inequities for women and minority workers, took effect in New York City in the fall. And state leaders are exploring ways to address this issue through legislation in the coming months. New Yorkers — among them union workers, labor activists, the public advocate and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul — are gathering at City Hall at noon to raise awareness about the issues in New York and demand pay equity.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"“I don’t think most Staten Island people think about ticks because it’s a relatively new problem,” said the lead researcher, Maria Diuk-Wasser, an associate professor in Columbia’s department of ecology, evolution and environmental biology. “We want to educate people about the risks, and tell them where they’re more at risk.” The project surveyed the five boroughs and found the most ticks on Staten Island, some in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx and a small number in Queens. They did not find any in Central Park, “and we don’t expect them to be there because there are no deer,” Dr. Diuk-Wasser said. “The key is really deer.” The team sampled a dozen parks on Staten Island and, in all of them, found ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Nymphs (young ticks) become infected by feeding on birds and small mammals like mice, chipmunks, raccoons and opossums, Dr. Diuk-Wasser explained. But it’s deer that are responsible for transporting dangerous adult ticks farther and wider. A tick’s happy place is in a humid, forested area. Tree-filled, leaf-littered, shrubby areas are tick territory; sunny, dry patches of grass are usually not. Homes at highest risk for tick exposure are often those closer to parks, those with yards frequented by deer and those with white-footed mice, Dr. Diuk-Wasser said. And if a team of tick scientists rings your doorbell this summer, don’t be alarmed — the researchers will be going house to house on Staten Island through July, educating on ticks, collecting data for the app and offering yard checks.","Thursday: Bloodsucker season is upon us, outdoor movie night, and Robert F.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) A heavy flow of Central American migrants and refugees has continued toward the U.S.-Mexico border despite intensifying obstacles to entering the United States: the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” approach to illegal border crossings; the separation of thousands of migrant families; and tightening of “credible fear” qualifications on asylum requests. In interviews along the border last week, many described harrowing journeys from their home countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala: marching through Central American wilderness and borderlands on foot, hiding in vans through Mexican immigration checkpoints, and even riding on top of cargo trains. Back home they had left behind family members, homes and farms, because threats against their lives had made remaining untenable. Many families told The New York Times they would rather be separated from their children then send them back home. Victor Clark-Alfaro, an adjunct professor at San Diego State University and director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana, said that he did not believe the flow of migrants would stop. Mr. Clark-Alfaro said that in his extensive experience on the border working with migrants, an abundance of violence back home remained by far the most prevalent reason people have left their countries. “It’s the gang violence. That is the biggest factor that is forcing them out. The economic situation is second; the violence is the primary reason,” he said. “But the gang violence goes right along with the economy. There aren’t any options.”","Monday: Why migrants seek entry into the United States, President Trump attacks immigrants and the judicial system, and the world’s ugliest dog.",2018-06-25T12:52:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: When Asylum Is Your ‘Only Shot’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/trump-migrants-border-crossing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/23/us/23families-375-fader-slide-BVY0/23families-375-fader-slide-BVY0-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"One hundred and fifty years ago, the Brooklyn Flint Glass Company was tugged through New York’s waterways to Corning, N.Y., transforming an upstate town 215 miles northwest of Manhattan into an artistic hub for glassmaking. (The company became Corning Glass Works.) To celebrate the anniversary, the Corning Museum of Glass has set up a floating glassmaking studio, GlassBarge, off Pier 5 at Brooklyn Bridge Park. It’s holding free glassblowing demonstrations daily from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Memorial Day. You can make reservations here.

Brian Heater,"Turns out those rumors that Beats wouldn’t have anything to show off during today’s big Apple event weren’t 100 percent true. Granted, there was no mention of the headphone maker during the event itself. Instead, the company sent out a bit of an also-ran press release as things were still unfolding here in Cupertino. The big reason the brand got no love during today’s event: these aren’t new products, really. Rather, they’re color updates to two of Beats’ existing lines. In fact, the new shades were designed to match Apple’s new hardware. Fittingly, the headphones are priced to match their corresponding handsets. The $300 over-ear Beats Solo 3 Wireless now come in satin gold and Satin silver to match the new colors for the iPhone XS/XS Max, while the $60 urBeats3 earphones are available in yellow, blue and coral to match the cheaper iPhone XR.

DANNY HAKIM and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The Salinas Valley is known as the “Salad Bowl of the World,” so it’s no surprise that there are a lot of pesticides used in California farm country. We recently paid a visit to the Chamacos project, run by the University of California, Berkeley, which for nearly two decades has been studying the effects of pesticides on the children of Salinas-area farm workers. (Chamacos is Spanish for “children.”) This was the backdrop we chose for a story on the Trump administration’s war on what it calls “secret science” at the Environmental Protection Agency. At the urging of agrochemical companies, the administration has proposed forcing studies like the Chamacos project to make public information about its study participants in order to continue to be considered by regulators. Former E.P.A. officials and academics view the move as a breach of privacy safeguards and said the proposal echoed what the tobacco industry once tried to do in thwarting science that highlighted the dangers of smoking. The industry, which keeps much of its own research secret, says it is a legitimate effort to improve transparency. Studies like Chamacos — part of a field known as epidemiology — examine disease trends in people. They are often complex, because they require adjusting for the many different chemicals and pollutants people are exposed to. It was only under the Obama administration that the E.P.A. began to more seriously incorporate epidemiology alongside lab tests of how pesticides impact rats and other animals.","Monday: How a study on the effect of pesticides illustrates President Trump’s conflict with the E.P.A., remembering John McCain, and a taco truck opens on a freeway.",2018-08-27T13:02:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: ‘Secret Science’ in the Salinas Valley?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/california-today-salinas-valley-secret-science.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/business/26human-1/26human-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,today,1
IAN URBINA and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Over the years, each mass shooting in America renews a stalled debate about gun control. But in those conversations, far less attention is paid to ammunition. Without bullets, however, a gun is a useless piece of metal. And so a growing number of gun control advocates are arguing that tightening rules on the sale or purchase of ammunition is potentially a useful way to lessen gun violence. California already enforces some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, and it is now leading the drive for more limits on ammunition. Gun control advocates in the state have pushed to limit internet sales, ban large-capacity magazines, require sellers to have licenses, raise taxes on bullets, and mandate serial numbers or other traceable markings so the police can more easily track them. The idea of regulating guns by tightening controls on bullets is not new and has been floated over the years by a diverse mix of public figures, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and the comedian Chris Rock. But gun rights advocates, who see such regulation as an end-run around the Second Amendment, say these measures are expensive, ineffective and put an undue burden on lawful gun users, including hunters, range regulars and sport shooters. Over the next several months, we will explore the regulation and commerce of ammunition, with a mix of stories focused on topics like how law enforcement uses shell casings to solve crimes, why millions of Americans make or reload their ammunition at home, and how hunters, concerned about poisoning scavengers, are leading the effort to shift toward non-lead bullets. We began this week with a look at California and its position on guns and ammunition, and how the state has emerged as the battleground for this conversation and debate.","Sgt.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"“It’s become a trend to have younger, more inexperienced people be managers,” Mr. Wagner said. “Knowing how to handle data and information and knowing how to relate to the players is more important than having done this for 30 years.” And Mr. Boone, 45, is nearly a decade younger than Mr. Girardi. “He was very hard-nosed and didn’t have much of a sense of humor,” Billy Witz, who covers the Yankees for The Times, said of the team’s former manager, “and I think his communication skills were drawn into question.” “They got somebody who was that antithesis of that in Aaron Boone — he’s very engaging and his strengths are in some of the areas that Girardi was lacking, so it’ll be interesting to see how much his lack of experience is a factor,” Mr. Witz said.

A Bil-Jac chicken liver treat. “He’s accurate about 80 percent of the time,” Mr. Trevino said, a hit rate that has led some in the past to complain about using dogs to inspect for insects. But Mr. Trevino defended his co-worker. Instead of exploring an entire apartment, he said, the dogs help him narrow his search. And they are fast. An inspection takes about 20 minutes, or a matter of seconds if it’s a full-blown infestation. “That’s when the dog walks in and is like, ‘Whoa,’” he said, mimicking Nemo by throwing his head back and crinkling his nose. “He’ll look at me like, ‘What do you need me for?’” Photo A badge worn by Nemo.

SOMINI SENGUPTA and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The defiant ones have come to California. Of course they have. Where else would they go? Mayors, governors, corporate executives and environmental activists from four continents are gathering in San Francisco this week to show what they can do to stave off the most catastrophic effects of climate change, even if the president of the world’s most powerful country — the United States, which is also history’s biggest polluter — won’t. It’s a gamble. As my colleague Brad Plumer writes, these defiant ones are trying to demonstrate that they can take big steps to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that have warmed the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. But their efforts have not been enough to offset the effects of the Trump administration’s rollbacks on climate policy. And the world as a whole is nowhere close to meeting the targets set under the Paris climate accord three years ago, an accord that President Trump intends to withdraw the United States from. California is not just where some of the consequences of climate change are being felt acutely, nor simply a place where high-profile solutions are being tested out. It has also been a finger in the eye of the Trump administration on climate policy; for instance, it has challenged his rollbacks on fuel-efficiency standards.","Gov.

TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Theres a growing anxiety of how we measure economic prosperity, and California is a poster child for why thats a legitimate debate. Service economy, low-wage workers working full time without workers comp benefits, uninsured thats where we are struggling. We have these high-wage, high-skill jobs. And then you have a third of the population Im loosely defining a third, not for PolitiFact purposes that are working full time and are around the poverty rate. Q. Gay marriage is the issue you are most identified with. Do you consider that your singular achievement? A. Its a point of pride to have been associated with that movement. Everyone was running. That was lonely, but it shapes my frustrations with my own party, my willingness to be independent of my own party. The fact that I survived that I wasnt sure I was going to. Q. Do you see yourself like Governor Brown as being a national figure for Democrats? A. To the extent you have this extraordinary bully pulpit, because California punches above its weight. So it matters what Governor Brown says. Its always mattered what governors said in the past. You can move markets.

ADAM NAGOURNEY and MATT STEVENS,"The idea has met a decidedly frosty reception from Mr. Brown and some legislative leaders, who say it would be hugely expensive. No one has explained exactly how the cost might be covered. And two of the candidates — Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and John Chiang, the state treasurer — are skeptical. “We are looking at a Trump administration, may I remind us all, who are trying to take away health care from two to five million people in California,” Mr. Villaraigosa said. “We have to stand at the gate and say no. We need waivers from Trump to get single-payer in this state.” Mr. Chiang said he supported the concept of single-payer, but said, “I want to push California to do aggressively what we can today.” Mr. Newsom saw his opening: “I want to defeat Trumpism,” he said. “I also want to defeat defeatist Democrats.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Ice hockey may not be a hugely popular sport among kids growing up in sunny Southern California. But Cayla Barnes has four older brothers who played roller hockey as children. And, as she explained to The Times’s Matthew Futterman just before the start of the Winter Olympics, that sport “is big” in her hometown, Eastvale. That is how Ms. Barnes, a 19-year-old from Riverside County started her journey toward the Olympic gold medal she and her American teammates won Thursday when they defeated Canada, 3-2. Ms. Barnes, the team’s youngest member, had not been born when the American women last took home gold in 1998. During her lifetime, the United States lost to Canada three times in gold medal games. And indeed, she is not your typical defender. She stands barely more than five feet tall. But she’s quick, skillful and a perfect fit in the Americans’ new system, which requires players with many of her strengths. Ms. Barnes was a late addition to the 2018 Olympic squad — she has said she was surprised to have even made this team — and a previous Times article speculated that because she was not well known to Canada, she could give the team a pivotal edge. As it turned out, Thursday’s contest could hardly have been closer — it required a shootout, which also went into overtime, to decide. But after the win, with a gold medal hanging from her neck, Ms. Barnes reportedly said : “There was never a doubt.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

MATT STEVENS and JULIE TURKEWITZ,"“Since the top 1 percent of Californians own a lot of stocks, a stock market decline that results in lower capital gains could have a disproportionately large impact on California – and its state budget,” Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said. We have a lot of tech companies in California – and their stocks tend to feel the impact of market movement more acutely Tech companies like, say, Apple, tend to sell products known as “consumer durables” – products like an iPhone that do not have to be bought frequently because they last for a long time. When people are feeling strapped, they tend to cut back on buying those types of products. Those companies tend to be “high beta,” Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, meaning that tech stocks move more than “one for one” with the stock market. Companies like Apple, she said, have a beta above one, meaning that a 10 percent drop in the market tends to be associated with a larger than 10 percent drop in their stock prices. “The industry composition of our businesses matters because some industries like tech are more affected by the underlying economic drivers of the stock market decline,” Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said. The big picture All that said, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen urged people to keep things in perspective. “The stock market has declined, but it’s a pretty modest decline compared to how much the run up has been,” she said. “It’s now basically flat for this year, but it still went up a huge amount last year.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

[ San Diego Union-Tribune ] And Finally... The year was 1968, and California-born Peggy Fleming took to the ice at the Stade de Glace in Grenoble, France — a 19-year-old with a shot at Olympic gold. Just a few years before, a plane crash had killed the entire American figure skating delegation, wiping out a generation of top skaters. Deafening applause rolled through the rafters, according to coverage in The New York Times. Ms. Fleming wore chartreuse. Rhinestone glittered under the lights. Peggy Fleming - America's Golden Girl | Grenoble 1968 Winter Olympics Video by Olympic “Here they were, one after another—the double loop, the double axel, the Wally jump, the ballet jump, another Wally, the flying camel and the double lutz,” wrote our reporter. “Peggy was nearing the end now—her skates flowing onto the ice and there suddenly was the finale—a half-toe loop, one-and-a-half toe loop, then a double-toe loop, perfectly conceived, perfectly executed.” Ms. Fleming took home the nation’s only gold medal in that Olympics, and her victory became a global symbol of the resurgence of U.S. figure skating.

Swapna Krishna,"FastStart works by applying machine learning to identify which parts of the game are required for full-fledged gameplay. This is what differentiates it from the Ready to Start feature. It will allow you to launch a game about twice as fast as you were able to before. If the game has FastStart enabled, all you have to do is start downloading it. Your console will automatically take care of the rest. The catch is that the feature is only available right now on certain English-language titles in the Game Pass catalog. However, the FastStart feature will be expanding to additional games in multiple languages soon. You will be able to see a full list of supported titles here, though it hadn't been updated at the time this article was being written. The July update also brings a new way to organize your apps and games with ""Groups."" Additionally, the update provides more robust search options; pressing the Y button while you're on the dashboard will bring up the search menu.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"But first, I needed coffee. The closest place I found was Kavasutra in the East Village, a 30-minute subway ride away. (The subway does not accept Bitcoin, so to ride I had to cheat.) After pulling a shot of cold brew for 0.00014486 BTC, or $1, the barista called up a QR code on an iPad. I scanned it with an app on my phone, but it didn’t work. He began coaching me like a child patiently setting up Grandpa’s Facebook account, and then gave up. But eventually I figured it out, the payment went through and I became his third Bitcoin-paying customer of the day. Paying with cryptocurrency was like that: exciting, fraught and never the same twice. I was invoiced by email for a load of laundry at the Eco Laundry Company in Chelsea. I texted with a hair stylist in Israel who accepted a tip on behalf of his colleague at Armando Piña Hair Salon on the Upper East Side. I waited — fingers crossed — for five minutes before a payment finally posted and I could dig into an ice cream sandwich at Melt Bakery on the Lower East Side. And like an obsessive day trader, I would check my digital wallet and watch as the value went up and down by a few cents every few minutes. It was fun, until I got hungry. I had searched for restaurants and grocery stores using Coinmap, the Blockchain Wallet and filters on Yelp, but almost none took Bitcoin, and most said they never had. “No one is really using it the way it’s supposed to be used, as a currency,” said Dan Sim, who accepts Bitcoin at his Lean Crust pizza shop in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Circa 2013, he said, he’d process dozens of Bitcoin purchases a week, but as the currency became more valuable and volatile, that’s dropped to zero. “People don’t want to part with their Bitcoin,” he said. I couldn’t find anyone to sell me less than $200 worth of socks or a gym that accepted Bitcoin. By the time lunch rolled around on Day 2, I was ready to throw in the towel. I headed to Sweetgreen. Its restaurants don’t accept cash, but they still take good old-fashioned plastic. Here’s what else is happening: Weather We’d pay a pretty penny for better weather. We could see two inches of rain, and thunder may rumble through the morning. Today’s high is around 60. Highs will be in the 50s all week — a little cool for mid-April.

Photo Sites memorializing the people who survived the sinking of the Titanic as well as those who died. Credit Library of Congress This week in 1912, around 700 people stepped off the Carpathia steamship at Pier 54 in the meatpacking district. They were the only survivors of the Titanic, which had sunk on April 15, claiming over 1,500 lives. On the central beam of the pier, you can still read the lettering of the shipping companies “Cunard,” which operated the Carpathia, and “White Star,” which owned the Titanic. The Titanic left its mark on other places in the city as well. • Many of the surviving crew members were first received at the Lower Manhattan Seamen’s Friend Society, which was dedicated to improving the “social, moral and religious condition of seamen” and is now the Jane Hotel. • Memorials to those who perished include Straus Park, a small park at Broadway and 106th Street dedicated to Isidor and Ida Straus; the William T.

In 2011, Raven Starke was shot en route to her neighborhood bodega in Manhattan. Photo Raven Starke Credit Kathy Shorr In 2006, when Aniyah Halsey was 6 years old, she was shot in the leg as a group of men opened fire outside her family’s car in Brooklyn.

He survived; his best friend was killed. Photo Matthew Gross Credit Kathy Shorr Luis Lopez, who was shot in Brooklyn at age 14, is now involved with Wheelchairs Against Guns. Photo Luis Lopez Credit Kathy Shorr Ms. Shorr herself was held up at gunpoint in the West Village in the 1980s, while carrying her infant daughter, by two men dressed as postal workers. That experience left her wondering what happens to people who are shot and survive. Among the 101 survivors in Ms. Shorr’s book are people ages 8 to 80, of different races and ethnicities, from across the country. The shootings, which stretch from the 1950s to 2015, range from high-profile mass shootings to episodes that most Americans never hear about. The students and victims of domestic violence in some images bear scars similar to those of gun owners and N.R.A. members in others. “I thought it was important to show scars and the collateral damage of what shootings leave with people,” Ms. Shorr said. Each scar is “a badge of honor,” she said, proof “that the survivors have had this happen to them and that they were here now — strong, powerful and dynamic — and had pushed through the tragedy.” You can meet Ms. Shorr, and learn more about this project and future work, on Tuesday evening at the School of Visual Arts in Chelsea. 7 p.m. [Free] Here’s what else is happening: Weather Not much to report.

And Finally … Photo We’re gonna need a bigger bagel. Credit Alex Wroblewski for The New York Times Today, you can eat a part of bagel history. In celebration of National Bagel and Lox Day, Acme Smoked Fish and Zucker’s bagels are attempting to set the Guinness record for the world’s largest bagel and lox. Their goal is a 250-pound fish and bread combo, three feet in diameter. For their shot at breakfast bread glory, expert hand-rollers began forming 80 pounds of flour into dough at Zucker’s in TriBeCa early this morning. It will be boiled, baked and driven across the East River to the headquarters of Acme Smoked Fish in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where it will be loaded with cream cheese, Nova Scotia salmon, sliced tomatoes, red onions and capers. In a world where records exist for “fastest toilet” ( 53.25 mph ), “longest underwater kiss using mouth to mouth breathing” ( 20 minutes and 11 seconds ), and “most apples crushed by a bicep in one minute” ( 10 by woman, 14 by man ), we were surprised to find that creating the largest bagel and lox has never been attempted. (The largest bagel was 868 pounds and displayed at the New York State Fair in 2004.) After meticulous documentation of the bagel-making process and inspection by a Guinness judge, we’ll find out if the team set the record — in 8 to 12 weeks. But you can enjoy their hard work today: The bagel and lox will be sliced up and served free at Acme Smoked Fish around noon.

THOMAS FULLER and CONOR DOUGHERTY,"The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units. The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don’t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on. “It’s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,” he said.

The park received more than 5 million visitors in 2016. And although February is usually one of the slowest months, the spectacular sunsets that occur during the last two weeks of the month at Horsetail Fall have become a major draw. The fading sunlight colors the ribbon of water that descend from El Capitan a fiery red and orange. To help mitigate the traffic jams this year the National Park Service is requiring visitors who want to drive to that section of the park to reserve a spot. “Nature now requires reservations,” grumbled The San Francisco Chronicle.

Brian Heater,"After days of press conferences teasing games arriving in some time within the next decade, here’s a refreshing bit of news. As previously rumored, wildly popular sandbox survival game Fortnite is, indeed, coming to Nintendo Switch. Not only that, it’s available starting today as a free download from the Nintendo eShop. Epic’s title will be available at 10AM PT today (a little under an hour from now), bringing the battle royale mode that has made it such a massive money maker on the PC, consoles and iOS, which arrived in March. An Android version of the title is also in the works for later this summer. The game is a perfect fit for console. Nintendo’s long time focus on all ages entertainment certainly lines up with the title, which skews younger than many of the titles on display at the show this week, along with the (perhaps litigiously) similar Player Unknown Battlegrounds (PUBG).","After days of press conferences teasing games arriving in some time within the next decade, here’s a refreshing bit of news.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"Her husband asked her to stay away from the lot, where homeless men were known to gather. Her neighbors called her crazy. “But I was eager,” she said, “and I insisted on being part of the process.” Photo Over the years, Jenny’s Garden has sent hundreds of pounds of vegetables to a nearby homeless shelter. Credit Elias Williams for The New York Times On Sunday, Ms. Benitez and her daughter Victoria, 57, led us through what became of those vegetable plots. We walked past rows of blueberry bushes, budding pear trees, a greenhouse with seedlings of asparagus and broccoli, and mounds of crocuses just beginning to push their golden petals out of the soil. The site was recently renamed Jenny’s Garden after Ms. Benitez. “I’m seeing the garden that I was dreaming of,” Ms. Benitez said. Ms. Benitez rested on a bench that was donated in the name of her late husband, and flipped through early photos of the garden. Black-and-white shots revealed abandoned cars, waist-high weeds and a group of young men cleaning graffiti off stone walls. As the photos transitioned to color, the garden took shape, with families planting vegetables, playing and eating in the garden. Over the years, Jenny’s Garden has sent hundreds of pounds of vegetables to a nearby homeless shelter and has been tended by neighbors, schoolchildren, residents of a nearby halfway house, and orange-suited lawbreakers working off their community service. “We’re very proud of what she was able to do,” Victoria said of her mother. The garden has given the Benitez family food, a place to play, and space to mourn — Ms. Benitez planted trees there after the death of her husband and two sons. “It made us feel like this park belonged to us,” Victoria said. “We’ve climbed these trees.” “This tree,” she said, gesturing to one whose trunk provided a bit of cover from the garden, “was where I had my first kiss.” Here’s what else is happening: Weather Today is going to feel like one giant sneeze. Fog and drizzle will tickle our skin on the morning commute. After lunchtime, the clouds will thunder and blast us with rain and gale-force winds from every direction.

It’s an attempt to get all New Yorkers to read the same book at the same time. Here’s how it works. New Yorkers have the month of April to vote for one of five nominated books: “ If Beale Street Could Talk ” by James Baldwin; “ Manhattan Beach ” by Jennifer Egan; “ White Tears ” by Hari Kunzru; “ Behold the Dreamers ” by Imbolo Mbue; and “ When I Was Puerto Rican ” by Esmeralda Santiago. The winner will be announced in May, to be followed by events and book discussions at libraries around the city. To better inform your vote, around 5,000 copies of the nominated books have already landed at libraries throughout the city, or you can purchase a copy at one of these bookstores. And you can attend a discussion with the four living authors — Imbolo Mbue, Hari Kunzru, Esmeralda Santiago and Jennifer Egan — and the director Barry Jenkins at the New School in Greenwich Village on April 19 at 7:30 p.m. The One Book, One New York program is now in its second year. (Last year’s winner was “Americanah” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.) But that wasn’t the first attempt to get our city on the same page. A 2002 campaign to get New Yorkers to read the same book was canceled when — wait for it — the New Yorkers in charge couldn’t agree on the book.

ADAM NAGOURNEY,"“I still have a drought hangover so I wake up worried about drought,” said Felicia Marcus, the head of the state Water Resources Control Board. Southern California is dealing with the same collection of forces that accounted for the intensity of the wine country fires: an unusually wet winter led to extensive brush growth and a record-hot October baked the growth into kindling. The final ingredient was the heavy Santa Ana winds whipping across Southern California. “It was sort of a trifecta for Napa and Sonoma,” Ms. Marcus said. “And now you are seeing that recreated in Southern California.”.

Here, lightly edited, are some of the responses. “My husband and I along with our 18-month-old fled our house Wednesday morning on Casiano Drive. As we left, embers were falling from the sky and helicopters were flying low overhead spraying water. A completely surreal experience. We just bought our house in April. It’s our dream home. And as I type this, a house right next door to our neighbor’s is in flames. I’m not sure if our house will make it, but thankfully we are all safe.” — Lisa Goh “I got the emergency alert on my phone of fire at 5 something in the morning. I saw an alert of a six-acre fire near Mulholland Drive, east of the 405. That’s just a couple of miles away. By 6:15 the fire had reached 50 acres and I was already packing bags and calling my husband who is on business in Boston. By 6:30 I knew for sure we had to get out of there. I told our two nannies to wake up immediately and get their bags packed as well as the kids bags packed. I told them to pack as if we would never see this house again.” — Gwen Gottlieb “After dinner in Westlake, we were driving home down the grade and saw the red glow of the fires. It was awful and we just prayed for all in its path. Thirty minutes later we arrived in Ventura and the streetlights flickered. Then the entire city went dark. At that point we figured it was from the fires and headed inside. Not 20 minutes later I looked out my bedroom window and saw the red glow extremely close. I told my daughters we need to start gathering items as it must be spreading. Within minutes I saw the fire crest our hill and it was panic. We literally had minutes to get anything we could grab along with our pets (including our one week old kittens and a nursing Mom) and leave. We headed to Oxnard Shores to my fiancé’s parents’ home. At that point the entire mountain range of Ventura was ablaze.” — Stephanie Jensen Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"“Someone who appreciates the diversity of our city, but not in a trite or calculated way,” said Lenora B.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"There were no reports of earthquake-related damage, injuries, or other issues in New York City, according to Nancy Silvestri, press secretary for the city’s Emergency Management Department. Small earthquakes are felt in New York City every few years, said Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, though more damaging earthquakes only strike the Northeast’s urban corridor, which includes New York City, about twice a century. The last two severe earthquakes in New York City, she added, took place in 1737 and 1884, before the magnitudes of earthquakes were even measured. The last time an earthquake of any note shook the city was in 2011, when a quake centered in Virginia sent thousands of New Yorkers in Midtown Manhattan scrambling into the streets. Evan Jackson, 30, remembers panicking during the 2011 quake, when he evacuated his office building in Downtown Brooklyn and looked up at the tall buildings. “I thought, ‘I should probably get back into the building’” to avoid any falling debris, he said. Mr. Jackson said he was “loafing” in bed yesterday when he felt it shake and saw his blinds and mirror move. “It was pretty light,” he said, unfazed. “This time, I didn’t even get off the bed.” Did you feel yesterday’s earthquake? What did it feel like? Let us know in the comments. Here’s what else is happening: Weather You won’t be shaking or trembling too much today, if you wear a warm coat. A sunny day lies ahead with a high of 53. Saturday and Sunday look similar: enough sun to matter with highs that won’t stray too far from 50. Welcome to December.

Credit Julio Cortez/Associated Press If you find yourself outdoors on Sunday, look up: This year’s first and only supermoon will be lighting up the sky. A regular moon becomes a supermoon when it reaches its perigree — the point along its orbit that is closest to the earth. On Sunday, the moon could appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than normal. This supermoon is also known as the Long Nights Moon, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac, because it takes places close to the winter solstice, the day with the least amount of sunlight. For an enhanced experience, check out the moon when it rises along the horizon in New York City at 4:59 p.m. on Sunday. Because of an optical illusion, it could appear even bigger and more colorful. And if you’re in town, The Times is hosting a supermoon viewing party on Sunday for Times Insiders at Columbia University, with the science reporter Nicholas St. Fleur and the astronomer and professor David Kipping. If you miss it, don’t fret. Two more supermoons will appear in January.

Last year, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment and the film school at Brooklyn College held a screenwriting contest for shows by, for or about New York City women. After poring over more than 300 submissions, the judges have narrowed it down to two finalists: Patty Carey and Robin Rose Singer are about to have their local television debuts. Ms. Singer’s script, “Maturity,” is about a woman who moved from the Midwest to New York, where she finds work at a Bronx nursing home and meets an interesting cast of characters. Ms. Carey’s script, “Half-Life,” is about motherhood — and juggling its responsibilities with the protagonist’s day job (as a location scout) and dream job (as a writer).

JONATHAN WOLFE,"How do you avoid burnout? I don’t know. I’m very tired (laughs). But we’re all very tired. I think that the demands of reporters now are very different. The only way to avoid burnout is to take cues from your body and your brain. If you’re making mistakes in your copy, take a few extra minutes and look it over a few extra times. Double-check yourself. That doesn’t really deal with the feeling of “I can’t keep doing this,” but if you need to take a break, take a break. What’s something that newcomers to the industry might not understand about your job? There’s a difference between letting your sources take advantage of you and having good sources. What are the most important qualities in a journalist today? Not being afraid. A lot of times people are afraid of writing something because someone will get mad or they’ll lose access. That can never be a concern. Ever. That was true 50 years ago, and even more so now because the culture of bullying reporters has become more intense. Here’s what else is happening: Weather If you’re struggling to wake up, you’re not alone: The sun is getting a late start as well.

Photo Should marijuana be legal in New York? Credit Jason Henry for The New York Times And Finally … There’s been a lot of talk in these parts lately about marijuana. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced last week that New York would study whether it’s possible to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. In New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy, who campaigned on full legalization of marijuana, signed an executive order on Tuesday aimed at easing access to medical marijuana. And in Vermont, the state’s Republican governor, Phil Scott, signed a bill on Monday “with mixed emotions” that legalized recreational marijuana. Even so, states face the potential challenge of a federal crackdown on legalization by the Trump administration.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"During bigger snowstorms, he added, temperatures tend to rise closer to freezing. So in New York, at least, “you don’t tend to see that big a snowstorm in the single digits.” (Case in point: During the blizzard in January 2016, one of the largest snowfalls ever recorded in New York City, temperatures were generally in the 20s.) So what ingredients are needed to cook up a perfect storm? “In order to get snow of significance,” Mr. Homenuk said, “the main things you need are cold enough temperatures, lift in the atmosphere and moisture.” Later this week, when temperatures are expected to climb closer to 30, we may see some flurries.

Beginning today, the entire loop-drive through the park — east and west sides — will become car-free. The decision was decades in the making. Most recently, when the park held a trial run last summer, the city’s Department of Transportation found that closing the roadways to cars caused little to no incremental delays, further making a case for the change to be permanent. “As Brooklyn’s backyard,” said Sue Donoghue, president of the Prospect Park Alliance, “it is important to do all we can to ensure the park is a safe and tranquil destination for the millions of visitors who depend upon it for recreation and relaxation.” Following implementation today, the department plans to monitor traffic patterns in the area and adjust traffic signals if necessary. Now all we need is some warmer weather so we can actually enjoy it.

Nicole Lee,"Testing out an early version of Oculus TV for a few hours revealed an experience that's very similar to other VR video apps. You're sat in a living-room-esque environment, with not much going around you except a virtual landscape, which leads to a pleasant distraction-free feel. The main event happens right in front of you, in what Oculus describes as the equivalent of an 180-inch TV. Though I can't be sure it measures exactly 180 (virtual) inches, it certainly looks massive. The large viewing area makes watching videos in bed a much more pleasurable experience than just staring at my phone. Videos looked crisp and colorful as well. Still, I can't help but think watching TV in VR is very much a niche proposition, at least for the time being -- your virtual TV's resolution will never match that of your phone, at least not for a few years yet. Wearing a headset for hours on end might not be everyone's cup of tea either. Oculus TV does promise a social feature that lets you watch shows with your friends (much like the Netflix app), which does elevate it above the normal video viewing experience, but that's dependent on your friends having VR headsets too. Oculus TV might be better with some content more than others -- perhaps sports events or nature documentaries, where having that immersive experience makes more sense. When you launch Oculus TV, you'll see a selection of curated shows featured in a carousel up top, with a row of video channels listed underneath. Select a show, and if you don't have the associated app already, there'll be an option to download it. So, for example, if you select Ball in the Family, and you don't already have Facebook's Video app, you'll have to hit the Install button to get it. It's also worth noting that if you do want to get Facebook Video, you'll have to link your Oculus and Facebook accounts together. That's because aside from watching Facebook Watch originals, the app also lets you watch your very own uploaded video clips as well as the ones shared by your friends and family. Those aside, Red Bull TV mostly features extreme sports like skydiving and kiteboarding, while Pluto TV is more of a cord-cutting alternative, with curated channels like Food TV and more mainstream options like NBC News. Other options include Neverthink, which features the latest internet memes, and Newsy, which shows the up-to-the-minute news headlines. Oculus plans on adding even more VR video content soon, especially from favorites like ESPN. Now that Oculus TV is official, all Go headsets will have it installed by default. And if you have an Oculus headset already, you can go ahead and download it right now from the Oculus Store.","Over a month ago at F8, Facebook announced Oculus TV, a new way to watch TV on a VR headset. Today, it's finally live, and there are plenty of entertainment partners on board already.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"Undoubtedly, Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the homeless crisis — up to more than 55,000, an increase of more than 13,000 compared with last year. Eighty percent of homeless people in Los Angeles live on the street or in public parks. Last year, voters approved a ballot measure that expects to raise about $4.7 billion in the next decade for affordable housing and homeless services. Mr. Metcalf said the numbers have not been this dire since at least 2007. Dozens of city and county governments have declared homelessness an emergency in the last two years, something Gov. Jerry Brown has refused to do on a statewide level. “I’m not sure what it would do for us that we can’t do already,” Mr. Metcalf said.

Peter Burnett was the first governor of the State of California, ascending to the post on December 20, 1849. But his ignominious legacy is hardly known today. Mr. Burnett came from Missouri via Oregon, settling near Sacramento amid the Gold Rush. Just as he had done in Oregon, Mr. Burnett pushed to exclude blacks from the state. While he seemed to couch his argument in antislavery terms, he was merely “disguising” his “equal opportunity racism,” said William Deverell, a historian and the director of the Huntington-U.S.C. Institute on California and the West. “He was not particularly unusual at all at the time,” Mr. Deverell said. “That’s when the really vicious attacks on Native Americans started coming and gave way to genocidal violence. He was early opponent of the Chinese, which leads to the exclusion act. He really shows you can be antislavery and a racist to the core without any difficulty whatsoever.” Though he is included in fourth grade state history, Mr. Burnett’s name has largely been erased from the public sphere. His name was on a San Francisco preschool as well as an elementary school in Long Beach, but was recently taken down and replaced at both schools after reports of his views and statements resurfaced. “He talked in this undeniably ugly way about people, so we should talk about how we’ve honored him,” Mr. Deverell said. “These are not issues that are reserved for other parts of the United States without resonance in California.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

THOMAS FULLER,"Fueled by Santa Ana winds, the intensity of this week’s fires made it very hard for firefighters to do anything to stop them. On Tuesday evening there were seven active fires in Southern California, according to Calfire. The Thomas fire, the largest, burned 35,000 acres in the first 12 hours alone. By Tuesday night it had spread to more than 50,000 acres. The winds are forecast to continue into the weekend and will not peak until Thursday, according to Chief Berlant. Chief Berlant, who is the head of Calfire’s prevention efforts, says it is crucial for the state to consider fire safety when planning roads and housing developments. As one example, building codes were changed a decade ago to make roofs more likely to withstand embers falling on them. “We know we have a changing climate and we have to adapt to it,” Chief Berlant said. “Our homes and our communities need to be more resilient to wildfires.” Were you evacuated because of the fires?

THOMAS FULLER,"In a recent study, Issi Romem, chief economist at BuildZoom, a San Francisco company that helps people find contractors, looked at the growth of American cities over the past several decades, and found that cities that add a lot of housing do so by expanding outward, building suburbs and exurbs that are almost exclusively covered by single-family homes. Once cities stop spreading out, their rate of new housing production slows — and prices shoot upward. As the population grows, Mr. Romem said, there are three choices for how to accommodate more people. One is the Houston method: Keep growing outward. The second is the Bay Area method: Slow down sprawl while leaving existing neighborhoods alone, raising prices and pushing lower-earning households out of state.

As for how creators will earn from the hub, TechCrunch says the IGTV videos will have link-out options, allowing creators to drive traffic to their own websites or stores.

Swapna Krishna,"Some people see SpaceX's tactics as risky because they test new rocket features on active missions, rather than performing test launches. An obvious example: SpaceX didn't use a test mission to figure out whether a reused Falcon 9 stage could fly. They flew that historic mission with an active customer payload, though they did charge a lower rate because of the risks involved. Indeed, many of the changes to the Block 5 have been have been deployed and refined aboard Block 3 and Block 4 rockets. But now, there will be little, if any, tweaking to the rocket during active missions. This will make it easier to certify the Falcon 9 rocket for human flight. NASA will require seven successful flights of the Block 5 Falcon 9 before it's human rated. Presumably, that means the design has to remain the same from flight to flight without too many changes. Right now, the GAO estimates that human certification for the Block 5 Falcon 9 won't occur until late 2019. Most of the changes to this final form of the Falcon 9 are designed to emphasize reusability. For SpaceX to become cost-effective, as it has aimed to do since the company was first founded, it has to make as many components on its rockets as reusable as possible. This doesn't just mean the first stages of rockets; it means everything from the payload adapter to the grid fins should be reusable not once, but multiple times with minimal maintenance and turnaround time from one use to the next. According to a round-up of changes posted on Reddit, changes to the Block 5 Falcon 9 include improved heat shielding around the engines to protect them from the stresses of reentry and switched to a thermal protection barrier, rather than just paint, to help with reusability. SpaceX will also be using titanium grid fins (which deploy during and help control reentry), rather than aluminum. In theory, they should be reusable an unlimited number of times. The payload fairing has also been upgraded, which will theoretically help with recovery, which SpaceX hasn't been able to do yet. Many of these tweaks are also focused on turnaround time for these rockets. Having a reusable rocket isn't super cost effective if it takes months to perform the maintenance needed before it can be used again. SpaceX is clearly trying to cut down the amount of time between when a rocket is first launched and when its first stage (and second stage, down the line) can be launched again. You can watch the live stream of the Bangabandhu Satellite-1 launch below. The window opens today at 4:12 PM ET and closes at 6:22 PM ET. The weather is 80% favorable. If SpaceX isn't able to launch the Block 5 Falcon 9, a backup launch window opens tomorrow at 4:14 PM.","SpaceX's launch that's scheduled for this afternoon may appear to be a routine launch to deploy a satellite, but it's actually anything but.

CONOR DOUGHERTY and ADAM NAGOURNEY,"The proposed law is the latest twist in a long and contentious fight over rent increases in Santa Rosa. The Sonoma County city, like much of California, is struggling with a difficult housing shortage and rising rents. The City Council passed a rent control and just cause eviction measure in 2016, only to see it repealed by a landlord-backed ballot initiative during a June special election this year. After the fires, community groups continued to organize renters, holding clinics and renewing their push for expanded rights. “The fires are clarifying the deep need that our region has for tenant protections,” said Davin Cardenas, a director of the North Bay Organizing Project.

On Monday, at the mayor’s weekly cabinet meeting, Mr. Terrazas warned the mayor about extreme conditions that could lead to disastrous fires later that week. He was proved right the next day, though he was not ready on Thursday to declare game over. “This has been a long week and we are not done yet,” Mr. Terrazas said, wearing a protective yellow jacket and an L.A.F.D. cap. “Tomorrow morning will be Day 5 of a multiday Santa Ana event.” “You can see some improvement,” Mr. Terrazas said, referring to fire conditions. “But it’s still in extreme range.” More Coverage From The Times of the California Fires: Follow live updates today here.

Now, the Trump administration is facing the same kind of assault from Democratic state attorneys general like Xavier Becerra of California. Mr. Becerra, a former congressman from Los Angeles who was appointed California attorney general this year to succeed Kamala Harris when she became a United States senator, has filed around 20 lawsuits against the federal government, challenging its policies on scaling back environmental regulations, cracking down on immigration enforcement, and more. But, speaking to New York Times reporters during a visit to Washington this week, Mr. Becerra sidestepped a suggestion that he was taking a page from the playbook of Obama-era Republican attorneys general like Scott Pruitt — the Trump administration’s deregulation-minded head of the Environmental Protection Agency who rose to national prominence as Oklahoma attorney general by suing the Obama administration, and who is now being sued by Mr. Becerra. “I haven’t opened one of their books,” Mr. Becerra said. “We’re doing this because it’s existential for California to be able to continue doing what we’re doing.” “We have, by a factor of about 10, more clean-energy jobs in California than there are jobs in the entire coal mining industry,” he said. “All of that could be put at risk by all of these rollbacks.” — Charlie Savage, national security and legal affairs reporter in Washington California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.
