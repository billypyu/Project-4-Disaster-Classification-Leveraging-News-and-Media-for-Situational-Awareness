JONATHAN WOLFE,"Credit George Etheredge for The New York Times March 7, 2018 It was a hard storm to pin down. New Yorkers woke on Wednesday to blaring headlines about the nor'easter bearing down on their city, but saw only a light drizzle outside their windows. By noon, only a few flakes had fallen, and they quickly turned into puddles or slush on the concrete. With nearly a foot of snow predicted for the city, doubts emerged. Sandals and light sweaters were spotted in Washington Heights. Skeptics even rang the National Weather Service to complain about the bum predictions.

KATE TAYLOR,"The Arctic air moving in behind the storm was expected to deliver freezing temperatures as far south as Tallahassee, Fla., and to snarl travel across most of the Northeast, even in areas where the storm dropped little or no snow.
Anything that remains liquid is going to freeze rather quickly, so there will be dangerous travel conditions, said Rich Otto, a meteorologist at the National Weather Services Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Md.
More than 10,000 people in Connecticut were without power on Sunday morning, according to Eversource and United Illuminating, two utility companies, in large part because so much of the storms precipitation in the state had come in the form of sleet or freezing rain. Mr. Otto said that the trouble could multiply as the frigid winds pick up during the day.
Those kind of winds blowing on those power lines and trees that are already stressed from the weight of the ice, I think, is going to be problematic, he said.
Governor Lamont warned Connecticut residents on Twitter that power outages could be prolonged, and urged those who currently had power to keep their phones charged.","Jose De Jesus shoveled snow in front of his home in Norwood, Mass., on Sunday.

WIRECUTTER STAFF,"He also looked into battery-powered snow blowers (and tested models from Ego and Snow Joe.) Although he saw much to like, Wirecutter doesnt yet recommend any of them, finding them often underpowered and hard to maneuver: Unlike gas-powered models, which are self-propelled, battery-powered blowers make the operator do all the pushing. Battery-powered tools are also easy to care for just stash them out of the way in the off-season. Gas-powered machines need their tanks drained or treated with a fuel stabilizer before storage. If youre an urban apartment dweller, you probably dont have a driveway to shovel, but you probably do have drafts to deal with. Foam and V-channel (or tension seal) weather stripping helps to eliminate drafty windows while still allowing you to open the windows on warmer days; Lowes has a helpful how-to, and you can find the gear there, online or at any decent hardware store. Clear window-sealing tape or plastic sheeting is easier to install, but using one of those options means keeping your windows shut. If your doors are also drafty, install a door sweep. If you want to go further, Wirecutter has other advice on where to look for and how to deal with climate-control leaks. In the event a storm knocks out the power, youll be happier, safer and more comfortable if youve prepared. A flashlight is a must, and a headlamp is invaluable if you expect to be outdoors doing cleanup, as it keeps both hands free for work. LED lanterns are safer than candles. (And youll find other uses for lanterns, too theyre terrific at a campsite, for example. Collapsible models, like these from Suaoki, take up little room.) A USB battery pack (or power bank) can keep your phone charged, and the larger ones can keep tablets running for a few days, helping to stave off boredom for kids and adults alike. But if outages are a regular feature of your winter, a portable gas-powered generator can keep vital equipment such as a fridge or a medical device running. You should also have a plan for dealing with perishable foods. Even if youre not a beach-goer or tailgater, a hard cooler can help keep fruits and vegetables fresh for days in the event of a blackout. Have a few ice packs ready to go just store them in the back of the freezer, out of the way. (Be on the safe side and dont cook meat or fish that has gone unrefrigerated for more than a few hours.) For a deeper dive into everything you need if disaster strikes, check out Wirecutters guide to emergency preparedness. That guide recommends that people in hurricane territory keep a few heavy-duty plastic tarps on hand to temporarily seal damaged roofs. But tarps are also useful for anyone who has trees on their property, where falling boughs pose a constant threat to roofs especially in winter, when heavy snows can snap weak or dead branches. Even if no branches breach the roof, tarps are handy for post-storm cleanup: Just pile the detritus on and drag it en masse to where it needs to go.","Wirecutter has advice on snow shovels, snow blowers and emergency gear to get you ready before the snow flies.",2018-10-18T21:54:52Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","For a Safer, Easier Winter, Prep Your Home Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/smarter-living/wirecutter/for-a-safer-easier-winter-prep-your-home-now.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/smarter-living/18wcwinterize/18wcwinterize-facebookJumbo.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind. Earther can’t really give you any insights into our big button boy’s mindset on the nuclear front, but we’ve got you covered when it comes to this bomb cyclone thing that’s about to “ blast the East Coast.” Snow is falling in northern Florida thanks to moist air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with the frigid cold hanging over the eastern U.S. The impending storm will get really organized and march up toward the Mid-Atlantic this evening, where there are rare blizzard watches already in effect. By late tonight or early tomorrow, snow, storm surge, and powerful winds will smack the Northeast. Along the way, this extratropical cyclone will undergo “explosive bombogenesis.” Or, in less nerdy terms, it will bomb out. And that has got people on edge. You’ve probably seen the Washington Post tweet that sparked the whole bomb cyclone freakout (it is a Very Good Tweet): In some ways, the freakout is warranted. This is shaping up to be a massive, dangerous storm that could fell records and cause widespread power outages. Snow in Florida is really, deeply weird and wrong. The cold air rushing in after the storm passes could be deadly. But let’s step back for a sec and talk about what’s actually going on. In simple terms, bombogenesis describes what happens when a storm’s central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The lower the pressure, the more intense the storm. Those types of rapid drops can happen in hurricanes, but only extratropical cyclones—storms that have cold air at their core—technically qualify as bomb cyclones. That means you generally only get weather bombs in winter, and often in coastal areas where cold land meets relatively warm ocean water. The bigger the difference between warm and cold air masses, the bigger the potential for bombogenesis. “The contrast between the warm and cold air gives you an indication of the energy available to intensify an extratropical cyclone,” Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, told Earther. “In this case, large contrasts in temperature between Arctic air currently over the Northeast and warm Atlantic waters suggest the potential for an intense cyclone.” This week’s bomb storm could see pressure drop an unbelievable 45 millibars in 24 hours, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration model ensemble. It’s forecast to bottom out around 950 millibars, a central pressure typically associated with Category 3 hurricanes (though this storm will not bring Category 3 winds). While this storm could be one for the record books, storms bombing out isn’t that rare. Jonathan Martin, a meteorology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told BuzzFeed that you can expect about 10 of these types of storms across the northern hemisphere in any given winter. In the Northeast, many storms that bomb out take the form of nor’easters, winter storms that have their strongest winds out of the northeast. In Europe, they’re usually wind storms. Elsewhere like the Bering Sea, they’re just really nasty storms. Scientists have been throwing around some combination of the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather”,and “climatological” since the 1940s. They somewhat entered the mainstream lexicon in 1980. That year, MIT professors Fred Sanders and John Gyakumpublished the amazingly-titled study “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb.’” It’s one of the first papers to deconstruct the process of bombogenesis. Sanders attributes the focus on rapidly dropping pressure in storms to Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who also gave us our working theory of how precipitation forms in the 1930s. So, this whole cyclone bomb thing has been a known quantity for a while. That doesn’t mean this storm won’t be bad, or that you shouldn’t be prepared for power outages, especially considering the bone-rattling cold that will follow. But make sure to allocate your freakout between meteorological and existential threats accordingly.",Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind.

(He split the jackpot with a woman from Iowa.) He accepted a check for $125,396,690 his cut after taxes. Its not clear. The deal is designed in a way that requires approval on the state level, not the city. Governor Cuomo supports the deal and has a lot of sway. But there are potential roadblocks, my colleague J. David Goodman explains. And Politicos Dana Rubinstein notes : Key elements of the plan require the approval of state legislative leaders via an obscure entity called the Public Authorities Control Board... The State Senate and Assembly majorities each have a vote on the board, and so does the governor. Unanimity is required. The Queens neighborhood where Amazon is heading is represented by State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who has spoken out against the deal. In January, he becomes the second-most powerful senator in the chamber. Whether Gianaris actually wants to kill the deal or merely exact more concessions from Amazon remains to be seen, Ms. Rubinstein writes.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"A winter weather advisory is in effect until 2 p.m., which means roads could be slippery and visibility may be reduced. But whatever you do, don’t call this storm a nor’easter. While we may have just celebrated a rare “four’easter,” with four nor’easters pummeling our region within a month, today’s storm will not be the fifth. “The magnitude of this storm is not quite up to par,” said John Murray, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. For a storm to qualify as a nor’easter, he explained, it must meet a few conditions, including sustained winds of 34 knots, or around 39 miles per hour. Wind gusts today are expected to reach only 25 miles per hour, leaving the storm with the less-sexy label of “quick-moving low pressure system.” Which is a mixed blessing. The storm is not strong enough to postpone the Yankees home opener against the Tampa Bay Rays, but it’s also not dumping enough snow to upset alternate side parking, which is in effect today.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Where it happens, dangerous travel conditions and power outages are possible. Winter storm watches and advisories already are in place for more than 12 million people in portions of states from New Mexico to North Carolina. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: Friday morning through Saturday evening Precipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Snow, ice and f looding rain Snowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Nearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots. Oklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most Arkansans won't feel precipitation until later Friday, with winter weather beginning in the overnight hours and moving east Saturday morning toward Tennessee. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix Significant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a ""once-in-a-generation event."" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow. While most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon. Snow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" or ""the wedge"" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a ""warm nose"" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the ""'wedge,"" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE and JONATHAN WOLFE,"The snowman was a serious symbol in the Middle Ages, Mr. Eckstein discovered, an early form of pornography or political commentary at a time when most people could not read or write. During the Miracle of 1511, an enormous storm in Brussels, “it snowed, and it was like art supplies dropped on everyone’s doorstep,” he said. Locals sculpted provocative scenes dealing with sex and political angst with the government and the church. These elaborate snow scenes evolved into fine art during the medieval era and later, with the help of Michelangelo (who in 1494 sculpted a snowman for the courtyard of the Medici Palace in Florence), Larkin Meade (who in 1856 created a world-famous snow angel in Vermont) and other artists. (Mr. Eckstein, though, is no fan of Frosty, whom he cites as one reason the art of making snowmen is, in modern times, “not really considered with much respect.”) Now he fears that rising temperatures are putting the very pastime in danger. “The snowman is like the duck-billed platypus of global warming,” he said. He wondered: Will Times Square panhandlers dressed as characters from “Frozen” be among the last snowmen we’ll see in New York City?

PATRICK McGEEHAN,"Each of the airport’s 43 airlines has customers to serve and a schedule to keep, but there is no doubt who has the ultimate authority. Ed Freni, the director of aviation for Massport, leads the meetings. Each of the four terminals at Logan has its own manager who reports to Mr. Freni. “Ask anyone at the airport who’s in charge, they’ll say Ed Freni,” said Thomas P. Glynn, the chief executive of Massport. The daily meetings also foster a spirit of cooperation among airlines that are typically the fiercest of rivals, said Norbert P. Strissel, director of airport operations at Logan for JetBlue Airways. An airline will make one of its gates available to a competitor in a pinch, especially if it is in danger of violating the time limit for keeping passengers in a plane on the ground, Mr. Strissel said at a recent meeting. “We’ve been in that situation in years past, as well as other carriers here at Logan,” he said. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, we’re saying go ahead and get that plane to a gate and at least get the customers off of it.” Photo Every morning, dozens of Logan airport officials meet with representatives of airlines and state and federal agencies to share information that might affect operations. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times That is not what happened at Kennedy on the first weekend in January. Some passengers on a flight from France that landed late on Jan. 5 said they were still aboard when dawn broke the next morning, more than a full day after the storm had swept through the New York area. It was one of several international flights that landed and could not find a gate for hours. The storm, which had been described as a bomb cyclone, dropped several inches of snow at Kennedy, but the runways had been cleared by Friday morning. Removing the snow was the Port Authority’s business. But sorting out the growing chaos in Terminal 1 was not. Under Kennedy’s operating model, management of just about everything that happens inside the six terminals is left to the tenants, either airlines that have their own terminals or companies that manage terminals occupied by several airlines. Terminal 1 at Kennedy handles 21 foreign airlines but is operated by a consortium consisting of four of them: Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa. After the airport reopened on that Friday, the airlines, eager to deliver their delayed and detoured passengers to New York, started sending flights to Kennedy. It was up to the terminal’s managers to schedule access to its 11 gates, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the influx of jets. The experience of Aeroflot, the Russian airline and a tenant at Terminal 1, illustrates how dysfunctional the situation became. At about 5:30 p.m. on Friday, an Aeroflot flight from Moscow arrived at Kennedy. But passengers said they were held on the plane for nearly three hours, and then had to wait an additional three hours to retrieve their luggage. Photo Crews at Logan keep about 300 tons of salt on hand throughout the winter. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times That Saturday afternoon, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took the unusual step of ordering the terminal closed to inbound flights. That move forced Aeroflot to have a plane that was headed there from Moscow turn back. The problem had not been solved by the next day, so the Port Authority barred arrivals at Terminal 1 again on Sunday. Aeroflot had to cancel two flights that day from Moscow and one from Kennedy to Moscow. Aeroflot blamed the cancellations on “the complicated infrastructure situation at the J.F.K. Airport and the lack of parking lots for aircraft,” according to Tass, the Russian news agency. Adding misfortune to misery, on Sunday afternoon, a frozen pipe burst in the ceiling of the arrivals section of Kennedy’s Terminal 4, flooding an area that had been crowded with stranded travelers and their baggage. That mess, too, was not the Port Authority’s responsibility, but quickly became its problem. The agency sent workers to help out the operator of Terminal 4, a company known as JFKIAT, and had to bar it from accepting international flights for several hours that evening. What became of the passengers whose flights were blocked from landing at Kennedy that weekend? Six planeloads of them wound up at Logan, Mr. Freni said. Without gates for all of them, airport officials had to close off the end of one of Logan’s runways and park them there, said Todd Smith, Massport’s director of aviation operations. Passengers were then taken by shuttle buses to the international terminal. Photo Passengers waited in Kennedy Airport’s Terminal 4 after a weekend of delays and cancellations caused by the snowstorm. Kennedy’s terminals are run by the airlines, not the Port Authority. Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press The six planes that were diverted to Logan from Kennedy on Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Smith said, included an Air Europa flight from Madrid and a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo. Boston was the second of two unscheduled stops the Japanese plane made. It had nearly reached Kennedy when it was diverted to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. After leaving O’Hare for Kennedy, it was rerouted to Boston, where it stayed overnight while some of the passengers made it to New York by bus. By the weekend, while thousands of suitcases were piling up at Kennedy, all was calm at Logan. Massport’s fleet of snow-removal equipment, which includes 14 plows with 27-foot blades and a rubber-tracked snow-groomer designed for a ski resort, had quickly cleared the airport’s six runways. “Top-down management is sort of out of fashion these days,” Mr. Glynn said. But, he added, “top-down management works here and it works because people have respect for those at the top.” Logan, of course, is smaller than Kennedy, and handles only a fraction of the international passengers that Kennedy does. But the responses from officials of the Port Authority in the last several weeks imply that the different management structures of the two airports explain much of the gap in performance. Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, has repeatedly apologized and vowed that there would not be a repeat. The agency appointed the former transportation secretary Ray H. LaHood to investigate what happened at Kennedy and said it would immediately make several changes in procedures. Among those changes would be to require airlines to notify the Port Authority whenever an arriving plane is not assigned to a gate within 90 minutes of the time it lands. Speaking to an air-travel industry group in Manhattan recently, the Port Authority’s director of aviation, Huntley Lawrence, admitted that the agency had paid too little attention to passengers. Reflecting back to the 1960s, when the Port Authority first turned management of terminals over to private companies, he said: “No one ever dreamed that meant we would abdicate control of the customer experience at our airports. But we did.” Now, Mr. Lawrence added, according to the text of his speech, “those days are over.” Mr. Cotton said that Port Authority officials would await Mr. LaHood’s report, which is expected this spring. But, he added, “if his recommendation is that the Port Authority needs to take a more aggressive role, the Port Authority will take a more aggressive role.” Continue reading the main story","Snow plows in waiting at Boston Logan International Airport.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Washington state knew that it was in for an unusual snow event over the weekendbut the storm delivered a full-on Snowmageddon. Snow blanked the region beginning Friday and into Saturday, delivering to Seattle what the National Weather Service said was the most snow in February in 70 years.
Snow pummelling the state created hazardous conditions on the roads, with State Patrol Trooper C. Thorson tweeting that hundreds of cars became trapped Saturday evening near Interstate 82 in Benton County following a collision that led to a nasty pile-up. According to CBS-affiliate KEPR, up to 300 cars became stuck in the incident following multiple wrecks.
According to the Washington State Department of Transportation, officials also had to send a rescue team to bail out one vehicle in Douglas County after the truck maneuvered around a roadblock and became stuck in the snow.
We are having the same problems in eastern Washington, Thorson tweeted Saturday, sharing an image from the scene. Its gotten to the point where we are going to have to start writing tickets if people drive around road closed signs. Please just follow the instructions for your good and ours.
Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency ahead of the severe winter storm as Washington prepared for what had the potential to be one of its worst snowstorms in years. The governor warned Washington residents against driving but advised that anyone who became trapped in their car on the road stay inside.
Weather forecasters predict this may be a storm unlike one weve seen in many years, Inslee said in a statement last week. I encourage everyone to stay off the roads if possible and plan ahead if you must travel.
Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed over the weekend, with dozens of more cancellations on Sunday adding to the strain. Tens of thousands of people in the area also experienced power outages over the weekend as a result of the extreme winter weather thats unusual for the Pacific Northwest.
According to the National Weather Service, winter weather advisories are in effect in parts of Washington, and the state could be in for more snow beginning Sunday after and through the evening. According to a tweet from the agencys Seattle account Sunday afternoon, the area could see another 1 to 3 inches of snow.

MITCH SMITH,"CHICAGO Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.
If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.
Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.
Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways. In Minnehaha County, S.D., which includes Sioux Falls, the sheriffs office posted a photo of a car washed off the road. In Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, near Sioux City, residents were asked to conserve their water use because all the draining water is inundating our sewer system.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area. For the third time this winter, we’re using the term bomb cyclone to describe the storm. But neither of those facts are what’s got meteorologists glued to their radar maps today. They’re watching the snow. There’s going to be a lot of it. “This one’s main impact is going to be snow,” NWS meteorologist Kim Buttrick told the Associated Press of the storm. A blizzard warning is in effect for coastal Massachusetts, where total snowfall accumulations of up to nearly two feet are expected. The snow is is falling fast, at rates of up to 1-3 inches per hour, which, combined with wind gusts veering well into tropical storm-force territory, sets the stage or whiteout conditions that could make travel “very dangerous,” the National Weather Service warns. In Boston proper, more modest snowfall totals of 17 to 18 inches are expected. That’s still no fun to dig your car out of, mind you. Boston is no stranger to snowy winters. ““We don’t see snowfall rates of 1-3 inches per hour every day in New England, but neither are they unheard of,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email. “Likewise, the expected accumulations are impressive but not necessarily record-smashing.” But combined with the fact that this is the third nor’easter the region has seen in the past few weeks, and combined with the fact that meteorologists are already talking about a potential fourth, March 2018 is almost certainly going down as one of the snowiest in Boston’s history. “We’re definitely seeing an anomalous event for this time of the year with respect to snowfall,” meteorologist Ed Vallee told Earther, noting that Boston’s number one snowstorm for March and April, on April Fool’s Day ‘97, saw about 22 inches of snow. Vallee told Earther that the city has already seen seven inches of snow this month and that he’d add “at least another foot” after today’s storm. “Especially late in the winter, it often takes a highly dynamic system to chill the atmosphere to snow-producing temperatures, and those strong dynamics can also lead to very heavy snowfall rates,” Henson said. So let’s talk about those dynamics a bit. Henson told Earther the volley of storms we’ve seen in recent weeks is likely connected to a record strong phase of the Madden-Julien Oscillation, which NOAA describes as “a major fluctuation in tropical circulation and rainfall that moves eastward along the equator and circles the entire globe in a span of 30–60 days on average.” This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is stationary in the tropical Pacific. As Henson explained, a strongly active MJO “fed into a split of the stratospheric polar vortex in February” that’s still having atmospheric reverberations, including the recent “ Beast from the East ” cold outbreak over Europe and record cold in Siberia. The MJO is also a strong contributor to Arctic air outbreaks across the central and eastern U.S., according to NOAA. In addition to the legacy of the MJO, another atmospheric pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) veered into record low territory earlier this month. A negative NAO is characterized by a ridge of high pressure air over Greenland, something meteorologists call the Greenland block. Vallee explained that the Greenland block leads to a trough of low pressure further south and west. “That’s a very conducive pattern for nor’easters to form,” he said, noting that the Greenland block not only enhances the pressure gradient fueling these storms, but can slow their progress out to sea. The nor’easter that drove massive coastal flooding in Boston at the beginning of the month was slow to get out of the city’s way thanks to the Greenland block, Weather Underground reported at the time. This time around, at least, the coastal flooding risk for Massachusetts is much fairly low. Weather Underground reports that the strongest winds from today’s nor’easter will be further offshore, with peak land gusts of about 60 miles per hour forecast to blow across Cape Cod and Nantucket. This storm, unlike its predecessors, also happens to coincide with some of the lowest astronomical tides of the month. So, while Massachusetts will wind up buried in snow today, at least folks’ basements won’t be flooding, too? Small miracles, I guess.","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"But meteorologists were unable to pin down where and when exactly rain would turn into snow. • Travel plans were disrupted nationwide. Thousands of flights were canceled, including hundreds to and from Kennedy International and LaGuardia Airports in New York, and Amtrak modified service on the Acela Express, Northeast Regional, Keystone and Empire lines in the region. The Metro-North Railroad announced a reduced schedule for Wednesday. • Schools were closed in dozens of districts across the Northeast, including Philadelphia’s. New York City schools remained open. Hundreds of thousands still don’t have power from last week’s storm. The storm came just a few days after heavy snow and high winds assaulted the region on Friday, killing eight people and knocking out power for 2.7 million. Around 240,000 were still without power on Tuesday, according to the United States Energy Department. (The department said that it expected everyone to have power back by the end of the day, but that full restoration might be affected by Wednesday’s bad weather.) Mr. Cuomo said in a briefing on Tuesday that 78,000 people were still without power in New York, which he considered “unacceptable.” “These storms have now become the rule rather than the exception, and they have to have the capacity to quickly restore power,” he said.

The less-extreme amber alert — different from the United States warning about a missing child — was in place for possible disruption of services other parts of Scotland and England, with warnings of more than 19.6 inches of snow in parts of southwestern England. As a new wave of snowfall and freezing cold arrived Wednesday afternoon, Londoners rallied to provide warm food and blankets for homeless people, with volunteers scrambling to refer them to local services for temporary overnight accommodation. “For many, the snow is all fun and games,” said Alex Harper, a volunteer for the homeless charity Shelter. “But there are thousands of homeless people at real risk who could freeze to death in the night.” He added that on Tuesday night a record number of people had been referred to services in any 24-hour period, and that the numbers were expected to go up by Wednesday night. At least nine people have died across Europe this week because of the freezing weather conditions, prompting a Belgian mayor to detain people who refused shelter overnight, The Guardian reported. “These are the kinds of precautions we should be taking,” Mr. Harper added. “There’s all this panic and chaos over canceled flights and trains and changes to plans, but the homeless are at real risk — and during every cold spell they are overlooked.” Even so, some Britons and tourists said the authorities were spreading “disproportionate hype and panic” over the weather. Richard Ball, a teacher who commuted an hour into central London from a town in southern England, said, “Reading the news and official statements, you would think it was doomsday.” He pointed to a newspaper picture of a dark cloud with a headline that read, “Moment monster weather snow bomb from the East hits the capital.” “The amount of snow we’ve seen in London is laughable,” he said. “They wouldn’t even call this snow in some parts of the world.” Not the world's biggest snowman - but someone's built a very happy chappy on the @HouseofCommons terrace. pic.twitter.com/liIuLLEaks — Nigel Huddleston MP (@HuddlestonNigel) Feb. 28, 2018 Tourists visiting Hyde Park agreed, with one boy complaining that there wasn’t even enough snow to make the first layer of a snowman. “These Brits are so dramatic,” said Nichole Lemercier, who was visiting from France. “Our hotel told us not to travel today unless it was an emergency,” she said, laughing. “Maybe people here are afraid of the snow,” she added. “Look, even here in the main park, there are not that many people having fun in it.” But the Met Office said more snow was expected in northern England through Thursday and Friday, with fewer showers expected in the south. “Brace yourself for stronger winds and treacherous icy conditions,” it warned in a tweet.

RICK ROJAS,"In Connecticut, where state offices were closing early, Governor Malloy encouraged companies to allow employees to work from home if possible. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker tweeted that “everyone should expect a long &amp; challenging commute home.” And in New York City, where 1,600 snowplows were waiting to be deployed, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged residents to take precautions. “Use common sense,” he said. “If you can leave work early and get home earlier, please do.” The “thundersnow” on Wednesday brought quick accumulation and excited social media activity along parts of the coast.

Across the region, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, electric companies said that thousands of workers have been deployed to work on restoring electricity. Thousands of people across the Northeast have not had electricity since a winter storm blew across the region last week. They have waited, bundling up in their cold houses, staying in hotels or squeezing in with relatives and friends, as the time they were told their power would be restored has been pushed back repeatedly. And now, their frustration has only mounted. In the days since the storm that snapped a tree on their street in Scarsdale, just north of New York City, Erin Foster’s family has relied on a generator while the tree remains ensnared in a tangle of utility lines, and little progress appears to have been made.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Weather Service, called the storm a “mid-latitude cyclone” — as opposed to a hurricane, which is a tropical cyclone. “If it comes close enough to the coast, you can get a walloping snowfall,” Mr. Carbin said Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday was already cold, with high temperatures ranging from 0 degrees in the Northeast to the low 40s in parts of North Florida. It was in the 20s and 30s in parts of Texas, where much of the state was under a freeze warning. A shot of Arctic air will reinforce that cold and feed the storm, according to Mr. Carbin, who noted that a stretch from Louisiana to Georgia had already seen snow a few weeks ago. “We are,” he said, “in the depths of winter.” Southern governors encourage residents to stay aware. Mr. Deal was among the Georgia politicians who received criticism after a winter storm paralyzed Atlanta in 2014. In a statement on Tuesday evening, he noted that the state Department of Transportation had sent all of its brine trucks, as well as 75 plows, to southeast Georgia. “I encourage all Georgians in the potentially impacted areas to stay informed, get prepared and be safe,” he said. In North Carolina on Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Roy Cooper warned that the forecast for his state — up to five inches of snow in eastern counties — could change quickly. “A small change in a storm’s track can make a big difference in how much snow falls and where,” Mr. Cooper said. The state’s emergency management director, Mike Sprayberry, said counties were preparing to open warming centers if they were needed, and state officials said workers were already dumping brine onto roadways, overpasses and bridges from Raleigh eastward. The conditions also led to the shutdown, or planned closure, of ports in Savannah, Ga., and Charleston. Officials at other major ports said Wednesday morning that they were monitoring conditions and could close them later in the week.

A total of 34in (86cm) of snow blanketed the city and surrounding areas in the Pennsylvania state. There was no respite on Boxing Day, with meteorologists registering a grand total of 60in over the two-day period. Police warned motorists that ""roads are dangerous and impassable"", with a number of closures reported. More snow is forecast on Wednesday. The officials say the heavy snowstorm is the result of lake-effect snow - when cold air combines with lake water.

The National Weather Center Cleveland on Christmas Day registered a new all-time high for any single day, beating the previous record set in 1956. The state's two-day snowfall record from 1944 was also shattered, as well as a storm total snowfall and a monthly snowfall. How are local residents affected? A number of cars and homes were buried in snow, with some residents having to shovel their way out. Shops and childcare centres were closed.

The monster storm that tore across the Midwest this week got our atmosphere all types of wild. So wild, in fact, that winds picked up dust from deserts in New Mexico and Texas and wound up dropping it, alongside snow, all over peoples yards in South Dakota and Minnesota.
 Hot, dry conditions in the Southwest, combined with the storms ferocious windswhich reached speeds of over 70 miles per hour in some placescreated widespread fire danger this week. These conditions also allowed dust to get lofted high into the air before it precipitated out farther north. Winds were strong enough to transport dust from places like the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico.
People have been posting photos on Twitter of their slightly off-color snow. As weird as this may seem, its not a first. Just last year, Europe got hit with some orange snow full of dust from the Sahara. The snow coloring homes in the Midwest has got nothing on the bright stuff that fell over Russia and Moldova last year, but its definitely not your average snow.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tweeted some Dust in the Wind would be appropriate for the occasion. Thanks, NOAA. Truly.

Adam Rosenberg,"Get those shovels out, Pennsylvanians. The city of Erie is operating under a ""snow emergency"" declaration in the wake of a storm that kicked off shortly after 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve. As of 1 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 26, total accumulation had reached 56.5 inches, according to the National Weather Service. SEE ALSO: These beautiful snowflake photos were actually captured using a microscope It's the state's largest-ever snowfall over a two-day period. Data from the NWS puts Erie's Christmas 2017 accumulation ahead of a 1958 storm in Morgantown, which saw 44 inches pile up over the same period. The 1 PM snow observation at Erie International Airport was 1.5"" of new snow since 7 AM. This brings the daily total to 20.5"" of snow. The 2-day total since midnight Christmas Day is 54.5"" of snow. The storm total since snow began after 7 PM Christmas Eve is 56.5"" of snow. #pawx — NWS Cleveland (@NWSCLE) December 26, 2017 The Erie snowfall also knocks out Pennsylvania's 13-day total snowfall record. The previous record, set in early 1999 (technically, the timeframe started on Dec. 31, 1998), was 52.8 inches. Let that sink in for a moment. Erie saw more snow pile up over a two day period than any other location in the state of Pennsylvania had seen previously during a 13-day period. It was a lot of snow. This beats the 13-day total snowfall record for Erie, PA. Previous record was 52.8"" from 12/31/98-1/12/99. — NWS Cleveland (@NWSCLE) December 26, 2017 The high level of accumulation is a product of lake-effect snow. When frigid, dry Arctic air blows across the warmer and unfrozen Great Lakes, the resulting moisture in the air forms long, thin bands of intense snow. The resulting thick and powdery snow falls in downwind areas, and the storms that deliver it can be quite intense. Sometimes, they'll even produce lightning and thunder — resulting in the rare, wonderfully named weather event known as ""thundersnow.""

You probably have already read about what’s going on, so I’ll be brief: You’re looking at warm air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with frigid air in the North. The two spiral into one another and create a cyclone. This produces the weather “bomb,” or the pressure dropping precipitously: at least 24 millibars in 24 hours.

KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and CHRISTINA CARON,"As of Sunday, the storm did not appear too threatening, but by Monday afternoon, the outlook had shifted. Meteorologists said the storm had intensified, and they predicted more snow, with as much as two feet in Maine and parts of Cape Cod. Rhode Island and parts of New Hampshire were expecting up to 18 inches. The Cape was also expected to be blasted with high winds, with gusts up to 65 miles per hour, said Lenore Correia, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. Since early March, the region has been pummeled by storms. Last week, a nor’easter slammed into the East Coast on the heels of an earlier powerful storm that killed at least eight people and knocked out power for 2.7 million. Ms. Correia said the concern with this storm was the same — that the snow would be heavy and wet and could bring down more trees, branches and power lines, plunging New England residents into the cold and dark. Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said officials were not calling out the National Guard as it had in the earlier storms because the tides would be low and any flooding was likely to be minor. Power failures were his main concern, Mr. Baker said. Crews, assisted by utilities from across the Northeast and Canada, have by now restored power to 750,000 homes and businesses in the state over the last several days, he said. It has been slow going because fallen limbs and trees took out individual lines, meaning crews were restoring power “one neighborhood at a time.” Cities farther south along the East Coast are facing far less precipitation. The National Weather Service predicted between two and five inches of snow in New York City and surrounding areas, where a winter weather advisory was in effect. The eastern end of Long Island could get up to 10 inches of snow. New Jersey, where some residents are still without power from the earlier storms, is expected to get between one and four inches.

Photo While the euro was introduced in 11 countries in 1999, notes and coins only started being used in 2002. Credit Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Though euro bank notes and coins wouldn’t be released until 2002, eurozone banks were required to use the currency in transactions as soon as markets opened on Jan. 4, 1999. Fears of technical glitches meant banks brought in employees en masse : In Frankfurt, one bank had 3,200 people working to reprogram its computers. London had 30,000 workers on trading floors and in back offices, even though Britain wasn’t even adopting the euro. The switch took more than a year of planning, months of rewriting software, and full-scale dress rehearsals. But the reward for the banking world’s tireless efforts was a smooth debut when world markets opened for business. Others received something more concrete: For sharing a birthday with the new currency, each baby born in France on New Year’s Day that year received 100 euros from the Finance Ministry.

"Judson Jones and Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)A winter storm will unload a messy mix of heavy snow, strong winds and frigid temperatures across parts of the Midwest and Northeast over the weekend. 
About 115 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. Snow will start Saturday evening in Boston and New York, which will then turn into a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. 
The National Weather Service in New York is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of sleet and snow plus possible ice. New York may warm up enough for rain Sunday morning, but freezing is expected by the evening when temperatures plummet. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state will begin Saturday at 3 p.m. ET. Amtrak will operate a modified service Saturday and Sunday due to the weather, it said. 
Thousands of flights canceled
Travel through Sunday will be affected, with nearly 2,000 flights involving domestic airports canceled, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, closed for several hours after a Southwest Airlines flight went off a runway while taxiing. The airliner slid onto a runway overrun area, Southwest Airlines said. 
None of the 150 passengers and six crew members was injured, the airline said. 
The storm system is associated with the same upper-level energy as one on the West Coast that dumped rain in Los Angeles and elsewhere as well as caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Blowing and drifting snow
The second storm will exit the Rockies and likely will begin to drop snow across Kansas over the weekend. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of a storm last week-- will get less accumulation this time. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could face through the weekend. Both cities may get more than half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, snow to the north and ice and snow across the states' centers. 
Icing is possible in New England
This second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up at least 6 to 12 inches deep, with some icing for added misery.
The Interstate 95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will form, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning Saturday at noon. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
Deep chill across the United States 
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough for rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. It's expected to happen so fast it would instantly freeze any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

JOHN ELIGON,"Pack away the sidewalk tables and flip-flops; break out the boots and shovels.
Nature was showing its fickle side on Wednesday, with blizzard conditions, heavy snow and frigid air expected to pound parts of the Rockies and the Plains, just a day after the weather was sunny and idyllic in some of those same places.
The storm, caused by a low-pressure system moving east from the Pacific Ocean, is expected to bring temperature drops of about 50 degrees to places like Denver, where it was in the mid-70s and sunny on Tuesday but could drop to the mid-20s by Wednesday night, with 55-mile-an-hour wind gusts and up to 10 inches of snow. Whiteout conditions could make driving nearly impossible, forecasters said.
The effects of the low-pressure system will be felt from Colorado through Michigan, with heavy snow and thunderstorms, and even down into Texas, where dry conditions and high winds have led to fire warnings.
While the whiplash from pleasant to grim conditions might draw a collective groan, it should not come as much of a surprise to those familiar with springtime in the Plains.",Up to 10 inches of snow may fall on the city Wednesday as temperatures plunge below freezing from the mid-70s.

JULIE TURKEWITZ,"Mr. Maue said he understood that many people were experiencing spring fever angst, but that they should remember, its still winter.
The March mess follows a February full of record-breaking cold and snow in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota and other states. Rapid City, S.D., recorded subzero temperatures on 20 of the months 28 days. The Twin Cities in Minnesota received 39 inches of snow, beating a normal February by more than two feet.

A winter storm warning is in effect until 1 a.m. Expect six to eight inches of snow, strong winds and temperatures below freezing. (A coastal flood advisory is also in effect until noon for waterside areas in southern Queens and Staten Island.) Light to moderate snow began falling in New York City around 5 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. Schools in New York City are closed, as are many others across the region ( see the list here ). Commuters are encouraged to avoid driving and use mass transit when possible. The snow will be heaviest during the morning commute, but it’s likely to affect the evening commute as well, so travel safely and leave yourself extra time on both ends. You can check for service changes and delays before heading out: • The subway • Metro-North • Long Island Rail Road • Bridges and tunnels • Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy airports: airlines have already canceled many flights to and from East Coast destinations.

AZI PAYBARAH,"Last year, Amazon announced plans to open a major campus in New York City.
On Valentines Day, it called the whole thing off.
Then, Governor Cuomo began a campaign to woo it back.
Heres what you need to know:
 The Times broke the news that Mr. Cuomo had spoken to multiple Amazon executives by phone over the last two weeks, including the companys owner, Jeff Bezos. That they even took his calls after the deals collapse is a ray of hope for supporters.
 The Times also reported that a prominent critic of the plan, State Senator Michael Gianaris, is no longer set to join an obscure state panel that could have given him veto power over the deal. Leroy Comrie, a Queens state senator, recently replaced Mr. Gianaris as the nominee to the panel, known as the Public Authorities Control Board.
 The day after that news broke, a full-page ad appeared in The Times, signed by more than 70 prominent supporters, urging Mr. Bezos to reconsider. The ad said Mr. Cuomo would take personal responsibility for the projects state approval.
 On the day the ad appeared, Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview that Mr. Gianaris and another prominent critic of the deal, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, were irrelevant because there are other ways the state can get it done.
 As one Albany reporter humorously noted, Mr. Cuomos latest push seemed to resemble an article from the satirical news outlet The Onion, which pictured the governor furiously chasing down a limousine carrying Mr. Bezos.
The takeaway: This is not all about Amazon. The company hasnt commented, and Mr. Cuomo said he had no reason to believe the deal was back on. But Mr. Cuomo is signaling to other businesses: New York is still primed for deals that create jobs.","Five to eight inches of snow are expected in the New York City area, likely causing delays for commuters on Monday morning.",2019-03-03T19:12:46Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Weather: Snow in Forecast as Winter Storm Moves East,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/nyregion/newyorktoday/nyc-winter-storm-snow.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/nyregion/04NYTODAY/04NYTODAY-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
JULIA JACOBS,"Early on Saturday, officials warned that eastbound traffic near St. Louis was experiencing delays of six to eight hours.
Adam Dylewski, a St. Louis resident, said he spent more than three hours on the road on Friday night after trying to get from one urgent care center to another for his job as a physician assistant. He said there were countless cars spinning their wheels, fruitlessly trying to get up modest hills, and he saw several drivers abandon their cars in search of help.
It looked like I was in some sort of apocalyptic natural disaster movie where people were trying to flee, Mr. Dylewski said.
The Illinois State Police said that during a period of about 20 hours it responded to nearly 300 traffic crashes of which one was fatal. In eastern Illinois, a tractor-trailer flipped and landed on its roof, a state trooper said in a Facebook video.
In some areas of the state, many of the vehicle crashes involved college students trying to get back to school, the Illinois State Police said.

Emily Price,"A bomb cyclone hit Colorado on Wednesday. While the term sounds like something out of science fiction, its quite realbomb cyclone is a scientific term describing the aftermath of bombogenesis, which is another word Im thankful is now in my vocabulary. So, to understand a bomb cyclone you first need to understand a bombogenesis.
Bombogenesis
According to the National Ocean Service, a bombogenesis describes a midlatitude cyclone that rapidly intensifies. 
Heres the full definition from the ocean service.
[Bombogenesis] occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure. This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters. The formation of this rapidly strengthening weather system is a process called bombogenesis, which creates what is known as a bomb cyclone.
Its referred to as a bomb because its an explosive storm that cpmes on quickly. Bombogenesis is a combination of the two words bomb and cyclogenesis. All storms are considered cyclones, and genesis means the beginning. So Bombogenesis is the beginning of an explosive storm.
Bomb cyclone
The lower the pressure gets, the stronger the storm, or bomb cyclone, will be. Stronger storms can mean high winds and large amounts of snow.
In the case of Denver, when an Arctic air mass from the north hit the warm, humid air mass that was over the area at the time, the pressure dropped quickly and the bomb cyclone was formed.
This essentially means that it was a strong storm that appeared quickly, rather than a slow storm that everyone was able to track on its approach.
While we dont hear about them too often, bomb cyclones typically occur at least once a year, according to the National Weather Service. With climate change, theyre something we might start to see a lot more of as cold air continues to migrate a bit farther south than it has in the past.","A “bomb cyclone” hit Colorado on Wednesday.

Back Story Each week, The Times’s crossword column, Wordplay, highlights the answer to one of the most difficult clues from the previous week’s puzzles. This week’s word: nene. Photo Behold the nene: a rare goose (and a frequent answer in The Times’s crossword). Credit Barry Batchelor/PA, via Associated Press If it looks like a goose and honks like a goose, it should just be a goose, right? The nene, however, is special. Not only is it Hawaii’s state bird, it’s also the world’s rarest goose. Its webbed feet have adapted to living on hardened lava, but it is a weak flier. Nenes were once hunted nearly to extinction, but conservation efforts have bolstered their population. Another reason to know your nenes is that, although rare in the wild, they often come up in crossword puzzles. Nene has been an entry in Times crosswords 295 times since 1944. It appeared in the puzzle on March 12 with the clue “Hawaiian goose.” The word might also appear in easy puzzles with the clue “Hawaiian state bird” or “Hawaiian honker.” Later in the week, as the crosswords become harder, it might be referred to as “Aloha State bird,” “Endangered state bird,” “Lava geese,” “Bird so-called from its call” or “Gray-brown goose.” You can find out about the nene and other birds that appear regularly in our Crossword Aviary.

CHRISTINA CARON,"Parts of New Jersey remained without power after last week’s storm. As of Sunday afternoon, more than 14,000 customers served by Jersey Central Power &amp; Light were still waiting for their electricity to be restored. On Twitter on Saturday, Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey called the company’s lack of preparation and response “embarrassing and unacceptable.” “Once all power has been restored to every New Jersey resident and business, our administration will begin an investigation into what went wrong and how utilities could have responded better,” he added. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light said in a statement that most of the customers without power were expected to have it restored by late Sunday night. “Our JCP&amp;L personnel and outside line crews have been working 16-hour days to safely restore power since the storms hit the region and will continue to do so until the job is finished,” Jim Fakult, the company’s president, said in the statement. Mr. Hurley said the wind won’t be as strong or as long-lasting as it was during the other recent storms, so he didn’t expect to see as many power failures. “Certainly there are going to be higher wind gusts toward the coast,” he said. In Cape Cod, Mass., winds may gust as high as 40 to 50 miles per hour, which could result in fallen tree branches, the National Weather Service in Boston said on Sunday morning.

NICK CORASANITI,"The storm comes just as many in the region have finally dug out from two relentless storms in early March — the second one left two people dead and thousands of people in New Jersey and the suburbs north of New York City without power for days as utility companies came under scrutiny for their response. Gov. Philip D. Murphy, Democrat of New Jersey, speaking at the train station in Madison, said that he was closely monitoring the coming storm, and was considering declaring a state of emergency to begin around midnight should the forecasts hold true. “Our concerns have somewhat intensified,” Mr. Murphy said, warning residents that the evening commute on Tuesday could turn icy and windy, but that the snow accumulation and storm were unlikely to begin until early Wednesday. Addressing what he called the “the biggest shortfalls” of the last storm, Mr. Murphy said that one of the state’s much-maligned utility companies — Jersey Central Power and Light — had activated 800 workers to respond to the storm, and that all of the utility companies had activated their mutual aid agreements, meaning that they would share resources in response to outages. “We’ve been in touch with them all day,” Mr. Murphy said of the utility companies, and noted that the state Board of Public Utilities was also “center stage” in planning for the storm. He noted that the storms potential for heavy snow, in addition to gusty winds, has the potential for more downed power lines, and urged caution to residents. “Please do not head out into the snow unless you absolutely have to,” he said.

If the forecast holds, this could be the biggest spring snowstorm in New York City history. The current record was set on April 3, 1915, when 10 inches fell.

In some areas, the storm is expected to be accompanied by winds gusting up to 50 miles an hour, which — combined with the weight of wet snow — could bring down tree limbs and trigger power failures. Minor to moderate coastal flooding is also expected along the Eastern Seaboard.

Beth Skwarecki,"There was always a pink blanket in the trunk of the family car when I was growing up. It took up a lot of space but could never be removed, because what if the car broke down in winter? We would all have to huddle under the blanket while we waited for help. Driving without a blanket is just asking for trouble. This never happened, of course, and I didn’t carry on the tradition. But I always think of the trunk of my car as a place to carry emergency essentials. I wouldn’t go anywhere without jumper cables, and I’ve used mine several times over the years—sometimes to be a good Samaritan, sometimes to ask for a jump myself. When I lived in dorms and apartments I would always keep a kid-sized snow shovel in the trunk, so I could dig myself out of a storm. Now that I have kids, there’s a lot more going on than emergency gear. It’s not like I’m going to leave home without diapers, nail trimmers, or approximately 37 baby dolls.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Coastal communities in Massachusetts are still cleaning up from last week’s potent nor’easter. They may want to put those efforts on hold, though. Another storm is set to impact the region by midweek. The coastal flooding won’t be nearly as bad, but colder air means snow is expected to pile up across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The active weather pattern is courtesy of a climate oscillation known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, which has been in record territory to start the month. We all know last week was a nor’easter of epic proportion in terms of wind, waves and planes covered in vomit. The next storm to hit the region is currently creating blizzard conditions in the northern half of the Midwest and gusty, dry fire weather in the southern half. It will skirt the Ohio River Valley on Tuesday before curling up the coast on Wednesday and Thursday. Because astronomical tides will be lower and the storm will move faster than last week’s behemoth, coastal flooding is unlikely to be as bad as it was in New England on Friday and Saturday. Areas that were hit hard, however, will be in a more vulnerable state and this could add insult to injury. Ditto for the winds, which won’t be hurricane force like they were last week, but could still cause damage to branches and power lines already weakened. One area where this storm will outperform last week’s nor’easter is snow. Coastal areas are still looking at a rain-snow mix, but some inland locations could get a foot or more of snow. Bands of snow that train north to south could create relentless snow and even offer a chance of thundersnow in parts of New Jersey and inland areas further north. Somewhere, meteorologist and noted thundersnow enthusiast Jim Cantore is surely getting stoked. So while not historic, we’re still looking at high impact winter weather. The string of storms is coming courtesy of a climate pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Right now, it’s in a negative phase, which usually translates to snowy U.S. and cold Europe. And this recent negative NAO is no exception with back-to-back nor’easters on tap in the U.S. and frigid air in Europe that allowed it to snow in Rome last week. A negative NAO is also generally characterized by a big ridge of high pressure over Greenland, something meteorologists refer to as a Greenland Block. That in turn causes the jet stream—a river of fast flowing air that storms ride—to dip a bit over the eastern U.S., increasing the odds of wild weather in the region. “While the NAO is not the only factor at play, I believe it is definitely a driving force behind this pattern,” Ed Vallee, a meteorologist and owner of Vallee Weather Consulting LLC, told Earther. “Blocking high pressure in southeastern Canada has amplified the pattern as a whole and has allowed disturbances originating from the Pacific Ocean to glide across the U.S. while tapping into available moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.” The current negative NAO bottomed in historic territory just as the last week’s nor’easter was tearing up the East Coast. It’s since slowly started marching toward a more neutral state, which is good news if you’re not fan of this recent spate of turn-umbrellas-inside-out weather. “It appears the blocking pattern causing this increase in storminess will begin to break down toward the middle of the month,” Valle said. “In return, the pattern will likely shift back warmer and perhaps drier as we head into the back half of March.”","Coastal communities in Massachusetts are still cleaning up from last week’s potent nor’easter.

SANDRA E. GARCIA,"A winter storm that slammed some parts of the Midwest and that officials say contributed to the deaths of at least nine people was moving east on Sunday, leaving disruptions to travel and electric power in its wake.
Much of the snow was winding down in the Midwest, Dan Pydynowski, a meteorologist with AccuWeather, said. There is still some light lingering snow around St. Louis and parts of central Illinois, he said, adding that it was expected to stop by late Sunday evening.
But as the Midwest dug itself out, the storm was continuing east on Sunday. The system delivered snow to Baltimore; Washington, D.C.; Delaware; parts of New Jersey; and the mountains in Virginia. Mr. Pydynowski said the snow would continue across southern New Jersey until very early Monday morning before ending.

Mariella Moon,"Graeme Stephens, director of the Center of Climate Sciences at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, explained: ""We don't have any way of measuring how water and air move in thunderstorms globally. We just don't have any information about that at all, yet it's so essential for predicting severe weather and even how rains will change in a future climate."" While small, the RainCube isn't so tiny that scientists can let loose a bunch inside a raging hurricane à la the sensors in Twister. It works by using radar to see storms in the same way a bat uses sonar to fly around in the dark. RainCube has an umbrella-like component that sends out chirps or radar signals, which then bounce off raindrops to paint a picture of what the inside of a storm looks like. The RainCube team created it as an experiment to see if it's possible to create a weather radar in the form of a tiny low-cost satellite. ""The radar signal penetrates the storm, and then the radar receives back an echo,"" Principal Investigator Eva Peral said. ""As the radar signal goes deeper into the layers of the storm and measures the rain at those layers, we get a snapshot of the activity inside the storm."" In the future, multiple units could work together to monitor hurricanes/typhoons in real time and send back updates every few minutes. Scientists could then use the data they gather to enhance weather models, so we can improve our ability to predict the movement of rain, snow, sleet and hail and make more accurate weather forecasts.

SEE ALSO: This comedian's neighbours left her wine in the snow to help beat weather blues The politics of ordering food during a snowstorm, or any storm for that matter, is an moral, ethical, and human decency quagmire. On the one hand, during snowstorms, weather warnings frequently advise citizens to stay off the road, unless for emergency purposes. So skipping out on ordering food seems like the logical and ethical thing to do. But on the other hand, food delivery people augment their hourly income with tips from making deliveries. If a food delivery person has to show up to work, and nobody orders because customers think that ordering food during a storm is rude, are we depriving delivery people of their livelihood? What's a hungry person to do!? Popular wisdom is to order and tip extra: life hack: if you order delivery tonight during the snow storm, tip your driver well for risking their life to bring you pizza — kanye (@queengabbi) January 12, 2018 Reminder to East Coasters: if you order food delivery during a snowstorm, your minimum tip is $20 or 30%, whichever is higher.

To check, we called several New York eateries. One Brooklyn restaurant explained, ""We're open 24 hours. As long as we're open, we can deliver. If we're closed, we'll put up a notice."" Another Manhattan diner echoed the sentiment. ""It's completely okay provided the place is open. I don't think it's wrong to order,"" a customer representative advised. ""But be very patient and expect to wait."" Be very patient and expect to wait. But at the end of the day, the golden rule seems to be: communicate. When it comes to ordering during a storm, the rule of thumb is to play it by ear, explained another Brooklyn restaurant. ""It depends on the severity of the storm. I'd rather people hold off, but you can always call."" Seamless also recommends checking with the restaurant on a case-by-case basis. ""In that type of situation, I would suggest you place your order a little bit earlier,"" a Seamless customer care representative advised. ""We do allow our customers to place their order 24 hours prior. So you can send in your order and give the restaurant a big heads up. And hopefully you can agree on a early enough time when the storm has not hit so hard."" So is there a definitive answer on whether you should order during a snowstorm? Nope! That mystery lives on. But when in doubt, just double check with the restaurant first, and you should be able to enjoy your takeout free of guilt. And if your delivery person arrives caked in snow, the universal way to say ""thank you for braving the storm"" is by giving an extra generous tip.","*Stretches widely* *Inhales deeply and peacefully* Aaahhh!

Andrew Freedman,"Just a few days after a powerful storm caused widespread damage across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, another potent nor'easter is tracking toward the region. This one won't be quite as strong as the last event, which was so massive that it caused damage as far away as the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, but it will have more cold air to work with, making a foot or more of snow more likely, especially across interior portions of New England. The storm will exacerbate the coastal flooding that never completely dissipated in the wake of the last intense storm and astronomical high tides that hit beginning on March 1. In coastal Massachusetts, the first nor'easter severely weakened or destroyed shoreline infrastructure in many communities, making the high waves and coastal flooding from this upcoming storm even more of a threat. SEE ALSO: This one picture sums up climate change's growing role in coastal flooding In general, as sea levels rise in response to global warming, weather ""bombs"" like the two storms in the last week will be capable of causing more severe coastal flooding, since their storm surge will ride on top of a higher baseline of water. And anytime that a major storm coincides with astronomical high tides, as the March 1-4 event did, look out for records to fall along with seawalls. National Weather Service snowfall forecast for New York City. Image: nws. Coastal storms, including weather systems that undergo the process known as bombogenesis, in which the minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, are not unusual at this time of year along the East Coast. However, it is rare to see two back-to-back intense storms, both of which would qualify as ""bomb cyclones"" or ""weather bombs,"" occur within a few days of each other. [Coastal Flooding] Watch issued for Northeast MA (Cape Ann) for the Thursday AM high tide (3a - 5a); potential 2.5 - 3.0 foot storm surge along w/ tides yielding minor to moderate coastal flooding considering now vulnerable shoreline per recent storm (winds below in knots) pic.twitter.com/dD7zYQdIcC — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 6, 2018 The back-to-back nature of these weather systems is largely due to a favorable weather pattern across the North Atlantic, with a blocking area of high pressure over Greenland preventing storms from moving quickly out to sea, and a see-saw pattern of atmospheric pressure, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, in a phase that favors East Coast storms. The snowfall forecast for major cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is an extremely difficult one, given multiple factors that could cut down on totals, or conversely, drastically raise them. So far, the consensus forecasts call for about 6 to 8 inches to fall in the Philadelphia area, with much more snow to the northwest of the city, and similar amounts in New York City. Quite a gradient in snowfall across RI and MA for Wednesday's storm. Nothing in Boston but almost a foot in Bedford, MA (near I-195/128). 2-4"" for Providence but over a foot in NW RI.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The weather doesnt stop for anyone, including voters. For many folks heading to the polls this week, a big mess of rain, snow and possibly severe weather is on tap starting on Monday and stretching into Tuesday. But the impacts arent expected to last all day, so you should be able to find a window to go vote. The low pressure system that will deliver some Election Day slop will drop out of Canada, riding a cold front into the Midwest all the way down to the Southeast. Rain is already spreading over that large swath of the country as the system begins to ramp up. Come Election Day, a dusting of up to two inches of snow is possible in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Gusty winds of up to 35 mph could lead to low visibility. The rest of the Midwest will deal with wind-driven rain, so pack your umbrella and a raincoat. The same storm will bring rain to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. But the clash between the cold Canadian air and warm air streaming in from the Gulf of Mexico raises the risk of thunderstorms and even the possibility of tornadoes. According to the Storm Prediction Center, the worst of the weather will strike on Monday with a bullseye of enhanced severe weather over the Southeast. Election Day will feature a slight risk of severe weather but over a much larger area that runs from Georgia to southern Pennsylvania. Up to three inches of rain could fall in Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, with the latter three home to some extremely competitive races. Rain will also spread into the Northeast by midday Tuesday, though forecasts show it winding down a little before the polls close for most areas save northern New England. Most of the rest of the country will be pretty quiet weather-wise, outside of some snow showers and rain in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies. A 2010 study showed that in non-competitive races, rainy weather can keep people away from the polls. But if the 2016 presidential election demonstrated anything, its that every vote matters. And the same will be true in 2018, a watershed midterm election. There are an unfortunate number of roadblocks to voting in some states, but the weather shouldnt be one of them. I think that if voter engagement is higher this year at a national level, that may mean that weather is less of a factor even in uncompetitive districts, Bernard Fraga, a political economist at the University of Indiana who authored the aforementioned study, told Earther. In addition, given that a large share of Americans now cast their ballots early (including today, in some states) it is plausible that some voters decide to vote early if bad weather is forecast for election day. Bundle up if you think there will be a line at your polling place, and drive safe (or tell your free or discounted Uber or Lyft driver to do so).

ELIZA SHAPIRO and MICHAEL GOLD,"Mr. de Blasios then-schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, defended their decision by declaring, Its a beautiful day. The comment landed her days of unflattering coverage on the front pages of the citys tabloids.
Snow day decisions involve a complicated calculus of politics and logistics. The citys response to the most recent storm typically influences the next decision; if the mayor was seen as overly alarmist over just a few inches, he may be more hesitant to cancel schools, but if he took heat for mismanaging a storm, it is easier to make the case for an abundance of caution.
A morning snowstorm can be particularly tricky for schools because a massive fleet of yellow buses have to leave their depots, typically before the sun rises, and pick up tens of thousands of students. Those buses then interfere with the 1,600 snow plows the mayor said would comb the streets overnight. Heavy snow can impact subway service, and New Yorkers are familiar with city buses skidding and sliding across avenues in bad weather.
Then there is the question of unreliable forecasts: Mr. de Blasio defended his administrations response to the November storm by noting that the forecast only called for an inch of snow, when six inches that fell during rush hour an especially inconvenient time paralyzed the city. One meteorologist noted on Monday that had the temperature been just a few degrees colder overnight, the modest snowfall could have been closer to eight inches or more.
With the start of spring just a few weeks away, Mr. de Blasio was likely also betting that it would be the only snow day of the season. In the past, the city has been more hesitant to close schools early in the winter.
Mr. de Blasio was not the only local official who shuttered schools on Monday. In New Jersey, where Gov. Philip D. Murphy declared a state of emergency, school districts began announcing closures or delayed openings as early as Sunday evening.
Schools in the cities of Hoboken, Secaucus and Jersey City, all just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, were all closed on Monday. In suburban Bergen County, about 30 school districts opted to close for the day; roughly an equal number opted to open late.",It is a fact of New York City politics that a mayor is only as popular as his most recent snow day decision.,2019-03-04T17:45:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Snow Day: Was de Blasio Too Quick to Cancel School?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/nyregion/school-snow-day-nyc.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/nyregion/04SNOWDAYS-01/04SNOWDAYS-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
Eric Niiler,"The governments new weather forecast model has a slight problem: It predicts that outside temperatures will be a few degrees colder than what nature delivers. This cold bias means that local meteorologists are abandoning the National Weather Service in favor of forecasts produced by British and European weather agencies.
For the past few weeks, the National Weather Service has been forecasting snowfall that ends up disappearing, according to Doug Kammerer, chief meteorologist at WRC-TV in Washington, DC. Its just not performing well, Kammerer says. It has continued to show us getting big-time snowstorms in this area, where the European model will not show it.
The new model, known as GFS-FV3 (Finite Volume on a Cubed Sphere dynamical core), has often overpredicted snow in the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, a region where incorrect forecasts affect the lives of tens of millions of people.
The existing NWS forecast model, called the Global Forecast System, or GFS, has long been considered second in accuracy to the European models. Now Kammerer and others say the new FV3 upgrade is worse than the forecast model put out by our neighbors to the north. The running joke now among meteorologists is that [the FV3] is looking more like the Canadian model, Kammerer says. For those not plugged into weather humor, apparently the Canadian model also predicts big snowstorms that ultimately vanish.
The FV3 was developed over the past three years by NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. FV3 forecasts were released a few weeks ago for testing by local meteorologists, and many of them took to Twitter to complain about the results. I have no faith in the FV3 [for snowfall], tweeted Boston-based Judah Cohen, a meteorologist at Atmospheric Environmental Research, a private firm that provides forecasts to commercial and government clients.
On Wednesday, the National Weather Service tweeted that the FV3 will be fully operational on March 20. But a NWS official told WIRED on Friday that the agency might push it back a few weeks because of all the complaints.
The FV3 upgrade uses an enhanced set of algorithms that have been developed in the past few years by climate scientists to describe the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans. These algorithms, which capture the physics of cloud formation, tropical storms, and polar winds, among other things, are then populated with temperature data from satellites and surface observations to generate a three- or 10-day forecast.
No model is perfect, says David Novak, acting director of the NWS National Center for Environmental Prediction. The weather community knows this. Novak acknowledges that the FV3 has a cold bias and that the agency is working to fix it. It tends to be colder than what is observed. It appears to be a systematic issue, we are doing our due diligence and investigating these reports.
Novak says the 35-day government shutdown slowed final testing of the FV3. When federal climate scientists and programmers got back to work on January 25, the agency expected the model to be almost ready to go live. It looks like that deadline will now be pushed back.
He argues, however, that the FV3 isnt all bad. He says it produces more accurate forecasts of hurricane intensity and the jet stream, the current of high-altitude air around the northern hemisphere that drives much of the United States weather patterns. We found a lot of the good things, Novak says. We do know there are some areas that may need additional improvement.
NOAA recently signed an agreement with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a Boulder-based research facility that also develops forecast models. Antonio Busalacchi, director of NCARs parent agency, says hes optimistic that the new NWS model will get better over time. Its premature to evaluate any one modeling system based on a snapshot with snowfall forecasts, Busalacchi says. One needs to look at the totality of the system.
At the same time, Busalacchi says that NWS and its parent agency, NOAA, might want to rely on help from academic scientists who are developing their own forecast models. We want to get in a position where the research community and operational community are more collaborative than we have been in the past, he says.
As for Kammerer, he says he'll keep watching the new NWS model as he prepares his own forecast for the weather in Washington, DC. But maybe not for the next snow day.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over. A powerful storm is set to spin up in the Midwest this week. And if youre getting deja vu looking at the weather map up top, youre not alone.
The swirling mass of air forecast to blast the region with blustery winds, snow, and rain bears more than a passing resemblance to last months bomb cyclone that devastated the region. While this weeks storm might not be quite as strong, it will unleash a wave of misery in places still suffering from flooding.
The gnarly weather pattern will follow a similar evolution to last months bomb cyclone. A storm will come racing on the back of a strong jet stream dipping across the west through the first half of the week. As the jet stream swoops back up into the Midwest on Wednesday, it will pull ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico up to meet cold air from the north. Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota are all under winter storm watches. The contrasting air temperatures will have winds whipping up to 35 mph and six or more inches of snow are forecast, according to the National Weather Service. Other parts of the Upper Midwest could also see snow through Thursday before the storm swirls into the Ohio River Valley, and its extremely likely those winter storm watches could expand to other areas and be upgraded to warnings. Blizzard-like conditions are also possible, so it wouldnt be wholly shocking to see the National Weather Service issue blizzard warnings at some point either.
While the storm is no joke, its also not likely to be quite as potent as last months bomb cyclone, which arrived with hurricane-force winds and record-setting low pressure. Thats because the environment isnt as conducive to as powerful a storm this time around. The temperature gradient on either side of the fronta key ingredient for winter storms to bomb outwont be as extreme. That means this storm might not meet the textbook definition of a bomb cyclone, a term that applies to storms that see their central pressure drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. 
But textbook definitions aside, this storm poses a serious risk to the region still recovering from flooding last month. Data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows thatMidwest soil moisture levels are in the 99th percentile, which is to say that soils are extremely waterlogged. The new batch of rain and snow is like pouring a can of gas on a fire. Except instead of the flames rising higher, the water will. 
If youre wondering what climate change looks like, this is it. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, unleashing more deluges and with them, more floods. With saturated soil, water is once again expected to run off into rivers and streams, many of which are still swollen. In the Missouri River basin, 26 flood gaugesin NOAAs networkare in a state of major or moderate flooding. In the Upper Mississippi basin, 56 gauges are at those levels of flooding. The new influx of water will add to the flood woes and is likely to tip other gauges back toward moderate or major flooding.
That could add to the billions of dollars in losses and once again raise the specter of flooding at Superfund sites. And it will add to the slow moving torrent of water working down the Mississippi River toward the Gulf of Mexico. That wall of water is forecast to unleash historic flooding through May, according to NOAA.","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over.

MATT STEVENS,"Photo Brian Croteau loading sandbags onto his bike on Thursday in Provincetown, Mass., as he prepared for a powerful storm. Credit Steve Heaslip/The Cape Cod Times, via Associated Press A sprawling winter storm barreled toward the Atlantic Coast on Thursday and was expected to pound most of it with a potent mix of rain, snow, gusty winds and storm surge that forecasters warn could flood neighborhoods, knock out power and destroy homes. “Take this storm seriously!” the National Weather Service’s Boston branch warned on Twitter late Thursday afternoon. “This is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation for those living along the coast.” The effects of the nor’easter, which could linger through Saturday or beyond, are expected to stretch as far south as Georgia and South Carolina, all the way north to Maine. Weather officials say 10 inches of snow — or perhaps more — could blanket parts of New York; some areas of New England could get three to four inches of rain; and some coastal towns are expected to be hit with winds of 50 miles per hour or more. Alerts have been issued up and down the coast, but experts are warning that some of the most severe flooding could occur in places like Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts where the Weather Service said roads, basements and other structures could become inundated by three feet of water or more. In those areas, officials said, the most severe coastal flooding was likely to occur during the high tides Friday night and Saturday afternoon. “Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time,” the Weather Service said in a written warning. “This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary.” Winter Storm #Riley will become an intense #noreaster with locally major, long-lived coastal #flooding, high winds, and heavy, wet #snow that could lead to widespread power outages. https://t.co/XjELnjHJis pic.twitter.com/KAAcpib2cC — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) March 1, 2018 The dire messages prompted Gov.

Andrew Freedman,"The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is taking shape across the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm is expected to become the biggest late-March snowstorm on record from Washington, D.C. to New York City. The fact that the storm is hitting on the first full day of spring is twisting the metaphorical knives in the backs of millions who are weary of shoveling snow, enduring power outages, and facing more travel disruptions. SEE ALSO: Climate change could force millions of people to move within countries This storm has the potential to shatter March snowfall records in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York, where up to a foot or more of snow is possible. Some spots in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey could approach 2 feet, if computer model projections on Tuesday afternoon prove to be correct. The snowstorm will result from an area of low pressure taking shape in the Carolinas on Tuesday. The storm will intensify as it moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast, throwing copious amounts of moisture from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico inland, where the air is cold enough to support snow. The heaviest snow will fall in narrow bands just 10 to 20 miles wide. These are known as ""mesoscale bands,"" since they are so localized, and they form where the strongest atmospheric lift is located. Within such bands, snow could fall at up to 2 inches an hour or greater, whereas in between them, it will be snowing at slower rates, bringing far lower accumulations. The heaviest snows are forecast for the Mid-Atlantic region, with considerable uncertainty about whether the higher snow totals will reach New York City and Boston, as computer models suggest a storm track further offshore than previously thought. Even so, this will still be a major event for the I-95 corridor. It is also a prime example of what can happen when highly amplified weather patterns are established and are exceedingly slow to break down. Let's face it — the atmosphere is stuck in a rut, with the jet stream, the highway of fast-flowing air at about 35,000 feet — setting off one nor'easter after the other as if someone forgot to hit the ""off"" switch. Unlike the past three storms, though, this one is not expected to deliver its most severe impacts to the Boston area, but rather focus on Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Wilmington, and central New Jersey. It won't take much more than a foot of snow to set all-time snowfall records for this late in the month of March in New York and Philadelphia, both of which are within reach if the storm tracks close enough to the coastline to bring the heaviest snow to these areas. The latest nor'easter, so named because the winds in such storms blow predominantly from the northeast, is occurring at a time when the overall climate is warming due largely to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels for energy. Therefore, it might seem paradoxical to have so many late-season snowstorms. However, in a way, this repetitive fusillade of snow events may be what global warming looks like, for two main reasons. Firstly, it will still snow in a warmer world, and there has been a well-documented increase in heavy precipitation events during the warm and cold seasons across the U.S., tied to the atmosphere's ability to hold more moisture as air temperatures increase. Therefore, when it snows, the odds could gradually favor heavier snowstorms, rather than moderate ones. That’s a major increase in precipitation amounts on the Euro across much of NJ, E PA, NYC and Long Island compared to last nights run. Tighter gradient on the northern fringes. Big time snows south of that gradient! pic.twitter.com/IxAjEarjJu — John Homenuk (@jhomenuk) March 20, 2018 Second, some researchers have been noticing an increasingly common tendency for weather patterns to get stuck in place, as large north-to-south undulations in the jet stream are slow to break down, thereby causing extended periods of extreme weather. The physical mechanisms behind jet stream tendencies are not yet well-established, but many of the most severe weather extremes in recent years have been associated with such stuck weather patterns. In addition, there is also some statistical evidence linking rapid Arctic climate change to increased snowstorm activity along the East Coast during the mid-to-late winter months. As for this particular storm, though, one consolation is that the snow will melt far faster under the spring sun than it would've had this nor'easter parade occurred in January. Also, you might not want to hear this, but there are some signs of a fifth nor’easter potentially forming next week, soon after the snow from this one has melted.","The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is taking shape across the Mid-Atlantic states.

PATRICK McGEEHAN,"“Having all these terminal operators as sort of independent operators complicates J.F.K. and makes it more difficult than any other airport in the country,” Mr. LaHood said. But, he added, Los Angeles International has a similar structure “and they’ve got it down to a fare-thee-well.” Los Angeles does not have to cope with snowstorms, he said, but its airport has had other troubles, including the fatal shooting of a Transportation Security Administration screener in 2013. “They’ve had some serious incidents and they’ve handled it very well,” Mr. LaHood said. Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, said his agency accepted the criticisms in the report and embraced its recommendations for change. He said the emergency operations center would evolve into a “24/7” operations center, though probably not with all 26 entities represented at all times. The Port Authority has addressed another breakdown highlighted in the report by ordering more snow-removal equipment. The report detailed the trouble Kennedy’s crews had clearing snow from the airport’s runways after the Jan. 4 storm, which Mr. LaHood referred to as winter storm Grayson. When the storm’s combination of snow and wind created “whiteout” conditions, airport officials closed Kennedy at about 11 a.m. and said it would reopen at 3 p.m. That reopening time was repeatedly pushed back, first to 6 p.m., then to 8 p.m. and eventually to 7 a.m. the next day. Meanwhile, Kennedy’s airfield became “gridlocked” and “passengers were stuck on inactive planes for unacceptable periods of time,” the report said. Many planes that had taken off for Kennedy from overseas had to turn around or detour to other cities. A total of 8,400 passengers on 28 planes were diverted to O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, where some “were virtually abandoned” because their airlines did not have a presence there, it said. Mr. Cotton has vowed that Kennedy will not get into another jam like that. To help ensure there is no recurrence, the Port Authority has adopted a practice of barring airlines from sending planes to Kennedy during a period when a winter storm is expected unless they have an assurance from a terminal operator that a gate will be available.","Ray LaHood, a former transportation secretary, laid out dozens of changes to avoid a repeat of the failure that followed a fierce January snowstorm.",2018-05-31T22:43:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Report Offers 50 Ways to Avoid the Chaos That Crippled Kennedy Airport,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/nyregion/kennedy-airport-snowstorm-report.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/06/nyregion/01KENNEDY-01/07xp-jfk-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

MATT STEVENS and SANDRA E. GARCIA,"“We’re used to snow, don’t get me wrong,” Mr. Sinnott, 52, said. “But this amount, trying to deal with this, is very atypical.” Mr. Sinnott spoke on Tuesday evening by phone as he monitored the dispatch of snow plows from a municipal garage. He said crews had been working around the clock to clear main thoroughfares, but until about noon Tuesday, it had snowed so much that “every time we finish the main streets we have to circle back around and do them again.” As a result, snow has accumulated on residential side streets, making it difficult for people to escape their driveways, he said. But even if they could leave, Mr. Sinnott noted, “everything is closed.” He said he was not aware of any “critical incidents,” as of late Tuesday. The biggest problem, said Mr. Sinnott and David Mulvihill, the city’s director of public works, is that dozens of vehicles had been abandoned in the streets after they got stuck. “They just leave the car there,” Mr. Mulvihill said in a telephone interview. Officials said they had tapped city employees from across departments to help plow during 12- to 16-hour shifts. Officials from Pittsburgh, about 130 miles south of Erie, have offered to send equipment and personnel if needed, they said. “It’s all hands on deck here,” Mr. Mulvihill said. “We got blasted, but we’re keeping up with it.” Erie declared a snow emergency, and officials urged residents to stay off the streets. Mr. Sinnott and Mr. Mulvihill both said they were grateful the storm arrived during a holiday, when schools and many businesses were already closed.

Leigh Anderson,"The morning after a big snowfall here in Brooklyn, us city-dwellers always awake to the same awful, desperate noise: The sound of a million New Yorkers trying to pull their cars out of parking spaces that haven’t been adequately shoveled out. This means an ongoing high-pitched whirring of tires and revving of engines, sometimes for hours, while I lie with the pillow over my head and pray that they run out of gas or otherwise somehow explode. It is for these people, these determined tire-spinners, that I called the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, New Hampshire to talk to Real New Englander And Car Guy™ Eric Rollins, the director of maintenance for the Speedway, for advice on how to rock one’s car out of a snowbank. He took time out of his day of prepping the Speedway for the big storm and offered some good advice for the tire-spinners and the inexperienced winter drivers among us. Be Prepared in the First Place “You should have good tires,” said Rollins. Examine them before the snow hits (this might be too late for you for this storm) and check that the tread isn’t worn. “Check the air pressure in the tires—they should be inflated to the proper level. Make sure your anti-freeze is good, your fan belts are good, and pack a blanket and jumper cables,” preferably one with a battery pack so you don’t need another car for a jump. Rollins recommends asking the mechanic to check everything out when you have your oil changed, and to remember to fill up on gas. “If you get stuck and your car runs at least you can stay warm.” The QueerCents blog has a primer on how to winterize your car including this neat penny trick: Read more Read Get Ready to Dig If your tires are spinning, “the first thing you should do is have a shovel,” said Rollins. “And probably a little kitty litter.” There’s no way around it: If you’re stuck in the snow, “the only way to get out is to move the snow.” Rollins recommends carrying a shovel, the kitty litter, and tire chains (here’s a handy video guide to installing tire cables —which ideally you should have on your tires before you’re stuck). If you can’t get any traction, shovel away more snow and scatter kitty litter, sand or dirt in front and in back of the tires. You can also use a board or one of the floor mats as a wedge behind the tires. Rock If you’re almost out, and are too lazy to get out and shovel, you can try to rock your car out of the snow. If you have a manual transmission, Rollins says, “Put it in first gear and let the clutch out. When it goes forward, push the clutch in, reverse, and and let it roll back and repeat the process.” Eventually, hopefully, you’ll get enough rocking momentum going to clear the snow in front of you. Need a tutorial for an automatic? Check out this helpful video: Use Your Common Sense For good measure, Rollins also offers some icy-driving tips for those of us who learned to drive before there were anti-lock brakes: Basically, if you start to skid, stay calm and keep a steady pressure on the brakes. “When you step on the brakes and they start to chatter, hold your foot firmly on the brake pedal and steer where you want to go.” Don’t pump the brakes or jerk the wheel. Rollins said he himself learned this only four years ago, as part of his firefighter training; people who learned to drive some decades ago might be conditioned to pump the brakes when they start to slide. Rollins also points out that nothing is going to help you at 100 miles an hour, though—and offers a reminder to drive at safe speeds and keep an adequate distance between cars. My Vermonter relatives often tell me that four-wheel drive or tire chains don’t allow you to go fast, they just allow you to go, so be cautious if you must drive in the snow, especially if you’re not used to it. And if you park on my street tonight? Please remember to pack a shovel.","The morning after a big snowfall here in Brooklyn, us city-dwellers always awake to the same awful, desperate noise: The sound of a million New Yorkers trying to pull their cars out of parking spaces that haven’t been adequately shoveled out.

Andrew Freedman,"The ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday exceeded weather forecasters' expectations in nearly every way. It dumped more than a foot of snow on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including 16 inches in Islip, Long Island, and flooded parts of downtown Boston with a storm surge that sent water rising to historic levels. The storm got its name for the process known as bombogenesis, which describes a storm whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained On Thursday, the bomb cyclone intensified by 59 millibars in 24 hours, which is the fastest rate ever observed in any other winter storm along the East Coast since at least 1976, according to data from David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, and Andrea Lang, an assistant professor at the University of Albany. Lang said that research by her and Hannah Attard, a doctoral student in her research group, found 1,218 cyclones that originated north of 30 degrees North latitude and met the bombogenesis criteria in the Northern Hemisphere between 1980 and 2015. This indicates that meteorological bombs, so to speak, aren't that rare. ""What is uncommon is the rate of deepening for the 4 January cyclone,"" Lang said in an email. ""If you filter all 1218 cyclones that meet the 'bomb' criteria for those that occurred in a box just off the East Coast (60-80˚W and 30-55˚N) we find 23 'bomb' cyclones in the 1980-2015 reanalysis data."" ""This storm would be the new number 1 in terms of 24 hr mean sea level pressure fall... for storms on our list,"" she added. The intensification rate isn't just a bit of trivia for weather geeks, either. It had implications for the storm's impacts, primarily by accelerating the storm's winds. Winds gusted to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across Cape Cod and the Islands, and high winds raked everywhere from the Carolinas to Nova Scotia. This occurred because air was rushing in toward the center of the storm in response to the rapid drop in air pressure. Such winds helped drive the storm surge flooding that created so many problems in New England, too. The satellite imagery taken of the storm clearly shows how intense it became, as it even sported an eye-like feature near its center. Meteorologist Jeff Frame annotated an image to show all the meteorological features it revealed. There are many reasons why this storm intensified so quickly and significantly, with a minimum pressure eventually dropping to levels more typically seen in Category 2 or 3 hurricanes. For one, there were tremendous contrasts in air masses between cold, dry Arctic air pouring in from the northwest, and moisture-rich subtropical air streaming north over the Atlantic. ""There are several factors that contribute to the intensification of all cyclones, all of these factors were on the extreme side for this event,"" Lang said. ""All extratropical cyclones, which includes storms like nor'easters, form on boundaries between cold and warm air. However, not all nor'easters form when there is record-breaking cold air already in place along the east coast,"" she said. ""In general terms, the magnitude and scale of the temperature contrast is an indicator of energy available for cyclone intensification."" Zoomed-in satellite image of the eye-like feature in the 'bomb cyclone' on Jan. 4, 2018. Image: noaa Lang said that the southern location of the initial storm, which spun up near the coast of Florida, added more energy to the mix. ""The fact that the cyclone formed as far south as it did allowed the cyclone [to maintain] a link to the subtropics (nicely shown in the satellite imagery),"" she said. ""The subtropical link provided the cyclone with a source of fuel, in the form of water vapor, that fed the large field of precipitation and enhanced the storm strength."" While many of the East Coast's most memorable snowstorms also underwent bombogenesis, there was nothing typical about this particular weather bomb. And that's why satellite images of it have been saved to weather geek's hard drives, (and set as my new desktop background.) This storm was a beast, and looked absolutely gorgeous from space.","The ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday exceeded weather forecasters' expectations in nearly every way.

Andrew Freedman,"The fourth coastal storm in three weeks to hammer the Eastern Seaboard appears likely to form early next week, potentially delivering yet another crippling snowstorm to millions from the Mid-Atlantic to New England. Unlike the previous storms, this one is going to form further to the south, putting the Washington, D.C. area, along with coastal Maryland and Delaware, into play. We're sure they're thrilled to be included. The nor'easter continues to show up in projections from all the most reliable computer models, including the American model, known as the Global Forecast System or GFS, and the European Model, or ""Euro."" Other models, including one run by our Canadian neighbors, also depict the event. SEE ALSO: Third nor'easter in 2 weeks to slam New England: What's going on here? However, each of these model projections differs in important details that will ultimately determine who gets accumulating snow, who gets slop, and who gets heavy rain. Computer model projection for Wednesday March 21, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The most confident of all the storm impacts is that it will be a slow-mover, spinning off the coast of the Mid-Atlantic and moving to the northeast from Tuesday through Thursday. This will bring the threat of high onshore winds, battering waves, and coastal flooding to the beaches of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey. There's added uncertainty about whether the storm will move close enough to southern New England to result in another round of accumulating snow and coastal flooding there, but that is a possibility. If this storm follows a track that socks the D.C. area with heavy, wet snow and then slams the Philadelphia area, New York City, Hartford, and Boston, it would be a remarkable feat in a month that is already going down in the books in some areas as one of the snowiest Marches on record. Though snow fans in the DC area have had one of the most disappointing winters on record there, with fewer than 5 inches of snow falling all season so far. Parts of the Berkshires, Green and White Mountains have picked up nearly 100 inches of snow in the past 2 to 3 weeks alone, with about 5 feet at Snowshoe resort in West Virginia, too. But while the ski areas are rejoicing at this late season bounty, millions are getting tired of shoveling out their driveways, enduring power outages, and clearing up tree damage from their property. To them, another storm is not exactly good news. The string of storms is the result of a combination of factors that meteorologists observed as they moved into place in February. Computer models of the next storm show a familiar scenario of a large dip, or trough, in the jet stream carving out a slow-moving storm system across the East next week. The storm will be effectively stuck in place, hemmed in by a blocking pattern over the North Atlantic and Greenland, consisting of an area of high pressure in the mid-to-upper atmosphere. Such blocking patterns tend to be prerequisites for big East Coast snowstorms, because they help disturbances embedded in different branches of the jet stream to come together, or ""phase,"" creating a major storm system. Other factors – including a displaced polar vortex, record negative North Atlantic Oscillation index, and climate pattern in the tropics that favors more storminess – help explain why the East Coast is having such a hard time letting winter go. Differences between computer models in projecting the evolution of the midweek storm have to do with how and when weather disturbances phase, as well as the precise track of a low pressure area along the coast. Computer models will likely jump around through the weekend as they try to get a better handle on the ingredients for the storm, potentially resulting in big changes to the forecast.","The fourth coastal storm in three weeks to hammer the Eastern Seaboard appears likely to form early next week, potentially delivering yet another crippling snowstorm to millions from the Mid-Atlantic to New England.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The massive, dangerous bomb cyclone that barreled into the central United States this week hit as hard as its name would imply on Wednesday, CNN reported, with law enforcement officials in some areas forced to take shelter instead of assisting motorists involved in collisions.
This particular storm began far west, where moisture from the Pacific headed into the Southwest. As it pushed into the Central U.S., it grew in strength and its pressure dropped dramaticallya phenomenon known as explosive bombogenesis, hence the term bomb cycloneas it cycled moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico into contact with freezing air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. This particular phenomenon normally does not happen inland, and is more common on the East Coast.
Per CNN, an estimated 1,100 motorists were stranded throughout Colorado, with Wellington Fire Protection reporting a single incident in which 100 vehicles were involved in a pileup on Interstate 25. On the streets of Denver, some 125 accidents were reported. A Colorado State Patrol corporal was struck by a vehicle in Weld County while assisting another motorist who had driven off Interstate 76, losing his life.
Snowfall in parts of Colorado closed in on 20 inches as of 10:45 p.m. local time, according to ABC 7, though totals were wildly variable across the state.
While Colorado is one of the hardest-hit areas, the winter storm is huge and has caused hurricane-force winds over a massive area, with a train actually derailing in the northeastern New Mexico town of Logan, CNN wrote:
The storm is bringing hurricane winds to the Rockies and as far away as Amarillo, Texas. Winds gusts equivalent to Category 1 and 2 hurricane winds were reported at the Denver International Airport and in Colorado Springs, the National Weather Service.
In New Mexico, heavy winds contributed to the derailment of a 26-car train near the village of Logan, according to a tweet from state police. No injuries were reported.
78 mile per hour winds were reported as far south as Dallas, the Washington Post wrote, where an Amazon warehouse near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had its roof shorn off. A record-setting 80 mph gust was reported at Denver International Airport, which was shut down for the vast majority of air traffic.
The weather is finally settling down in New Mexico, KQRE reported, though gusting winds were the biggest problem on Wednesday. Los Alamos Police Commander Preston Bellew told the station that I know guys who have lived and worked here their whole lives and they have not seen the powerful winds, snow drifts, and the snow all in such a short period of time.
Heavy snow was reported in northern Colorado, including Denver, western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming, central South Dakota, and southeastern North Dakota, according to Accuweather. Blizzard conditions remained a danger in the northeastern part of Colorado as of late Wednesday night.
There is a considerable risk of flooding as precipitation continues and snow melts in the Midwest and Great Plains regions. There is also a risk of avalanches in mountainous regions that received heavy snowfall.
The South is not being spared, either. The Storm Prediction Center wrote that parts of the Mississippi River Valley, including eastern Arkansas, southwest Tennessee, and the northwest corner of Mississippi would be considered at enhanced risk for severe weather as the storm moves east, the Post noted. The paper added that reports indicate severe thunderstorms may still occur on a cold front stretching from Mississippi and Alabama to Southern Michigan on Thursday. According to CNN, the storm is forecast to rapidly intensify overnight east of the Colorado Rockies and bring extreme weather to the Midwest on Thursday.
By late on Thursday, however, the storm is expected to weaken considerably on its route towards northeastern Canada (where it will end up on Friday). States in the East should expect some rain.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Photo Braving the elements in West Stockbridge, Mass., last week. The Northeast found itself dealing with another winter storm on Wednesday. Credit Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle, via Associated Press John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the winter storm in the Northeast United States, the second to hit the region in less than a week. Ask your questions by emailing storms@nytimes.com. If it’s cold, how can there be climate change? That’s a common question — one asked, in various ways, by the president of the United States. But it’s based on a fallacy. Weather is not climate. Weather refers to day-to-day conditions; climate is about long-term trends. And the long-term trends show a planet that is warming, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Even with occasional Arctic blasts of bitter cold, which we’ve seen in much of the United States in recent years, 2017 had the second-highest surface temperatures ever recorded, surpassed only by 2016 — which was the third “hottest year” in a row. The trends are clear, even if you can make a snowball in March in Central Park. Really, though — is there some connection between climate change and this cold weather? Scientists have been looking at phenomena like cold spells, which occur when air from the Arctic dips south. After all, the Arctic is warming as a result of climate change, and that appears to be weakening the jet stream, which tends to hold that cold air up toward the top of the world. As Marlene Kretschmer, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told The Times in January, the connection is not yet fully established. “There’s a lot of agreement that the Arctic plays a role, it’s just not known exactly how much,” she said. “It’s a very complex system.” The weather report shows temperatures in the mid-30s or higher in some regions. How can it snow if the temperature is above freezing? The temperature near the ground is above freezing, but up in the clouds, where the snow forms, it’s well below freezing. Falling through the warmer air, however, can have an effect on the snowflakes, which may partially melt and clump together on the way down. Newscasters keep calling this storm “Quinn.” Is naming winter storms new? Relatively speaking, yes. The Weather Channel began naming storms in 2012. Not everyone approves, including my colleague Henry Fountain, who had this to say in January about the winter storm that was given the unfortunate name “Grayson.” My regular tweet to ignore the Weather Channel's name for this storm. It serves no useful purpose and is simply a marketing ploy. Plus this particular name is especially god-awful. — Henry Fountain (@henryfountain) Jan. 4, 2018 What’s the deal with buying toilet paper and milk? Good Seinfeld impression! The question is why do people slam the grocery stores before a storm for supplies like toilet paper and milk? At least if you get eggs, too, you can make French toast.

Andrew Freedman,"A major developing storm is taking shape along the Mid-Atlantic coast, and it's proving to be quite the illusionist. Residents of New York City woke up to a mixture of light rain and snow, and questioned whether the storm forecast was a ""bust."" But computer model guidance has been consistent in showing extremely heavy snowfall moving into the Philadelphia metro area, northern New Jersey, New York City, and then up into Connecticut and Massachusetts beginning Wednesday afternoon. This will occur as the storm ""bombs out,"" or undergoes the process of rapid intensification known as bombogenesis. SEE ALSO: What is bombogenesis? In other words, the storm's effects as of Wednesday morning are not WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), to use an old school internet term. Instead, it's trying to lure folks into a false sense of complacency, draw them into work or school, and then make the evening commute impossible. Model projections, for example, show an unusually strong signal for thundersnow across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast associated with this storm. In meteorologist-speak, this storm has strong dynamics associated with it. In normal person vernacular, that means this storm means business, and will bring surprisingly heavy rates of snowfall once it gets going in earnest by early to mid-afternoon in the big cities. The snowfall forecast has been a major challenge, particularly in New York and Boston, where relatively mild air from the ocean could keep snow from sticking or turn precipitation over to rain for a time. However, dynamical cooling from strong lifting of the air aloft and heavy precipitation dragging down cooler air from above should overcome milder temperatures in most areas. That happened in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday night, when rain suddenly switched over to big, fat flakes of snow and stinging sleet accompanied by thunder. Consider, though, the snowfall forecast for New York, where media outlets and the Weather Service are expecting a big difference in accumulations between JFK International Airport in Queens, which is right on the ocean, and Central Park. The Weather Channel, for example, has been predicting 12 to 18 inches will fall in Central Park, while just about 6 inches will fall at JFK, which is located only about 15 miles. Finally, here is a huge warning sign for later. This morning we are seeing significant CAPE values and convective lifting in the mid levels. If this translates this afternoon in precipitation rates, you have 3""+ snowfalls over these regions. pic.twitter.com/EdbhA9KDdw — NY NJ PA Weather (@nynjpaweather) March 7, 2018 The fact that forecasters can now zero in on transition zones with such precision is an example of how far meteorology, aided by powerful computing technology, has come in recent years. However, poor communication of large forecast ranges has led to some media headlines that ruffled feathers in the meteorology community, since large ranges in forecast accumulations is not the same as saying ""we just don't know."" The storm presents a major communications challenge for weather forecasters to make clear that the evening commute in major cities could be downright impossible due to heavy snowfall rates. During past storms, New York City has ground to a sudden halt once snowfall rates reached 2 to 3 inches per hour for even just a couple of hours, putting lives in danger and complicating commutes of all kinds. Similar events in Washington, D.C. have proven that storms involving a benign morning commute followed by a harrowing evening commute can result in stuck cars and commuters overnight. New York City's public schools remained open on Wednesday, for example, suggesting that the authorities may have underestimated the storm's potential to cause havoc. ⚠️ NYC Public Schools will be open tomorrow, Wednesday, March 7, 2018. Afterschool programs will continue as planned. Field trips using yellow bus service will be cancelled. https://t.co/6IAR8fbZYB — NYC Public Schools (@NYCSchools) March 6, 2018 This storm is striking New England right on the heels of an even stronger and slower-moving storm that battered the region beginning on March 1. Coastal flooding from that storm caused serious damage in eastern Massachusetts, including breaching seawalls, weakening coastal homes, and flooding numerous homes and businesses. While this storm won't be as bad, coastal flood warnings are in effect for eastern Massachusetts, as strong onshore winds will ensure that a remarkably prolonged period of flooding continues. In addition, thousands of people still don't have their power back after the previous storm, either, and this event will bring even more wet snow that could take out trees and power lines. This could extend power outages — particularly in inland areas that pick up the most snow — from days to more than a week. This is a developing storm and story.

Andrew Freedman,"In a typical winter, residents of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast might see one or two big storms, known in the region as nor'easters, because of the strong northeasterly winds that accompany them. This winter, however, is not ordinary. The second in what may turn out to be a string of three back-to-back nor'easters is set to hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast starting late Tuesday night, and lasting into Wednesday night. Like the last storm that brought damaging winds, coastal flooding, and heavy rain and snow, this one will also have its array of hazards. SEE ALSO: Photos and videos show historic flooding, damage from intense nor'easter First, it has more cold air to work with, making snow the predominate precipitation type, especially along and just to the northwest of Interstate 95.

The storm could slow efforts to restore electricity to hard hit areas that lost power in the last storm. The forecast details still need to be worked out, but even the big cities of Philadelphia, New York, Hartford, and Boston, are likely to see at least some accumulating snow from this storm — although a rain/snow mix is possible for a time. Computer models had been showing this storm threat for about the past week, giving meteorologists higher than average confidence in calling for a significant event. Models are also hinting at a third storm to come late this weekend, which, if it were to occur, would make for an incredibly rare string of powerful storms in a part of the country that had seen relatively quiet and unusually mild weather since January.

This pattern includes a potent area of high pressure parked near Greenland, serving as a ""block"" to weather systems trying to move northeast, and out to sea. In addition, a see-saw pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic that meteorologists keep track of, known as North Atlantic Oscillation, or NAO, currently favors stormy weather.

Adam Rosenberg,"Parts of the Southeastern United States woke up to a most unusual sight on Wednesday morning: Snow and ice. The icy onslaught came from the incipient stages of a rapidly intensifying storm that threatens to set off a ""meteorological bomb"" as it creeps north through Wednesday night, but it's already making history in the South. Regions of the U.S. that aren't accustomed to seeing snowy weather are bracing for record-setting accumulation. SEE ALSO: People are losing their minds over historic Southern snowstorm In Tallahassee, a Florida city that hasn't seen any snow in decades, a measurable (if small) amount was visible on Wednesday morning. The 0.1 inches of accumulation might seem like nothing to a northerner, but it was more than enough in Tallahassee to prompt a warning from local police. The nearby Gulf Coast of Louisiana has also gotten a rare taste of snow and freezing rain, thanks to the unusual Arctic air mass in place ahead of the storm.

But the storm's historic impact will be well-established by then. The storm's unusually heavy impact on southern states is the product of a powerful and long-lasting Arctic blast that brought cold air much further south than is normal. We've already seen much heavier snowfall in the U.S. this winter, as recently as last weekend's lake-band effect-prompted inundation of Erie, Penn., but this storm's relatively light accumulation in the Southeast is no less history-making.

Andrew Freedman,"An unusually powerful storm is threatening the East Coast of the U.S. this week with heavy snow, high winds, and record-shattering cold not seen in some places since the early 20th Century — if at all. The storm will be the result of a combination of three strong pieces of atmospheric energy, known to meteorologists as shortwaves. Think of these shortwaves as protein bars for storm formation. This particular storm, which is already beginning to form off the coast of Florida, will devour enough of them to allow it to become so powerful that it will contain hurricane force winds by the time it moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast late Wednesday night. SEE ALSO: Niagara Falls is a frigid, beautiful wonderland right now Because of the cold air in place ahead of the storm, winter storm watches and advisories for this event have been issued as far south as Florida, all the way northward to Massachusetts, which is nearly unheard of. In fact, some computer model runs show that the storm could intensify far faster than what would be required for the tempest to be known as a weather 'bomb,' for a process called ""bombogenesis."" This term refers to a low pressure area whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. By feasting off of intense atmospheric disturbances as well as differences in air masses and ocean temperatures, including the moisture rich Gulf Stream waters, the upcoming tempest is projected to exceed that intensification rate by several more millibars in 24 hours. This intensification rate, if it comes to pass, would be astonishing. Some computer models are projecting a minimum central air pressure of below 950 millibars at its peak, which would be nearly unheard of for this part of the world outside of a hurricane. For comparison, Hurricane Sandy had a minimum central pressure of about 946 millibars when it made its left hook into New Jersey in 2012. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections show that this storm is likely to reach a peak intensity that is rarely seen off the East Coast, with a minimum central air pressure of about 950 millibars. This is comparable to the air pressure measured in a Category 3 hurricane. Storm track is key The big question concerns the storm's track. As of Tuesday morning, most computer model projections and human-made forecasts showed it heading just far enough out to sea to spare all but Cape Cod and the Canadian Maritimes from a punishing blow of heavy precipitation, damaging winds, and coastal flooding. Animation of projected satellite imagery, showing the explosive storm development along the East Coast. This is NAM 3KM model data. Image: tropicaltidbits However, even a 50-mile shift westward in the storm track, which is entirely plausible at this point in the game, would put Boston in the crosshairs for potential blizzard conditions, and a 100-mile shift — which is also within the realm of possibility, would put New York City in play. The forecast trend through midday Tuesday has been to move the track slightly to the west, given forecasters in New York, Philadelphia, and Connecticut heartburn. As of Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service was forecasting 2 to 4 inches of snow in New York City from this storm on Wednesday night through Thursday, but such amounts may have to be raised dramatically if the storm shifts west, and conversely if there's an eastward shift. The track of the storm depends on the subtle interactions between the two pieces of energy diving southeastward from the Pacific Northwest, as well as energy from the southern branch of the jet stream. Even with supercomputers and other modern assets at their disposal, forecasting storms such as this one still tests meteorologists' ability to anticipate what the capricious atmosphere will do. Nova Scotia is likely to take a direct hit from this storm on Friday, with widespread power outages from hurricane force winds, along with heavy snow, heavy rain, and battering waves. This could be a storm for the record books there, as well as Downeast Maine, again depending on the exact track of the low pressure area. Stupid-level cold follows this storm Even if the storm leaves a fluffy 3 to 4 inches of snow in New York and Philadelphia, rather than a crippling blizzard with snow measured in feet, it is still going to have one dangerous impact that is quite certain to occur in those locations. The heart of cold air over North America and parts of the Arctic is currently parked over Hudson Bay, Canada. Temperature departures from average projection from the Euro model for Saturday morning, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell The enormous circulation around this storm is likely to drag this cold air down behind it, as if the low pressure area itself is reaching around and slapping New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Washington, D.C. residents right in the face. How rude. The cold weather that will result is going to be more frigid than anything that residents of the Midwest and East Coast have experienced so far during what has been an unusually intense and long-lasting cold snap. Instead of breaking daily temperature records, as dozens of cities have been, all-time cold temperature records will be threatened on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. For example, the high temperature in New York City may not get above the single digits on Saturday, with overnight lows in the metro area plunging below zero. Forecast record cold high temperatures on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018. Broken records indicated by circles. Image: nws/weatherbell Record low temperatures that have stood for decades or longer could fall, and infrastructure from home water pipes to city water mains and fire hydrants could fail in such cold. As former Weather Service meteorologist Gary Szatkowski explained via Twitter on Tuesday morning, areas that don't get much snow from this storm, but that do get into the heart of the cold air mass, could have more infrastructure problems since snow cover acts as an effective insulator to the ground below it. For people venturing out into the cold this weekend, frostbite will be a risk on any exposed skin within minutes of being outside, particularly on Friday night, as gusty winds whip across the Northeast behind the storm. The good news, however, is that there are signs of a ""warm up"" toward more average temperatures in the Midwest and East by early to midweek next week.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Nearly half the flights at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and around a quarter of the flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were called off. The Newark airport also sidelined its AirTrain because of high winds and replaced it with shuttle buses. • More than 200,000 people were without power in Virginia, Dominion Energy reported, mostly in the northern part of the state. Forecasters were warning that other parts of the East Coast might lose power, too. • The National Weather Service said coastal flooding from high seas and storm surge could impact areas from New Jersey to Massachusetts, and warned of inland flooding from the heavy rains. • New York City and Long Island can expect heavy rain — an estimated two to three inches — and some snow mixed in, but the biggest concern will be the damaging winds in the afternoon and evening. Read more in New York Today. • Some communities in Massachusetts, including Scituate and Newburyport, urged residents to evacuate ahead of the storm. The state’s governor, Charlie Baker, warned Friday’s storm could be more severe than the Jan. 4 storm that brought historic flooding to the city. Another ‘bomb cyclone’ is expected. The dire warnings prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Governor Baker of Massachusetts said he had called in the National Guard. The Jan. 4 storm gained much attention in part because some meteorologists described it as a “bomb cyclone.” (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Meteorologists say the pressure in the center of this weekend’s storm will plummet so fast that it, too, is likely to become a bomb cyclone. Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Taunton, Mass., said the storm was essentially an area of low pressure that was moving northeast — strengthening and spiraling before it comes to a halt for about two days. While the system spins north, the strong winds will whip out around it, Ms. Buttrick said, churning up the seas and adding to the conditions that, along with “astronomically high tides” and other factors, could create the catastrophic flooding. Video The rising waters are looking ‘really bad’ near Boston. At Revere Beach, north of Boston, the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean was churning up on the shore on Friday morning, and threatening to flood homes and businesses along the beach. “The water is bad, really bad,” said Fernando Loaiza, the manager of Antonia’s restaurant. Motorists were inching slowly along the boulevard that runs the length of the beach. All along the Massachusetts coast, residents were bracing for high tides. Combined with buffeting winds, seas were expected to surge beyond the record-breaking levels of the Jan. 4 storm, which caused major damage. Already, high winds have taken down trees and branches, hurling them across train tracks and stalling subway and commuter trains, and power losses have been reported across the region. Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood and Katharine Q. Seelye from Boston; Matt Stevens and Alexandra S. Levine from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN)A series of storms moving across the country will bring significant snow and ice to the north and heavy rains to the south Friday and into the weekend. 
Roughly 100 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
The storm is already affecting travel with nearly 450 flights canceled as of Friday morning, according to FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers traveling in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Major metro areas on the East Coast likely will face light snow Friday ahead of and during the morning commute. The storm should move so quickly that accumulations are expected to remain low in New York and Boston.
The second storm is associated with the same upper-level energy as the West Coast storm that has dumped inches of rain in cities such as Los Angeles and caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Snow is likely in places like Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago
The second storm exits the Rockies and will begin to drop snow late Friday across Kansas. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of last week's storm -- will see less accumulation with this system. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will help enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could see through the weekend. Both could see over half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, inches of snow to the north and ice and snow across the central portions of the states. 
Significant icing event is possible along I-95 corridor through New England
The second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. It's unclear on the timing of what type of precipitation is expected for metro areas in the Northeast.
This situation is reminiscent of an event earlier in the season when forecast models were showing warmer air leading to little or no snow totals. The models all came true, except in New York, where the colder air spilled in and inches of snow caught many New Yorkers by surprise. 
CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm in November was more difficult to forecast because it was early in the season when the models are just beginning to run winter equations, and the actual air profile doesn't act like winter yet. 
""Now that we are in the middle of winter the models should do better with this storm."" 
The latest model forecast indicates places such as Boston and New York will see snow starting Saturday evening, which will then turn into more of a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. New York is likely to warm up enough to see rain Sunday morning. But even if some precipitation doesn't freeze on contact Sunday, it will freeze by Sunday evening when the temperatures plummet. 
Similar to the November storm, there is a steep gradient between rain, ice and snow. Meaning close to the coast people could see rain, a few miles inland freezing rain mix, a few more miles inland snow mix and then a few more miles away the snow starts piling up quickly. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up 6 to 12 inches deep (likely more) with some icing for added misery.
The I-95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will set up, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
A flash freeze is likely behind the storm
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough to see rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. That could happen so fast it would instantly freeze any remaining moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
The National Weather Service in Boston said it's expecting ""a roller coaster of temperatures through this portion of the forecast"" and ""a prolonged period of well below normal temperatures early next week."" 
Keep the hand warmers handy, because temperatures won't just be below average Sunday and Monday.
""For the most part, this winter the jet stream has traveled horizontally across the US. Sure, there have been some ups and downs, but nothing like what is to come,"" CNN's Myers said. 
""By next week the jet stream will flow from Fairbanks (Alaska) to Texas. So, for example, the following Saturday Anchorage will be 32 and Chicago will be 13."" 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

JULIA JACOBS,"And because Seattle residents are not accustomed to this sort of weather, people are going out of their minds, Professor Mass said. The supermarkets are getting stripped of all food.
In Portland, Ore., which has an average snowfall similar to Seattles, a winter storm warning stretches from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon, and the National Weather Service was forecasting from one to four inches. Up to six inches is expected in areas of higher elevation east of Portland.
Another storm that is predicted for Sunday is likely to keep snowfall totals climbing.
Farther south along the West Coast, heavy snow was expected from Californias northern coast to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, said Richard Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. About one to three feet of snow was forecast for the mountainous areas, with four feet likely to fall in parts of Yosemite National Park.
Unlike at Seattles low-lying terrain, the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada makes heavy snowfall common during the winter, Mr. Bann said. After a snowstorm last week, more than 120 visitors and staff members were stranded for five days at Montecito Sequoia Lodge in Kings Canyon National Park, where up to seven feet of snow fell, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Bann said the heavy snow and strong winds likely to hit the mountain range this weekend would make traveling in certain areas difficult to impossible.
The National Weather Service also warned that high winds could cause fallen trees, and that wind chills could reach 30 degrees below zero.","A fisherman looked out on Seattle, which was lost in a whiteout during a snowstorm on Friday.

Devin Coldewey,"There’s a lot about snow we don’t know. Where does it come from? Where does it go? What does it taste like? Admittedly there are tentative answers to these questions. But there are yet more complex ones like how exactly, on a microscopic level, snow melts in mid-air. That’s the focus of one project at NASA, the results of which are both practical and beautiful. Snow is a critical part of the weather system (did you know there’s a whole “cryosphere””), and the ways in which it forms and melts can help meteorologists predict, for example, the likelihood or severity of a storm. But it’s not enough to catch a flake in your hand and look closely. Like anything else, you need a mathematical model of a phenomenon in order to understand it properly. Jussi Leinonen has been working on this problem for years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “I got interested in modeling melting snow because of the way it affects our observations with remote sensing instruments,” he said in a news release. As you can imagine, it’s rather important for a rocket science lab to be able to understand and predict weather patterns. Leinonen’s contribution has been an exact model of how and why snowflakes melt — which types of flakes, at what temperatures, in what ways, and so on. The basic version is this: water collects in concave regions of snowflakes where it can stay liquid. Those little lakes expand, eventually covering the whole ice crystal and encasing the core, which also eventually melts. Sounds straightforward, but Leinonen’s model shows how this happens at an extremely detailed level with arbitrarily shaped snowflakes and clumps thereof. The 3D visualization of this process is remarkably beautiful, and more importantly seems to be correct. With an accurate model meteorologists can profile different snow and rain types, see how they perform in various conditions, and produce relevant details like how those differences would affect a radar image. No word on when we can get a screensaver of snowflakes melting with high precision. Leinonen published his research in the journal Geophysical Research.","There's a lot about snow we don't know.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"• Alternate-side parking rules are suspended for snow removal. Meters remain in effect. With 12 to 18 inches of snow in the forecast, the nor’easter was expected to break the record for the largest spring snowstorm in our history. The previous record, of 10 inches, was set on April 3, 1915. A little after midnight, the ruler in Central Park read 8.2. Your snow-shoveling experience may vary. The snow fell unevenly, dropping 11.7 inches in Bedford-Stuyvesant, 12 in Queens Village, 10 in Gramercy Park, and around 8.5 inches at both La Guardia and Kennedy. “But Staten Island won the lottery,” said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Port Richmond is waking up to 13.8 inches. Even though parts of the city saw higher snow totals “the record is still going to the April storm,” Mr. Maloit said. Central Park is used for the official city total because record-keeping there is more extensive and “because, let’s face it, when you think New York City, you think Central Park, not La Guardia or Kennedy,” he said. We did set one record yesterday, though. It was the most snow seen in New York on March 21. And you can take comfort in knowing you lived through a spring snowstorm and the fourth nor’easter in one month, a super extra rare occurrence. The National Weather Service found at least one other instance of four nor’easters taking place in one month — between Dec. 30, 1986, and Jan. 26, 1987 — but that was in the dead of winter.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Commuters in Brooklyn, New York City on Thursday morning A winter storm has caused travel chaos on the US north-east and is being blamed for up to 17 deaths. Over 3,000 US flights were cancelled and another 6,000 delayed on Thursday as snow falls on New York and New England, as well as eastern Canada. Boston could get up to 18in (45cm) of snow, while New York City is bracing for up 1ft, say forecasters. The storm, known as a ""bomb cyclone"", is expected to continue to affect eastern North America into the weekend. Media caption It snowed in Tallahassee, Florida, for the first time in 28 years Nearly 60 million people are in the path of the storm, with blizzard warnings in effect from Georgia to Maine in the US. Seventeen cold-related deaths have been reported across the US, according to the Associated Press news agency. Hurricane force winds of up to 60mph (95km/h) are expected to hammer the north-eastern US coastline. US railway operator Amtrak is running on a reduced schedule, and interstate buses are also being cancelled. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida. ""The situation has continued to deteriorate,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as he declared a state of emergency on Thursday. ""It's almost impossible to clear roads when you have those high wind gusts, because as soon as you clear the road the snow, the wind literally just brings the snow back on to the road."" Cars becoming stranded on the Long Island Expressway, he added, could cause a ""situation of life and death"" in which rescuers may be unable to reach trapped motorists. A ""bomb cyclone"" or ""weather bomb"" is an unofficial term for what is known as explosive cyclogenesis, according to BBC Weather. This occurs when the central pressure of a low pressure system falls by 24 millibars in 24 hours and can result in violent winds developing around the system. The winds can be strong enough to bring down trees and cause structural damage. The storm is forecast to undergo rapid cyclogenesis over the Atlantic Ocean throughout Thursday and into the weekend, and current projections show areas north of New York as having the highest risk of significant impacts from strong winds and heavy snow.

PATRICK McGEEHAN,"The proposed changes represent “a much stronger hand on the part of the airport in terms of setting operating standards,” Mr. Cotton said. He said the Port Authority would make “a stronger commitment to articulating performance standards and to enforcing them.” The new rule on flights bound for Kennedy when a winter storm is forecast is an unusual restriction, airline industry officials said. The managers at Kennedy may recommend the cancellation of flights scheduled to arrive when storm conditions are predicted to be severe. If an airline decides to launch a flight anyway, it will have to obtain an assurance from a terminal operator that a gate will be available when the plane touches down. That is a departure from standard practices, said Perry Flint, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, which represents airlines. In Europe, he said, airlines are required to have a landing slot, but not necessarily a gate, reserved at destination airports. Mr. Cotton said he was not aware of another airport requiring prior assurance that a gate would be available. That restriction is appropriate at Kennedy, he said, because so much of its traffic is long-haul flights from overseas. The need for it became apparent after Kennedy was overwhelmed in January with more planes arriving than some terminals could handle. In normal conditions, terminal operators and their airline tenants manage to get planes in and out of gates fast enough to keep up with the inbound traffic. But in the days after the snowstorm that swept up the East Coast on Jan. 4, frozen equipment and staffing shortages slowed operations and left some planes parked for hours without gate assignments. In some cases, the Port Authority had to send staircases and buses to rescue passengers from stranded planes. Mr. Flint said his transport association, which has a liaison stationed at the Federal Aviation Administration’s command center in Virginia, had agreed to help facilitate communication between international airlines and the Port Authority and terminal operators. “We look forward to working with the Port Authority and all stakeholders to collaboratively develop procedures based on industry best practices and expertise that will enhance the customer experience going forward,” Mr. Flint said in a statement. Inside two of the terminals at Kennedy in January, baggage-handling procedures broke down, leaving hundreds of pieces of luggage piled up in waiting areas. Some travelers did not get their bags back for days. To prevent a recurrence, Port Authority officials said they would require terminal operators to have a common baggage-service office for airlines that do not have their own. Mr. Cotton said the agency would impose this obligation “so a passenger who is looking for their bag has a clear place to go.” Huntley A. Lawrence, who oversees the airports for the Port Authority, said the agency also would take inventory of all of the equipment at the airport in case it needs to ask an airline to lend a spare piece, “so when you have a winter storm emergency, you’re not scrambling around.” The Port Authority’s primary responsibility in a winter storm is to clear snow and ice from the runways and taxiways. After the January storm, the Federal Aviation Administration said it would investigate how the Port Authority handled snow removal. Mr. Lawrence said he has not learned of the conclusion of that investigation, but the Port Authority has already decided to add snow-moving equipment. “We did see this winter a lot of heavy wet snow,” Mr. Lawrence said. “The heavy, wet snow is more difficult to move.” He said the agency would spend $3.5 million on four snow blowers and $1.4 million on four plows.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","I want to be writing this as little as you want to be reading it: We’re in for another nor’easter this week. If you live in the Northeast, you’re surely sick of the snow. If live anywhere else, you’re surely sick of hearing about it. And yet here we are, with a fourth nor’easter lining up to bring snow from Ohio to Maine midweek. Are we calling it a four’easter? Sure, great, why not. This week’s spirit crushing storm will start to take shape on Tuesday. That happens to be the first day of spring, thus definitively proving that nature has no chill. Two weather systems will collude for the latest bout of midweek misery. The first is an area of low pressure currently bringing snow and rain to the Midwest (and increasing the risk of tornadoes in the Southeast on Monday night!). The first flakes will fly in the Appalachians and parts of the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday. Snow will likely mix with rain nearer to the coast and thundersnow’s awkward cousin, thundersleet, is possible in the Washington, D.C. region according to Capital Weather Gang. But it’s all a precursor to the main event, which will shape up on Tuesday night as the second low pressure system builds in the Atlantic. That system will tap tropical moisture and thrive off a big dip in the jet stream. Couple it with the chill dropping out of the Midwest, and you’ve got a recipe for snow, which will likely become more widespread by Wednesday up and down the I-95 corridor. Right now, it’s looking like the Appalachians are in line for the biggest snow totals. Locations in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia looking at a foot or more of springtime snow. For coastal areas, there’s still some uncertainty about just how high the snow totals will get, but it looks like up to 6 inches of snow could fall in some locations east of I-95. It all depends on just how far northwest the storm tracks. Late last week, it was looking like the storm would stay further out to sea, reducing snow totals. But models have been trending toward higher snow totals for coastal New Jersey and New York, and Massachusetts, which, I’m sorry. It will also be of the heavy, wet variety, which is good for snowballs and a pain for shoveling. But hey, it’s not all bad news! Higher snowfall totals don’t necessarily mean blockbuster accumulations. Because the sun is at a higher angle than it was earlier this month, any snow that does fall should melt quicker. Astronomical tides are also much lower than they were when the first nor’easter hit way back [checks calendar] 17 days ago. That will lower the risk of coastal flooding substantially. This storm will also likely be less windy. The active streak of weather is being driven in part by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The negative phase of the NAO is characterized by a strong ridge of high pressure over Greenland that does two things to storms on the East Coast. First, it can cause low pressure systems to drop lower as they essentially attempt balance the atmosphere. Second, it can slow storms from leaving the region, which can cause snow and other impacts to pile up. The NAO started March in record low territory. It started climbing toward neutral before dipping over the past five days. While not near early March’s intensity, the negative NAO is almost certainly playing a role in this week’s sadness-inducing storm. By next week, the forecast indicates it could finally flip to neutral or even positive, which could spell the end (or at least a reprieve) from our nor’easter hell. The odds of a warm spring are also mercifully in our favor not just in the Northeast, but basically every corner of the country but the Northern Rockies. There could be just one other, tiny speed bump to get to the sweet release of heat, though. We could see another nor’easter this weekend.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"If the forecast holds, this could be the biggest spring snowstorm in our city’s history. New York City’s largest snowstorm after the vernal equinox was on April 3, 1915, when 10 inches fell. For those lamenting spring’s slow arrival, note that things could be worse. The latest in the season that New York had substantial snowfall was on April 25 (in 1875), when three inches fell on Central Park. And a trace fell on May 29, in 1995. This nor’easter is forecast to drop more snow on New York City than the previous storms this month, the last of which killed two people and left hundreds of thousands in the region without power. Power failures are possible throughout the day. Like earlier this month, we could see some thundersnow, and lots of sleet. What is sleet, exactly? “Sometimes what happens is that, in between a cloud that’s producing snowflakes and the ground, you get a layer of warm air,” Mr. Homenuk said. “The snowflake from the cloud melts into a raindrop in the warm layer, and then passes back into freezing air, and then it refreezes into like an ice pellet.” (Unlike freezing rain, which freezes after it hits the ground.) “When it’s sleeting, you will know,” he added. “Sleet stings. It pings you. It’s not as gentle as a snowflake.” Here’s what else is happening:","Wednesday: The latest on the storm heading toward New York City, and how it could affect your commute.",2018-03-21T09:43:28Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Spring Snowstorm,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/nyregion/new-york-snowstorm-spring.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/21/nyregion/21nytoday1/21nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
Andrew Freedman,"The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurricane force winds, to cement-like wet snow that will bring down trees and power lines. The storm will undergo bombogenesis, a process in which the minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. In general, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. The rapid drop in air pressure will kick up extremely strong winds, which will help bring air travel to a halt in some of the biggest cities in the country, from Boston to Washington, D.C., due to high winds and heavy precipitation. SEE ALSO: Dangerous storm targets Northeast, Mid-Atlantic with high winds, coastal flooding, inland snow Along the Massachusetts shoreline, coastal flooding is likely to exceed all of the benchmark floods of the past, including the Blizzard of 1978, and possibly the highest water level on record in Boston, which was set earlier this winter. Up and down the coast of eastern Massachusetts, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge on top of high astronomical high tides, coupled with angry seas with building waves, will do significant damage to shoreline infrastructure, including homes and businesses. A man walks through a flooded section of Brant Rock in Marshfield, Mass., on Jan. 4, 2018, as the afternoon high tide struck during the blizzard. Image: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images On Jan. 4 of this year, Boston saw its highest water level on record when the ""Bomb Cyclone"" hit the city. That storm flooded a subway station and shut down portions of the city. This event has the potential to do even more damage in the low-lying, coastal city. Communities to the north and south of Boston, will also see major coastal flooding on par with some of the biggest coastal storms on record. Cape Cod looks to be in line for some of the highest winds and waves, and its beaches are prone to erosion. Chart showing atmospheric spin at around 15,000 feet, depicting a closed upper level low south of New England, a telltale sign of an intense Nor'easter. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The overall weather pattern in which this nor'easter is forming is going to prevent the storm from skipping east, out to sea, quickly. This will heighten the storm's impacts, making coastal flooding last through multiple high tides, as east to northeast winds drive water ashore in Massachusetts, parts of Long Island, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. A sprawling, intense area of high pressure parked over Greenland is serving as a giant stop sign in the atmosphere, pinning storms like this close to the U.S. coast. Such a high pressure area is known as a ""Greenland block,"" and it's a prerequisite for producing a severe winter weather event in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Here's what to expect in the big cities of the Northeast, along with more details on the threat of heavy, wet snow making it all the way to the coast, which could spread power outage closer to highly populated areas. Computer model projection showing sea level pressure and winds just above the Earth's surface on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia: In these cities, heavy rain on Thursday night and Friday, along with extremely windy conditions on Friday will be the biggest impacts from the storm. Some coastal flooding is possible in the Philadelphia area as well. Wind gusts could exceed 60 miles per hour on Friday in the D.C. area, as the region will be located between the deepening low pressure area offshore and high pressure to the west, causing a wind tunnel effect. New York City: In New York, the official forecast is for a sloppy, messy, windswept rainstorm. The precipitation may mix with or change to snow at times, but any accumulations are highly uncertain at this time. It's possible that the storm will manufacture enough cold air through dynamical cooling to turn the rain to heavy snow late on Friday into Saturday morning, which would create a host of problems in the city and nearby suburbs, but this is not a high-confidence forecast scenario. Winds will gust to at least 50 to 60 miles per hour along the coast, and moderate to major coastal flooding is possible at high tides, which is also the case in coastal New Jersey. Storm surge of 3-5 feet with big wave action is no joke. Take this storm very seriously if you are at the coast. Major flooding is expected. And remember this flooding is for 3-4 straight tide cycles. pic.twitter.com/QvMx7dPRuB — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) March 1, 2018 Hartford, Connecticut: Heavy rain and snow is expected from late Thursday night through Saturday in Hartford. Snowfall amounts, however, hinge on how much temperatures cool down during the storm, with anywhere from 3 to 6 inches of snow to a foot of heavy, wet snow possible. Snowfall exceeding 3 inches could cause widespread power outages, given the weight of the wet snow on trees and power lines. The Halloween nor'easter of 2011 dumped about a foot of snow in Hartford, causing a weeklong power outage. Boston: The strongest winds, most severe storm surge, and historic coastal flooding all appear to be focused on Beantown and other locations in eastern Massachusetts. Winds could gust to hurricane force — 75 miles per hour — in the area, and a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and destructive waves are likely to produce historic coastal flooding in many areas during multiple high tides. [COASTAL FLOOD WARNING] 9 am Friday → 3 am Sunday; severe damage to shoreline structures; some homes may be destroyed; widespread inundation of coastal roads, basements; LIFE THREATENING SITUATION! Many neighborhoods may be at risk of being cut off for a time. pic.twitter.com/3IeOWcEilh — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 1, 2018 Like in New York City, there is also a wild card of precipitation type in Boston, with some computer models suggesting that heavy rain will change to accumulating snow on Friday night and Saturday, as the center of the storm drifts further to the south. The National Weather Service is using strong language to warn people about the likelihood of potentially historic coastal flooding from this nor'easter, calling it a ""LIFE THREATENING SITUATION."" A summary of talking points w/ the forecast high impact / long duration coastal storm. Please take this storm seriously! For those living along the coast, this is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation. Please heed the advice of local officials. pic.twitter.com/jOAMNeWSbl — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 1, 2018 It's not a coincidence that Boston may set back-to-back records for its highest water level in the same year. Coastal flooding is an increasing hazard in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in part because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Higher background sea levels make it easier for storm surges to break records and do more damage. This is similar to basketball players competing on a court with a steadily rising floor, making it easier for them to dunk. Over 40-feet significant wave height now forecast by ECMWF model for massive Nor'easter. Seas dramatically build in Friday unfortunately with long duration component of direction perpendicular to the coast. ( https://t.co/XcmEbEJxko ) The worst waves look to impact Bermuda, too. pic.twitter.com/7JSRoGYQWs — Ryan Maue | weather.us (@RyanMaue) March 1, 2018 Other noteworthy aspects of this storm: This nor'easter will churn the waters of the Western Atlantic, creating waves higher than 40 feet across a vast swath of the ocean, from Nova Scotia to Massachusetts, southward all the way to Bermuda. Just off the Massachusetts coast, waves may tower up to 35 feet, and some of the highest swells in years are likely well offshore. Any ships caught in its path could be in trouble, as high winds and waves present a serious hazard. Cruise ships in particular have had a habit recently of sailing directly into powerful East Coast storms, hopefully that won't happen again this time.","The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurr…",2018-03-01T20:28:13Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions",https://mashable.com/2018/03/01/noreaster-new-england-worst-coastal-flooding/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LhZYhGJ19GBNVsk3jSIjxNpx46E=/1200x630/2018%2F03%2F01%2Fa9%2Fe36ae33d5376495f8308a830613fdade.87678.jpg,mashable,Mashable,snow storm,1
Andrew Freedman,"A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast. The blizzard is the result of three distinct disturbances in the atmosphere as well as the intense contrast between the Arctic air mass in place across the East and a subtropical plume of moisture moving up the coast near the Gulf Stream. Non-tropical storms feed off air mass differences, along with upper level disturbances, and these ingredients are quickly coming together for a historically intense storm to form. SEE ALSO: A meteorological ‘bomb’ is set to go off along the East Coast, and dangerous cold will soon follow In fact, snow, sleet, and freezing rain is already underway across the Southeast, where the heaviest snowstorm on record is possible on Wednesday in Savannah, Georgia, and the first measurable snowfall in 28 years is falling in Tallahassee, Florida. Snow will overspread the region tonight/Thursday morning &amp; last most of the day. Heavy snowfall is possible around 9am to 4 pm w/ snowfall rates near 2 inches an hour. Travel may become difficult due to poor vsbys &amp; snow covered roads. Blowing &amp; drifting snow is also possible. pic.twitter.com/BSF9XzJj6f — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) January 3, 2018 While there are still nagging questions about the storm's exact track and evolution, it's clear that it will intensify at an explosive rate, potentially doubling the intensification rate needed to qualify for undergoing a process known to meteorologists as ""bombogenesis,"" which refers to a storm whose minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. This storm is projected to go from about 998 millibars on Wednesday morning to 950 millibars by midday Thursday, a plunge of 48 millibars in about 24 hours. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Storms of this intensity are extremely unusual in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin when compared to climate records during the past 30 years. Hurricane Sandy, which had tropical characteristics, ruling it out as a direct comparison, had a minimum central air pressure of 946 millibars when it made landfall in New Jersey in October 2012. Blizzard conditions to hammer Northeast, Carolinas Late Tuesday and into Wednesday, computer models have tended to move the storm track to the west, bringing the heaviest precipitation over the East Coast. So, what first appeared to be a glancing blow now promises to be a full-fledged blizzard in some locations. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for Boston on Thursday, where up to a foot of snow is expected to fall, accompanied by wind gusts to 70 miles per hour. Computer model projection of satellite imagery on Jan. 4, 2018, from the high resolution NAM model. Image: tropicaltidbits Blizzard warnings have also been hoisted for parts of the Carolinas, and more may be issued later Wednesday depending on the latest computer model data. Blizzard warnings for up to a foot of snow, along with howling winds and low visibility, include Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia, which is the largest naval base in the world. Blizzard warnings are extremely rare in this area. Near-blizzard conditions are also anticipated to affect coastal Rhode Island and Connecticut, along with Long Island, with perhaps the toughest snowfall forecast reserved for New York City and New Jersey. Some computer model projections show this region getting buried by a foot of snow, while others show a far less severe event, with just 4 to 7 inches of snow. It may take until late Wednesday for the forecast to be ironed out for the Big Apple, and even then the level of uncertainty may be unusually high. The local National Weather Service office in New York City said the following in a morning technical forecast discussion on Wednesday: As mentioned, this remains a fluid situation based on model spread, with potential for these numbers to go down, but still seems more so upwards based on model trends and mode of SREF/GEFS/ ECMWF ensemble members compared to operational runs. This higher trend is reflected in latest WFO /WPC snow probs, with high probs of greater than 6 inches of snow across E LI /SE CT and low to moderate probs to Hudson River. A significant jump in the reasonable worse case has also been noted, with 1 in 10 chance of seeing more than 12-16 inches of snow across much of LI /CT, 8 to 12 inches of snow across NYC/NJ metro to Hudson River, and 4 to 8 inches N &amp; W still in play. To try to reduce the forecast uncertainty, the National Weather Service is dispatching hurricane hunter research aircraft to fly a route around the Southeast U.S. today to drop instruments that will gather data on winds, humidity, pressure, and other parameters. This information will then be fed directly into the agency's computer models, potentially making their projections more reliable. In recent years, the Weather Service has flown such missions outside of hurricane season for high uncertainty, high impact events, and this one definitely qualifies. Ice chunks to exacerbate coastal flooding Because the storm will intensify so significantly, and so quickly, it will generate very strong winds. These winds — in some instances gusting to hurricane force of 75 miles per hour — will drive water toward the coast, particularly in southeastern New England, where moderate to major coastal flooding is expected during high tides on Thursday. Given the recent, unrelenting cold snap, one additional threat will come from the ice chunks that are clogging many harbors and portions of Cape Cod Bay. These chunks could cause damage to shoreline infrastructure, or worsen flooding in some cases. Farther out at sea, high winds will create towering waves, creating a major hazard to mariners caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why this low pressure area will become such a monster The storm will have every ingredient it needs to intensify into a blockbuster. First, it will have ample upper level support from three distinct disturbances in the fast-moving current of air known as the jet stream. Once these combine into one, powerful system, they will promote lifting of the air over the East Coast, which is essential to forming precipitation. Lift is also key to the formation of a surface area of low pressure, as well as its intensification. An animation from the North American Model, known as the NAM, shows the combination of the three disturbances and the formation of a deep trough, or dip, in the jet stream off the East Coast, with the low pressure area tucked into it. If the model projections prove correct, as they have been so far, this could be one of the strongest winter storms on record, at least for this part of the North Atlantic Ocean. Image: tropicaltidbits The storm, named winter storm Grayson by The Weather Channel, will also have the advantage of forming in an area off the Southeast coast where the temperature contrast between frigid, dry Arctic air, near-record-warm ocean waters, and comparatively moist subtropical air is at its maximum, allowing the low pressure area to feast off this contrast as if it were at an all-you-can-eat buffet. And as it moves northward up the coast, it will also sustain itself through the release of latent heat via the formation of thunderstorms and precipitation in the cold sector. Winter Storm #Grayson will act as a heat bomb in the atmosphere in response to all the deep convection associated with the cyclone. Watch how this coastal cyclone accelerates the upper-level irrotational wind field, building the downstream jetstreak. #Science is awesome. pic.twitter.com/6V45hgw3d8 — Michael Ventrice (@MJVentrice) January 3, 2018 The Gulf Stream will play a key role in allowing this storm to explosively intensify, experts say. ""Relationships between the ocean and atmosphere are complicated, especially as they relate to explosively developing extratropical cyclones (like the one currently in the forecast),"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, in a Twitter message. ""But the extreme thermal contrast between very cold atmospheric temperatures over land and an unusually warm nearby Gulf Stream certainly sets the stage for impressive storm-strengthening potential,"" he added. ""Ocean conditions are not the only factor at play (atmospheric conditions, like the position and strength of jet stream winds in the upper atmosphere, are also critical), but they’re definitely important."" Polar vortex to follow this beastly storm The winter storm will plow into the Canadian Maritimes on Thursday night, and behind it, the coldest air of the season will pour southward, into the East, from Greenland, Hudson Bay, and the Arctic. Map showing a piece of the polar vortex (in white) moving from Hudson Bay down into New England on Saturday, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell Technically speaking, the cold that will follow the blizzard is associated with part of the polar vortex, which is a circulation of air around the Arctic that plays a role in determining how cold winters are in North America, Europe, and Asia. Temperatures of 30 degrees Fahrenheit below average are expected on Friday and Saturday in the Northeast, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic, which will put all-time temperature records in jeopardy. Anyone that loses power during the storm will have to seek out heat elsewhere, as temperatures plunge well below zero at night, and barely recover above the single digits during the day. Even in New York City, the high temperature on Saturday may not climb much above 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and winds gusting to 30 miles per hour will make it feel far colder. Fortunately, this weekend appears to be the end of this extraordinarily long cold snap, as more seasonable temperatures return next week.","A remarkable storm system is now taking shape along the East Coast, threatening the major cities of the Northeast with near blizzard conditions and full-on polar vortex-related cold, while bringing historic snows to the Southeast.

Here’s what you need to know for your morning commute: • Subways and Long Island Rail Road are running with normal service. • Metro-North Railroad is running on a reduced schedule. The last Hudson Line train from the city will leave Grand Central at 7:59 p.m. • New Jersey Transit has implemented a limited weekday rail schedule and is cross-honoring tickets for rail, buses and private carriers, but not for PATH or NY Waterway ferries. Bus service in North and Central New Jersey may be suspended this afternoon. • Bridges and tunnels are open, and Seastreak and NYC Ferry are operating normally, but may experience delays. • A travel advisory is in effect for all areas east of Interstate 81, essentially, the entire eastern half of New York State. • Amtrak is operating on a modified schedule in the Northeast Corridor. • Check your flight at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark before you head to the airport. Around 500 flights have been canceled at the three airports so far. The storm should blanket the city unevenly, said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Northern Manhattan and the Bronx are expecting seven to 11 inches; Northern Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island should get seven to nine inches; and Southern Queens is looking at four to seven. “The other wrinkle is that there’s a slight chance of thunder this afternoon,” Mr. Maloit said. “If we get it, anyone who’s underneath the thunder snow could get a rate of two to four inches of snow an hour.” Generally, the snow is going to be heavy, wet and mixed with rain in some areas, Mr. Maloit added. (So pull on your winter boots and pack an extra pair of socks.) Wind gusts are expected to reach 45 miles an hour, well below the destructive gusts seen in Friday’s storm, when eight people were killed and more than two million were left without power. (More than 9,000 customers in the city and Westchester still don’t have power.) A costal flood advisory is in effect along Jamaica Bay. Gov. Andrew M.

Shannon Connellan,"The ""Beast from the East"" is getting worse, with Europeans experiencing more extreme winter weather on what was supposed to be the first official day of spring. The ""Beast,"" resultant from intense east to west winds from Siberia, has now combined with Storm Emma, causing the UK Met Office to issue another "" red"" warning for snow — the highest level — for parts of southwest England and South Wales. SEE ALSO: Bus narrowly dodges car on snowy road in nerve-shredding dashcam footage It's the second ""red"" warning this week but only the office's third since the system started in 2011. Tuesday's ""amber"" warning was upgraded due to widespread heavy snow and blizzard conditions caused by strong easterly winds. On Friday morning a ""yellow"" alert, which is the lowest level of alert, was in place for snow for pretty much the entirety of the UK, with additional warnings for ice in southern parts of the nation, and strong winds in Northern England and Wales. Pushing up from the south, Storm Emma was named by the Portuguese met service, and will continue to bring intense winds and heavy snow. Many European cities, including Dublin, Rome, London, Paris, Munich, Amsterdam, Venice, Edinburgh, and Glasgow and have been experiencing extreme weather. Just look at Dublin Airport, which tried to clear runways on Friday: People have been tweeting from their snowy locations, posting images and video of extreme weather within the last 24 hours.

Andrew Freedman,"A major nor'easter is taking aim at the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, bringing an array of life-threatening hazards, from hurricane-force winds to record-breaking coastal flooding. Based on current forecasts, it's clear that this storm is likely to be more damaging than the so-called ""Bomb Cyclone"" that struck in early January. Technically, the storm, like many winter storms in the Northern Hemisphere, will rapidly intensify once it gets going on Thursday night and Friday morning. During the course of 24 hours, its minimum central air pressure — a key measure of the storm's intensity — is expected to plummet by more than 24 millibars. This would be sufficient to qualify the storm as undergoing a process known as bombogenesis (which, incidentally would also make a great heavy metal band name). SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions By that standard, one could also call this storm a ""bomb,"" or even a ""bomb cyclone."" Some media outlets, like CNN, Mother Jones, and AccuWeather, are doing just that in their headlines, thereby reprising the name used for the fastest-intensifying winter storm ever observed off the East Coast. But there are major problems with this using this nomenclature in headlines about this storm. Computer model projection of sea level pressure and low-level wind speeds on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com When facing a major storm threat, it's important that the public focuses on the hazards they are likely to face. This storm is going to have a broader, more damaging footprint across a larger amount of real estate than the ""Bomb Cyclone"" did in January. Power outages from this storm, for example, are likely to spread from the Washington, D.C., area, northward to upstate New York, and eastward to Boston. In addition, many of the other impacts from this storm will exceed those of the January 4 storm, particularly when it comes to coastal flooding. The National Weather Service forecast office in Boston is using dire language to warn people of the flood threat, noting that this is a ""LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION"" along the coast, where record flooding is likely from a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and towering waves up to 35 feet high just offshore. The National Weather Service expects seas that may exceed 15.3 feet at the Boston Harbor tidal gauge, which would be an all-time record, beating the one set during the Jan. 4 ""Bomb Cyclone"" by about 2 inches. This is a rather incredible depiction. Bombs the low to ~972mb nestling it just south of the cape with a series of wind maxima/meso lows landfalling into Boston/Cape Cod. I hope folks have done what they can to prepare. pic.twitter.com/i35EQ0cHPU — Taylor Trogdon (@TTrogdon) March 1, 2018 Mashable was one of the first media outlets (along with the Washington Post 's Capital Weather Gang) to call the exceptional nor'easter in early January the ""Bomb Cyclone."" The storm dumped heavy snow across Southern New England, and set a record for the highest-recorded water level in Boston. The setup for this storm looks far worse, in part because it is going to be traveling slowly, exposing the Massachusetts coastline to major coastal flooding during at least three tide cycles, whereas the ""Bomb Cyclone"" was moving quickly when it struck. Another aspect of this storm that is different, and potentially far more destructive, is the type of snow it will produce. The ""Bomb Cyclone"" had plenty of Arctic air to work with, making the snow that fell on New England light and fluffy. This storm, however, will dump pasty, wet cement-like snow on upstate New York, and the higher elevations of Connecticut and Massachusetts. The weight of such snow on tree limbs and power lines tends to cause significant power outages. This event will be different from the January 4 storm in two big ways: more wave energy coming from offshore and THREE tide cycles instead of one and done. Both equate to increased damage potential. — Matt Noyes NBC10 Boston &amp; NECN (@MattNBCBoston) March 1, 2018 The bottom line is that if the media were to call this upcoming storm another ""Bomb Cyclone,"" as other outlets are starting to do, we would run the risk of confusing readers into thinking that the impacts of the storm and its characteristics will be the same. In many ways — from coastal flooding to the storm's wind and wave field, as well as the power outage footprint — this upcoming storm will be worse. Using the Internet-friendly ""Bomb Cyclone"" moniker here would be to the detriment of public understanding of this weather phenomenon. Yes, this storm will undergo bombogenesis. Yes, you could call it a ""bomb."" But it will likely end up being remembered for being even more damaging than the January storm.","A major nor'easter is taking aim at the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, bringing an array of life-threatening hazards, from hurricane-force winds to record-breaking coastal flooding.

Andrew Freedman,"Just like each of us has our own personality, each nor'easter is different, with its own idiosyncrasies and mood. The rapidly intensifying storm taking shape off the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England on Wednesday, for example, is unusually feisty, with a mean streak. For days now, computer models have locked onto the potential for an unusually widespread display of thundersnow — lightning produced during a snowstorm — due to the strong lift that this storm is going to produce from eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey northward across parts of New York State, on up into southern New England. SEE ALSO: Hang onto your butts as another nor'easter cripples travel, triggers thundersnow These signs have come in the form of meteorological products that are virtually indecipherable to the typical weather consumer, such as model forecast soundings and projections of how much ""convective available potential energy,"" or CAPE, will be present at times. But these indicators have been blinking red, signaling that very heavy precipitation rates, accompanied by lightning and thunder at times, is likely to occur on Wednesday into Wednesday night, potentially in big cities like Philadelphia and New York. The atmospheric lift associated with these storms is key to the forecast for the New York City area, because surface temperatures at the start of this storm have been above freezing at the coast. Thunderstorm outlook for March 7, 2018, showing thundersnow potential in Mid-Atlantic and southern New England. Image: noaa/spc. Meteorologists forecasting up to a foot of snow in New York are counting on a process known as dynamical cooling, initiated by intense precipitation, to turn the rain to snow and cause it to pile up quickly. In fact, if some of the model projections come to fruition, the evening commute could be crippled in the New York City area, as well as Philadelphia and parts of Connecticut. The ingredients for thundersnow are usually different compared to what cooks up a more common summertime storm. For example, summer storms typically form on warm, humid days, and snowstorms obviously lack such heating at ground level. But what they lack in heat they make up for in lift, specifically narrow layers of rapidly rising air. Such lifting is typically triggered by dynamics associated with rapidly intensifying storm systems like the one undergoing bombogenesis, or a process of rapid intensification, south of Long Island on Wednesday. It's this strong lifting, usually in a narrow layer of air below 25,000 feet, that generates thundersnow. Computer model runs show strong areas of lift, associated with the formation of fronts aloft, that will move across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Wednesday afternoon. Meteorologists on Twitter have been impressed by the thundersnow potential. Finally, here is a huge warning sign for later. This morning we are seeing significant CAPE values and convective lifting in the mid levels. If this translates this afternoon in precipitation rates, you have 3""+ snowfalls over these regions. pic.twitter.com/EdbhA9KDdw — NY NJ PA Weather (@nynjpaweather) March 7, 2018 Snowstorms tend to have flat, layered clouds, with most of the precipitation formed in the so-called snow growth layer at relatively low levels of the atmosphere. For thundersnow to occur, the right ingredients need to come together to lift some of these flatter clouds and mold them into protrusions that some meteorologists call turrets. Such turrets protrude like a fist above the the broad and flat layers of snow-producing clouds, driven to greater heights by lifting from approaching weather features. These weather systems may be a deep dip in the mid-level jet stream, known as a trough, that causes air to rise ahead of it, or ascend from the formation of frontal zones within storm systems, known by the fancy term ""frontogenesis."" Both of these factors are present in abundance on Wednesday. For example, this chart of mid-level frontogenesis shows a clear signal that this will occur over the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England during this storm. However, also making Wednesday's storm unique is the presence of an abundance of extremely cold air aloft, which will make it possible for vertically growing clouds to take on a shape that more resembles summertime thunderstorms than more typical thundersnow events. Such storms could produce more lightning than usual, and, as the Washington Post 's Capital Weather Gang noted, the possibility of hail falling at the same time as heavy snow. When the right conditions are present, these turrets can form what's known as elevated convection (elevated because the cloud is not based near the Earth's surface). Within these clouds, large snowflakes mix with icy pellets known as graupel, and electrical charges can build up from static electricity as these particles collide in the turbulent atmosphere. This static electricity buildup eventually can trigger occasional cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-ground lightning strikes. Areas of thundersnow are typically associated with extremely heavy snowfall rates because the extra lift in such snowbands enhances the production of snowflakes. This is partly why weather geeks love thundersnow so much, it combines heavy snow with lightning and thunder, a combo of the seasons, if you will. Interestingly, because thundersnow occurs as a result of elevated convection, the thunder typically sounds different than the rumbles from an average summertime thunderstorm. Thundersnow tends to be somewhat muffled, influenced by its altitude, the cold air the sound waves are traveling through, and the snow on the ground. Also, most cloud-to-ground lightning discharges during thundersnow events tend to be triggered by human-made structures, like tall skyscrapers like One World Trade in New York, or massive broadcast towers, for example. Such towers can poke into the base of the clouds and cause a buildup of electrical charges.","Just like each of us has our own personality, each nor'easter is different, with its own idiosyncrasies and mood.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The weather sucks on the East Coast right now, and there’s more godforsaken cold on the way. On Tuesday morning, every state in the lower 48 recorded wind chill values in the teens, and 80 percent of the U.S. population woke up to temperatures below freezing. I think we can all agree we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming ( har har ), but the weather has other plans. Namely, a monster nor’easter forecast to climb the Eastern Seaboard later this week. We know the impending winter storm is going to be strong, but its exact track is still uncertain. That track will dictate how much snow and wind the East Coast will experience. What is a given is what will follow it. Bitter, life-threatening cold will spill into the region over the weekend. We’re talking highs in the single digits from Portland to New York, and sub-zero wind chills that will easily be the coldest air of the winter so far. Not sure if you’ve heard, but it’s cold in the eastern U.S. right now. Read more Read In short, this is gonna suck. First, let’s talk about the winter storm. The first places to deal with winter weather are in the Southeast. Winter storm watches have popped up in odd locations from northern Florida to coastal North Carolina. A tap of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will collide with the currently chilly conditions over the region on Tuesday night into Wednesday. Snow, ice and sleet are all possible and could make travel hazardous in a region unused to this type of weather. But things are really going to kick into gear on Wednesday evening. That tap of moisture coupled with a wave of energy traveling out of the Great Lakes will energize the storm system as it moves out over the Atlantic. In weather parlance, the storm will bomb out over the Atlantic on Wednesday night as it moves up the Eastern Seaboard. The term “bomb out” stems from bombogenesis, meteorologistspeak for when pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. “In terms of pressure, this is going to get down quite a bit,” Jason Furtado, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. “We’re talking pressure for this storm that will rival what you’ll see in Category 2 and Category 3 hurricanes. This is going to be a big storm in terms of records.” Having the same pressure as a Category 3 hurricane doesn’t mean the nor’easter will have the same wind speeds. But it does mean the storm will have a tremendous amount of energy to make life miserable in New England and the Canadian Maritime provinces. Early (read: likely to change) snow forecasts show coastal areas from Long Island to Maine will get the biggest totals, ranging from 4-8 inches. That may not sound like much, but winds nearing 60 mph could create whiteout conditions. The current cold blast has also caused ice to pile up in parts of Cape Cod, and moderate storm surge for the nor’easter could send a frozen slurry of seawater into coastal neighborhoods. “You don’t need 2 feet of snow to have a big impact winter storm,” Furtado said. Though the storm is still a few days out, the National Weather Service announced winter storm watches from Long Island to the Massachusetts coast. Watches will likely expand as the storm track becomes clearer and warnings are almost guaranteed to pop up as well. Here’s the bad news: this is the good news part of the forecast. The storm will reshape the jet stream so that a huge dip appears over the eastern U.S just in time for the weekend. That trough will allow cold air to come streaming in from the Arctic, ushering in the worst conditions of winter. Those conditions will make Hoth look balmy. The National Weather Service is forecasting wind chill values below zero for 62 straight hours in New York starting on Friday. Ditto for Boston. Ditto for Portland, which is forecast to hit minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit. Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit are also gonna be sub-zero with the wind chill. Freezing conditions will extend to the Southeast as well. It’s enough to want to cut a tauntaun open and curl up inside of it until Monday. “We thought it was cold, but this going to be a huge shot of cold air. We’re in rare extreme [territory],” Furtado said. The snow could act as an insulator for underground pipes and infrastructure, sparing them from the worst of the cold. But it could also deepen the chill aboveground by reflecting any incoming warmth from the sun back into space. Records will likely fall, and I will likely spend all of Saturday under a blanket watching Netflix with my cat (don’t judge). A slight thaw is on tap for Monday, and an even bigger reprieve could be on the way for the latter half of January. Models indicate the Madden Julien Oscillation, a roving band of thunderstorms in the tropics, could align the atmosphere into a pattern that helps make the jet stream straighter again. That would cut off the flow of brutal Arctic air and mark a return to plain old cold, which sounds like a beach vacation right about now.","The weather sucks on the East Coast right now, and there’s more godforsaken cold on the way.

"Jennifer Gray, CNN","(CNN)While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over. 
The potential is there for a ""bomb cyclone"" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. 
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. 
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. 
Things begin to unravel Tuesday
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota.
Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes. 
Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions.
Thursday the bottom drops out
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours.
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis. 
Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous. 
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. 
On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms.
The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest
Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely. 
We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected. 
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding. 
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend. 
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay.

Andrew Freedman,"For the tens of millions who live in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Ohio Valley, and the East Coast, the first taste of true winter weather is just days away. Ushered in by a powerful cold front, the cold air, with high temperatures running 10 to 15 degrees below average, will come as a shock following one of the warmest fall seasons on record. Computer models are in agreement that the weather pattern across the Northern Hemisphere will become extremely amplified, which means that the jet stream — that high altitude superhighway of winds that steers weather systems and forms the boundaries between air masses — will carve out large dips, or troughs, as well as strong, practically immovable ""blocking"" ridges. Such weather patterns are ideal for creating extreme weather. SEE ALSO: La Niña is officially here to shape U.S. winter weather, along with global climate This configuration of the jet stream will lead to a bizarre but increasingly common situation in which the Arctic is unusually mild for this time of year (while still being cold, by lower latitude standards), as parts of North America, Europe, and Asia experience colder than average conditions. However, there are two big caveats to keep in mind about the cold air about to invade the East Coast, so don't panic quite yet. First, the cold air coming to the U.S. won't be coming straight out of the Arctic, but rather it will be oozing south from Alaska and Canada. It also won't traverse snow-covered ground, keeping the cold air warmer than it might otherwise be. Snow cover across the lower 48 states is unusually low, with virtually no snow on the ground south of the U.S. border with Canada from Michigan eastward. All that means that this will not be a historic cold snap, not even close. One should expect few, if any, cold temperature records to be set or tied during the coming two weeks, even though temperatures will run below average in the eastern half of the lower 48 states. Computer model projection showing a cold air mass in place across the Midwest and eastern U.S. as of Dec. 9, 2017. Image: weatherbell analytics Second, while the large-scale weather pattern will be primed for a big East Coast snowstorm, with a blocking high pressure area over Greenland, a negative phase of a cycle known as the Arctic Oscillation, and a deep dip in the jet stream from Canada southward to the Gulf of Mexico, it's unclear if any formidable storm will materialize. Winter storms require a spark or trigger in the form of atmospheric energy riding along the jet stream. As of Monday, computer model projections showed no indications of a significant storm in the near-term, 7-day period. We'll have to wait and see if one emerges after that. Long awaited hemispheric longwave amplification gets underway this week ending our warm, boring pattern. Winter's chill set to stay over eastern half of CONUS next 15+ days.

There is one snow-making machine that will kick into gear with the arrival of the cold front: lake effect snow. As cold air blows across relatively mild, unfrozen waters, moisture will be dumped downwind in the form of heavy snow squalls. Feet of snow could pile up in parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, and New York State. This will at least increase the proportion of the U.S. with snow cover, which stood at a measly 15.5 percent as of Monday.","For the tens of millions who live in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Ohio Valley, and the East Coast, the first taste of true winter weather is just days away.

Andrew Freedman,"The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is pummeling the East Coast, bringing heavy snow and sleet to the most populated part of the U.S., from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston on Wednesday. The storm formed overnight on Tuesday as a strong low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere approached the East Coast and helped spark a surface area of low pressure off the coast of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. The low pressure area is intensifying as it moves slowly northeastward, spreading areas of heavy snow inland. SEE ALSO: Does ordering delivery during a snowstorm make me a trash human? This is likely to be the biggest snowstorm for so late in the season on record in Washington, D.C., and it could be the biggest March snowstorm in Philadelphia, where about a foot of snow is expected. More than a foot of snow could pile up in New York City if conditions come together just right, potentially making it one of the top storms for so late in the season. Further north in Boston it will probably just rank as a moderate to heavy spring snowstorm, but not a historic event. The 4th nor'easter of the month as seen from space on March 21, 2018. Image: noaa. The storm is snarling travel across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, with most flights in and out of New York's airports and Philadelphia canceled on Wednesday, and significant disruptions at Washington area airports as well. One feature of the storm forecast has been a dichotomy between the National Weather Service's (NWS) snowfall predictions and those of private sector forecasters. The NWS has both Philadelphia and New York City in a zone of 12-to-18-inch accumulations, whereas reliable media outlets have been predicting less, on the order of 6-to-12 inches, based in part on the high March sun angle and likelihood of a mix between snow and sleet at times. In addition, the precise location of the most intense bands of snow, known as ""mesoscale bands"" because of their small dimensions, is difficult to forecast beyond an hour or two in advance. It's the areas that experience these bands for the longest period of time that will wrack up the highest snow totals, while areas just a few miles away could see half as much snow. Thundersnow also typically occurs in these bands as well. The forecast has been particularly challenging this time because of disagreements between leading computer models, as well. The European model — statistically the most accurate global weather model for the medium time range — suggested far lower snowfall amounts on Tuesday afternoon, which raised forecasters' blood pressure considerably. But other models held steady, predicting serious snow accumulation in big cities. The Weather Service has been warning that this will be a high-impact storm, particularly for the Philadelphia area and New York City, where power outages and ""impossible"" travel conditions are expected by the evening commute, as narrow bands of very heavy snow pivot across this region on the northwest side of the low pressure area. While it's unusual to see four nor'easters in a row, this is not unheard of. The Weather Prediction Center tweeted an example of such an occurrence in December and January of 1987. However, there is statistical evidence showing that slow-to-breakdown weather patterns that can lead to extreme outcomes, such as heat waves and heavy precipitation events, are becoming more common as the climate warms in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. One study, published in the journal Nature Communications on March 13, tied warming Arctic winters and sea ice loss to an increase in intense winter storms along the East Coast of the U.S. However, the precise physical mechanisms that cause Arctic warming to alter weather patterns well outside the Far North have not yet been well-established in the scientific literature, and this is an area of active research and debate in the weather and climate communities. A general explanation of what's been going on so far this March, however, is that the jet stream — the highway of air moving from west-to-east at around 35,000 feet, which steers weather systems and helps energize them — has been repeatedly taking big dips across the East Coast. Right now, the jet stream has a sharp bend to it, carving out a low pressure area in the middle of the curve, or trough. What a dip, or trough, in the jet stream looks like on a weather map. Image: weatherbell analytics Other factors have influenced the fusillade of nor'easters, including a pattern of air pressure over the North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as a strong blocking pattern of high pressure near Greenland that is holding up weather systems like a stop light at an intersection. A Greenland block, which typically consists of a persistent area of high pressure, is considered a prerequisite to causing some of the biggest East Coast snowstorms on record, since it forces the jet stream to dive southward across the eastern U.S., and allows storms time to intensify. A blocking pattern can also force storms to move close to the coast, and sometimes even forces them to move backwards, from east-to-west, prolonging heavy snow, strong winds, and coastal flooding. The storm on Wednesday will move fast enough to avoid causing severe coastal flooding, but if the NWS is right, and a foot-and-a-half of snow falls in some parts of the Washington to Boston corridor, this event will still go down in history as one of the biggest snowstorms for so late in the season.","The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks is pummeling the East Coast, bringing heavy snow and sleet to the most populated part of the U.S., from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston on Wednesday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Deep snow blankets French ski resorts such as Val Thorens (pictured) Heavy snow has cut off the Alpine ski resorts of Cervinia in Italy and Adelboden in Switzerland, as stormy weather continues to batter Europe. Italian media report that Cervinia, in the Aosta Valley, is half-buried under 2m (6.6ft) of fresh snow. About 10,000 tourists are stuck there. A similar emergency has gripped Adelboden, where the army was mobilised to clear debris from a landslide. In many resorts the avalanche risk is at level four, out of five in total. It is not clear if a World Cup ski race can go ahead this weekend in Adelboden. The landslide cut the resort's road to Frutigen, Neue Zürcher Zeitung news reports. Image copyright AFP Image caption Swiss soldiers were airlifted to Adelboden to deal with the emergency In Austria's mountainous Tyrol region the avalanche risk is high too and many roads are blocked. In Vorarlberg it is at level four. In the French Alps, ski pistes have been closed at Val d'Isère - one of the biggest resorts - and Chamonix has stopped most of its ski lifts. Storm Eleanor caused havoc in many parts of France, disrupting air and road traffic and cutting power in thousands of homes.

From staff reports,"A winter storm warning is in place for Southern Virginia including Halifax County as a developing winter storm aims to dump as much as a foot of snow in some areas. The warning is in effect from midnight Saturday through 11 a.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The exact track of the storm will determine accumulations, but the weather service pegs totals in the range of 4 to 12 inches. The evolving storm is an area of low pressure predicted to track Saturday from Texas across the Gulf Coast. Meanwhile, an area of cold high pressure is driving down to the South. With the cold air in place and plenty of moisture, a prolonged period of snow is expected. For Halifax County, snow may begin falling around 6 a.m. Sunday. While some sleet could mix in later Sunday and keep snow totals lower, the weather service expected the heaviest snow to fall across northwest North Carolina into Southern Virginia. Ahead of the possible crippling snowfall, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency Virginians should take all necessary precautions to ensure they are prepared for winter weather storm impacts, Northam said in a statement. I am declaring a state of emergency to ensure localities and communities have appropriate assistance and to coordinate state response to possible snow and ice accumulations, transportation issues, and potential power outages. The state of emergency allows Virginia to mobilize resources and to deploy people and equipment to assist in response and recovery efforts.","Storm could dump up to a foot of snow on Halifax County; governor declares state of emergency YourGV.com Intense winter storm tears through Texas, dumping snow and heavy rain CBS News Wintry storm brings rain, snow, havoc across USA; more bad weather on the w…",2018-12-08T15:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Yourgv.com'}",Storm could dump up to a foot of snow on Halifax County; governor declares state of emergency - YourGV.com,http://www.yourgv.com/news/local_news/storm-could-dump-up-to-a-foot-of-snow-on/article_3d969292-fafe-11e8-963f-7798621ebbe3.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourgv.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/1a/51aec8da-fafe-11e8-b96c-2385172a8ca8/5c0be44f8ef11.image.png?crop=841%2C841%2C50%2C0&resize=630%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Yourgv.com,snow storm,1
CHRISTINA CARON,"The storm’s effects were felt as far south as Georgia and as far north as Maine. In Rhode Island, the winds were so severe that officials shut down the Newport Bridge. In New York City, most flights were grounded for a time on Friday afternoon. In the Washington suburbs, downed trees were strewn across the streets. Weather officials said more than three feet of snow blanketed some parts of New York State on Friday. Meteorologists confirmed Friday that the storm had become the second “bomb cyclone” in two months. (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Coastal flooding damaged homes, closed roads and sent at least one car floating down a street; many areas of New England got two to four inches of rain. In Quincy, Mass., there were more than 100 rescues on Friday as floodwaters drove people from their homes, the television station WBZ reported. “As far as a coastal storm, this is the worst since the blizzard of ’78,” said Mayor Thomas Koch of Quincy. “Across the board this is the most damaging, and I’m very concerned about the infrastructure damage.” Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts activated the National Guard, which mobilized 53 vehicles to help assist with evacuation and rescue efforts. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf activated the National Guard on Friday to respond to the severe weather in the eastern part of the state, where Monroe County, in the Poconos about 80 miles northwest of New York City, was hit with nearly two feet of snow and wind gusts that knocked electrical wires and trees into the roads. Cars and trucks spun out of control, shutting down Interstates 80 and 380, stranding hundreds of vehicles. “It’s quite a unique storm with the amount of snow that came down that quickly,” Sean Brown, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said in an interview on Saturday. “It has been nonstop,” Lorenzo Thompson, a manager at the Burger King in Gouldsboro, Pa., near Interstate 380, said in a phone interview on Saturday morning. “I have not stopped taking orders since 7:30 a.m.” One bus passenger, Angie Cortz, told WPXI on Saturday that said she had been on the vehicle on Interstate 80 since Friday afternoon. “They said that we were stuck due to accidents in the road,” she said. State troopers brought her and the other passengers some water as they continued to wait, she said. Travel ground to a halt elsewhere as more than 3,000 flights were canceled and more than 3,500 others were delayed across the country on Friday, many at coastal airports in the storm’s path, according to FlightAware. Amtrak suspended service along its Northeast Corridor. The wind gusts made for turbulent trips for those who did fly. A pilot on a plane headed to Washington Dulles International Airport sent a report to the Aviation Weather Center that painted an unsettling image of the flight. The center, which is run by the National Weather Service, recounted the report in a tweet that said: “Pretty much everyone on the plane threw up. Pilots were on the verge of throwing up.” As conditions began to improve in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, winds and coastal flooding remained a concern, Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with the Weather Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a phone interview on Saturday. “One of the more pertinent threats that continues into the weekend is coastal flooding from Delaware on up all the way to Portland, Maine, and that would include Long Island and the New York City metro area,” he said. The winds had slowed to 45 miles per hour in some areas, a departure from reported winds on Friday that exceeded 65 m.p.h., Mr. Burke said. The highest recorded gusts were 93 m.p.h. in Barnstable, Mass. On the heels of the nor’easter, a “modest-sized storm” will be making make its way across the Rockies and Central Plains, eventually arriving in the Northeast on Wednesday, Tony Fracasso, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t look like it’s going to be as strong as the one that just went through yesterday,” he said, but it will bring at least a few inches of snow in the interior regions of the Northeast, and more rain to the coastal areas. “There’s always the potential for something stronger than what we’re forecasting,” he added. Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood and Katharine Q. Seelye from Boston; Matt Stevens, Jacey Fortin, Al Baker, Sarah Lyall and Alexandra S. Levine from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

Himawari-8, the Japanese satellite centered over the western Pacific, caught the storm as it ramped up while GOES-17, the spiffy new American satellite over the eastern Pacific caught it as it swirled toward North America. From both sides, the storm is absolutely gorgeous. You can see the Himawari-8 image up top, and heres the GOES-17 iteration as it wraps toward Alaskas Aleutian Islands.

For people living across the Upper Midwest, Great lakes, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and New England, an Arctic blast and series of storm systems will make it look and feel more like February during the next week. There are now three separate storms threatening to bring snow to parts of this swath of the country between April 4 and April 12, as bitterly cold air — courtesy of the polar vortex — blasts its way south and east to the Atlantic seaboard.

The National Weather Service is forecasting Minneapolis' coldest April day on record on Friday, with a high temperature of just 21 degrees Fahrenheit. On Wednesday, the air temperature dropped to minus-6 degrees Fahrenheit in Aberdeen, South Dakota, setting a new monthly record low, the NWS found. The combination of the Arctic cold and an active storm track across the northern two-thirds of the country will keep snow in the forecast for places that would normally have high temperatures well into the 50s and 60s Fahrenheit at this point.

,"At a Glance
Winter Storm Eboni will intensify in the Plains and Midwest midweek.
Parts of the Plains and Midwest will see strong winds and significant snow.
Some communities in the northern Plains may see near-blizzard conditions.
Snow may also affect northern New England late this week.
Winter Storm Eboni will track into the Plains midweek where it will intensify and lay down an expansive swath of wind-driven snow.
Eboni will then spread snow into parts of the upper Midwest and northern New England through Friday.
Eboni was named late on Mon., Dec. 24 with the expectation that area criteria winter storm warnings for 400,000 square kilometers or more would be met later in the week. Both area and population criteria was reached Tuesday afternoon. 
(MORE: The Science Behind Naming Winter Storms at The Weather Channel)
Happening Now
Snow continues to fall across parts of the central and southern Rockies and has spread into portions of the northern and central Plains. 
Eboni brought more than a foot of snow to the Sierra on Christmas Eve into early Christmas morning. 
Winter storm warnings have been issued by the National Weather Service from southern Colorado northeastward to Minnesota and far northwestern Wisconsin. Heavy snow and blowing snow are expected to make travel dangerous in these areas. 
Near-blizzard conditions  including low visibility and blowing snow are possible in parts of the Dakotas late Wednesday into Thursday.
Winter weather advisories are also in place for parts of the Rockies, northern Plains and upper Midwest where travel could be tricky through midweek. 
(From the National Weather Service.)
Day-By-Day Forecast
Winter Storm Eboni will emerge and strengthen in the central Plains midweek as an upper-level trough a southward dip in the jet stream ejects out of the West.
(MORE: Severe Storms, Heavy Rain Threaten the South Midweek)
Temperatures are expected to be cold enough on the northern side of this storm for significant amounts of snow to fall from the northern and central Plains into the upper Midwest and northern Great Lakes region.
Wednesday
Snow or a rain-and-snow mixture may affect a swath from the southern Rockies into northwestern Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
Many areas of eastern Colorado, western Kansas and western Nebraska will see the precipitation start as rain but then change to freezing rain and snow Wednesday night.
Snow will spread through much of Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan later Wednesday or Wednesday night.
Increasing winds are also expected in the Plains and upper Midwest and near-blizzard conditions are possible in parts of western Kansas Wednesday night.
Snow will linger from New Mexico and northeastern Arizona northward into Colorado, Wyoming and eastern Montana.
(The green shadings depict where rain is expected. Areas that are shaded blue are expected to see snow. Purple-shaded locations may see either rain or snow. Areas in pink are expected to see sleet or freezing rain (ice).)
Thursday
Snow or a rain-and-snow mixture will affect areas from western Kansas to Nebraska, the Dakotas, Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and northern Michigan.
Increasing winds are also likely through the Plains and upper Midwest, which will reduce visibility where snow is falling. 
Depending on the strength of the winds, we could see near-blizzard conditions develop in parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska, Kansas and northern Minnesota.
Some areas will see a change in precipitation type, including Minneapolis which will see snow change to rain.
Snow, sleet and freezing rain will spread into parts of New England and eastern New York Thursday night.

Portions of northern New England and northeastern New York could see snow or a mix of rain, snow, sleet and freezing rain persist through Friday.
(The green shadings depict where rain is expected. Areas that are shaded blue are expected to see snow. Purple-shaded locations may see either rain or snow. Areas in pink are expected to see sleet or freezing rain (ice).)
How Much Snow?
At least 6 inches of snow is expected in a swath from parts of Colorado northeastward through the eastern Dakotas and into northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. More than a foot of snow is possible in eastern South Dakota, southeastern North Dakota and in parts of central and northern Minnesota.
Gusty winds will lead to blowing and drifting snow that may create snow drifts several feet high. 
The trickiest forecast for snowfall totals is for cities along the southern edge of the expected snowfall, which could see rain and snow. Minneapolis and Sioux Falls, South Dakota are two examples. 
Keep in mind, the area of heaviest snow could shift farther north or south in future forecast updates based on the track of the storm.
Farther east, more than 6 inches of snow is most likely in northern New Hampshire and northern Maine.
Light snowfall is possible in parts of southern New England but little to no snow accumulation is currently anticipated in Boston, Providence and Hartford. 
Winter Storm Recap
The low pressure system that became Winter Storm Eboni came ashore near the California/Oregon border on Christmas Eve with an area of snowfall and coastal rain. 
The system created a dip in the jet stream over the Southwest on Christmas where Eboni dropped snow across the Four Corners and the Tetons. 
Select snowfall totals through early Wednesday: 
California: 12 inches at Northstar resort
Colorado: 2 inches at Telluride
Idaho: 5 inches near China Mountain

AZI PAYBARAH,"Dec. 27-28, 2010 Mayor Michael Bloomberg, fresh off his unpopular push to extend term limits, was coldly dismissive of complaints from residents who said they were buried under a storm. The city is going fine. Broadway shows were full last night, Mr. Bloomberg told reporters, playing into critics caricature of him as a Manhattan-centric mayor unaware of life in the less-gilded quarters of the city. Later, it was reported that Mr. Bloombergs private plane and presumably its owner were in Bermuda. The same storm was, apparently, not enough of a concern to curtail Mr. Christies plans.

They write : For at least two decades, almost every time a child in its apartments tested positive for high lead levels, Nycha launched a counteroffensive, city records show. From 2010 through July of this year, the agency challenged 95 percent of the orders it received from the Health Department to remove lead detected in Nycha apartments. Private landlords almost never contest a finding of lead; they did so in only 4 percent of the 5,000 orders they received over the same period, records show. Nychas strategy often worked. The Health Department backed down in 158 of 211 cases in public housing after the authority challenged its finding, the data shows. Look ahead: Mr. Goodman emails to note that the de Blasio administration is trying to parry criticism over its handling of lead in public housing by exploring holding paint companies accountable. For help, a city official met with a historian and a lawyer.","For mayors and other officials, the backlash over storm preparations can be perilous. Now it’s Bill de Blasio’s turn.

http://www.facebook.com/fox2now,"Winter Storm and Blizzard Warnings for Nov. 25, 2018 ST. LOUIS, MO – A major winter storm will pound parts of the Midwest Sunday. Heavy snow will blanket parts of southeast Nebraska, northeast Kansas, southern Iowa, northern Missouri, and northwest Illinois, with some seeing 10 inches or more. The snow will be accompanied by winds of up to 45 mph, creating dangerous whiteout conditions on roads and interstates. Travel is not advised. For the St. Louis region, this storm will bring significant wind and falling temperatures but not much snow. Rain showers move in around midday as wind speeds begin to increase and temperatures begin to drop. Rain will change to windblown light snow and flurries Sunday evening. Wind gusts through the evening will be 25-30mph. Only minor snow accumulations are expected, mostly on grass and cars. The exception to this is in northern Montgomery County and Pike County, MO along with Pike and northern Greene Counties, IL, where around an inch of snow is possible. These counties are on the edge of the heavy snow that will more greatly impact communities to the north. Any light snow exits around midnight and we clear out into Monday. Much, much colder with wind chills in the teens Monday. It stays very cold through Wednesday. Tomorrow night, the northwest 1/3 of the state should anticipate up to 12 of snow. Central Illinois could get up to 6, the heaviest north of Springfield. Take all necessary precautions.

TRIBUNE STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Wind-driven sleet, freezing rain and snow alternated to keep roads slick Saturday as the Coulee Region waited to see how much snow would ultimately accumulate during a mid-April storm that blasted much of the nation’s heartland. The National Weather Service predicted 6 to 12 inches of snow along and north of Interstate 90, 2 to 6 inches south of the I-90 corridor, and a winter weather warning was in effect till 7 p.m. Sunday. The weather system stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, forcing flight cancellations and creating treacherous road conditions. Three people were killed in weather-related incidents, including a sleeping 2-year-old Louisiana girl. In the Upper Midwest, the early spring storm brought snow to a region pining for sunshine and warmth. More than 200 flights were canceled Saturday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and blizzard conditions forced the airport in South Dakota’s biggest city, Sioux Falls, to remain closed for a second straight day. Some flights at the La Crosse Regional Airport were delayed or canceled. The Minnesota Twins home game against the Chicago White Sox at Target Field was also snowed out, marking the first back-to-back postponements of baseball games in the stadium’s nine seasons. Authorities closed several highways in southwestern Minnesota, where no travel was advised, and driving conditions were difficult across the entire southern half of the state, well into western Wisconsin. “It’s a cool experience for me, the best Minneapolis experience,” said Niko Heiligman of Aachen, Germany, who braved the snow to take a walk along the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis. “I’m only here for the weekend, so I guess that’s how it goes. There’s snow and it’s cold. So it’s good.” The storm is expected to persist through today in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan before moving into New York state and New England. A band of 6 to 18 inches of snow had fallen by Saturday morning across central and northeastern Wisconsin, with another round on the way. A blizzard warning was issued for the northern half of Wisconsin, which was expected to get another 14 inches by Sunday evening. Winds of up to 55 mph caused blowing and drifting snow, along with ice shoves in Green Bay. In Chicago, Lake Michigan waves were expected to reach as high as 18 feet, prompting a flood warning until today along the lakefront. Huron, an eastern South Dakota city of about 13,000 people, received 18 inches of snow. One of the three storm-related deaths occurred Friday on snow-covered Interstate 80 near Chappell in western Nebraska, where the State Patrol said an Idaho truck driver lost control of his semitrailer and slammed into a semi that had become stranded. Rollo Ward, 61, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, died at the scene. Another death happened early Saturday in northwestern Louisiana when a storm toppled a tree onto a mobile home in Haughton, killing a sleeping 2-year-old girl inside. A woman died in a spinout on a slippery highway in central Wisconsin on Saturday morning. The Columbia County Sheriff’s Office said the 30-year-old woman from Poynette, Wis., was driving a minivan that began to spin and crossed the centerline of Hwy. 16 in the town of Lewiston, where it was struck by an oncoming SUV. The road was slush-covered and light, freezing rain was falling. The storm made its mark in Texas, too, where hail stones the size of chicken eggs fell on areas south of Dallas and Fort Worth.","La Crosse Tribune Storm blasts central US with snow, ice and wind, killing 3 La Crosse Tribune Wind-driven sleet, freezing rain and snow alternated to keep roads slick Saturday as the Coulee Region waited to see how much snow would ultimately accumulate durin…",2018-04-14T23:17:50Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lacrossetribune.com'}","Storm blasts central US with snow, ice and wind, killing 3 - La Crosse Tribune",http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/storm-blasts-central-us-with-snow-ice-and-wind-killing/article_eca99f5d-1357-5eb7-b8ea-701112e05b43.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lacrossetribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/80/48039fbe-a94e-5dc5-9037-b5bdee3e045d/5ad28b414b211.image.jpg?crop=1644%2C925%2C0%2C168&resize=1120%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Lacrossetribune.com,snow storm,1
"JACK HEALY, RICHARD FAUSSET and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON","But the mind-set seemed to have fully changed. Local officials used to regard hurricane response as something akin to major snow removal: sporadic events that therefore warranted relatively little investment. “Two years of these types of storms have really made us look internally at our own preparation,” Mr. Sears said. “Now that we have a better understanding of where people may be at risk, we can better stage assets in that area.” “Matthew got me once, Florence got me twice,” Mr. Sears said Tuesday, recounting what he told the City Council this week. “The next hurricane won’t get me.” Closer to the coast, in Conway, S.C., a few miles northwest of Myrtle Beach, the weariness with the cycle of worry, flood, repeat was palpable. “I grew up here,” said Matt Bruton, 34, a moving and storage business operator, who was hanging out Tuesday in his single-story brick home in Old Sherwood Country Club, an eclectic neighborhood of old and new houses north of the Waccamaw River. The waters had already risen through neighboring Crabtree Swamp to a level higher than residents had ever seen. “We had a record flood during Floyd in ’99, and it wasn’t this high,” Mr. Bruton said. “The hundred-year flood they called it the last time, and here we are again. I’d like to put my house in a different, higher place, but I call this the best neighborhood in Conway. We’re all friends here.”","As climate change and rapid growth bring more flooding, residents and officials must grapple with where to rebuild and how to prepare for the next storm.",2018-09-18T23:50:56Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘It’s Back’: Underwater Yet Again, the Carolinas Face a New Reality",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/us/north-carolina-hurricanes-storms-history.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/us/19stormredux1/19stormredux1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice. The Arctic is no stranger to cyclones, but the latest no-name storm, which emerged in the Kara sea north of Siberia, has garnered attention both for its size and timing. The storm’s central pressure (a measure of its strength) bottomed out Thursday at about 966 millibars, placing it par with the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012, one of the most extreme summertime storms in recent memory. That storm reached a minimum central pressure 963-966 millibars, depending on which analysis you trust. The new storm’s occurrence in June is also noteworthy. Big cyclones like this don’t normally start hitting the Arctic until late summer. The Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 spun up in August as did a major storm in 2016. “Preliminarily, this storm could rank in the Top 10 for Arctic Cyclones in June as well as for the summer (June through August) in strength,” Steven Cavallo, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther via email. Xiangdong Zhang, a scientist at the International Arctic Research Center who specializes in Arctic cyclones, cited a few factors responsible for the storm’s formation, including low sea ice cover in the North Atlantic which has increased the amount of heat in the atmosphere, a strong temperature gradient between land and sea, and the stratospheric polar vortex, an area of low pressure just above the storm. “The downward intrusion of this polar vortex intensified [the] storm,” Zhang told Earther via email. The no-name storm reached peak photogenicity yesterday, with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration capturing a stunning high-resolution image. While your typical late-season Arctic cyclones are notorious for chewing up sea ice, what this early season beast will mean for ice remains to be seen. “This storm is very quick-moving and occurring earlier in the season,” University of California, Irvine Ph.D. candidate Zack Labe told Earther via Twitter direct message. “Its impacts to sea ice are likely not comparable to these other strong cyclones that have occurred later in the summer.” Labe noted that early summer storms can favor cooler, cloudier conditions, slowing down the loss of sea ice, which typically bottoms out in September. However, he added that a storm of this strength “may precondition the ice for easier melt later in the season.” Zhang said that due to the storm’s location, it can transport more sea ice out of the Arctic through the passage between Greenland and Svalbard known as the Fram Straight. “This will contribute to Arctic sea ice decrease, in particular thick ice,” he said. Storm or no, it’s been a weird, bad year for Arctic sea ice so far. After limping along all winter, Bering sea ice was basically gone by May, months ahead of schedule. Even before this storm, sea ice around Svalbard was looking more like it should in September. Overall, Arctic sea ice extent for May was at its second-lowest on record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s latest monthly sea ice report released on June 6. The role of rising temperatures in driving down sea ice is well established. But there’s also growing evidence that climate change could fuel more ice-shredding cyclones. Research going back to the early 2000s suggests Arctic cyclone activity is on the rise. And a study published in April concluded that these storms will become more frequent and intense in the future as the contrast between land and sea temperatures continues to rise.","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice.

"Kelly Murray, CNN","(CNN)As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.
It comes on the heels of the deadly storm system that plagued much of the Midwest, South and East over Christmas. 
The worst is over as that storm pushes offshore into the Atlantic. But it killed at least six people in the Midwest and South and brought blizzard conditions, a foot of snow, and winds exceeding 55 mph to the Great Plains and Upper Midwest on Thursday. It then ripped across the East with heavy rainfall and winds.
On Friday, more than 50 million people were under the threat of floods, with flood watches and warnings stretching from the Gulf Coast to New Jersey. 
Flash flooding affected Southern Mississippi and Alabama, triggering dangerous situations and high-water rescues. Up to a foot of rain fell in less than a day.
The rough weather made holiday travel even more of a headache. There were nearly 9,000 flight delays into, within or out of the country Friday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.
As of Saturday, flood watches have been largely discontinued, but there are still warnings for some rivers in the South, particularly across southern Mississippi and Alabama, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
""I'm not expecting the foot of rain some areas in the Southern US received,"" Cabrera said. ""An additional 1 to 3 inches may renew flooding concerns due to saturated soils. Some areas in the South will in fact make a run for wettest year on record with the last few storms filling rain gauges to record levels.""
Forecast radar images for Saturday show rain persisting in coastal areas of the Southeast, but it should clear out for inland cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.
The letup won't last long, however. On Sunday, moisture emanating from the Gulf of Mexico will bring a band of showers to southeastern Texas and then stretch across southern Louisiana, all the way up through the Carolinas.
Then, on the last day of 2018, another storm will bring rain, although less heavy, to the North and East, Cabrera said.
Conditions will be wet, but temperatures will be mild in much of the Southeast -- in the 60s and 70s -- and in the 40s in the Northeast as New Year's Eve revelers welcome 2019.","As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.

Sunday, January 13, 2019, 10:33 AM -A snowstorm dumped up to 8 inches (20 cm) of snow across Missouri, Illinois and part of the U.S. Midwest Saturday (January 12), and is expected to bring rain and snow across a 1,800-mile (2,900 km) swath of the United States in the next few days.
The weather system, which started as rain from Mexico but has since turned into snow, is forecast to affect an 1,800-mile (2,900 km) swath of the United States from Colorado to the Mid-Atlantic.
The storm hit Kansas and Missouri on Friday and pummeled those states again on Saturday as it extended into parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said U.S. Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Andrew Orrison.
(Related: 'Congratulations on surviving your first plane crash')
In Kansas City, snow dusted the field at Arrowhead Stadium during Saturday's National Football League playoff game between the hometown Chiefs and Indianapolis Colts.
""There's snow time like Showtime,"" the Chiefs said on Twitter, sharing video of the team's quarterback Patrick Mahomes arriving at the stadium in the snow.
The storm is leaving its heaviest snowfall on areas west of St. Louis, where about a foot and a half of snow was recorded, with still more falling on Saturday, Orrison said.
At least five people died in weather-related crashes on roads in Missouri and Kansas, according to the highway patrolmen in both states.
""I think it's safe to say that every road is bad in Kansas right now!"" Trooper Tod Hileman, a spokesman for the Kansas Highway Patrol, said on Twitter on Saturday.
Dozens of flights were canceled at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, which described the onslaught of snow on Twitter as one of its biggest single-day winter storms in years.
Washington, where many federal government offices are closed due to the U.S. government shutdown, is expected to receive 6 to 8 inches (15 cm to 20 cm) of snow from this storm, according to the National Weather Service.
Central and northern Virginia will receive even more, with up to 10 inches of snow possible in some places. Baltimore and parts of Maryland are also bracing for a similar amount.
Philadelphia is expected to receive a few inches of snow, but areas north of there are expected to be spared, Orrison added.

A winter storm that contributed to at least five deaths in the Midwest pummelled the mid-Atlantic region for a second day Sunday, bringing with it an icy mix that knocked out power, cancelled flights and contributed to hundreds of car accidents.
Virginia State Police said the driver of a military surplus vehicle was killed late Saturday after he lost control on Interstate 81 because of slick road conditions.
Police said Ronald W. Harris, 73, of Gainesville, Georgia, died after his vehicle was struck by two tractor-trailers. The two tractor-trailer drivers were taken to a hospital for injuries that were not life-threatening. The state medical examiner determined Sunday that Harris death was storm-related, police said.

Virginia State Police said they responded to more than 300 traffic crashes and helped nearly 200 disabled vehicles in Virginia from midnight to late Sunday afternoon.
The storm knocked out power to nearly 200,000 people in Virginia and North Carolina at its height Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us.
In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Sunday to help utility crews restore electricity more quickly after power lines fell because of freezing rain, ice and toppled trees. The states western mountains and foothills were hardest-hit along with the western Piedmont region and nearly 1,000 state transportation workers were called out to clear ice and snow.
The National Weather Service reported nearly a half-inch of ice in some sections of western North Carolina, leading to fallen trees and power lines but other areas of the state got mostly a cold rain or freezing precipitation that caused few problems The wintry mix did, however, cause problems at airports in the region, including more than 250 flight cancellations Sunday at the three main airports serving the nations capital.
In Baltimore, a man was fatally shot as he shovelled snow early Sunday morning. Police said a 43-year-old man was outside shovelling at 4:40 a.m. when an unidentified suspect shot him in the head and shoulder. The victim died at a hospital.
By late Sunday afternoon, the Washington, D.C. metro area, northern Virginia and parts of Maryland had total snowfall accumulations ranging from five to eight inches (12-20 centimetres). Central Virginia, including Richmond, had much smaller accumulations as little as one inch (2.5 centimetres) but the snow was followed by hours of sleet and freezing rain.
Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said parts of the region could expect snow to continue falling into Sunday evening.

Class cancellations also are planned Monday in areas of central Illinois hit by record snowfall.
Springfields State Journal-Register reports the state capital broke a 55-year record for daily snowfall on Saturday. It cited the National Weather Service as saying the 8.4 inches (21.3 centimetres) of snow that day in Springfield broke the previous record for a Jan. 12 in 1964 of 6.6 inches (16.7 centimetres). Some 11.5 inches (29 centimetres) of snow fell on Springfield over three days.
Among those killed in the Midwest during the storm was an Illinois state trooper struck by a car when he responded to a three-vehicle crash Saturday in suburban Chicago.
State Police Director Leo Schmitz told reporters that 34-year-old Christopher Lambert was headed home when he pulled over and got out of his squad car to respond to the accident. Schmitz said Lambert positioned his squad car to protect the other three cars and took on the danger himself.

For Kansas City Chiefs offensive guard Jeff Allen, there was a bright spot during the storm when a Good Samaritan helped pull his vehicle out of the snow after he got stuck on his way to Arrowhead Stadium for the divisional playoff game Saturday.
Allen said he made it on time for the Chiefs victory over the Indianapolis Colts because of the mans help. The man who helped Allen didnt know he was a Chiefs player at the time.
Allen turned to Twitter to track down the Good Samaritan. When they connected Sunday morning, Allen thanked him and promised him tickets to next weeks AFC Championship game.","Winter storm slams U.S. mid-Atlantic region for a second day The Globe and Mail Storm dumps snow on Midwest; at least 5 dead in crashes CTV News Wintry mix of snow, freezing rain pummels mid-Atlantic CityNews Vancouver Winter storm continues to pummel U.S. wi…",2019-01-13T22:09:17Z,"{'id': 'the-globe-and-mail', 'name': 'The Globe And Mail'}",Winter storm slams U.S. mid-Atlantic region for a second day - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-at-least-five-dead-as-massive-winter-storm-hits-us-midwest/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/ClOdpNUH2Bh-x5RFOiW7YfSsj-Y=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RYZG4ZAGFBG7FLEK6EW3TD65DE.jpg,the-globe-and-mail,The Globe And Mail,snow storm,1

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Following a bone-dry start to the water year, California saw some much-needed rainfall in the form of an atmospheric river last month. Now, even though the wet season should be winding down, the Golden State’s getting another. The moisture will boost the state’s rainfall totals but could actually shrink snowpack, setting the still-too-dry region up for a thirsty summer. Rain is once again tap for California thanks to a massive moisture hose expected to settle in across the Pacific later this week. Also called the Pineapple Express because it originates near Hawaii, the atmospheric river could dump one to three inches of rain across central and northern California and more in the mountains, Weather Underground reports. “Clearly there’s gonna be an extremely rich channel of moisture all the way from Hawaii to central California,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther. “This would be a big storm in January. It could be a mammoth storm for April.” It’s the latest curveball in what started as an alarmingly dry water year for California and much of the West. December through February marked the state’s second driest winter on record and the driest since 1976-77, according to NOAA. In February, NASA’s Earth Observatory released maps that show part of the Southern Rockies looking dismally snow-free compared with last year. But the water year started to play catchup when a major atmospheric river crashed into California in late March, dumping upwards of nine inches of rainfall across the southern part of the state and triggering mudslides. As of Tuesday, water year-to-date precipitation across California is anywhere from 75 to 95 percent what’s normal, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The snowpack has played rapid catch-up, too, although levels are still well below average across much of the West. On Monday, new readings from California’s Department of Water Resources showed snowpack was hovering at just over half its normal levels for this time of year, according to the Sacramento Bee. “By no means even close to the ‘March miracle,’” snow survey director Frank Gehrke told the paper, referring to a hypothetical snowpack recovery that meteorologists apparently never really expected to happen. All of this fits a longer term pattern. As Weather Underground notes, six out of the last seven winters have seen below-average levels of accumulation. Over the past three decades, the maximum amount of moisture contained in Western snowpack has declined 10 to 20 percent, according to a study published last year. Per that same study, the downward spiral is expected continue as climate change drives temperatures up. Unfortunately, the impending atmospheric river won’t do western snowpack any favors. Because it’s so late in the season and the air is so warm, snow might only fall at the highest elevations in the Sierras. Lower down in the mountains, the forecast is for rain, which could melt snow and lead to downstream flooding. “What you like is for the snowpack to gently melt off into the reservoirs this time of year,” Henson said. “Instead, this is going to potentially melt off a chunk of the snowpack. What that means is, it flows down[stream] and the reservoirs have to release it because it’s coming too fast and early.” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain agreed, telling Earther in a Twitter DM that the storm would “almost certainly result in net snowmelt.” In other words, California might wind up with less reservoir-replenishing white stuff at the end of the coming rainstorm than it had going in. This article has been updated to include a comment from Daniel Swain.","Following a bone-dry start to the water year, California saw some much-needed rainfall in the form of an  atmospheric river last month.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","That bomb cyclone you’ve surely read about has officially gone off. And the images rolling in are something else. Pressure dropped 54 millibars in 24 hours in the winter storm currently climbing up the eastern seaboard. That’s more than double what’s needed to classify it as a bomb, making it a super bomb (kidding, please don’t repeat that, especially not to a meteorologist). In all seriousness, the impacts are piling up. Hurricane force winds have reached as far north as Cape Cod. Iguanas are turning into iguanicles in South Florida. The lights are starting to flicker out in Massachusetts. Snow is accumulating everywhere from Florida to Maine. This storm has been well forecast, and is playing out as expected. Cold air is waiting in the wings to make this weekend miserable ( and potentially deadly ) for the eastern U.S. But let’s step back and admire this storm because man is it a beauty from space. To wit: The recently operationalized GOES-16 satellite is returning a wealth of stunning views of a storm that could be writing its way into the record books. That’s why so many meteorologists doing a little happy dance even as they try to forecast a dangerous event. Here’s a bigger picture look: Here’s a slightly zoomed in look at the swirl off the Mid-Atlantic: And this is as tightly zoomed as it gets. You can see tiny swirls—the mesovortices mentioned in the tweet—which indicate areas of intense activity churning within the storm: Seriously, this storm is a thing of meteorological beauty and likely inspiring the next generation of meteorologists sitting at home enjoying a snow day. The source of the storm’s power is the huge temperature difference between the warm ocean currents and cold air covering most of the eastern U.S. The process is known as baroclinic instability. Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, likened it to what would happen if you had a fish tank divided in half with warm water on the bottom and cool water on the top. If you pull out the divider, the dense cold water would immediately drop and the warm water would rise. “From a physics perspective, potential energy in the mass of the water was converted to kinetic energy (the movement of the water) to create a circulation,” she told Earther in an email. “In the atmosphere, this type of instability is called baroclinic instability.” Baroclinic instability is a common factor in all nor’easters, strong winter storms that impact the East Coast, but this storm will likely go down as one of the most rapidly intensifying on record for the region. The new GOES-16 satellite is not only helping produce drool-inducing images, but returning data on a major event that will help meteorologists improve forecasts for the next storm, whether its a bomb or a plain ol’ nor’easter.",That bomb cyclone you’ve surely read about has officially gone off.

Scott Dance,"The Baltimore region appears likely to escape the brunt of a winter storm forecast to develop this weekend, but some snow could still fall Sunday, meteorologists said. Heavy snow is forecast across North Carolina and southern Virginia from Saturday night to Sunday night, and meteorological models have differed in recent days about whether the storm could creep up into Maryland. On Thursday, it appeared high pressure over the eastern Great Lakes and the mid-Atlantic would keep the storm south of Maryland, National Weather Service forecasters said. They predicted some impact, moderate to maybe high, in Southern Maryland, the lower Eastern Shore and Northern Virginia, and chances for at least some snow flurries up to the Baltimore region. AccuWeather.com predicted potential for some snow Sunday as far north as Baltimore, and chances for icy precipitation on the lower Eastern Shore. But forecasters said the storm isnt expected to move very far north. This is not the type of storm where snow will continue to advance northward, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brian Wimer said.

Nicole Gallucci,"Snow has started to fall in the United States, but not in the places you might expect. In yet another example of unusual weather this year, the first week of December brought accumulating snow to places like Austin, Texas, Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta, Georgia — places that rarely ever see several inches of snow, let alone experience a snowstorm before Christmas. Snow even fell as far south as Corpus Christi, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. SEE ALSO: Powerful cold front to usher in winter across the U.S., but it may not mean heavy snow The snow in the South has actually preceded the first measurable snow in traditionally snowy places, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. This is an extremely rare occurrence. Confused, surprised, and excited residents of the South have been sharing their views of the snow on Twitter. For Houston — which had temperatures in the 80s Fahrenheit on Thursday — this first winter snowfall could wind up ranking in the city's top 10 heaviest snowfalls in history. Several inches have fallen throughout the metro area. A lightning strike was detected in a band of heavier snow near Corpus Christi on Friday morning, indicating the most elusive of weather phenomena, ""thundersnow."" Light snow officially at our office and at the ASOS station at Brownsville-South Padre International Airport. #rgvwx #rgv #txwx — NWS Brownsville (@NWSBrownsville) December 8, 2017 The conditions were so out of the ordinary that Corpus Christi's National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office felt the need to throw some shade by tweeting at NWS forecast offices in Maine, Illinois, and Iowa — three states that have yet to fully transform into winter wonderlands. ""We think we found something you are missing! Let us know how to return it to you!"" Corpus Christi's official NWS Twitter account tweeted alongside a video of snow falling in Texas. Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge shared photos of a snow-covered Tiger Stadium, and other residents posted footage showing flurries still falling, with cars, roofs, and streets already blanketed. And Alabama is getting quite the dusting, too. Just woke up in Birmingham Alabama to snow everywhere. It’s freezing here. Meanwhile it is a beautiful day in NYC. Isn’t the SOUTH supposed to be warmer than the NORTH? pic.twitter.com/oCEZToSI9c — Ahmed Shihab-Eldin (@ASE) December 8, 2017 Sure the timing of the snow in these areas is premature, but what makes these snowfalls even more bizarre is the fact that cities usually dealing with snow by now have yet to experience it. The Lower 48 states have had very little snow cover so far this winter, with just a quarter of this region counted as snow-covered as of Dec. 8, 2017. The same storm system bringing snow to the South and Southeast, though, is forecast to intensify as it moves up the East Coast, eventually blanketing areas from Washington, D.C. to Maine in several inches. So the South may have had a head start, but the Northeast won't have to be jealous for long.

,"At a Glance Snow and ice from Winter Storm Bruce has snarled traffic. Nationwide, more than 2,000 flights have been canceled. Drivers stranded on impassable roads were rescued overnight in Illinois. Hundreds of flights were canceled as heavy snow and high winds from Winter Storm Bruce made travel treacherous for those trying to get home after Thanksgiving. Motorists were asked to stay off the highways as Bruce brought blizzard conditions to five states. Nationwide, more than 2,000 flights were canceled Sunday and Monday, according to FlightAware. Over 1,500 of the cancellations occurred at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Chicago's Midway International and Kansas City International saw the greater portion of their cancelations Sunday, but had lingering issues into Monday morning. As of Monday morning, over 250,000 customers were without power in the Midwest, the vast majority being reported in Illinois, according to PowerOutage.us. (MORE: Where Is Winter Storm Bruce Headed Next? ) Here's a state-by-state breakdown of Winter Storm Bruce's impact on the Midwest. Illinois In Illinois, overnight snowmobile rescues were reported after drivers became stranded in their cars on Route 6 near Princeton due to high snowdrifts, according to the Illinois State Police. The Ogle County Sheriff warned drivers that many state roads were still too hazardous to drive on Monday morning, and while IDOT crews were working to clear them, they had no time frame as to when road conditions were expected to improve. Schools in the area were closed for the day. At their highest, outages in Illinois reached upwards of 300,000 customers without power statewide Sunday evening, said ComEd Spokesman Tom Dominguez. Michigan Dozens of crashes were reported in the Lansing area Monday morning as Bruce coated roads with snow and ice. The Ionia County Sheriff called the roads ""treacherous"" in a statement, encouraging drivers to stay off them unless travel was essential. Schools in the Flint area were closed Monday with poor road conditions. Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer declared a state of disaster emergency in response to the winter storm moving across his state. The declaration authorizes the use of state resources and personnel to assist with response and recovery operations in affected counties. The Kansas Department of Transportation issued a blunt warning on social media early Sunday: ""Do not try to travel west if you are in NE Kansas and trying to go west, STOP NOW."" Over 200 miles of Interstate 70, from Topeka to the Colorado border, were shut down for most of the day Sunday, reopening around 9 p.m. Sunday night. A multiple car accident shut down U.S. 400 east of Beaumont, the National Weather Service reported. Several other highways east of Dodge City were also closed. Many school districts in Kansas canceled Monday classes. The University of Kansas canceled classes at the campus in Lawrence and the Edwards Campus in Overland Park because traveling was so difficult on Sunday. Iowa Near Creston, motorists were stuck for more than an hour on Interstate 35. At one point, a bus slid off the road, but it has been moved by state troopers, WOI-TV reported. Missouri Interstate 29 was closed from St. Joseph to the Iowa border because of whiteout conditions, the Missouri Highway Patrol tweeted. The roadway was later reopened despite being still blanketed in snow, said MSHP. Nebraska Nearly every roadway in Nebraska, southwest Iowa, and northwest Missouri was either partially covered or fully covered by snow and blowing snow, News Channel Nebraska reported Sunday. Even Monday, crews from the Nebraska Transportation Department reported that several highways were still closed due to snow and ice in the southern part of the state. KLKN-TV in Lincoln reported that near-blizzard conditions were keeping first responders from reaching stranded motorists in Saline and Jefferson counties. The Nebraska State Patrol closed westbound I-80 for several hours Sunday morning between Lincoln and Omaha because of crashes, which included semitrailer trucks jackknifed across the highway. At least one person was injured. Snow emergencies were declared in several Nebraska communities, KWBE reported, including Fairbury, Beatrice, Nebraska City. Colorado On Saturday, the Colorado Highway Patrol said a 20-vehicle pileup, including a jackknifed semitrailer, closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 70 near Frisco for several hours Saturday.

MICHAEL WILSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN,"But interviews with experts familiar with Kennedy’s operations this weekend, as well as with scores of passengers both inside that jampacked airport and others far away, hint at the complicated story to someday come, and offer a view from within the chaotic scene. The arrival of a severe winter storm on Thursday was not a surprise. With a snowstorm ominously described as a bomb cyclone bearing down on the New York area, the Port Authority started warning about airport disruption and flight cancellations on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, as the snow piled up and winds strengthened, the Port Authority announced that Kennedy would temporarily shut down. At 1 p.m., it was telling travelers that it intended to resume flight activity later that day. Around the world, airlines were reading that forecast as a green light to take off for long hauls to New York City. As late as 6:20 p.m., the Port Authority was still sending out tweets that it expected to reopen Kennedy that night. But an hour later, close to 7:30 p.m., the Port Authority decided to keep Kennedy closed until Friday morning. That meant that all of the flights bound for Kennedy had to divert to other airports or turn around. The sudden, unplanned detouring of all of those planes set off a chain reaction that stretched to various continents and left Kennedy tied in knots for the next few days, with passengers stranded in overcrowded terminals and on planes. “Virtually no foreign airline canceled any flights into J.F.K.” on Thursday, said Jason Rabinowitz, a freelance aviation blogger who tracked the cascading pileup as it played out. “They all launched their aircraft, but by the time they got halfway over the Atlantic, they found out they couldn’t land at J.F.K.” As an example, Mr. Rabinowitz cited Iberia Flight 6253, which got halfway to New York from Madrid before making a U-turn and going back to Spain: an eight-hour fight to nowhere. Norwegian Air Flight 7019 made a similar journey Thursday night en route to New York from France. “That was kind of weird,” said Mona Bismuth, 27, a passenger. “We turned around at the southern tip of Greenland.” A passenger on a different flight was sent back to Moscow — twice — because of what was happening in New York. When Kennedy gradually reopened on Friday, the airlines started sending their diverted planes on to Kennedy. The airport’s runways could handle the traffic, but some of its terminals were quickly overwhelmed with planes arriving faster than gates could be cleared for them. That mismatch continued into Saturday, as the airlines played catch-up on the flights they had sent elsewhere or had canceled.

"Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)Whether by car, train or airplane, Sunday travelers can expect significant delays and dangerous conditions because of a snowstorm moving east. 
Amtrak announced modified service for more than 20 trains on Sunday because of inclement weather, after canceling service for six trains on Saturday.
Snow and wind caused the cancellation of more than 650 flights at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Saturday and resulted in an average delay of 50 minutes, the airport said. At John F. Kennedy International Airport, crews were working to keep runways clear Saturday night, the airport said, as it encouraged travelers to confirm upcoming flights with airlines.
JetBlue announced that it has ""proactively cancelled approximately 770 flights through Monday.""
Delta Airlines has issued travel waivers so passengers scheduled on northeastern flights affected by the weather can reschedule.
Meanwhile, two people were killed and two injured in a car accident on a snow-covered, slippery road in Kohler, Wisconsin late Friday night, according to CNN affiliate WDJT.
The four had been traveling in a vehicle that struck a tree, according to WDJT. Police are still investigating the cause of the accident, WDJT reported.
Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories were in effect Sunday morning across a large portion of the country from the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians to the northern Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service.
The winter storm is expected to drop ""moderate to heavy snow"" Sunday morning across the upper Ohio Valley and into northwest Pennsylvania and the interior of New York and New England, the NWS said.
While snowfall is expected to taper off in the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians during the day, heavy snowfall -- as much as 1-2 inches in some places -- will continue in parts of New York and New England through Sunday night, the weather service said.
New York City can expect cold rain, and Boston will see a mix of heavy, wet snow, sleet and ice through the morning, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. 
The storm has brought harsh conditions across the Midwest and through to the East coast this weekend. 
Following a forecast of more than half an inch of freezing rain between northern New Jersey and southern New England, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning at noon Saturday. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state starting at 3 p.m. Saturday.
On Saturday, more than 100 million people were under some form of winter storm watch, warning or advisory from Missouri to Maine.
'Some of the coldest temperatures of the season'
The National Weather Service said Saturday the Midwest and East Coast can expect ""some of the coldest temperatures of the season by Monday morning.""
Temperatures are expected to drop so fast in some areas that any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects would likely freeze.
Highs on Sunday in the Kansas City, Missouri, area -- where the Chiefs will be host to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game -- will be in the 20s.
The extreme cold will follow the storm and move into the rest of the eastern United States on Monday.
Monday's expected high in Boston is 11 degrees, and New York City will top out at 14 degrees. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency is warning residents the wind chill could drop as low as 20 degrees below zero early Monday.
This arctic air is expected to spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

"Joseph A. Gambardello, Anthony R. Wood","A surprisingly vigorous snowfall from a potent winter storm has blanketed the Philadelphia region with heavy snow, icing streets, snarling traffic, and triggering a rash of early closings. The National Weather Service now is calling for 3 to 5 inches in the immediate Philadelphia area. ""We're in the process of updating the forecast,"" said Al Cope, science and operation officer at the weather service office in Mount Holly. Earlier forecasts had called for up to an inch in the city, but at 1 p.m. 2.4 inches had been reported at the official measuring station at Philadelphia International Airport. The first flakes were reported at 10 a.m. at the airport, fortunately coming after the peak morning commute. Then came the surprise. The snow was supposed to mix with sleet and rain, but didn't. ""We thought it was going to be more mix,"" Cope said. However, the temperatures at the surface and in the upper atmosphere stayed colder than expected. It was clear by lunchtime that some places were going to get more snow than expected. A National Weather Service spotter in Radnor Township, Delaware County, reported on phillywx.com that an inch of snow was measured at 11:45 a.m. Not long afterward, another spotter in East Nantmeal, Chester County, reported close to 3 inches. At 1 p.m., ""heavy snow"" was falling, with visibilities of just a quarter mile. Drivers were reporting messy, potentially hazardous, conditions on highways and SEPTA is advising Regional Rail passengers to expect delays of up to 15 minutes due to slippery rails. SEPTA also said the Route 35 bus was suspended until further notice due to road conditions and that service on bus Routes 9, 27, and 65 would terminate at Wissahickon Transportation Center. A Winter Weather Advisory for the region has been extended until 6 p.m. and now includes Jersey Shore counties that had been excluded from the earlier advisory. The advancing storm prompted Central Bucks School District to close for the day, while a number of other school districts in the suburbs announced early dismissals. Chester County government shut down at 2 p.m. The forecast said the snow should change to combination of sleet and freezing rain later in the day in the immediate Philadelphia area before turning to rain after nightfall. The wintry precipitation, however, is likely to last longer north and west of the city, where the affected school districts are located, and the Poconos could get up to four inches of snow by Friday morning. The city of Philadelphia declared a code blue aimed at assisting people experiencing homelessness in cold weather. Further south in the Mid-Atlantic, the storm blanketed the Washington, D.C., area with snow. PennDOT in the meantime dispatched trucks to brine major roadways in advance of the moisture-rich storm's arrival and Philadelphia International Airport is advising anyone who plans to fly today to check with their airline before heading to the airport. The weather service says that after the precipitation turns to all rain, there will be an increased potential for flooding, mainly across southern and coastal New Jersey and the Delmarva peninsula.

Mark Kaufman,"The nor'easter that has shut down much of New England ion Tuesday s reaching its great arms into regions over both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, sucking moisture into the powerful storm. In a technical forecast discussion on Monday night from the National Weather Service forecast office in Boston, meteorologists said the storm was even importing moisture from as far away as the Pacific Ocean. The result — aided by the storm also drawing in cold air from Canada — is a blizzard wherein enough moisture and freezing temperatures can create copious snowfall and high winds. SEE ALSO: Did a nor'easter whip a puffer fish into a tree? An investigation Satellite images captured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) weather satellite GOES-16, shows what exactly is going on with the storm from high above. GOES-16 orbits more than 22,000 miles above Earth, allowing it to capture such wide-field images of the planet. It's high-resolution cameras can also see detailed images of the *nor'easter*, including the eye-like feature near the center of the storm. This is the third nor'easter — which is broadly defined as a winter storm with strong winds blowing from the northeast — to hit New England in two weeks.

Specifically, a blizzard is a storm that has sustained 35 mph winds (or greater) and enough blowing snow to reduce visibility to under a fourth of a mile for at least 3 consecutive hours. And that's what's happening for some parts of the Northeast today, including Boston. This storm is also far from from finished, and it could become Boston's second-largest March snowstorm storm on record.","The nor'easter that has shut down much of New England ion Tuesday s reaching its great arms into regions over both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, sucking moisture into the powerful storm.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A winter storm that dumped heavy snow on the U.S. Midwest, stranding some motorists in Missouri and cancelling dozens of flights, marched east toward Washington on Saturday. 
The weather system is forecast to affect an 1,800-mile (2,900 km) corridor of the United States from Colorado to the mid-Atlantic. It started as rain from Mexico and turned to snow as it met icy air. 
The storm hit Kansas and Missouri on Friday and continued pummeling those states on Saturday, as it extended into parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said U.S. Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Andrew Orrison. 
The storm is dumping its heaviest snowfall on areas west of St. Louis, where about a foot and a half of snow was recorded, with more still falling on Saturday, Orrison said. 
More than 1,200 motorists in Missouri were stranded and there were four deaths on the roads, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a tweet on Saturday. 
It was not immediately clear if the fatalities were all weather-related and a representative for the Missouri Department of Public Safety could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Dozens of flights were canceled at St. Louis Lambert International Airport, which described the onslaught of snow, in a message on Twitter, as one of its biggest single-day winter storms in years. 
Snow is forecast for the Appalachian Mountains and the mid-Atlantic on Saturday evening and Sunday. 
“Given how cold it is across the Midwest and even in the mid-Atlantic region, certainly people who are going to be out are going to want to dress in layered clothing,” Orrison said. 
“To the extent that it’s snowing outside, travel will be hazardous and outright dangerous in some areas,” he said. 
Washington, where many federal government offices are closed because of the U.S. government shutdown, is expected to receive 6 to 8 inches (15 cm to 20 cm) of snow when the storm arrives there, according to the National Weather Service. 
Central and northern Virginia will receive even more, with up to 10 inches (25 cm) of snow possible in some places. 
Bands of icy rain are forecast for areas farther south, including parts of Virginia and South Carolina. 
But the storm will bypass New York City and other parts of the Northeast. Philadelphia is expected to receive a few inches of snow, but areas north of there are expected to be spared, Orrison said.

Andrew Freedman,"The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations. First, there's the cold. The first two weeks of April have been the coldest on record for the Upper Midwest, and even some areas to the south, such as Little Rock, Arkansas, have seen temperatures during this period that are far below average. Such extreme cold is noteworthy given trends in the opposite direction related to global warming. The cold set the stage for a blizzard that slammed the Upper Midwest over the weekend. This storm was so severe that it set all-time records, not just milestones for the heaviest spring snowstorm. SEE ALSO: Researchers hit back at climate change deniers twisting polar bear science A staggering 24.2 inches of snow fell in Green Bay, Wisconsin, making it the heaviest April snowstorm on record, and the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm on record at any time of year. Similarly, Wausau, Wisconsin, picked up 20.7 inches of snow, setting an April snowstorm record and making it the 2nd-heaviest snowstorm of all-time at that location. The snowfall jackpot was Amherst, Wisconsin, where 33 inches fell, according to the National Weather Service. Minneapolis, which is no stranger to snow and cold weather, picked up 14.9 inches of snow, making it their heaviest April snowstorm on record. Thundersnow was reported in and around the Twin Cities as the storm intensified, leading to snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour at times. Another, weaker, snowstorm is slated to move across the Midwest during the next 2 days, bringing several inches of snow to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The thick spring snowpack is raising fears of flooding if temperatures suddenly warm up and heavy rain were to fall in the coming weeks. Then there are the fires. In association with strong storm systems, massive walls of wind-driven flames have swept across the Plains, particularly in Oklahoma, where at least 300,000 acres went up in flames during the past week. Another ""Extremely Critical"" fire weather day looms in the Southwest on Tuesday, including parts of Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, with temperatures soaring into the 90s, winds gusting above 40 miles per hour, and relative humidity plunging to an arid 2 to 5 percent. Average temperature during the first half of April (top) and departures from average (bottom) during the same period. Image: NOAA CPC. The National Weather Service forecast office in Amarillo Texas warned Tuesday morning that ""A regional outbreak of dangerous wind-driven wildfires is possible."" Third, there's the severe weather and flooding. The same storm system that brought blizzard conditions to the Upper Midwest spawned at least a dozen tornadoes across the Southeast on Sunday and Monday, including an EF-2 tornado that struck Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday night. At one point on Monday, a nasty squall line stretched from Florida to the Mid-Atlantic, and rainfall was so intense in New York City that water came pouring into the aging subway system. Air travel was disrupted along the busy East Coast on Monday, particularly at the three major New York City area airports. In Boston, a heavy rain and cold onshore wind challenged runners of the Boston Marathon. And let's not forget the extreme weather whiplash that aggravated millions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic over the weekend, when temperatures in the 70s and 80s Fahrenheit suddenly plunged to the 30s and 40s within a matter of several hours between Saturday and Sunday, thanks to a ""backdoor"" cold front that moved from the northeast to the southwest. Such fronts are most common in the spring, when the temperature difference between the ocean and the land is at its peak. There are some signs of a warmup ahead late in the month and into May, though computer models have shown such glimmers of hope before, only to yank it away at the last minute, in favor of a colder, snowier solution.","The weather in the U.S. has been downright biblical so far this spring, with weather forecasters practically having to borrow pages out of the Book of Revelations.

The paper reported the 59-year-old man may have been homeless.
Seattle officials expanded shelter spaces for adults and families in preparation for the nearing storm, with King County Executive Dow Constantine saying at a news conference that if anyone comes to a shelter facility, wethe county, the citywe will find a place for you to be safe overnight, according to the Times.
People in the Washington area are being advised to limit time outside and keep off roads if they can be avoided, Inslee said. Anyone who absolutely must travel and becomes stranded or trapped in their car is advised to stay inside the vehicle rather risk braving freezing temperatures.
The Washington State Department of Transportation also noted that anyone behind the wheel during the snowstorm should use extreme caution around those working to keep roadways safe.

Bob Lesh,"Weather Resources MADISON, Wis. - A major winter storm will move through the Midwest later Thursday through Friday and could bring significant snowfall to parts of southern Wisconsin. The track of the storm Wednesday would bring the heaviest snow amounts to northern Illinois, with amounts rapidly decreasing as you move north. This would mean 6 to 8 inches of snow in areas near the Wisconsin/Illinois border, 4 to 6 inches in the Madison area and 1 to 4 inches near Wisconsin Dells. Because of the tight gradient in snowfall amounts, any small shift in the track could change the expected snowfall greatly. If the storm shifts north, the amounts will be higher and if it moves south, they will be lower. A Winter Storm Watch has been issued for Thu. night and Friday for far southern Wisconsin. Up to 8"" of accumulation are possible in this area, with a sharply declining gradient to the north.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Climate change is going to have a lot of unpleasant consequences. But at least those of us on the East Coast wont face as many nasty winter snowstorms, right? Well... a new study is throwing a bit of cold water on that silver lining.
Residents of the Northeast are all too familiar with noreasters, cold-weather cyclones that can deliver eye-popping snow totals accompanied by power outages, terrible traffic, massive school closures, and back-breaking shoveling. Research published recently in Geophysical Research Letters looked at how these and other winter snowstorms will change in a warming world. While snowphobes might cheer the late 21st century forecast of less white stuff on the whole, the biggest and baddest stormswhich frequently fall into the noreaster bucketare unlikely to go away.
The idea is well have less total snowstorms in the future, but when you do have a snowstorm, its more likely itll be an intense snowstorm than a weak one, study author Colin Zarzycki, an assistant professor in Penn States Department of Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, told Earther.
Zarycki reached this bummer conclusion by looking at 35 different climate model simulations run by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (he conducted the research while he was a project scientist there). These models are all based on the same assumptions about our future climate (in this case, a high carbon emissions scenario known as RCP 8.5) but use slightly different starting conditions that can lead to different outcomes for the weather. He then wrote an algorithm to pluck out individual snowstorms from these models and create a probability distribution of different snowy futures. 
This approach is especially helpful for predicting how big, infrequently occurring storms might change, Zarycki said.
The analysis showed that although winter storms will be more likely to dump their water as rain in a warmer future, when snow does fall it could pile up even higher than it does today. Thats because warmer oceans will provide more fuel for storms, and a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. Overall, the study predicts the number of big winter storms to look roughly the same by centurys end. 
Several experts not involved with the study said these results made sense. The study points out the obvious, that as things warm, we are more apt to get rain rather than snow, NCAR climate scientist Kevin Trenberth told Earther in an email. But it also points out we can still get big snows. The oceans are warming and thus can readily supply plenty of moisture. Even in a warmer world, though, we still have winter and it gets cold over land and to the North.
MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel also thought studys conclusions about snowfall seemed reasonable but added that its important to consider the coastal flooding impacts of winter storms, too. Indeed, noreasters often produce worse flooding for the northeastern U.S. than hurricanes, and sea level rise will give those icy, car-entombing floodwaters some extra juice.
Zarycki said factoring in the effects of storm surge was an important direction for future work. Hes also hoping to look at how shifts in population density (people moving into or out of cities) could affect future winter storm hazards.
This looks at the big picture of snowfall, but some next generation climate models might allow us to drill down on what this means for New York City or Philly, he said, adding that these hyper-local impacts require really big computers.
Bottom line for East Coasters, though? Youre going to need to keep that snow shovel on hand at least until the end of the century.","Climate change is going to have a lot of unpleasant consequences.

More than 800,000 customers were without electricity, including some who have been without power since last Friday's powerful winter storm. Heavy snow and icy roads prompted officials to close schools and cancel or delay thousands of flights across the region. It is the second storm to hit the US East Coast in less than a week. More snow and wind gusts of up to 55 miles (88km/h) were expected to stretch across eastern New York through northern Maine on Thursday. Up to 18 inches (45cm) of snow could fall on northern New England, according to the National Weather Service.

By Journal Staff,"The most powerful winter storm of 2018 so far for East Idaho could dump over a foot of snow on parts of the region this weekend. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm watch on Friday afternoon in East Idaho in anticipation of the “major winter storm” and then escalated that watch to a full-blown winter storm warning on Saturday morning. The snow started falling in some northern areas of East Idaho on Friday night but the weather service said the snow won’t become widespread until the bulk of the storm begins to hit some time between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. The storm is not expected to exit East Idaho until late Sunday night. “If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency,” the weather service said. Winds of up to 50 mph are in the forecast Saturday and Sunday because of the storm and the weather service has issued a wind advisory as a result. The gusts are expected to be so strong that controlling a vehicle could be difficult, especially on the region’s interstates. Conditions are expected to be so snowy and windy in much of East Idaho that the snowplows might not be able to keep up resulting in roads including major highways being shut down, the weather service said. Motorists are being urged to use extreme caution while driving because of the expected “severe winter weather conditions,” the weather service said. Two major roads — Highways 32 and 33 — were shut down Friday night because of blowing and drifting snow. Highway 32 is still closed between Ashton and Tetonia while Highway 33 has been reopened. Authorities closed Highway 20 Saturday evening between Ashton and the Idaho-Montana border because of the storm. It’s not clear when the highway will reopen. Even lower elevation areas such as Pocatello, Chubbuck, American Falls, Dubois, Burley, Atomic City, Aberdeen, Fort Hall, Blackfoot, Shelley, Idaho Falls, Ammon, Rigby, Rexburg, Arco and Preston could receive up to three inches of snow from the storm. But as with the vast majority of winter storms in East Idaho, the higher elevations are going to be hit hardest. The Island Park, Ashton, St. Anthony, Spencer, Driggs and Victor areas could receive five to eight inches of snow Saturday afternoon through Sunday night from the storm. The weather service said it’s even possible some of those areas could receive up to 17 inches of snow. Farther south, the Palisades, Bone, Swan Valley, Wayan, Henry, Lava Hot Springs, Soda Springs, Grace, Bancroft, McCammon, Arimo, Downey, Thatcher, Inkom, Montpelier, Georgetown, Paris and St. Charles areas could receive five to 10 inches of snow Saturday night through Sunday night. The weather service said it’s possible the higher mountains in those areas could receive 12 inches or more of snow. The Malad, Arbon, Rockland, Malta, Oakley and Albion areas and the Interstate 84 corridor from the Idaho-Utah border to the Interstate 86 junction are expected to receive up to four inches of snow Sunday morning through Sunday night. The higher mountains in these areas could receive up to 10 inches of snow. The storm will also bring winds of up to 50 mph to East Idaho, making for very dangerous conditions on the region’s roads. The weather service stated, “Winds of this power will drift and blow snow, making road clearing operations difficult at best, with temporary road closures possible.” The weather service said driving on higher elevation roads and over mountain passes will be extremely hazardous. Downed tree limbs and branches are also possible because of the powerful winds Saturday and Sunday. Elsewhere in the state, winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect in the central Idaho mountains, Northern Idaho and in parts of south central and southwest Idaho, excluding the Boise, Mountain Home, Jerome and Twin Falls areas. Winter storm warnings, winter storm watches and/or winter weather advisories are in effect in all of the states surrounding Idaho.","Idaho State Journal WINTER STORM WARNING: Over foot of snow could fall on much of East Idaho Idaho State Journal The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning in East Idaho in anticipation of a ""major winter storm"" that's forecast to hit the …",2018-02-17T20:49:11Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Idahostatejournal.com'}",WINTER STORM WARNING: Over foot of snow could fall on much of East Idaho - Idaho State Journal,https://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/winter-storm-warning-over-foot-of-snow-could-fall-on/article_de20bec5-03ec-52f2-83f6-f909d827cb8a.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/idahostatejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/ba/0ba5190c-6d93-587c-90a0-993d6381f309/5a8906ea8b3f4.image.jpg?resize=840%2C630,,Idahostatejournal.com,snow storm,1
Storm Team 4,"What to Know Two rounds of snow may hammer the tri-state early this week, impacting the area Tuesday night through the day Wednesday Three nor'easters earlier this month already cut power to hundreds of thousands of people and wreaked havoc on the region's transit systems Storm Team 4 says the active weather pattern is expected to continue through remainder of March, meaning more serious storms are possible A large, developing two-pronged storm system could bring two rounds of snow on Tuesday and Wednesday, dropping inches of snow on the tri-state to kick off the start of spring as the weather-battered region yearns for winter to end. Storm Team 4 says the storm system that’s currently developing out west is shaping up to arrive in the tri-state by Tuesday — the first day of spring. The initial bands of moisture will move in Tuesday afternoon, and heavy snow is possible in central and southern New Jersey by the evening commute. The snow will just graze the city, though, and points north of town stay completely dry. The next phase of the storm system develops offshore on Wednesday morning. Storm Team 4 says it could bring light to moderate snow throughout the entire tri-state, especially before noon. The Most Extreme Nor'easters in US History Several inches of snow are possible in central and south Jersey before the storm pulls away on Wednesday evening, but the five boroughs should expect lighter accumulations of about 3 inches or less. Blustery weather arrives as the storm pulls away, and temperatures will remain below average to kick off the spring season this week, Storm Team 4 says. More rain and snow showers are in the forecast next weekend, but it will be sunny and approaching 50 degrees by Tuesday, according to Storm Team 4. The potential storms come on the heels of a trio of deadly nor’easters that ravaged parts of the tri-state this month, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people and crippling East Coast travel. Storm Team 4 says the active weather pattern is expected to continue for the remainder of March, meaning even more serious storms are possible. Dramatic Images Show Wrath of Twin March Nor'easters The first nor’easter in the series, on March 2, canceled thousands of flights and wreaked havoc on the region’s commuter rail systems, including Amtrak, which shut down its popular Northeast Corridor. It hit New Jersey and the Hudson Valley hardest, with Sussex County seeing more than 13 inches of snow and parts of Orange County getting more than 9 inches. The second, on March 7, knocked power out for hundreds of thousands of people in New Jersey and the Hudson Valley. Rockland and Orange counties recorded more than 20 inches and Passaic and Essex counties saw more than 20 inches. The third, on March 12, grazed most of the tri-state but hammered Long Island and Connecticut with snow. Southampton got more than 18 inches and Newtown recorded 11 inches. At least three people in the tri-state were killed in the nor’easters: an 11-year-old Hudson Valley boy was hit by a tree during the first; an 88-year-old woman was hit by a tree outside her Hudson Valley home during the second; and an unidentified New Jersey driver was electrocuted when he drove onto a live wire.

Heather Dockray,"If you want to predict President Donald Trump's next move, look no further than Fox News' hit propaganda disasterpiece, Fox and Friends. Trump has long been a fan of the show, frequently tweeting about show segments when he's not busy spreading anti-Muslim venom.

SEE ALSO: Someone created a storm lamp that produces lightning every time Trump tweets Take a look for yourself. Image: dan snow/reddit Dan Snow, a masters in public policy student at the University of Chicago, posted the graph on r/dataisbeautiful Thursday. Snow used data from the Trump Twitter Archive GitHub to plot the relationship. ""I had been playing around with plotting y-axis time data to show the number of hours I slept for each day of the month. I found the Trump Twitter Archive and figured I could do the same thing for all his tweets. The Fox &amp; Friends thing was the suggestion of a friend after we noticed the high density of tweets between 6 and 9 a.m.,"" Snow said in an email. It's important to emphasize that correlation does not equal causation. There are other factors that could influence Trump's early morning tweeting — maybe that's when he's simply the most alert, or when he starts his heavy television for the day. ""We have no idea what Trump is actually doing from 6-9 a.m. or if F&amp;F is the cause of his increased tweet density,"" Snow said. Still, there are reasons to suspect a more meaningful relationship. The Fox &amp; Friends hosts have mentioned on air that the president loves 'em and concepts from the show, or its commercials, have ended up repeated on the president's Twitter feed, or spewing right out of his own mouth. Remember when he t old the New York Times you could buy health insurance for $12 a year?

Andrew Freedman,"Severe weather has been hammering parts of the south central Mediterranean this week, with heavy snow falling in the Alps, torrential rains in lower elevations along with powerful winds, and high waves affecting Italy, in particular. Deadly flash flooding has also occurred in Greece, as the low pressure area sitting to that country's west vaults moisture northward around its eastern periphery. The storm system responsible for this inclement weather is just getting started, however. Computer models show the storm will become a small but powerful hybrid system with some of the characteristics of a tropical cyclone typically found in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin. SEE ALSO: Major federal climate report rebuts everything Trump administration has said about climate change Such storms, known as ""medicanes,"" are relatively rare, but not unheard of. The storm is expected to move south and east of Italy through Thursday while intensifying, and then hug the coast of Greece, where it could bring damaging winds, heavy rain, high waves, and other hazards. By late this week and into the weekend, the storm — be it a purely tropical system or a hybrid storm — will be located just southwest of the Greek coast, with heavy rain and severe thunderstorms affecting that country. During the Thursday through Saturday period, the low pressure area is forecast to move southeast of Italy, and to the west of Greece, while becoming better organized. Low atmospheric wind shear (meaning winds won't change much in direction or speed with height), is forecast for that area, and ocean surface temperatures are relatively mild. Computer model projections show a small, closed circulation system that could have subtropical to tropical characteristics, with a ring of thunderstorms and strong winds surrounding a calmer inner core. Surface wind forecast for Friday, Nov. 17, 2017. Note the donut-shaped circulation near the Greek coast. Image: weatherbell When tropical systems, either subtropical or fully tropical, occur in the Mediterranean, they are usually much smaller in area than their cousins in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, and there's actually some scientific debate over how to classify them in the first place. The structure of a storm matters because it governs how such storms may affect areas that they hit. Interestingly, medicanes typically occur during October and November, which is at the tail end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Satellite image of 2014 medicane that struck Malta. Image: eumetsat A medicane in 2014 struck Malta, bringing winds of up to 154 kilometers per hour, or 95 miles per hour.

Minnesota has faced snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Hundreds of schools canceled classes Thursday. More than 200 accidents were reported throughout the state. A video from the Minnesota Department of Transportation shows every power line down along a strength of Highway 59 near Fulda, in the southeastern side of the state.
In Minnesota, the bad weather will continue through Friday, with winds gusting more than to 50, according to the National Weather Service.
Some of the snow might be tinted orange, the Twin Cities NWS said. ""The color is likely due to dust that was blown by high winds all the way from west Texas.""
Whiteout conditions were reported Wednesday night northeast of Denver to the Nebraska state line, Colorado Public Radio reported. Some major roads were closed for hundreds of miles because of poor visibility and blowing snow. Colorado DOT closed 150 miles of Interstate 76, and Interstate 70 was closed between Kansas and the Denver metro area, CPR said.
In Nebraska, Interstate 80 and Highway 30 were closed on Thursday morning between Lexington and Wyoming a distance of about 200 miles.

Bill Novak | Wisconsin State Journal,"A major winter storm heading toward the Upper Midwest at the tail end of the weekend could bring heavy snow to northern Wisconsin and a mix of precipitation to southern Wisconsin, forecasters say. No watches or warnings have been issued by the National Weather Service at this time, but the forecast for the Madison area is calling for a chance of sleet and freezing rain late Sunday night into Monday morning, switching to all rain then back to snow late Monday night. Heading into the weekend, it should be sunny but cold on Friday with a high of 25, then 32 and a chance of snow on Saturday. 27 Storm Track meteorologist Branden Borremans said Sunday should be partly sunny and breezy with a high of 39, followed by a high of 43 during the mixed bag of precipitation on Monday. Snow could linger on Tuesday with a high near 34, while Wednesday should be mostly sunny and 28, the Weather Service said. Sun and highs in the mid- to upper 30s are forecast for Thursday and next Friday. Thursday's high in Madison was 44, 13 degrees above normal and 19 degrees below the record high of 63 for Feb. 15, set in 1921. The low on Thursday was 33, 18 degrees above normal and 47 degrees above the record low of 14 below for the date, set in 1920. No rain or snow fell at the airport on Thursday, keeping the February precipitation total at 0.87 inches, 0.17 inches above normal. The record precipitation total on Feb. 15 was 0.48 inches in 1992, with the precipitation coming down as the record snowfall of 4.9 inches for the date. For the meteorological winter of December through February, Madison has received 3.28 inches of precipitation, 0.39 inches below normal, and 2.55 inches since Jan.1, 0.62 inches above normal. Snowfall totals stayed at 12.9 inches for February, 7.0 inches above normal; 26.8 inches for winter, 5.5 inches below normal; and 27.1 inches for the snow season of July to June, 9.3 inches below normal.","Madison.com Big winter storm could bring freezing rain, sleet starting Sunday night Madison.com A major winter storm heading toward the Upper Midwest at the tail end of the weekend could bring heavy snow to northern Wisconsin and a mix of precipitation to sou…",2018-02-16T13:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Madison.com'}","Big winter storm could bring freezing rain, sleet starting Sunday night - Madison.com",http://host.madison.com/wsj/weather/big-winter-storm-could-bring-freezing-rain-sleet-starting-sunday/article_1a271ef3-85ca-5024-8b6c-8746a8952e35.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/host.madison.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/a2/4a27e4a3-2a3c-5454-8c85-8fbe2fa4e4eb/5a86dfacc9ebf.image.png?crop=960%2C540%2C0%2C100&resize=960%2C540&order=crop%2Cresize,,Madison.com,snow storm,1

(Photo: Daniel Mears / The Detroit News) Buy Photo Winter Storm Mateo is hitting the region forcing the cancellation of hundreds of schools, flight cancellations and declarations of snow emergencies throughout the region. Snowfall of 6-9 inches is expected as the storm will continue to bear down on Metro Detroit through Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Trent Frey, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in White Lake Township said many areas of Metro Detroit can expect the snowfall to hit the ""upper range"" of the predicted snowfall by the time this storm front passes. ""It's going to be messy,"" Frey said. The weather service issued a winter storm warning for Washtenaw, Wayne, Lenawee, and Monroe counties through midnight Friday. Hopeful travelers hoping to get out of town at Detroit Metro Airport braved long security lines and some trepidation early Friday. A line of at least 200 people waited to clear security around 6 a.m. Friday at the airport. Communities declared a snow emergency as early as Thursday evening in preparation for the storm. Schools throughout the region closed Friday and the storm is expected to continue throughout the day. The cancellations racked up Friday with more than 110 flights were canceled at the airport, according to FlightStats.com. The canceled flights included trips to Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York, New Jersey, Flordia, Illinois, Ohio and Maine. In addition, meteorologists say light accumulating snow is possible Saturday night into Sunday as low pressure tracks through the eastern Ohio Valley. No more than a couple of inches are expected. Extended forecast Friday: Snow with a high near 28 degrees and a low of 18 degrees. Up to 9 inches of snow is expected to fall in the region. Saturday: Cloudy with a high near 28 degrees and a low of about 20 degrees. Snow is likely after 1 p.m. with less than half an inch possible. Sunday: Snow before 1 p.m. with an inch possible.

,"A winter storm watch has been posted for Wednesday afternoon and night for interior southern New England as our next storm system approaches from the south. The energy for the storm is just now becoming better understood by the computer models, so the forecast is still subject to quite a bit of variability. The biggest challenge over the next 24 hours will be to determine exactly where the rain-snow line will end up — and at what time the changeover occurs. via GIPHY A burst of snow then rain moves into southern New England Wednesday. Credit: COD Weather This particular storm has a lot of moisture and a difference of just two or three hours in terms of snow changing to rain would be the equivalent of that many inches as well. This is going to be a heavier and wetter snow, and, with the change to rain, it’s only going to become even more difficult to move as time goes on Wednesday afternoon into the night. This means you should try to remove the snow as soon as possible during the change to rain. I don’t expect the Wednesday morning commute to be impacted. However, the Wednesday evening commute could be a very big mess. If the snow arrives early enough on Wednesday, there will likely be some cancellations or early dismissals from schools and businesses. This isn’t a big nor’easter but where it stays all snow the potential exists for 6 to 12 inches, most likely into southern New Hampshire, Maine, and much of Vermont. Logan airport won’t shut down or anything along those lines, but some flights likely will be delayed or canceled during the middle of the day Wednesday. We’ll get a pretty good burst of snow during the middle part of Wednesday with accumulation rates approaching an inch an hour for awhile. This storm is part of a series of storms that is going to be affecting New England over the next two weeks. I’ve written about the fact that winter isn’t over and an active jet stream seems very likely through the middle of the month. The challenge with these upcoming systems is going to be the rain-snow lines and the amount of cold air in place during them. It’s not surprising that we’re getting a storm this week. We’ve had snow the first two weeks of February for the past several years, and, of course, this week is also the 40th anniversary of the Blizzard of 1978.

Andrew Freedman,"The calendar may say it's the first day of spring, but it will seem more like the movie Groundhog Day along the East Coast on Tuesday. The fourth nor'easter in just three weeks will begin to take shape across the Mid-Atlantic, as the first of two waves of low pressure spreads a wintry mix of snow, sleet, and rain from West Virginia to Delaware. The main show, though, appears to be set for Tuesday night through Wednesday night, possibly into part of Thursday, from Washington, D.C. northeastward to Boston. Once again, an atmospheric disturbance diving out of Canada and across parts of the U.S. will spawn an intensifying area of low pressure just off the Mid-Atlantic coast. SEE ALSO: Third nor'easter in 2 weeks to slam New England: What's going on here? The same ingredients that have come together to produce blockbuster spring snowstorms three times already this month, including snow totals above 2 feet in some cases, will combine to yield a powerful coastal storm that will throw moisture from the North Atlantic inland, where it will fall as heavy, wet snow. Dip, or trough, in the jet stream projected for March 23, 2018. Image: weatherbell analytics. The previous storms have been high-impact affairs, with tens of thousands without power from each event, as the wet snow brings down trees and power lines, and strong winds take out branches along the shore. This time around, the storm won't be as strong, though power outages are once again possible anywhere the snow accumulates more than about 4 inches, which as of Monday evening appeared to be the most populated stretch of the country, including the cities of D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Hartford, Providence, and Boston. In urban areas, the high sun angle of mid-March may make it difficult for the snow to stick on roadways, but as long as it snows at a heavy rate of 1 to 3 inches per hour, snow should accumulate.

A couple of key factors have persisted this March that have sparked storms near the East Coast and caused them to get hung up there. A dip, or trough, in the jet stream exists across the east. Upstream, across northeastern Canada, parts of the North Atlantic, and southern Greenland, weather systems are configured in a way that effectively blocks storms from moving off the East Coast. Lower atmosphere temperatures in the Arctic from Oct. to Feb. 2018. Image: NCEp/ncar via zack labe. This allows them to intensify before moving out to sea, and be slow-moving enough to bring high snow totals, strong winds, and potentially damaging coastal flooding. The repetitive winter storms this March fit the climate change narrative that some researchers have been putting forward for several years now through peer-reviewed research. Specifically, as Arctic temperatures increase due to human-caused global warming, and sea ice is reduced, it is having ramifications throughout midlatitude weather patterns. The Arctic had one of its warmest winter seasons on record this year, with sea ice hovering near or at record lows. One study, published in Nature Communications on March 13, provides statistical evidence of links between ""an unusually warm Arctic and cold continents."" What's more, this study, which builds off other previously published work, showed that the influence of Arctic warming is most likely to be felt in the eastern U.S. during mid-to-late winter, rather than early on in the season. ""... We show that in the period of accelerated Arctic warming, heavy snowfalls in the Northeastern U.S. have become more frequent,"" said Judah Cohen, chief seasonal forecaster at AER, a Verisk company, via email. ""So though a heavy snowfall in March is not unheard of or rare it is the frequency of the heavy snowfalls that seems to be changing."" While statistical links have been put forward between Arctic warming and particular weather patterns in the midlatitudes, the precise physical mechanisms through which these effects are occurring have not yet been proven, and research is ongoing.","The calendar may say it's the first day of spring, but it will seem more like the movie Groundhog Day along the East Coast on Tuesday.

SARAH VOWELL,"Bozeman, Mont. — Here in the Mountain West, there are no longer four seasons, only two: winter and wildfire. (Unless you’re a tourist, in which case: ski season and fly fishing.) Come August, my sister and I will make our annual bet, for pizza, on what date the first snow will fall in Bozeman, our hometown. I always lose rooting for the earliest possible flurries, since the snows snuff out the region’s last, stubborn wildfires. Then, when the smoke finally stops wafting across the Gallatin Valley, I can put away my eyedrops and see clearly which neighbors fail to abide by the Northern Hemisphere’s most sacred social contract, shoveling one’s sidewalk. Who cares about Republicans and Democrats? In this climate, there are only snow-shoveling solid citizens or the deadbeats whose slippery walks pose a daily existential threat to the brittle bones of my nice, elderly mom. Looking back on this neck of the woods’ multiplying struggles with the effects of global warming — and drying — I have come to think of June 14, 1988, as the first day of the rest of our lives. On that date 30 years ago, lightning struck the Custer National Forest northeast of Yellowstone National Park, igniting the Storm Creek fire, the first of that hot, dry, windy summer’s major infernos to spread into the park. By mid-July, lightning had also sparked the Shoshone, Fan, Red, Clover and Mink fires. On Aug. 20, fireballs conveyed by 80-mile-per-hour winds ravaged 165,000 acres in a single day remembered as Black Saturday. On Sept. 1, a headline in this newspaper announced, “ U.S. Forest Fires Worst Since 1919.” By Sept. 11, when the first snows started to put an end to the ordeal, 1.4 million acres of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned, including more than a third of America’s oldest and most beloved national park.","It’s almost like we have just two seasons now, winter and wildfire.",2018-06-13T23:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Contributing Op-Ed Writer: Shouting ‘Fire!’ in the Burning West,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/opinion/wildfire-west-yellowstone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/14/opinion/14Vowell/14Vowell-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
Kaitlyn Schwers,"As a strong winter storm approaches northeastern Kansas and northern Missouri, a winter weather advisory has been issued for the Kansas City metropolitan area, and is expected to be in effect from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The advisory includes Leavenworth, Wyandotte and Johnson counties in Kansas and Platte, Clay and Jackson counties in Missouri. Sundays forecast calls for about 1 to 4 inches of snow in the Kansas City area with winds around 40 to 45 mph, which will lead to near whiteout conditions and snow covered roads, the weather service said in a tweet Saturday afternoon. According to the forecast, the Kansas City area will see rain Sunday morning followed by snow falling after 10 a.m. The chance of precipitation is 100 percent, the weather service said. In areas north of Interstate 70, the weather service warned of blizzard conditions and blowing and drifting snow with accumulations of 4 to 9 inches and winds around 40 to 45 mph. A blizzard warning was issued for parts of northeastern Kansas and northern Missouri, and will be in effect from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday. The weather service said the combination of heavy snow and strong winds will lead to whiteout conditions and dangerous travel on area roads. Travel on Sunday during the storm is highly discouraged due to these potential impacts, the weather service said. Crews with the Kansas Department of Transportation in the Kansas City area have started making plans ahead of the storm. In a tweet, KDOT said crews are preparing to come in overnight and start plowing and treating the roads as rain turns to snow Sunday morning. It has also asked drivers to avoid traveling during this time. The Missouri Department of Transportation posted on Twitter that those who must travel on the roads Sunday should check the traveler maps ahead of time for road conditions. In a news release Saturday, a spokesman for Kansas City International and Charles B.

Andrew Freedman,"Residents of Southern New England are used to snowstorms, including the classic blizzards that can stalk this region like a hunter tracks prey. Such storms, known as nor'easters for the direction that the wind comes from, can shut down areas from New York City to Portland, Maine, and bring damaging coastal flooding, feet of snow, and widespread power outages. However, even the hardiest of New Englanders are likely growing weary, as the third major nor'easter in a parade of powerful storms is projected to hit beginning Monday night. SEE ALSO: What is bombogenesis? This storm is not predicted to track close enough to the coast to spread heavy snow well inland, toward New York and New Jersey, like last week's storm did. But eastern Massachusetts can expect near blizzard to blizzard conditions by Tuesday morning, with snowfall totals potentially nearing 2 feet in some locations, according to the National Weather Service. Essentially, the atmosphere is acting like a rechargeable battery, with major storms every three to five days, followed by a period of unusually cool, calm weather. Computer model projection of the nor'easter on March 13, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The new storm will hit at a time when thousands of people are still without power in the region due to the tree and power line damage the last storm caused. Some areas in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey are still littered with downed branches and even entire trees split in half. This coming storm is not likely to cause nearly as much damage to trees and the electrical infrastructure, since it will bring fluffier snow, rather than the pasty, wet cement of the last nor'easter. There's still a chance the latest nor'easter will track further away from the coast or closer to it, which would significantly change predicted snowfall amounts, but computer models are honing in on a track off the coast of Cape Cod. The latest nor'easter will likely end a remarkably stormy run of weather for early March, making this winter bookended by a frigid outbreak around New Years and a snowstorm blitz just before spring, with well above average temperatures sandwiched in between. Computer model depiction of the Greenland block, outlined by the blue square. Image: tropicaltidbits.com To understand why there has been such a barrage of storms, one must look to the large-scale weather pattern in place across the Northern Hemisphere that led up to this stormy period. As reported in February, the polar vortex, which is a semi-permanent area of low pressure at high altitudes above the Arctic with strong winds swirling around it, split into two pieces. One lobe of the polar vortex established itself over Siberia and Europe, leading to the ""Beast from the East"" cold and snow outbreak there. Another slipped into the Western U.S. for a time. Meanwhile, weird things were happening in the Arctic, where it was record-warm for the month of February. The region may soon set a record for the least amount of sea ice cover present at the end of the winter — also known as the lowest sea ice maximum. This is in keeping with trends toward rapidly increasing air temperatures during winter, and thinner, younger sea ice that covers less area over time. At the same time, conditions across the Pacific Ocean, including the tropical Pacific, set off a chain of events that altered the shape of the jet stream — the highway of air at upper levels of the atmosphere, which steers storms and helps energize them. Then, a massive block formed over Greenland, as a pattern of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation or NAO, plunged to record negative territory. When the NAO is in a negative phase, it ups the odds for snowstorms in the eastern U.S. and Europe, although it does not guarantee them. Earlier this month, the NAO index plunged to a record low, which is indicative of how primed the atmosphere is for major storms. Together, these events set the stage for a fusillade of storms to blast the East Coast, among other parts of the world. The Greenland block is absolutely key to this, since it prevents weather systems from simply slinking off out to sea, and allows different branches of the jet stream to come together, or ""phase,"" and form a rapidly intensifying storm. Here's how Jason Furtado, an assistant professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, explained what's going on, via email: The jet stream acts as the storm track. The southward displacement of the polar jet stream across the Eastern US (trough) during Greenland blocking/negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) episodes facilitates storm systems to track across the Midwest or Southeast and eventually off the Eastern Seaboard. Placing these potent systems over the warm Atlantic waters allows them to rapidly intensify and form Nor’easters. The blocking over the North Atlantic also helps to (a) increase winds from the storm system (pressure gradient) and (b) slow the storm system’s progress to the north and east, sometimes even forcing it out to the south. The offshore tracks for these systems with the block in place allows for cold air to take hold across the Northeast and thus make for rather big snowstorms. The low pressure area forecast to hit southern New England on Monday night and Tuesday will be the third straight storm to undergo bombogenesis, meaning its minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such bomb cyclones are typically accompanied by strong winds, as the air rushes in toward the center of the storm. Without the Greenland block, it's unlikely that all the ingredients would come together three times in a row for major East Coast storms. Think of it as a matchmaker: The Greenland block is facilitating a hook up between weather disturbances pinwheeling across North America, and raising the odds that they'll meet and get busy somewhere off the Mid-Atlantic coast. ""This is not unprecedented per se given the pattern in place (e.g., Feb 2010 'Snowmaggedon' in DC/Mid-Atlantic; Dec 2010-Jan 2011 for the Northeast),"" Furtado added. ""These Greenland block patterns (and post-sudden stratospheric warming episodes) tip the scale toward more frequent and/or intense nor’easters."" A string of storms like this one is not unheard of in New England, as the atmosphere can fall into a pattern that produces a storm every four or five days. That's why some months appear to be rainy every weekend while the workweek is sunny and gorgeous. Interestingly, this next nor'easter hitting tonight is likely to help change the current weather pattern, with the Greenland block breaking down somewhat in coming days. What about global warming? Studies show that there are connections between Arctic climate change and midlatitude weather patterns, particularly cold weather outbreaks in Europe, as well as more stubborn, blocking patterns such as the one we're in the grips of now. However, this is still a contested area of climate science, with some studies showing evidence of links between declining Arctic sea ice and the jet stream, and others failing to detect such connections. Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk company, has been studying the potential links between Arctic climate change and extreme weather in the Northeast and Europe, among other areas. His work shows that as the Arctic warms, the odds of heavy snows in the Northeast somewhat paradoxically goes up. ""So though a heavy snowfall in March is not unheard of or rare, it is the frequency of the heavy snowfalls that seems to be changing,"" he said in an email. ""Also maybe a little more rarer is to have three destructive/disruptive storms in quick succession. But I do think this is consistent with the pattern that follows a polar vortex split over time,"" he said. A recent study Cohen contributed to showed that polar vortex splits have become more frequent as Arctic sea ice has declined and Arctic warming has accelerated. In addition, it's clear, that the impact of nor'easters, including the recent ones, is getting worse due to global warming. This is particularly the case with coastal flooding, since sea level rise is providing storms with a higher launching pad for floods than was the case in previous years. For example, the first of the three storms gave Boston it's third-highest tide level on record, with flooding occurring during at east five high tide cycles up and down the coast from Maine to Connecticut. Also, global warming is causing seas to warm overall, and air temperatures to increase, which results in an uptick in the amount of available water vapor in the air to power major storms like nor'easters. Precipitation extremes, including heavy snow events during the winter, are becoming more common as the climate continues to change. Interestingly, global warming might be giving people the impression that heavy snows don't occur as much anymore, making these nor'easters more surprising. As University of Georgia researcher Marshall Shepherd said in an email: ""The string of nor'easters is having a significant impact, but it is somewhat amusing that cold and nor'easters have garnered so much attention, the changes in our climate have made having winter newsworthy.""","Residents of Southern New England are used to snowstorms, including the classic blizzards that can stalk this region like a hunter tracks prey.

Nancy Gaarder World-Herald staff writer,"Morning commuters in the Omaha area will come across some slick spots Friday morning, especially at intersections, after the region saw some light snow overnight.
The road conditions were much better than what drivers experienced Thursday in central Nebraska. A stretch of about 145 miles of Interstate 80 from roughly Grand Island to North Platte was closed for several hours Thursday while the storm howled and crews cleared crashes.
It reopened about 7:15 p.m. No severe injuries were reported.
The Nebraska Department of Roads reported Thursday evening that most of the roads in the central and northeast parts of the state were completely covered in ice and snow.

Miserably cold weather is forecast for Friday as temperatures remain locked in the teens and low 20s across the state and strong winds drive down wind chills.
Temperatures should rise a bit over the weekend before plunging again early in the week.
That means people should plan for a windy, cold New Years Eve. In Omaha, strong winds could drop wind chills into the single digits for the citys New Years Eve fireworks show.
Thursday, the Nebraska State Patrol helped more than 100 drivers who had trouble with the weather.
In western Kansas, a person was killed in a storm-related collision between a car and semitrailer truck on Interstate 70, according to WDAF-TV.
About 75 miles of I-70 was closed for hours because of the storm.
The storm similarly caused problems in the Dakotas and northern Minnesota.
Cliff Cole, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said the storm didnt produce the widespread high snow totals originally forecast.
For the most part, 5 to 6 inches of snow fell in western and northern Nebraska. Up to a foot of snow had been forecast.
North of Grand Island, there was a report of 8.5 inches in Greeley County, according to Jordan Thies, a meteorologist at the Hastings weather service office.
But strong winds gusting up to 55 mph were enough to pile up drifts between 1 and 3 feet high in some spots.
Winds were expected to be a problem into Friday morning before abating.","Morning commute could be slick in spots; bitter cold spreads across region Omaha World-Herald Snow Blankets Parts Of Northern, Western Minnesota During Winter Storm WCCO - CBS Minnesota Storm whips up blizzards, dumps snow in Dakotas, Minnesota The Associated…",2018-12-28T06:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Omaha.com'}",Morning commute could be slick in spots; bitter cold spreads across region - Omaha World-Herald,https://www.omaha.com/weather/morning-commute-could-be-slick-in-spots-bitter-cold-spreads/article_df844533-5c82-57b7-aa8f-987feb91cdf6.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/5c/25c05b4d-4c23-5a27-9658-7c5cd51a4b15/5c2574405a6f5.image.jpg?crop=1511%2C1133%2C158%2C0&resize=840%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Omaha.com,snow storm,1
KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"Credit Claire O'Neill/The New York Times In the middle of a nor’easter that disrupted travel in the Northeast and inundated areas already drenched from last week’s storm, some New Yorkers and others on the East Coast made a resounding discovery: “thundersnow.” The curious phenomenon, when thunder and lighting are heard and seen during a snowstorm, has been documented since at least the year 1099. But its rarity — a 2009 analysis found that only 0.07 percent of snowfalls are accompanied by thunder — means that it never ceases to excite. The captivating nature of thundersnow was documented in an article in The New York Times on Sept. 24, 1884 : “I don’t believe there has been a thunderstorm that I have witnessed for the past 30 years,” said a gentleman of this city, “which has not given me occasion to ask scores of people if they had ever seen a thunder and lightning snowstorm, and I never met but one yet, besides myself who ever had.” (That gentleman’s stories about thundersnow must have never gotten old.) There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&amp;M University. The first, which is most common to the central United States, mirrors the way regular thunderstorms are formed: Warmer, moist air close to the ground rises and mixes with colder, denser air higher up in the atmosphere. As the hot air moves up and the cold air moves down, the atmospheric instability can trigger lightning and the thunder that comes with it. In the case of a thundersnow event, air closer to the ground is just warm enough to rise and create atmospheric mixing, but it’s still cold enough that falling snow can stay frozen. This often happens in the Rockies, when the mountains trap pockets of warm air. “The air is cold enough down low that as the frozen precipitation falls out of it, it never encounters a warm enough layer of air to melt,” said Dr. Nielsen-Gammon. So instead of rain and lightning, there’s snow and lightning. The second scenario tends to happen around the Great Lakes in early winter. A thunderstorm develops even though temperatures are very cold, thanks to the relatively warm moist air that comes from the lakes. It’s intertwined with the same conditions that bring the region its lake effect snow. In the third scenario the low pressure of a powerful winter storm creates strong upward motions in the air, generating the atmospheric instability that in a typical thunderstorm would be driven by temperature changes. This is likely what led to New York City’s thundersnow. Even when the conditions are right, you won’t always notice the thunder. Snow is more likely to absorb the light of lightning and the sound of thunder than rain. But thundersnow tends to be accompanied by heavier snowfall, which you may indeed notice when your commute is snarled.","There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, but it always brings the element of surprise.",2018-03-08T00:25:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How Thundersnow Happens: With Considerable Difficulty,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/climate/thundersnow.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/07/climate/cli-thundersnow/cli-thundersnow-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,snow storm,1
Brian Cizek,"TODAY: Plenty of sunshine, milder. High: 46 TONIGHT: Partly cloudy and chilly. Low: 29 MONDAY: Considerable cloudiness with some rain in the afternoon. High: 48 The storm that moved through last night was fast moving, but packed quite the punch! A very heavy band of snow set up right over the Lehigh Valley, dumping over 8 inches of snow in some spots. The Lehigh Valley was the bulls eye in terms of snow totals, with most spots seeing 6""-9"" of snow. As you move either north or south of the Lehigh Valley, snow totals dropped off fairly quickly, as points farther north saw lighter snow, and spots farther south saw some mixing with rain. Today will be a completely different story than yesterday. The storm has moved well off the coast, and high pressure has moved overhead. The high will bring mostly sunny skies for the entire day, and will also bring in some milder air. Temperatures will climb into the mid to upper 40s by this afternoon. Because of this, we will see quite a bit of the snow melt by the time the sun goes down. President's Day will also be a mild one, but we won't see nearly as much sunshine as we will today. Temperatures will reach the upper 40s by the afternon, but a blanket of clouds will roll in during the morning hours as a warm front pushes up from the south. Eventually, we will see some rain and showers move in by the afternoon as that warm front passes to the north. The rain and showers should move out by the late evening hours. As we progress through next week, a very strong ridge of high pressure anchored off the Southeast U.S. Coast will lead to a southwesterly wind flow that will pump some very warm air into our region. This high pressure system should make for dry conditions Tuesday with partly sunny skies and near record breaking warmth. High temperatures Tuesday are expected to top out in the mid to upper 60s. The current record high Tuesday for Allentown is 68 degrees (1930). Wednesday is also expected to be an extremely warm day with a mix of sun and clouds and afternoon highs perhaps getting up to the low 70s! Allentown's current record high for Wednesday is 67 (1953). A cold front is expected to approach from our west late in the day and this may bring some showers. This cold front is then expected to linger across the region overnight Wednesday into Thursday keeping shower chances around along with plenty of clouds. High temperatures are expected to drop off a bit for Thursday and beyond but are still expected to reach the mid to upper 40s. While it will be cooler than the middle of the week, it will still be above the average for this time of the year. Have a great and safe rest of the weekend!","WFMZ Allentown A mild and sunny Sunday will rapidly melt the snow WFMZ Allentown The storm that moved through last night was fast moving, but packed quite the punch!

Tom Davis,"Look out for round two: A second potentially destructive nor'easter is expected to hit New Jersey this week, and the National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for 10 counties. The storm could dump as many as 4 to 12 inches of snow beginning Tuesday evening and lasting until late Wednesday night. Rain and strong winds are expected, too, just as 60,000 people remain without power following the destructive Friday nor'easter. The storm could cause school districts to close, delay openings or dismiss early. Some districts also could close on Tuesday, before the storm hits, because they're still dealing with the lingering effects of the Friday nor'easter. Read more: New Jersey School Closings/Delays List This Week The NWS issued the winter storm watch for Sussex, Passaic, Bergen, Hudson, Essex, Somerset, Morris, Union, Hunterdon and Warren counties. A hazardous weather outlook has been issued for the rest of the state, and a coastal flood advisory remains for the Jersey Shore. The National Weather Service says heavy snow is possible, so drivers should plan on difficult travel conditions because of covered roads and reduced visibility. Heavy wet snow may bring down tree limbs and utility wires, resulting in more power outages. The nor'easter will impact the entire state, and it's considered a coastal storm that will bring a wintry mix of precipitation for Central and South Jersey and the Jersey Shore. Wind gusts in excess of 30 mph are possible. The wind along with accumulating wet snow may bring down tree limbs and utility wires, resulting in power outages, according to the NWS. The National Weather Service has issued some preliminary estimates for the snow: Here is the forecast: Monday: Partly sunny, with a high near 45. North wind 11 to 14 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Monday night: Partly cloudy, with a low around 27. North wind 3 to 7 mph. Tuesday: Mostly sunny, with a high near 45. Light and variable wind. Tuesday night: Rain likely before 10pm, then rain and snow likely between 10pm and midnight, then snow likely after midnight. Cloudy, with a low around 32. East wind 5 to 8 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70 percent. New snow accumulation of less than one inch possible. Wednesday: Snow. High near 36. East wind 13 to 16 mph. Chance of precipitation is 90 percent. New snow accumulation of 3 to 5 inches possible. Wednesday night: Snow likely, mainly before midnight. Cloudy, with a low around 30. Chance of precipitation is 60 percent. Thursday: A chance of snow showers before 7am. Partly sunny, with a high near 42. Chance of precipitation is 30 percent Downed trees and power outages, meanwhile, continue to plague New Jersey following the Friday nor'easter. Flooding continues to be a problem in Manasquan, Ocean City and other areas of the Jersey Shore (see information below). Much of New Jersey was still struggling to recover Monday.

A state of emergency has been declared in North Carolina, with some areas reporting as much as 0.5m (18.5ins) of snow over the weekend. One man died after a tree fell on his car. A search is under way for a driver whose vehicle was found in a river. Thousands of flights were also cancelled across the region. More than 300,000 people were affected by electricity outages in the Carolinas, Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia on Sunday, while storm warnings remained in place in the south-east ""especially North Carolina and Virginia"", the National Weather Service (NWS) said in a tweet. The storm was expected to move off the coast on Monday, although the NWS's lead forecaster Michael Schichtel warned it would continue to be ""a dangerous system"". ""It's slow to move off the Carolinas but a saving grace is that it won't hit New England,"" he told Reuters news agency. In some areas, so much snow fell the weight brought power lines crashing down. But the main danger appeared to be on the roads. Almost 60 crashes were reported in Virginia, state police told local media, with the number rising to 500 in North Carolina between midnight and 11:00 local time on Sunday. As a result, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told CNN the state's ""biggest concern"" was not the snow but ""ice making roads even more dangerous"".

Jonathan Allen,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second winter storm in a week will continue to dump wet, heavy snow on New England on Thursday, forcing schools to close and leaving hundreds of thousands without power as it promised to slow the morning commute across the region. A man takes shelter as snow falls in Times Square in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Amr Alfiky A foot (30 cm) of snow and fierce wind gusts of up to 55 miles per hour (88 km/h) were expected from eastern New York through northern Maine on Thursday after the storm slammed the region on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said in several watches and warnings. Up to 2 feet of snow accumulation was expected in some inland parts of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts and 18 inches was possible in Maine. Boston public schools along with dozens of schools throughout New England canceled classes on Thursday as local officials and forecasters warned commuters of whiteout conditions and slick roads. “With snow removal efforts underway, motorists are asked to stay off roads, stay home and stay safe,” the Boston Police Department said on Twitter. Amtrak suspended passenger train services between New York City and Boston until at least 10 a.m. local time and canceled dozens of routes on Thursday. A man takes a picture as snow falls in Times Square in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Amr Alfiky Two dozen flights were already canceled early on Thursday morning after about half of all scheduled flights were canceled at the three major airports serving New York City on Wednesday. The website said more than 2,100 flights had been delayed and 2,700 canceled, most of them in the Northeast, as of 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday. The dense snow and strong winds downed trees and power lines, knocking power out for hundreds of thousands in New England and the Mid Atlantic, according to Poweroutage.us, a website that tracks outages. “4am, no power (no heat), waiting for a text from work to say “we will be closed today”. Fingers crossed!” tweeted Jessica Squeglia in Peabody, Massachusetts. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy ordered many state workers to head home early on Wednesday afternoon at staggered intervals to avoid traffic snarls on slippery roads.

Adam Rogers,"Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer
questions about your interactions with science and technology.
Q: What is an atmospheric river?
A: Join me in song.*
three-four!
Dont know why its raining this wayAll this water and skies are so grayPack an umbrella; wear some Gore-TexYou havent seen the worst of it yetI wanna knoooooow you wont tell meThis rains gonna stay
Atmospheric river, drops on us the waterAtmospheric river, pours even more waterWashing us down, washing us down
Has this song been stuck in the heads of every Californian for a month? Kind of. But they know the drill. Atmospheric rivers, the so-called Pineapple Express, are a feature of almost every coastline in the worldcausing half the extreme wind events and dropping more than half of the water those coasts see in rainfall. They can be 300 miles wide and 1,000 miles long, and even though just 2.8 percent of the rainfall hours in California between 2004 and 2010 were atmospheric river hours, they dropped 60 percent of the states rain.
More hyperbolic stats? Sure, we got em. More snow in a day than Boston got all winter. More rain in eight hours in Palm Springs than in the previous eight months. San Jose breaks a century-old rainfall record. Sonoma County got 20 inches of rain in two days (and yes, there were floods). Half of Californias water supply is now frozen as snow in the Sierras (thats good; its literally cold storage).
I dont know why youre raining so hardAll this wind makes you a blowhardYouve dropped an ocean, a flood, a delugeA lot of water that, sure, we can useI wanna knoooooow you wont tell meThis rains gonna stay
Atmospheric river, drops on us the waterAtmospheric river, pours even more waterWashing us down, washing us
What causes them? The river part isnt just a metaphor; warm, moisture-laden air in the tropospherefrom the ground to between 6 to 12 miles up over the tropics blows eastward. The flow eventually hits mountains (in this case, the Sierras) that deflect it upward, where the air cools offand drops all that moisture. The key number is called Integrated Vapor Transport: the amount of water getting pushed. According to a recently devised scale, any storm that moves more than 250 kilograms of water per meter per second and lasts more than a day is an atmospheric river.
Soak me, spatter me, splash me, splatter meTill I cant, till I cant, till I cant take no moreDrop down more water, atmospheric riverRain down more water, atmospheric riverWashing us down, washing us down
I dont know why you snow and you rainWish my galoshes would fit on my brainFifty inches of rain is a slogAnd now I still have to go walk the dog
While its true that atmospheric rivers bring floods, mudslides, sinkholes, and a generalized emotional greying of the Golden State, they also are the monsoons that typically end Californias dry seasons and break the states frequent droughts. But even that upside-down might be turning into a frown. Climate change means that atmospheric rivers are getting warmer at higher altitudes, dropping rain instead of snow. Without that snowpack, the states people and agriculture dont have enough water. The rivers will flow, but the droughts wont end.
Atmospheric river, dont just drop waterAtmospheric river, we need more snowa lot-terKeep washing us down, washing us down.

We've been talking about it for the last few days and now the time has arrived. Get ready for likely the region's biggest winter storm/snow storm of the season as another coastal storm is set to pound us pretty good. This will be the second winter storm in five days to impact us and also the second coastal storm in five days. Unlike the last one which featured strong damaging wind gusts as its main course, this coastal storm should have less wind, but quite a bit more snow, certainly for folks outside of the Poconos. Even though the Spring Equinox is just under 2 weeks away, mother nature is certainly reminding us that it is still officially winter. TIMELINE: What to expect from Wednesday's nor'easter Hopefully you took advantage of the calm before the storm Tuesday as we enjoyed a mix of sun and clouds and high temperatures near 50 degrees in several spots. Clouds thickened and increased overnight as the beginning stages of our storm system started to unfold. An initial wave of moisture worked in from our west as some light rain showers and sleet mixed with and changed over to some light snow. Several locations across southeastern Pennsylvania did pick up 1 to 3 inches of snow from this first wave. Low temperatures have been marginal with many struggling to even get below freezing; therefore, very early on this morning, you can expect just minor slippery conditions with a lot of roads just on the wet side. That will be changing significantly after sunrise. The heart of our storm system is expected to occur during much of the day Wednesday. An area of low pressure has quickly developed near the Virginia/North Carolina coastal border, and this low pressure system will deepen and strengthen tracking to the northeast throughout the day. The coastal low will be positioned somewhere near the Jersey Shore and Long Island by Wednesday afternoon throwing Atlantic moisture into cold air and producing rounds of heavy snow. The heaviest snow is most likely to occur from mid-morning through mid to late afternoon. Bands of very heavy snow with snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are likely, especially across far eastern Pennsylvania and much of northern New Jersey. Winds will increase as well, but not to the level of the intense gusts we had with Friday's storm. This time, winds will blow briskly from the northeast, sustained up to 20 miles-per-hour with gusts as high as 30 to 40 miles-per-hour. While not as strong as last week, the combination of the blustery winds and the heavy and wet snow accumulating on power lines and trees (some weakened by last week’s storm) means that additional power outages and tree damage are possible. No big changes have been made to the forecast. We still anticipate a widespread 6 to 12 inches of snow from north and west of the Interstate 95 corridor through most of eastern Pennsylvania including the Lehigh Valley, and the Poconos, as well as all of North Jersey. Within that large area there will likely be a swath of more than 12 inches of snow, especially where those heavier snow bands set up shop for a few hours. At the moment, the area where we have the greatest confidence there will be numerous 12 inch or more amounts is the eastern Poconos over into northern New Jersey and down into eastern sections of the Lehigh Valley. The heavier snows will also extend west into Berks, Schuylkill, and eastern sections of Lancaster and Lebanon counties where at least six inches of snow is likely. Farther west from there, amounts will diminish, perhaps rather sharply. South and east of the I-95 corridor, rain and sleet are expected to factor in for a longer time and therefore less snow is expected, with 3-6” across interior South Jersey just southeast of Interstate 95 and 1-3” southeast from there, with perhaps very little along the shore. Snow should end from southwest to northeast early Wednesday evening as our coastal low pressure system moves into coastal New England. Winds will remain brisk Wednesday night and shift to the northwest behind the departing storm. Thursday and Friday look largely dry and rather breezy with west-northwest breezes continuing. It will be a little chilly for early March with highs in the upper 30s. Our average high for this time of year is in the mid 40s, so we’ll be running below that with a brisk breeze adding an extra chill. A stray snow shower or two can’t be ruled out late Thursday or anytime on Friday, but no accumulation is currently expected. The second weekend of March looks nice with cool sunshine on Saturday and then some increasing clouds on Sunday. Another ocean storm is expected to develop on Monday, but latest indications are that it may stay safely to our south and east and slide out to sea underneath us. A chance of rain and snow is kept in the forecast just in case for late Sunday and early Monday, but hopefully that can be taken out if these southerly trends continue with this next storm. The cool pattern looks to remain indefinitely through at least the first half of next week. Be safe everyone and don't forget to check all of our different platforms throughout the day for plenty of updates on the storm, whether it be here on the web, social media, the AccuWeather Channel, and 69News.","WFMZ Allentown Winter storm begins, set to bring heavy snow, gusty winds WFMZ Allentown TODAY: Blustery with snow, some heavy, creating difficult travel. 6-12” for much of the area but some see 12”+. 3-6” far west and less towards the shore High: 35.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"“They literally go out and stick a ruler in the snow,” said Carlie Buccola, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Technically, it’s a little more complicated than that. Before a snowstorm, spotters place a white board faceup on the ground. As the last flakes fall, they insert a ruler, measure and then wipe the board clean for future measurements. Spotters can also track rainfall amounts, barometric pressure and tree and property damage, which are used to verify the National Weather Service’s weather advisories. All of this made us think: If a snowflake falls in Brooklyn, and no one is there to measure it, does it leave a record? Not according to the National Weather Service. “People call in and ask why their city or town is not on the snowfall list,” Ms. Buccola said. “It’s likely because nobody there sent in a report.” You can represent the microclimate of your block this weekend by submitting your own freelance storm report to the weather service. You can also train as a spotter this spring or join a network of observers. We don’t have any formal schooling, but here’s our submission: Umbrellas up, it’s soggy till Sunday.

Michael Page,"Saturday will be a very stormy day across New England, with numerous angles to focus on. TIMING The storm will arrive first in Southern New England before dawn, before spreading into Northern New England over the course of the morning. The storm will continue through the day, pulling away late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. RAINFALL Saturday is basically a washout, aside from a few dry hours during the morning in Northern New England. Rainfall will be heaviest in parts of Eastern New England, from Rhode Island into parts of Southeastern Massachusetts. Expect a widespread 1- to 2-inches. FLOODING Street flooding will be a problem during the day with so many leaves and pine needles blocking storm drains. If possible, clear the drains in front of your house. STRONG WINDS Many of those leaves will be blown down by powerful winds blowing in off of the water. Through the interior, expect gusts 30 to 40 mph. Of course, in hilly towns, there will be some gusts closer to 50 mph. Along the coast, from Maine to the Seacoast of New Hampshire, and into Eastern Massachusetts, expect gusts around 50 mph. Gusts will be closer to 60 mph for parts of Cape Cod, the Islands, and the South Coast. Isolated power outages are likely. COASTAL FLOODING The strong onshore winds, combined with astronomically high tides following this week’s full moon and offshore waves 10 to 20 feet, will result in areas of minor coastal flooding during the Saturday afternoon high tide. That happens around 1:40 p.m. in many towns. Extreme Weather Photos: Flash Flooding in France MOUNTAIN SNOW As the storm arrives in Northern New England, the precipitation will start as a wintry mix and snow. In the high terrain of Western New England, including parts of the Berkshires, expect a dusting of one inch before a switch to rain. Along the Greens and in the Northeast Kingdom, as well as in the Whites, Central New Hampshire, and the mountains of Northern and Western Maine, expect a widespread 1-to-3-inches of snow. The highest peaks in those areas, like Mount Washington, will get six inches or more in some cases. SUNDAY AND BEYOND While the storm pulls away on Sunday, we’ll still be left with mostly cloudy skies and a few spotty showers, especially during the morning. Temperatures will be in the 50s. A separate storm will clip New England with some showers on Monday, but it still looks like we can dry out closer to Halloween as temperatures get closer to, and even a bit above, average.","NECN Weekend Nor'easter's Impact: Heavy Rain, Strong Winds, Flooding, Snow NECN Saturday will be a very stormy day across New England, with numerous angles to focus on.

Associated Press,"SAN FRANCISCO – Motorists were warned to stay off Northern California mountain roads as a major winter storm was expected to bring heavy snowfall, powerful winds and torrential rains at lower elevations Thursday. Meanwhile predictions of widespread showers across the southern end of the state raised concern about flash flooding near wildfire burn scars later in the week. A blizzard warning was issued for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where winds could gust up to 125 mph (200 kph) on the ridges and 40 to 60 mph (65 kph to 95 kph) in some valleys, the National Weather Service said. The blizzard would help the snowpack, which is vital to the state's water supply and is only about a quarter its normal size for this time of winter. ""Totals will be measured in feet and mountain travel will become dangerous,"" the National Weather Service tweeted. ""Travel is highly discouraged."" Northern mountains were expected to receive 3 feet (0.9 meter) to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow, and up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) in localized areas. The storm was expected to reach Southern California in the early hours of Friday. Santa Barbara County issued a recommended evacuation warning for south coast communities including Montecito, where a Jan. 9 storm triggered flash floods that destroyed or damaging hundreds of homes. Twenty-one people were killed and two remain missing. The county is following a rigorous new system of alerts that emphasizes evacuations well in advance of storms rather than suggesting residents can use their discretion. Officials hoped to decide Thursday whether to issue a mandatory evacuation order. People cannot be forced to leave their homes under a mandatory evacuation order, but authorities said they should not be expected to be rescued while the storm event is occurring. ""Our intention is to make sure that you have a plan, that you are prepared, and that you are safe,"" said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown, who warned people not to be lulled into a false sense of security because midweek weather was calm. ""Just because the skies are blue right now doesn't mean there isn't a threat."" People with mobility issues or those with large animals should get out now, officials said. There were no estimates on how many people may have left the area. Montecito and neighboring communities on the coastal foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains lie below slopes burned bare last year by the largest wildfire in recorded California history as well as other fires in recent years. Evacuation fatigue for some residents is a factor. Some evacuated multiple times during the wildfires, and then again when the mudslides hit.","Fox News Major storm to bring feet of snow to California mountains Fox News SAN FRANCISCO – Motorists were warned to stay off Northern California mountain roads as a major winter storm was expected to bring heavy snowfall, powerful winds and torrential rains …",2018-03-01T07:22:51Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Major storm to bring feet of snow to California mountains - Fox News,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/01/major-storm-to-bring-feet-snow-to-california-mountains.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/03/01/major-storm-to-bring-feet-snow-to-california-mountains/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.png/0/0/1519888677643.png?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,snow storm,1
AZI PAYBARAH,"Temperatures were just not as cold as predicted, so it didnt allow for as much accumulation, said John Murray, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was a challenging forecast, with uncertainty at play, and a few inches can make a dramatic difference.
Who else can tell you about the weather?
Practically everyone gets their information from the National Weather Service. Its website is detailed and maybe not ideal for people who just want to know if they need an umbrella or scarf. For that, there are some very good newsletters (I can think of a few).
If you want a little more information, there is an array of weather apps.
Liz Robbins, a former Times colleague and weather enthusiast, told me about some she uses: AccuWeather is easy to use; Dark Sky is precise and good for knowing when to grab an umbrella; and Weather Underground (clever name!) has helpful charts, graphs and radar maps.
The takeaway: By the time the brunt of a storm arrives, its too late to figure out how to respond. Mayors often need to make decisions hours earlier, when many of the factors may be, literally, up in the air.

Andrew Freedman,"Everyone should be wary when weather geeks start getting excited about an upcoming shift in the jet stream because it usually means inclement weather is ahead. After all, weather enthusiasts — whether they be armchair forecasters or professionals — tend to abhor boring stretches of ""nice"" weather. Forecasters have reason to be psyched right now, given strong hints for what could be a major weather pattern realignment during the next two weeks. SEE ALSO: Fans of cold and snow in the U.S. will love this new winter outlook Computer models are increasingly showing the potential for a cold and possibly snowy weather pattern to develop along the East Coast of the U.S. during the second week of December. While there are many uncertainties associated with the forecast so far in advance, the general contours of what is likely to happen are becoming clearer. Some of the building blocks for the cold weather are already in place, including a predominantly negative Arctic Oscillation, which favors — but does not guarantee — colder-than-average conditions in the eastern U.S. ""Where have you gone (negative) #Arctic Oscillation our nation (of weather geeks) turns its lonely eyes to you."" Nearly classical AO- predicted by the models early Dec with three poles of #cold, Europe, East Asia and East US (Euro not quite there yet). It's been at least 5 years! pic.twitter.com/EwnJja2Wmv — Judah Cohen (@judah47) November 22, 2017 The Arctic Oscillation, or AO, is climate pattern that describes the atmospheric circulation over the Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean. During a negative phase of the AO, the polar vortex over the Arctic is weaker, resulting in a slackening of the upper level winds ringing the Arctic from west-to-east. This can allow frigid, Arctic air to spill into the midlatitudes, including Europe and the U.S. For much of late November, we've had a strongly negative Arctic Oscillation with milder-than-average conditions in much of the U.S., which goes to show that other factors, including weather patterns across the North Pacific Ocean, also have an influence on winter weather in the lower 48 states. Computer model projections for 11 to 15 days from now show a strikingly favorable weather pattern for cold air to invade the eastern U.S., as well as parts of Europe and East Asia. Strong areas of high pressure at high latitudes, including one in the Gulf of Alaska and another monster high over Greenland, plus another across the Ural Mountains, will each act to help steer air masses around the world. A blocking high over Greenland is typically associated with some of the East Coast's most memorable snowstorms, because it helps direct cold air into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states while also preventing storm systems from quickly escaping out to sea. Computer model projection showing a dip, or trough, in the jet stream developing in the East in mid-December. Image: weather.us According to Judah Cohen, a snow-obsessed meteorologist with AER, a Verisk business in Massachusetts, the upcoming atmospheric events appear to be relatively rare, and exciting. Cohen researches the chain of events that trigger disruptions in the polar vortex, and he says the upcoming weather pattern reminds him a lot of December 2010, which featured a paralyzing blizzard from Philadelphia to Portland, Maine. ""I am following with interest the trifecta of ridging. one in the Gulf of Alaska, one across Greenland and one across the Urals,"" Cohen said via email. ""Respectively, they are bringing cold to the Eastern US, Europe and East Asia. But it is the blocking centered on the Urals that could have the longest-lasting impact. That is key to weakening the polar vortex. It has already begun and I am watching to see if it eventually leads to a major disruption of the polar vortex with longer lasting impacts."" Cohen's statements may not sound giddy to non-weather nerds, but they're the equivalent of a sports fan showing up at a football game shirtless, with the number of a favorite player painted on their chest. He prefaced his remarks by saying, ""The question is not whether I have any comments on the current pattern but whether I can limit myself so anyone else will bother to listen."" Other experts who have been examining the upcoming changes in winter weather patterns are a bit more skeptical that they'll result in a blockbuster event. Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, says the weather pattern in the troposphere, which is the layer of air where most weather occurs, will go through ""major changes"" in the next week to 10 days. ""The changes have started in the Pacific and will eventually propagate over into North America and strengthen the current blocking pattern across the North Atlantic (strong North Atlantic ridge),"" Furtado said in a Twitter DM. ""This overall pattern (ridges in Western US + North Atlantic and troughs in the Central - West North Pacific and Eastern North America) is overall favorable for a colder and stormier regime."" Furtado cautioned that just because the weather pattern will be ideal for generating snowstorms does not guarantee anything. ""... The atmosphere will be primed, but we will need to watch the 'sparks' — the shortwaves/disturbances that ride along the jet stream that are the seeds for individual storms,"" he said. According to Ryan Maue, chief operating officer with Weather.US, the dip, or trough, in the jet stream over the eastern half of the U.S. in a week to 10 days is a ""pre-requisite"" for a snowstorm. But so far, there are no indications of a major storm during that time frame. Forecasters with Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang blog also raised the red flag on the upcoming weather pattern change on Monday, saying it ""screams winter weather potential."" Two time periods experts there cited as analogs to the upcoming weather pattern include December 1989, which set cold temperature records, and December 2009, which featured a blizzard known as "" Snowpocalypse.""","Everyone should be wary when weather geeks start getting excited about an upcoming shift in the jet stream because it usually means inclement weather is ahead.

Paul Gross,"DETROIT - The Local4Casters have been telling you about it for a few days now, and it’s finally almost here. A significant winter storm will really mess up our Friday, including both rush hours, as well as air traffic at Metro Airport. We'll have a dry evening, with no weather worries for any errands or plans you have. Snow will develop after midnight and, by dawn, it’ll be really coming down. At morning rush hour time, areas south of 8 Mile will likely have a solid two inches of snow already on the ground (perhaps even near three inches in spots), with one-to-two inches from 8 Mile northward to M-59, and generally an inch or so north of M-59. Lows tonight in the mid teens (-9 degrees Celsius) will be set by midnight, with temperatures starting to creep upward from there. Wind will be light and variable. Snow continues through the day on Friday, although some models are actually suggesting a period in the afternoon where the snow actually tapers off for a while across the northern half of the area, before another batch moves in late afternoon into the evening. The southern half of the area should maintain steady snow all day long. If you haven’t already, I strongly suggest downloading the FREE Local4Casters App, just search for WDIV in the App Store, and you’ll see it right there. When you open the app, it opens right to what you want to see first: the radar page. You can pan and zoom the radar anywhere you want, and remember that the app follows you wherever you travel, the radar shows you the weather anywhere in the nation, and even in Europe. Wherever you are, when you open the app, it opens to your location. Also remember to follow us on Twitter at @Local4Casters, and you can also follow me at @PGLocal4, for personalized updates. If nothing else, it’ll be pretty cool watching the big blob of snow over us tomorrow, and seeing where (if) that break for northern areas materializes. If you don’t have a smart phone, no worries…the Local4Casters will keep you updated on Local 4 and on ClickOnDetroit.com. Highs Friday will be in the upper 20s (-2 degrees Celsius), and the east wind will only blow at 5 to 10 mph, so at least it won’t be a nasty feeling day…just a nasty one for commuting. Friday’s sunrise is at 7:37 a.m., and Friday’s sunset is at 5:58 p.m. Snow will diminish by midnight Saturday. As far as total snow, there will be a considerable difference in snow amounts in southeast Michigan. Right now (and this could still change based upon some very small-scale details yet to be resolved), it appears that the heaviest band of snow will be south of 8 Mile…with areas there picking up six to nine inches of snow, and possibly even a little more. Between 8 Mile and M-59, this is looking more like a four-to-seven inch snowfall. The toughest part of the forecast is actually north of M-59, because there will likely be a very sharp drop-off in accumulation on the northern part of this snow shield. Some models project only two-to-four inches for this area, while other models suggest a little more. Needless-to-say, Friday will be a very tough day for travel around the region and, based upon the sheer number of people e-mailing, texting, tweeting and Facebook messaging me, it appears that a lot of people have a lot of travel planned. The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for areas south of 8 Mile until 12 a.m. Saturday, and a Winter Weather Advisory north of 8 Mile (except for Sanilac County). Two important caveats: Don’t just look at the highest number of the ranges and think that this is what you’ll get. These are ranges, with expected snowfall in the range. Because of the sharp drop-off in snow amounts as you head north, keep in mind that even small north-south shifts in where the snow band sets up can increase or reduce your snow amounts rather dramatically. Here is a series of maps showing you the running totals for snow accumulation Friday into Saturday morning: Since the southern half of the area likely will get six or more inches of snow and travel will be so nasty, we’re pegging this snow as a “Pizza and Beer” snow, just stay in, throw a frozen pizza in the oven, grab your favorite beverage, and watch the snow. Another batch of accumulating snow is possible on Saturday, although this looks to be much less accumulation than we’ll see on Friday. Highs in the upper 20s (-2 degrees Celsius). Yet another batch of snow (the last one), crosses the area on Sunday, with more light accumulation possible. Highs again in the upper 20s (-2 degrees Celsius). Here is a series of maps showing you the snowfall progression into the weekend: Most of next week looks dry, with perhaps a rain or snow shower chance on Thursday. Highs looks to moderate into the low to mid 30s (-1 to 2 degrees Celsius).

,"At a Glance Winter Storm Benji dumped inches of snow on parts of the South, making travel more difficult. Schools were canceled Friday and residents were urged to stay home. Nearly 300,000 homes and businesses lost power in the path of the winter storm. Residents from South Texas eastward across the Deep South enjoyed the presence of rare December snow on Friday, while officials were hopeful that warm road temperatures would counter the snowfall and minimize the impacts of Winter Storm Benji. Early Friday morning, thundersnow was reported in some parts of southern Texas and even in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as the system brought bursts of snow that were heavy at times. Farther east, heavy snow fell in cities like Jackson, Mississippi, Birmingham, Alabama, and the northern suburbs of Atlanta. (MORE: The Latest Forecast for Winter Storm Benji ) The snow also had an impact on power – nearly 300,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia combined Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. Texas Accumulating snow was reported as far south as Brownsville Friday morning as southeastern Texas enjoyed a rare snowfall from Benji. In the Houston area, several school districts delayed opening because of road conditions, according to the Houston Chronicle. ""We're experiencing delays with bus transportation due to weather, traffic, and staffing,"" Houston ISD said in a release sent Friday morning. ""School leaders most impacted have been contacted, but this will be a district-wide problem. We also urge parents whose student rides the bus to make sure they're bundled up and to be patient as we work to get every bus rider to school safely. The safety of our students is our top priority, especially in unusual conditions such as those around the city today."" (MORE: Once-in-a-Decade Snow Falls in South Texas ) Nearly 50,000 customers were without power in the Lone Star State Friday morning. Louisiana Multiple school districts in southeastern Louisiana canceled classes Friday, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, as Benji's snow became problematic for travelers across the region. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Friday morning, with most of those outages grouped in the south-central part of the state. A stretch of U.S. 90 was closed in both directions from Amelia to Gray late Friday morning because of ice on the roadway, the Times-Picayune also said. The closure impacted a stretch of the highway about 20 miles long in southern Louisiana. Snow flurries fell in New Orleans during the afternoon hours, providing a rare wintry scene for the Big Easy. On the 24-mile causeway bridge that spans Lake Pontchartrain, police aided drivers via slow-moving convoys on the slick roadway, according to the Associated Press. ""Hopefully, the only people on the roads are the ones who have to be out today,"" Dexter Accardo of the St. Tammany Parish government told the Times-Picayune. ""We're advising everyone to stay off the roads if they can."" Mississippi Roads became troublesome in areas and more than 80,000 homes and businesses lost power in southern parts of the state as Benji dumped several inches of snow Friday morning. Parts of southern Mississippi received up to a half-foot of snow, making Benji one of the biggest snowstorms to hit the area since records began, according to the National Weather Service. (PHOTOS: Winter Storm Benji, in Pictures ) In Jackson, several schools were canceled Friday; WAPT.com has a complete list. Despite the headaches, many Mississippians were grateful that it wasn't a different kind of wintry precipitation for once. ""My whole life it was always ice storms, rarely snow,"" Jackson resident Jason Tuten told the AP. ""I guess the conditions were perfect."" Alabama Residents were urged to stay home in northern Alabama as Benji turned roads dangerous. AL.com reported numerous crashes on Interstate 65 Friday morning, and meteorologists said street conditions were worsening as the morning went on. Reports from the NWS mid-morning Friday said all city roads were closed in Talladega, and some streets in Anniston were becoming impassable, with multiple wrecks reported. Georgia More than 650 flights were canceled into and out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport – making up virtually all of the domestic cancellations – as Benji made travel treacherous in North Georgia on Friday. Although many roads in the Atlanta area were pretreated with a brine solution, the slushy roads were packed midday with drivers looking to get home and beat the rush. Schools in the metro Atlanta area dismissed students early and thousands of residents hit the streets at the same time, creating another gridlock situation. ""We're surprised that this little snowfall would cause this much disruption to the entire city,"" Lucas Rachow told the AP while trying to get a ride to the airport. North Carolina With some of the South's biggest snow totals expected to fall in western and northern North Carolina, officials were taking no chances with travel – not even the state's leader. Gov. Roy Cooper postponed two events because of Benji, one in Waynesville and one in Asheville, where he was scheduled to appear, according to the AP. Those events will be rescheduled after the storm wraps up, the report added. More than 10,000 homes and businesses were without power statewide Friday afternoon because of the winter storm.

CBS/AP,"Residents across a huge swath of the U.S. were hunkered down as a massive winter storm packing snow, ice and high winds, followed by possible record-breaking cold, moved up the Eastern Seaboard. The worst conditions were expected from the Carolinas to Maine. The massive storm began two days ago in the Gulf of Mexico, first hitting the Florida Panhandle. It has prompted thousands of canceled flights, shuttered schools and businesses and sparked fears of coastal flooding and power outages. Wind gusts of 50 mph to 60 mph, strong enough to cause downed trees and power lines, are predicted in places where the National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings. They include the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes parts of Delaware, Virginia and Maryland; coastal New Jersey; eastern Long Island, New York; and coastal eastern New England. After the storm, a wave of bracing cold is forecast to hit much of the Northeast. The storm dumped snow in Tallahassee, Florida, Wednesday -- that city's first snow in nearly three decades -- before slogging up the Atlantic coast and smacking Southern cities such as Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, with a rare blast of snow and ice. Follow along with updates below as the storm works its way up the coast. All times Eastern unless otherwise indicated. 4:03 a.m. Brrrr: Baby, it's gonna get cold(er) outside Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli says the storm will go down as one of the strongest non tropical cyclones ever along the Eastern Seaboard. Barometric pressure is forecast to drop near or below that of Superstorm Sandy. While 12-18-plus inches of snow on Long Island and eastern New England will be impressive, the cold behind the system will be even more impressive. Friday and Saturday morning will see the mercury at or below zero from New York City north, with wind chills of minus-20 degrees near New York City and minus-50 in the mountains of northern New England. 3:45 a.m. Conditions worsening in Washington, D.C. area Winds have begun to pick up. Snow is being blown around a bit as we cross over the Choptank River in Cambridge, MD on US 50 heading to Salisbury. #WUSA9Weather @wusa9 @Wusa9traffic @MiriWeather pic.twitter.com/8hqJuII2nB — Melissa Nord (@MelissaNordWx) January 4, 2018 2:30 a.m. Amtrak train partially derails Three cars of an Amtrak train heading from Miami to New York with 311 passengers on board derailed as the train tried to slowly back into the Savannah, Georgia station late Wednesday night, Amtrak tells CBS News. All three cars - a baggage car and two sleeper cars -- stayed fully upright. There were no reports of injuries. CBS Savannah affiliate WTOC-TV says frozen switches on the tracks forced the crew to stop the train and put it into reverse. News footage from the site showed police and other emergency vehicles - their lights flashing - crunching over snowy, ice-shrouded roads near tracks where the cars had derailed. Workers in neon safety vests, their frosty breath rising in the bitter cold air, converged at the scene. The train was expected to continue north, with some of the sleeping car passengers being transferred to a different train. 12:13 a.m.: Storm passing over southeastern Virginia, northern North Carolina Snow is tracking across Virginia's Hampton Roads area and northern North Carolina, reported CBS affiliate WTKR meterologist Madeline Evans. Portions of the Outer Banks were only spot still seeing a mix of cold rain and some snow, and it will continue to transition into only snow overnight. Most of the area will see 8 inches to 10 inches of snow accumulation, with some spots possibly reaching a foot of snow, according to Evans. Snowfall will increase northward into portions of the Mid-Atlantic and northern New England early Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Blizzard conditions are possible over eastern Long Island and portions of coastal New England, and also near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and Hampton Roads. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the shore areas, CBS Baltimore reports. 10 p.m.: Philadelphia officials announce snow emergency Philadelphia city officials announced that a snow emergency goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thu., Jan. 4. Managing Director Michael DiBerardinis says a snow emergency means all parked cars must be moved off snow emergency routes for plowing. Officials urge residents to park as far away from street corners as possible so that plows can easily turn. For more information, visit this website. Cars left on snow emergency routes will be moved to other parking spots to assist in snow plowing operations. If your car is moved, call 215-686-SNOW to find it. Do NOT call 911. 9:45 p.m.: Nearly 35,000 people without power in the South CBS News has confirmed that nearly 35,000 people in the South are without power as a winter storm crosses the region. A look at websites monitoring outages show that Georgia is hit hardest with at least 17,000 customers affected. However, many of the outages predate the storm. 8:37 p.m.: American Airlines cancels more than 600 flights Jan. 4 American Airlines announced that more than 300 flights were canceled for Wednesday and more than 640 flights have already been canceled for Thursday. All depatures are canceled from Boston and Providence's airports, American Airlines said. There are scattered cancellations from Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and New York's airports. 7:50 p.m.: New York City cancels school New York City is under a winter storm watch from late Wednesday through Thursday evening, CBS New York reports. A blizzard warning has been issued for Long Island's Suffolk County and some coastal New Jersey counties, but New York City is not affected. Finally, as reported earlier, @NYCSchools are closed tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/nQa9Jau6uJ — Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) January 4, 2018 How much snow the city gets depends on the track of the storm. CBS New York forecaster Lonnie Quinn reported the North American Model expects the storm to track closer to the west, bringing 8.8 inches of accumulation. But the European Model, which tracks the storm 54 miles farther east, anticipates only 2.9 inches of accumulation for New York City. Wind gusts of 35 mph to 45 mph are also possible. New York City's Department of Sanitation issued a snow alert starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday, meaning snow equipment will be ready to handle the winter weather. 7:05 p.m.: Deep freeze expected overnight in Florida There will be a hard freeze overnight for many locations away from the immediate coast, CBS affiliate WJAX reports. Even the beaches will see a light freeze overnight. Highs will be in the mid to upper 40s Thursday and another hard freeze is expected Friday morning. In Tallahassee, the Suwannee County Sheriff's Office Division of Emergency Management will be opening as a warming station for people to escape the cold, CBS affiliate WCTV reports. {""@type"":""Event"",""eventStatus"":""EventScheduled"",""name"":""Winter Storm Grayson"",""image"":""https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/01/04/2af4a852-25a4-429a-8fce-55ca63c50e35/thumbnail/1200x630/fb7540beef382a2e4ddacc80ca58a259/ezgif-3-6114ba2561.gif"",""description"":""Bomb Cyclone Northeast Winter Storm Grayson covers the Eastern U.S. with cold, snow, winds, latest forecast, tracks, updates"",""url"":""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bomb-cyclone-winter-storm-northeast-latest-track-snow-storm-forecast-2017-01-04-live-updates/"",""location"":{""@type"":""Place"",""name"":""Northeast United States"",""address"":{""addressLocality"":""Northeastern U.S.""}}}","CBS News Massive winter storm heads north after dropping rare snow on South -- live updates CBS News Last Updated Jan 4, 2018 5:08 AM EST.

https://www.facebook.com/markberman,"A brutal winter storm descended upon the East Coast on Wednesday, bringing snow to Florida and Georgia along with ominous forecasts of bone-chilling temperatures and pummeling snow expected to follow across the eastern United States. The powerful storm prompted dire warnings from meteorologists and government officials alike, as authorities shut down schools, grounded flights and closed roadways throughout the Southeast. Forecasts called for the storm to become a “ bomb cyclone ” because its pressure will drop so quickly, causing it to intensify at explosive rates. Snow and freezing rain coating parts of the Southeast on Wednesday are only expected to be the beginning. The storm is forecast to travel up the coast like a snowbird in the spring, bringing snow to the Mid-Atlantic and then potential blizzard conditions in New England on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. After that’s done, forecasters warn, a painful cold will follow. “Bitter cold and dangerous wind chills to persist into the weekend,” the National Weather Service said in a warning Wednesday morning. [ ‘Bomb cyclone’ to blast East Coast before polar vortex uncorks tremendous cold late this week ] The storm has already caused issues for travelers, halting scores of flights. Even before the forecast snow arrived in the Northeast, airlines had canceled more than 1,700 flights on Thursday, most of them through the three New York-area airports as well as Boston. Airlines bracing for the weather had begun issuing waivers for travelers heading through essentially the entire East Coast, allowing people to change their flights without any fees. As the storm began to grind across the East Coast, it brought wintry weather to unusual places. Snow fell Wednesday on Tallahassee, Florida’s capital, and stretched across the border into Georgia. The Raleigh, N.C., office of the National Weather Service reported that the temperature there dropped to 9 degrees on Wednesday morning, tying a record low set on the same date in 1887. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) declared a state of emergency for 28 counties, warning that the snowfall and freezing rain could melt and then refreeze, “producing additional ice related hazards.” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said that while it was hard to predict the snowfall totals, the impact could make it treacherous for people to drive. Authorities there also warned about the dangers the extreme cold could pose for the elderly and children, among others. “Cold temperatures can present a challenge for everyone across the state, especially our most vulnerable residents,” Dr. Betsey Tilson, North Carolina’s state health director, said Wednesday. Some braved the icy conditions for supplies. At a Harris Teeter supermarket James Island, S.C., just across the Intra-Coastal Waterway from downtown Charleston, mostly male shoppers stocked up Wednesday morning on water, hot dogs, bread and milk. “The women were too smart to go out,” one cashier said as icy rain turned the parking lot to slush shortly before noon. Further south, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) had ordered transportation crews to prepare state roads and bridges amid the winter storm warnings and advisories issued across the Sunshine State. “As this weather system moves through state, families and visitors across North Florida should prepare for potential hard freezes and below-freezing travel conditions,” Scott said in a statement. Roadways were already shut down by the storm across parts of the Southeast. Florida officials said they closed a stretch of Interstate 10 because of the weather, while a number of roadways were closed in Georgia. The storm essentially meant that many Floridians, more accustomed to seeing schools closed for hurricanes, had snow days this week. Leon County, which is home to Tallahassee, shut down schools Wednesday. About three hours away, Alachua County canceled classes on Wednesday and Thursday due to the warnings of freezing rain, dangerous roads and black ice. “Closing schools is not a decision we make lightly,” the Alachua school system said in a statement. “We recognize that it’s a real headache for families, but safety has to be the first consideration.” While southern states dealt with the snow and ice, many in the north began hearing warnings of what they could soon confront. The National Weather Service forecasts that Boston and nearby areas could see up to a foot of snow — and possibly more — saying that “near blizzard conditions are likely in this region.” Philadelphia could see up to three inches of snow, while New York City may see as much as six inches by Thursday. What path the storm takes could determine its impact. If the storm wobbles away from the coast, snow amounts and peak winds will decrease, but if it hews closer to land, snowfall and gusts could climb higher and extend farther inland. Doug Pardue in Charleston, S.C., and Jason Samenow in Washington contributed to this story, which will be updated throughout the day.

Kevin Bissett,"A massive winter storm that walloped Southern Ontario this week moved through Quebec and the Maritimes Wednesday, closing schools, restricting travel and shuttering many businesses and offices for the day.
Few areas were spared as activities across much of Eastern Canada were disrupted, from the Dennis Oland murder trial to outdoor events at Quebec Citys winter carnival.
Its been a long day, said Troy Arsenault, who fought a losing battle as he cleared snow from the steps in front of Frederictons Beaverbrook Art Gallery Wednesday.
Story continues below advertisement
Its our third time here the wind keeps blowing the snow right back to where weve cleared it.
Mr. Arsenault said the drifting and rapid accumulation made it one of the worst storms of the winter.
Jill Maepea, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said much of New Brunswick could expect close to 35 centimetres of snow from the storm by Wednesday night, with more on the way.
All of New Brunswick and P.E.I., and much of Nova Scotia and Southern Quebec were under similar winter-storm warnings.
Areas of western Nova Scotia also received heavy snow Wednesday morning, but weather in much of the province had changed over to freezing rain or rain by midday. Environment Canada said winds could also gust to 80 kilometres an hour and combine with freezing rain to make travel treacherous.
Schools and universities in almost all of the region were closed or delaying their openings, along with some government offices and businesses.
The courts in Saint John opened as scheduled Wednesday morning, but closed at noon due to the blizzard, adjourning Mr. Olands retrial in his fathers killing for the day.

Airports in Fredericton, Halifax and Charlottetown were reporting dozens of flight cancellations, a day after the scene played out in Toronto where there were mass flight disruptions and widespread closures of schools, tourist attractions and non-essential municipal services.
A no-travel advisory for New Brunswick highways was issued Wednesday.
Al Giberson, general manager of MRDC the company responsible for the stretch of Trans-Canada Highway between Fredericton and Moncton said snow was accumulating as fast as four to five centimetres an hour.
The real challenge though is the heavy snowfall, and the wind that has come with it, has made visibility very poor. Driving conditions are very treacherous, Mr. Giberson said.
Much of Southern Quebec also remained under a winter-storm warning after about 30 centimetres of snow fell in Montreal, forcing the closing of schools and travel disruptions on Tuesday.
In Quebec City, the weather was bad enough that even the winter carnival was forced to close its outdoor activity sites Wednesday. Organizers said the temporary shutdown was necessary to ensure the safety of everyone.

Between 20 and 40 centimetres of snow were expected to fall in Quebec depending on the region, with strong winds reducing visibility on some roads to almost zero. Several highways were closed Wednesday morning, including Highway 20 in both directions between Lévis and Montmagny.
Most of the provinces schools and universities were closed, with more than 50 of 72 school boards declaring a snow day.
All Montreal universities were also closed, as were Universite Laval in Quebec City, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres and Universite du Quebec en Outaouais.
Meanwhile at the other end of the country, Environment Canada lifted snowfall warnings for British Columbias south coast, but conditions were still treacherous in some areas and frigid temperatures persisted in parts of the province.
Snow continued to fall over parts of southern Vancouver Island and the Fraser Valley, prompting some school closings as well as the suspension of all BC Transit service between Abbotsford and Hope.

Jessica Patton,"Commuters in the Greater Toronto Area are encouraged to leave plenty of time for travel on Monday as the region deals with intense snowfall and brisk winds.
Environment Canada issued a winter storm warning. It said 15 to 25 centimetres of snow, which is the result of an “Alberta Clipper,” is expected to hit the city by Tuesday morning.
“The evening commute will be very messy with snow and blowing snow,” Global News meteorologist Anthony Farnell said, adding temperatures will remain well below freezing.

Significant snowfall, extreme cold in forecast for Ontario
Winds gusting to 50 km/h are blowing the snow around, making for treacherous driving conditions.
The City of Toronto said salting operations began just after 12 p.m. on Monday. Plowing will begin once the snow accumulation hits five centimetres.
The TTC issued a warning to commuters Monday to “plan ahead” for the conditions. Anti-icing efforts are underway, as well as heaters have been turned on across the TTC network.
Extra staff will also be working overnight to monitor signals and tracks.
OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said commuters who are driving should make sure snow is cleared off of vehicles, that emergency supplies are stocked and that washer fluid is topped up. He said to also make sure you are giving yourself extra time.

As of 10 p.m. on Monday, Schmidt said there were more than 100 collisions on GTA highways patrolled by OPP officers.
He said collisions that take place during events like these are often “preventable.”
“Drivers just going too fast, following too close, not paying attention those are absolutely preventable and we just want people to do their part,” he said.

If you get into a collision, Schmidt said drivers involved should remove themselves from the highway to exchange information or get to a collision reporting centre.
After the storm hits, Farnell said temperatures will continue to plummet into the double-digits below freezing by late Tuesday. 
He said Wednesday will be one of the coldest days of the entire winter season with temperatures hovering near -20 C, with wind chills below -30 C.

,"The first snow of the year is on the way just a couple of weeks before Christmas thanks to a massive winter storm that will travel from Texas up to Maine. Some parts of Massachusetts could get more than three to six inches of heavy, wet snow, with higher accumulation totals piling up further inland. The storm system will move up along the coastline and bring a mix of rain and snow to the area beginning Saturday mid-morning and continuing through the overnight hours. The heaviest precipitation will occur from 11 a.m. until about 11 p.m. on Saturday. The moisture from the storm is actually the same moisture that dropped early snow on Texas yesterday. Some energy from Canada will merge with that moisture off the coastline Saturday to form our coastal storm. A few areas may go above the 3 to 6 inch range, I am predicting. The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory lasting from 4 a.m. on Saturday until 7 a.m. on Sunday, forecasting 3 to 6 inches for a large swath of the state and a small chance of 7 to 8 inches in the central hills of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Rain vs. Snow Cape Cod and the islands will likely get soaked with rain, and any snow that occurs will be minimal. The outer tip of Cape Ann will also likely end up with some rain, although there could be a slushy coating to a couple of inches. South of Boston, along the South Shore roads, the precipitation may flip back and forth between rain and snow, resulting in lesser snow totals there as well. If the storm jogs a little west or east, however, the rain could push inland or the snow could push toward the coast, so coastal dwellers should be aware that the forecast could change the most for you. The snow will be on the heavier and wetter side. You likely have noticed that some of the trees, especially Japanese maples, are holding onto their leaves right now. This is because that dramatic cold which occurred in November while the plants were growing stopped the abscission process and left the leaves on these trees. Because of that, some of the heavier snow could do some damage. It’s not a bad idea if you can very gently shake the snow off during the storm if it looks like these trees are getting really weighed down. This isn’t the type of storm that’s going to shut down Logan Airport or create long-term travel issues. This is a typical moderate December snow storm. You should leave yourself extra time to get to where you’re going, as roads will be slick much of the afternoon and evening on Saturday. We could see lighter snow showers Saturday overnight, but Sunday will see clearing skies and cold temperatures. A second storm on the horizon? This bout of winter weather isn’t over yet. There is another storm we need to watch for later Tuesday and Wednesday. However that storm shakes out, much colder arctic air is also set to arrive by the end of next week. Temperatures will be well below normal for several days.","Boston.com A heavy, wet snowstorm is headed toward New England Boston.com The first snow of the year is on the way just a couple of weeks before Christmas thanks to a massive winter storm that will travel from Texas up to Maine.

,"A winter storm that blanketed the Midwest with snow and left seven dead hit Washington and its surrounding areas Sunday with more than 35 million people under winter weather alerts.
Up to a foot of snowfall is possible in Washington and Virginia on Sunday and into Monday morning, the National Weather Service said.
Baltimore is also in the path of these heavier bands of snowfall, with 4 to 6 inches of snow predicted for Sunday. Philadelphia is predicted to get 1 to 2 inches of snow, and there is a possibility of light accumulation in New York along the storm's northern edge.
""We have a strong snowstorm that's stretching 1,400 miles from Kansas to the East Coast,"" CNN meteorologist Haley Brink said. ""St. Louis is seeing its worst snowstorm in five years. We're going to see a significant snow event for the mid-Atlantic to start the year for 2019.""
Over a foot of snow has fallen across areas of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado since Friday. The highest snowfall totals were in Montgomery City, Missouri, northwest of St. Louis, which was hit with 20 inches of snow.
More than 35 million people are under winter storm warnings or advisories across the Ohio River Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday.
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning effective through 6 p.m. ET Sunday for Washington, parts of central Maryland and northern and northwest Virginia. Sleet, snow and ice are making traveling conditions hazardous if not impossible.
Snowy and icy mess
The Appalachians will pick up ice and snow in the mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, forecasters said. Half an inch of ice and 3 to 5 inches of snow are predicted. In anticipation of the storm, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency Saturday.
There is a small chance the southern Appalachians will get enough freezing rain and sleet to bring an ice event Saturday into Sunday.
More heavy rain also will fall on the saturated South. The Southeast has seen abundant precipitation in December and January, and the additional rain could put a strain on already-high rivers.
The storm eased up Saturday in St. Louis after dropping more than 10 inches of snow there.
At least four people have died and scores of motorists were injured and stranded, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.
In Kansas, three people died Friday in traffic accidents, authorities said Saturday: A 62-year-old man in a vehicle that struck a barrier wall on the Kansas Turnpike, a semi-truck driver whose vehicle collided with another truck and a driver whose vehicle struck an oncoming vehicle and ran into a ditch.
In a tweet Saturday night, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said it had responded to 57 injuries, 878 crashes, 1,790 stranded motorists and 3,918 calls for service.
St. Louis recorded 10.4 inches of snow by 1:30 p.m. ET, with higher accumulations in other parts of Missouri. In Columbia, 15.5 inches were reported and Harrisburg had 17 inches.
The Missouri Department of Transportation warned residents not to travel in the storm if it wasn't necessary. The department reported incidents and stalls on interstates overnight. But it cited progress Saturday as crews worked to clear routes and bring ""water and food to stranded motorists.""
The University of Missouri men's basketball game Saturday at the University of South Carolina was moved to Sunday because of weather-related travel problems, the team tweeted.","National After killing 7 in the Midwest, winter storm to hit DC and surrounding areas CNN WCPO Winter storm snarls Midwest roads, claims at least 7 lives CBS News Storm woes continue; stay home Saturday, MoDOT ask KPLR 11 St. Louis Storm dumps snow on Midwest…",2019-01-13T14:24:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wcpo.com'}","National After killing 7 in the Midwest, winter storm to hit DC and surrounding areas CNN - WCPO",https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/after-killing-7-in-the-midwest-winter-storm-to-hit-dc-and-surrounding-areas,https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee6e381/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Faf%2F71%2F0a71b4b34598ba025ced117dcabe%2Fgettyimages-1081542074.jpg,,Wcpo.com,snow storm,1
Joshua Freeman,"The GTA and much of southern Ontario could be in for another bout of messy weather with a winter storm system expected to hit the region Tuesday.
According to a special weather statement issued by Environment Canada for Toronto and most of southern Ontario Sunday, significant snow, freezing rain, and strong winds could be on the horizon.
A low pressure system brewing over the Southern Plains States may intensify into a winter storm as it tracks over Southern Ontario Tuesday, the agency said in its statement. Snow is expected to arrive Tuesday morning. The snow may change to ice pellets and freezing rain for a few hours Tuesday before changing back to snow by Tuesday night as colder air arrives in the wake of the low pressure system.
The snow is expected to taper off to flurries on Wednesday.
Between five and 15 centimetres of snow and ice pellets are expected to accumulate in some areas, along with ice buildup from freezing rain.
The wind could make the messy weather even more hazardous.
Strong and gusty easterly winds may cause low visibility in blowing snow before the snow changes over to freezing precipitation, Environment Canada said.
The statement warned that the storm could have a significant impact on travel in the region.
The city will see a small taste of precipitation tonight, with two centimetres of snow expected overnight.
The expected storm Tuesday comes as the city sees a few days of relatively warmer weather.
A high of 4 C was expected in Toronto Sunday. The warmer weather was enough to prompt the city to end an extreme cold weather alert which had been in place.
Tuesday will see a high of -2 C, though the wind chill will make it feel closer to -12.
On Tuesday, the city is expected to see a high of -1 C.","More winter weather on the way: Snow, freezing rain expected in Toronto Tuesday CP24 Toronto's Breaking News Blistering wind chill overnight then up to 40 cm of snow Tuesday Ottawa Citizen Another winter storm brewing in the GTA, to arrive Tuesday 680 News Wi…",2019-02-10T18:43:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cp24.com'}","More winter weather on the way: Snow, freezing rain expected in Toronto Tuesday - CP24 Toronto's Breaking News",https://www.cp24.com/weather/more-winter-weather-on-the-way-snow-freezing-rain-expected-in-toronto-tuesday-1.4290520,https://www.cp24.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273340.1548770673!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Cp24.com,snow storm,1
Rachel Reeves,"The first week of March will roar in with travel-disrupting snow, strong winds and blizzard conditions across the north-central United States. After spreading accumulating snow over the northern and central Rockies this weekend, snow and wind will ramp up across the northern Plains Sunday night into Monday. The winds combining with the snow will lead to local whiteout and blizzard conditions, according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun. The worst of the blizzard is expected across the Dakotas, from Minot and Bismarck, North Dakota, to Pierre, South Dakota.

There is the potential for many communities to pick up 6 inches or more of snow with this storm across the north-central U.S. “Bismarck has only received around 18 inches of snow so far this season and could receive around a foot or more from this event alone,” Rathbun said. Precipitation will start with rain and/or a bit of ice across the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin prior to colder air wrapping into the storm. Snow may struggle to stick to roads and sidewalks initially in these areas. However, as the temperature plummets and the ground cools, motorists and pedestrians will need to be wary of slick travel.

Six years ago, Hurricane Sandy pushed storm surges into the streets of Staten Island, New York, wrecking entire neighborhoods along the small island off the coast of Manhattan.

Flooding from rainfall will exacerbate conditions throughout the area. pic.twitter.com/kuugOzWU4c — Dr. Rick Luettich (@RLuettich) September 11, 2018 In light of this reality, how much worse might these Florence-caused storm surges be? ""The simplest effect is that any storm surge is amplified by sea level rise,"" Jaap Nienhuis, a researcher at Florida State University's Coastal Morphodynamics Lab, said in an interview. ""When a major event like this occurs, it's riding on top of sea level rise,"" added Rick Luettich, the Director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in an interview. Sea level rise can certainly make the difference in whether or not hurricane waters surmount coastal dunes and comes flooding into communities, said Luettich, but it’s not yet as influential as normal tides in determining how a destructive a storm’s surge may, or may not, be. Off the North Carolina coast, tides rise and fall between 5 and 6 feet each day — substantially more than current contributions from sea level rise. It's important to remember that the Storm Surge Watch issued at 5 AM this morning covers the potential for life-threatening surge through 48 hours. Impacts beyond 48 hours will be covered by subsequent updates. pic.twitter.com/0RaE51d5Ws — NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) September 11, 2018 “The timing of the surge with the tide is enormously important,” said Luettich. “We might dodge the bullet if it [Florence} were to hit at a low tide.” Yet, a looming problem with Florence is that the expansive storm is expected to stall over the region — as more storms are want to do as the Arctic warms. This means strong winds could have more opportunities to hit the high tide cycle, bringing the worst of the surges. “If it’s a real lingerer, then it will undoubtedly end up going through a high-tide cycle,” said Luettich. The future of storm surges Any storm surge is dependent on a variety of factors — the shape of the land, winds, tide, etc. — and sea level is just one component. But sea level rise is now accelerating as ice sheet melt hastens and the warming ocean expands. Eventually, sea level rise will be a critical influence. “The effect today is not nearly what it’s going to be in 100 years,” said Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University. “Down the road — when the sea has risen a meter — then it’s going to be a factor.” Until then, however, sea level rise will still be a growing, relentless problem. Melting ice and expanding oceans “are going to persistent into the future,” Ben Hamlington, NASA’s Sea Level Change Team Lead, said in an interview. “You know they’re going to contribute going forward.” A NASA graph showing sea level rise since 1993. Image: nasa And as the surges grow, development along the coast has largely eliminated the natural barriers that once weakened storm surges — things like marshes and dunes. “There’s not a buffer zone anymore,” said Nienhuis. “It’s been developed immensely,” he said, specifically citing the Southeastern coastline. To counteract the disappearance of natural barriers, we’ve built impressive fortifications like seawalls to combat rising seas or surges, said Nienhuis. But these efforts are counter-intuitive, he said. Rigid walls reflect wave energy, rather than absorbing it, sending that energy to other portions of the coast, and bringing erosion and damage elsewhere. Worth mentioning the continued population &amp; exposure growth in the potential path of #Florence. Many spots show robust change since 2000. Such rapid changes means many new residents have yet to experience hurricane conditions and/or severe inland flooding. pic.twitter.com/gdLmHZDhjr — Steve Bowen (@SteveBowenWx) September 10, 2018 Hurricane Florence promises to be such a powerful tempest that it’s wise — if not imperative — to leave the coasts, should the right combination of high tides, surging waters, and ever-growing sea level rise combine to hammer coastal communities. Willoughby says it would behoove coastal dwellers to take a trip well inland — perhaps using the storm as an excuse to really get out of town. “There’s a lot of people in the coastal Carolinas that should be thinking about visiting Aunt Mabel in St. Paul, Minnesota,” he said.","Surging hurricane waters can throw around cars, boats, and houses like toys.

Most transport and flights have been suspended in Ireland where strong winds brought by a storm left some 24,000 homes and businesses without power. Several other countries have faced disruptions caused by snow and ice. The death toll rose in Poland, and the public has been told to alert officials if they see people sleeping outside. The unusually cold spell brought by a Siberian weather system was being felt as far south as the balmy Mediterranean. Where are the problems? The system has been given various nicknames - in the UK it is ""the Beast from the East"" while the Dutch call it the ""Siberian bear"" and Swedes the ""snow cannon"". It met Storm Emma on Thursday, causing blizzards and strong winds in parts of England, Wales and Ireland. Media caption How to keep warm?

"Elizabeth LaFleur, Haley Walters","Snowfall forecast for winter storm headed to Upstate this weekend as of 4 p.m. Dec. 5. (Photo: Submitted photo/National Weather Service) A potentially historic winter storm is rolling into the Upstate this weekend, with forecasters now predicting as much as a foot of snow in northern Greenville County and parts of North Carolina. Greenville's weekend forecast depends on what a storm 3,000 miles away does over the next few days but it could mean freezing rain, sleet or even snow. On Wednesday evening, forecasts showed more snow and less ice than previously expected. Winter weather is expected to begin early Saturday evening and possibly linger into Monday. ""This storm could be historic for some areas, but we're not sure what areas yet. Any time you're talking about a portion of our area outside the mountains seeing a foot of snow, that's a once in a generation event,"" said Trisha Palmer, meterologist with the National Weather Service at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. She said precipitation totals and locations of snow will change as the low pressure system progresses. The National Weather Service issued a hazardous weather outlook for Upstate South Carolina, Western North Carolina, Northeast Georgia and Piedmont North Carolina. ""Confidence is high we'll see a significant storm with significant weather for the mountains and foothills of mainly N.C. and close to the border,"" said Robbie Munroe, meteorologist with the National Weather Service at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport earlier Wednesday. ""As you head down our direction, we're kind of on the borderline between snow and rain."" Related: Greenville County, Upstate may get snow, sleet, rain this weekend Forecasts for Greenville show a back and forth between rain and freezing rain or sleet throughout the weekend. As of Wednesday morning, the low pressure system was still out near California and changes in the strength or track of that system could make a big difference in how it affects Greenville, Munroe said. ""Since this will be a powerful coastal storm, one thing we are confident in is we'll likely see fairly significant precipitation across the region,"" Munroe said. Rain is expected most of the day Saturday and could turn to freezing rain and sleet overnight Saturday into Sunday. Rain or freezing rain is again expected Sunday with it turning to all rain by 2 p.m. before returning overnight Sunday, according to the current forecasts. Saturday: Rain likely after 4 p.m. 60 percent chance of precipitation. High near 40. Saturday night: Rain,likely before 8 p.m. then rain and sleet likely between 8 p.m. and midnight, then sleet after midnight. Low around 32. 80 percent chance of precipitation. Sunday: Rain and snow before noon, then rain or freezing rain between noon and 1 p.m, then rain after 1 p.m. High near 35. 90 percent chance of precipitation. Sunday night: Rain likely before midnight, then a chance of snow between midnight and 2 a.m, then a chance of rain after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 32. 60 percent chance of precipitation. Monday : 50 percent chance of rain. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 41.

Pamela Sroka-Holzmann | For lehighvalleylive.com,"With nearly a thousand people still without power in Warren and Hunterdon counties, meteorologists are watching the potential for a third storm Monday into Tuesday. Forecast models don't yet seem to agree Monday's storm will be a third nor'easter, but the National Weather Service is showing this round of weather will be bringing some additional snowfall. There's a slight chance of snow before 2 p.m. Monday, then rain likely between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., then rain and snow likely after 5 p.m. -- just in time for the evening commute, according to the weather service. Forecasters are predicting mostly cloudy weather, with a high near 39 degrees and a northeast wind 3 to 7 mph. The chance of precipitation for Monday is 60 percent with snow accumulation of less than a half inch possible. Forecasters predict more snow into Monday evening as temperatures drop to a low around 29 degrees. Northeast wind is expected to be around 5 mph becoming northwest in the evening. The chance of precipitation is 90 percent on Monday night with new snow accumulation of 1 to 3 inches possible. AccuWeather is making similar predictions, calling for flurries to begin around 6 p.m. Monday and when the storm is all said and done, bringing a total accumulation of 1 to 3 inches. More bad news is predicted for Tuesday with snow expected to fall again sometime before 1 p.m., according to the weather service. Then, there's a chance of rain showers. Stranded in storm with no power? National Guard may be coming to help Tuesday is expected to be cloudy with a high temperature near 42 degrees and northwest wind 8 to 14 mph. The chance of precipitation is 30 percent with new snow accumulation of less than a half inch possible. AccuWeather is forecasting flurries around 10 a.m. Tuesday and again, around 7 p.m. Tuesday. The chance for more than three inches of accumulation Monday into Tuesday is 36 percent while the chance for less than an inch of snowfall accumulation is 10 percent, according to AccuWeather. The storm comes as residents -- mostly in Warren and Hunterdon counties -- remain without power due to high winds, snow and rain knocking down power lines from a March 2 nor'easter. Households received a second punch with yet another nor'easter March 7. As of 11 a.m. Sunday, 79 Jersey Central Power &amp; Light customers in Warren County remain in the dark and another 752 Hunterdon County customers also are without electricity.

Tony Bizjak,"The biggest storm of the season began rolling into Northern California late Wednesday, kicking off four straight days of wintry weather that will drench the Sacramento area and deliver as much as 7 feet of snow with whiteout conditions to the Sierra Nevada. As a late afternoon drizzle descended on the Sacramento region, the National Weather Service forecast heavy rains, gusting winds and possibly another hailstorm in the area - but no significant flooding. The Sierra Nevada was in for a severe pounding, with foothill areas as low as 3,500 feet likely to get as much as 5 feet of snow by the time the storm front departs late Saturday - the heaviest snowfall in the foothills since 2011. Courtney Obergfell, a weather service meteorologist, said the fiercest snow will arrive Thursday but conditions in the Sierra will be difficult throughout the duration of the storm. Higher elevations will see 7 feet of snow in some areas before it's over, and Obergfell urged motorists to forgo any trips to the mountains. ""This is going to impact a long stretch of highway and... traffic is highly discouraged,"" said Obergfell in a conference call with reporters. She said the weather service is ""just trying to encourage people to... wait until Sunday if they can."" The weather service issued a winter storm warning for the mountain regions until late Saturday night. In Sonoma County, meanwhile, officials urged residents to be prepared for flooding and other problems left over from last October's wine country fires. In Southern California, evacuation warnings were issued for areas overcome by mudslides in January. In short, California is finally getting a dose of normal winter weather after an abnormally dry season. The latest storm isn't unprecedented; it's just long overdue this year. ""These (storms) can happen during the winter typically,"" Obergfell said. ""We haven't had a lot of these recently."" Along with Monday's rain and snow, the new storm is expected to put a dent in the drought-like conditions that have plagued California this winter. But it won't completely remedy the season's water shortfall. The weather service said Sacramento could expect 2 to 3 inches of rain by Saturday. Because river levels are low and temperatures will stay cold, the region should avoid any significant flooding except in areas where drainage is poor and flooding is frequent. Obergfell said parts of the valley could get thunderstorms and another bout of hail Thursday, repeating the freakish conditions from Monday that convinced many Sacramentans it snowed. Caltrans officials were gearing up for chain controls and road closures. “We’re going to have a fun couple of days here, my goodness, shades of last year,” said Liza Whitmore, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. She said intermittent road closures were expected, beginning as early as Wednesday night, at Donner Summit on Interstate 80 and Echo Summit on Highway 50. Motorists in foothill communities such as Placerville, Grass Valley, Nevada City and Auburn will see extensive snow on major highways and local roads. “If you are going anywhere in the mountains and foothills, expect chain controls,” Whitmore said. Caltrans also warned of localized flooding on valley roads. Tahoe ski resorts, which have relied heavily on artificial snow for much of the winter, greeted the arrival of the real thing. ""3-4 feet of more snow in forecast thru Sunday,"" blared the headline on the Squaw Valley-Alpine Meadows website. Getting to the ski areas could be extremely difficult, though. Even though there will be some breaks in the weather, notably Friday, the weather service said motorists can expect lengthy delays because of the long hours it will take to clear the roads. Winds in the mountains will gust as high as 50 mph, which will bring more travel problems. ""It's going to be a fluffier, whiter snow, and so we're expecting issues with blowing snow as well, and that can cause whiteout conditions at times,"" Obergfell said. Fluffier snow brings another downside: less relief for California's water supply. Michelle Mead, the weather service's warning coordination meteorologist, said temperatures are expected to be so cold that the snow won't deliver as much water as usual. ""It's a drier snowfall, for sure, but we're going to take it,"" Mead said. ""It's still a decent amount of liquid precipitation."" So far this year, rainfall totals in Sacramento and many other cities are about half what they should be for this time of year, and the Sierra snowpack - a critical source of water in summer and fall - is just 23 percent of average. The Department of Water Resources' closely watched rain-gauge index, which measures a mix of rain and snow in the northern Sacramento Valley, was at 57 percent of average heading into Wednesday. Winter driving, chain control tips The U.S. Drought Monitor, published by the federal government, said 91 percent of California was ""abnormally dry"" heading into this week, and 48 percent of the state was experiencing some degree of drought conditions. Meanwhile, forecasters said Southern California could expect more than an inch of rain beginning Thursday. The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office issued a recommended evacuation warning for areas of the county where mudslides killed more than 20 people and temporarily closed Highway 101 in January. ""High risk for loss of life and property exists,"" the Sheriff's Office said.","Sacramento Bee Stay put in the valley.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"(Reuters) - A winter storm bearing down on North and South Carolina on Saturday was set to glaze roads with ice and trigger widespread power outages, with the National Weather Service warning of more than a foot of snow in the region’s mountainous west. The snow was due to strike the area on Saturday evening, with the heaviest falls expected early Sunday morning and lasting until early Monday. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, who declared a state of emergency on Friday, told residents to finish stockpiling food and avoid unnecessary travel. “This weekend isn’t the time to head out to see the winter wonderland. Stay safe where you are,” Cooper said in a statement. “Getting out on dangerous roads could put your life at risk.” The effects of the storm, including power outages, could last for days in North Carolina, officials said. About 500,000 electricity customers could lose power in North Carolina and South Carolina, a Duke Energy spokeswoman said on Twitter. North Carolina’s Mount Mitchell could receive 12-18 inches (30-46 cm) of snow, said meteorologist Jim Hayes of the federal Weather Prediction Center. Other parts of the Carolina mountains are also expected to receive heavy snowfall. Charlotte, the most populous city in North Carolina, could be covered in 5 inches (13 cm) of snow. The storm may affect airports including Asheville and Raleigh-Durham International in North Carolina, Lynchburg and Roanoke in Virginia and Greenville-Spartanburg International, South Carolina. American Airlines said it would waive change fees for people booked through Charlotte Douglas International, a major regional hub in North Carolina. Some of North Carolina’s roads may disappear under ice up to a quarter of an inch (half a centimeter) thick, the National Weather Service said. Icy roads also were expected in the upstate region of South Carolina, with the mountains of northeast Georgia also at risk for slick roads, Hayes said. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division warned motorists to drive carefully on bridges, overpasses and remote roadways, which could freeze over quickly. The storm, which formed off the Texas coast and is moving east, has dumped more than 5 inches (13 cm) of precipitation in Lubbock, Texas, and lashed parts of Arkansas and Tennessee with icy rain, Hayes said.

Zack Green,"Friday will be mild but dreary. Rain sticks around through the early afternoon but we're looking ahead to the weekend concerns. A Winter Storm Watch has been put in effect from Saturday evening through Sunday morning for Rhode Island along with Plymouth and Bristol County, MA. Southern Worcester County is also in this Watch. The steadiest snow should come between the hours of 10pm and 5am. The timeline has come together quite nicely and the guidance models agree that it should push to the northeast by 7am Sunday. Take a look at how quickly this system moves below. Over the past few days, the snow totals have waivered a bit. In fact, 72 hours from the event, the European model was suggesting over 8"" while the American forecast was between 1-2"". That wide gap has become smaller over the last day, but, the totals will depend on where this system ultimately lands. At this time, both models (as well as the higher resolution information) are suggesting is stays offshore which is conducive to snow in southern New England. But, as you can see in the images below, the two premier models differ in their location. Regardless of which track eventually wins, it's safe to say there will be a brushstroke of 3-6"" for most in RI. Lesser amounts are possible towards the Cape and Islands as some rain could mix in. This is expected to be wet, dense snow and should compact quickly. A parking ban has already been put into effect for Portsmouth. Portsmouth Police told NBC10 the ban will last from 9pm Saturday through 1pm Sunday. I expect bans in other parts of the state to pop up ahead of this storm. If you don't like to shovel, there is some good news to pass along as well. Temperatures will be on the rise as early as Sunday afternoon. With highs in mid 40s on Sunday, near 50° Monday, and approaching 60° on Tuesday, the snow will likely melt off quickly!

Weather Prediction Center forecaster David Roth told NPR this could be a ""historic storm"" for southwest Virginia and western North Carolina. Jonathan Drew/AP Up to a foot of snow and possibly more is expected to fall on Sunday night across the southern Appalachians and nearby foothills in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. ""Some places might get what the equivalent of a year of snowfall is for that area,"" David Roth, a forecaster Weather Prediction Center, told NPR. ""I would think this will end up being a historic storm for southwest Virginia and western North Carolina."" The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for areas from northeast Georgia to southern Virginia. A mix of wet snow, sleet and rain are predicted to hit southern Virginia and the coastal plain of the Carolinas, which is still recovering from Hurricane Florence. Churches across the region have canceled Sunday services, and many schools are planning to shutter their doors on Monday. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on Friday. On Saturday, the governor urged people not to risk travel during the snowstorm, which he reminded residents isn't the same thing as ""snow fall."" ""This weekend isn't the time to head out to see the winter wonderland. Stay safe where you are,"" Cooper said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam followed suit, declaring a state of emergenc y on Saturday. ""Virginians should take all necessary precautions to ensure they are prepared for winter weather storm impacts,"" said Northam. Being prepared means having up to three days worth of food on-hand and an emergency kit in your car, said North Carolina's emergency management officials on Saturday. It won't be easy for people to travel during the storm by road, train or air. Cooper warned that North Carolinians who brave the roads could make it harder for first responders and road crews to do their jobs, which includes keeping roads ice-free. ""Each night, any snow that melts during the day...it could refreeze,"" forecaster David Roth told NPR. ""You're going to end up with black ice on the roads."" As of Saturday morning, the governor's office said that road crews had spread more than 1 million gallons of brine solution on the state's roads to keep them from getting icy. Flights to and from cities in North Carolina and Virginia have been impacted, too, according to travel advisories from multiple major airlines, including Delta, Southwest, United and American. Flights in Tennessee and South Carolina have also been affected. FlightAware, a website that tracks flights, reported more than 6,500 delays and 1,500 cancellations on Sunday morning. And, on Saturday, Amtrak announced it would be canceling trains and changing services through Tuesday. As heavy snow and ice weigh down branches and cause trees to fall, power lines could fall, too, causing power outages. One of the country's largest electric companies, Duke Energy, announced on Saturday that the storm could bring more than 500,000 power outages in the Carolinas. According to a website that tracks live power outages, almost 150,000 people in North Carolina were without power as of Sunday morning.

Nick Bannin,"CHICOPEE, Mass. (WWLP)- Accumulating snow is coming back to western Massachusetts during the middle of the week. After temperatures in the 50s and 60s Friday into Saturday, winter weather has returned and snow is in the forecast. A Winter Storm Watch has been issued for Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday afternoon for ALL of western Massachusetts. A Winter Storm Watch means there is the potential for 6″ or more of snow in the Watch area. Snow could begin as early as Tuesday afternoon, but it should start as flurries or just light snow showers. We don’t expect difficult driving conditions until later Tuesday evening and especially Wednesday morning when snow could be fairly heavy. While we most likely will make adjustments to our forecast, at this point we expect widespread 3-6″ of snow throughout the area. Here’s our snowfall forecast map.

Alex Dobuzinskis,"(Reuters) - A winter storm that has blanketed the U.S. Midwest with snow advanced on the U.S. Northeast on Saturday, forcing the cancellation of flights and train service during a holiday weekend when many Americans were traveling. 
The Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings or advisories for a swath of the eastern United States that is home to 100 million people, said meteorologist Rich Otto of the U.S. Weather Prediction Center. 
The storm system, which was moving from west to east and was strengthened by arctic air from Canada, hit many parts of the Midwest on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. 
In Chicago, where some neighborhoods received 8 inches (20 cm) of snow, one third of flights were canceled at the city’s two main airports, said Mark Duell, vice president of operations for tracking firm FlightAware. 
The storm was expected to dump up to 2 feet (60 cm) of snow on the Northeast starting on Saturday evening, with snowfall likely to last until Monday in upstate New York and Maine, Otto said. 
New York City was expected to receive up to 2 inches (5 cm) of snow. 
Gusty winds will bring the coldest air parts of the U.S. East Coast have seen all winter, according to the National Weather Service. For instance, the temperature in Boston could drop to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 degrees Celsius) on Sunday. 
The governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared emergencies for their states ahead of the storm, warning of high snow accumulation and even potential flooding in some areas. 
The storm was sweeping across the eastern United States ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, a holiday honoring the late civil rights leader. 
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration had said it expected the long weekend to be a busy one for travel. 
The storm has interrupted some travelers’ plans. 
From Friday through Sunday, the severe weather was expected to trigger the cancellation of more than 3,000 flights in the United States, Duell said. 
Meanwhile, in some parts of the Northeast, the Weather Service warned snow-covered roads could leave some people stranded on Saturday night and Sunday. 
“If you don’t have to be on the roads, we recommend staying in and staying safe,” Automobile Association of America spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano said in a phone interview. 
Amtrak canceled train service from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York on Saturday and canceled and modified several routes that originate and end on the East Coast on Sunday.

Marcus Gilmer,"With a giant nor'easter slamming into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, forecasters are using warnings with dire language to inform coastal residents of Massachusetts that this storm will not be an ordinary event. In fact, record coastal flooding is anticipated in Boston and other parts of eastern Massachusetts, which is leading the National Weather Service to come out with statements that it rarely, if ever, issues. SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions The coastal flooding is the result of a long fetch of easterly winds, reaching hurricane force (75 miles per hour), pointed squarely at the north-south coast of eastern Massachusetts. The combination of astronomical high tides, astorm surge of 3 to 5 feet, storm surge, and waves of up to 30 feet just just offshore, is already inundating the coastline with water levels well above normal tide levels, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). At high tide on Friday morning, the water in Boston Harbor reached 14.36 feet, which was the third-highest water level on record. And the worst of this storm is yet to come. For the high tide on Friday night, the NWS is forecasting a record water level will be set in Boston of between 15.4 and 15.7 feet, beating the old record set just two months ago. The long-lasting flooding and battering waves has prompted unusually drastic language in the NWS' warnings (emphasis ours). Damage to some shoreline structures may occur. There will likely be widespread inundation of coastal roads and basements with life-threatening inundation depths above 3 or more feet possible in some locations. Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time. This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary. Another major impact from the storm will likely be beach erosion, prompting this warning from the NWS: ""Very severe to extreme erosion is likely and may compromise protective dunes, seawalls and other structures. This storm may be capable of producing one or more new inlets."" In other words, this storm could simply smash through existing land, to create new islands. The NWS's Coastal Flood Threat and Inundation map shows where the worst flooding is expected along the Massachusetts coast, with water levels of nearly 15 feet expected in locations like Gloucester Harbor, Revere, Scituate, and Boston. The coastal flooding could break records all along Massachusetts' coast, including the Boston area, records that were just set in early January thanks to the ""Bomb Cyclone"" that whipped through the area. There's a major difference between that storm and this one, even though both are intensifying rapidly enough to be called meteorological bombs. Unlike with the ""Bomb Cyclone,"" which moved through quickly, a high pressure area over Greenland (also known as a ""Greenland block"") will keep the current storm system pinned in place for days. This means the storm will last through several high tide cycles along the North Atlantic coast, making damage more likely.

Andrew Freedman,"It all started innocently enough. Shortly before New Year's celebrations kicked off in the Southeast, a record-cold air mass blew in from the north. This air had a direct connection to the Arctic, spilling out as if someone left the Northern Hemisphere's refrigerator door open. This frigid air oozed across the Gulf of Mexico, into Florida, and served as one of the catalysts for a low pressure area to develop in the Bahamas on Tuesday. Snow flurries were even reported on an oil platform off the coast of Louisiana. SEE ALSO: Incredible photos from space show off the historic East Coast 'bomb cyclone' The cold air sitting over unusually warm Atlantic Ocean waters helped set up a huge thermal, or heat, contrast, which the East Coast's bomb cyclone was then able to take advantage of and intensify at nearly unheard of rates late Wednesday and Thursday. During the 24 hour period ending at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, the storm's central air pressure dropped by 59 millibars, to 951 millibars, which put the blizzard in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying storms. No other non-tropical storm has intensified this rapidly off the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast in the past 30 years or more.

So much to see! pic.twitter.com/OS4hLO9wOd — Jeff Frame (@VORTEXJeff) January 4, 2018 After the cold air moved into the Southeast, all that was needed for a storm to form was a trigger to come along. Mother Nature delivered multiple triggers on Wednesday, when three distinct, potent waves of energy embedded within the jet stream moved over the area. According to meteorologist Alex Lamers of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, meteorologists are scrambling to understand how this storm got so strong, so quickly. The temperature contrast was just one of the key ingredients that set this storm off, he said. “You had a really anomalously cold air mass south to the Gulf,"" Lamers said in an interview. “I think that was a big driver, just the big gradients in temperature and moisture,” he said. Some other factors, he said, may not be known now, and will require further study by researchers. “I think that was probably a big factor, and then jet [stream] dynamics probably played a big role too,” Lamers said. Winds at the upper levels of the atmosphere, within the highway of air that steers weather systems, promoted ascending air and storm intensification, Lamers said. 10 AM official WPC analysis has low pressure down to 951mb, a remarkable drop of 59 millibars in 24 hours. Also 38mb in the last 12 hours. pic.twitter.com/TgoLDS9J7h — Alex Lamers (@AlexJLamers) January 4, 2018 Sam Lillo, a meteorology Phd. student at the University of Oklahoma, said the jet stream disturbances acted ""like a vacuum, evacuating mass out of the column of atmosphere [and] resulting in decreasing pressure at the surface."" ""Even one shortwave interacting with the low and its subtropical connection would've resulted in a strong Atlantic storm. The three shortwaves also aren't perfectly phasing, so the actual ceiling for the strength of this storm was likely even higher."" Another ingredient in the bomb cyclone was unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Western Atlantic, Lillo said in a Twitter message. ""These origins, along with the unusually high Atlantic sea surface temperatures are important because there has been extraordinary influence from latent heat fluxes and deep convection in this storm...,"" he said, referring to the formation of powerful thunderstorms as part of the low pressure area. The above normal sea surface temperatures also produced an unusually sharp zone of temperature contrasts, which helped to fuel the low pressure area, Lamers said. Such storms, after all, feed off of the differences in air masses, so the bigger the contrast in air masses, the stronger the storm may get.

The main difference between a rapidly intensifying storm like the one on Thursday and one that intensifies at a more typical rate for the Northeast is that storms that undergo bombogenesis tend to produce higher wind gusts, as well as more thunderstorms. They can also be more difficult to predict, since computer models may struggle to predict their complex evolution. With winds gusting to at least 80 miles per hour, and a foot-plus of snow already falling in the Mid-Atlantic and New England, it's clear that the bomb cyclone of 2018 lived up to most of the hype. Now it's up to meteorologists to figure out how to better predict more storms like it in the future.","It all started innocently enough.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Great Lakes region is sending the year out with a bang. Wave after wave of lake effect snow has pummeled the region, making for a record-setting white Christmas and a shoveling project that could take until New Year’s Eve to complete. Erie, PA, is under a snow emergency after 53 inches of snow fell in 30 hours—the state record for the snowiest two-day period. It’s also more than Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and a slew of other seemingly snow cities get over an average winter. The crazy snow totals don’t stop there. In Redfield, NY, more than 32 inches fell in 24 hours between Christmas Day and early Tuesday. The region is expecting up to an additional 36 inches of snow by tomorrow, making shoveling a futile task. If Erie picks up four inches, it will officially set the record for the snowiest December ever recorded in Pennsylvania. “Travel will be very difficult to impossible,” the National Weather Service wrote in its lake-effect snow warning, a polite way of saying “we hope you’re not sick of your family yet.” The region from Cleveland to far upstate New York is no stranger to massive snow totals. Its geography sets it up perfectly for these types of large snowstorms. And in a seemingly strange twist of fate, climate change could actually provide them with a boost. Lake effect snow requires a few things to fall into place. The first, as with all snowstorms, is cold. It’s gotta be below 32°F to snow. For the Great Lakes region, cold air dropping out of Canada provides that key ingredient. But what allows lake effect snowstorms to produce such huge amounts of snow is, well, the lakes. Specifically, it’s the difference between the air temperature and the water temperature of the Great Lakes. As cold air rushes over lakes, it sweeps up some of the heat (relatively speaking) and moisture from the lakes’ surface. The length of the Great Lakes allow these burgeoning storms to pick up a huge head of steam as they barrel toward land. By the time they reach the Great Lakes’ shores, the air has become so moist and unstable that it unleashes a massive amount of snow with rates that can approach three inches an hour. These storms tend to come in narrow bands that result in tight snowfall gradients and even sunny skies a few miles from to most intense parts of the storm. Angela Fritz at Capital Weather Gang explains this curious quirk : “When a band of lake effect snow really gets going, an interesting thing happens. Air rises in the snowy regions and then sinks on either side, which means the area right next to these snow bands can be completely clear, with blue sky and sun. It also means just a few miles can separate 53 inches from zero.” The shape of the lakes and direction winds usually travel means that within the region, there are lake effect snow hot spots. The areas around Buffalo and Syracuse can get particularly snowy because winds are able to travel over long expanses of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, respectively. Parts of Michigan are also prone to heavy lake effect snow, particularly areas along the south shore of Lake Superior. The snowiest ski resort in the Midwest, for example, is on the Keweenaw Peninsula, which juts out into the lake from the Upper Peninsula and acts as a lake effect snow magnet. Lake effect snow is most common in November and December when there’s a lot of open water on the Great Lakes. As winter wears on and the lakes freeze over, moisture for these storms disappear. Ice only covers 3 percent of the Great Lakes as of Saturday but a coming Arctic blast could cause them to rapidly freeze up in the coming weeks, shutting down lake effect snow season. That’s where climate change comes in, though. Peak Great Lakes ice cover has been declining since satellite measurements began in the 1970s. Less ice means more chances for lake effect snow. And turns out that that’s exactly what scientists have observed. A 2003 study looking back to the 1930s showed an increase in lake effect snow across the entire lake effect snow region. A 2009 study using slightly stricter quality controls found that areas downwind of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan have seen significant increases with slightly less significant increases near Lakes Ontario and Erie. But snow could become less bountiful if climate change continues to wreak havoc. Warmer weather means less ice on the lakes, but it also means fewer days with freezing weather. Without early season cold, early season lake effect snowstorms could become less common according to a 2015 study. Ditto for late season ones after the ice starts to break up. That’s bad news for snow lovers, but a small silver lining of climate change for future 20somethings stuck at home for the holidays (lol kidding, their lives will probably be hell ).","The Great Lakes region is sending the year out with a bang.

Snow is going to change to rain quickly along the south coast, that rain-snow line will progress right into Boston by mid-morning. Near the rain-snow line, about 3 or 4 inches are expected near Boston. It's along and just north of that line where the heaviest and wettest snow falls, making it the most difficult to remove. To the north, snow amounts may be a little higher in the order of 5 to 8 inches, but it's a drier and easier snow to deal with.

Rebecca Hersher,"A satellite image from Wednesday morning shows a powerful storm system heading east across the U.S. The storm is expected to bring high winds, snow and rain to much of the central U.S. in the coming days.
GOES-East/NOAA
When a storm gets very intense very quickly, it gets a very special, very scary name: bomb cyclone.
And just such a storm has arrived in the central U.S.
The powerful system is already bringing high winds, rain and snow to an enormous chunk of the country, including the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region. The National Weather Service has issued high wind and winter storm advisories for an area ranging from Colorado and New Mexico over to Nebraska and parts of Texas, and up to South Dakota.
""This will be one of the strongest wind events in years for West Texas and Southeast New Mexico,"" warned the National Weather Service office in Midland, Texas, with gusts up to 75 miles per hour on Wednesday.
Winds that powerful can make it impossible to drive safely, especially in tall vehicles such as trucks.
The storm could also cause flooding, as rain falls on accumulated snow and rivers clogged with ice begin to rise. Unlike wind, flood risk can last days or even weeks as rivers crest.
On Wednesday morning, some roads were already flooded in the northeastern part of Nebraska, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning, saying more rain is expected later in the day.
In the Denver area, blowing snow could cause dangerous blizzard conditions. On Twitter, the weather service warned residents to ""cancel any travel plans Wednesday afternoon and evening."" Colorado Public Radio reports that the storm could be the most intense storm ever recorded in the area, with the barometric pressure dropping a walloping 23 millibars in just one day.
Barometric pressure is the pressure of the air in the atmosphere, and it changes when the weather changes. A drop in the barometric pressure generally accompanies ""bad weather"": wind, thunder, snow and rain.
When the barometric pressure drops a lot over a short period of time, the bad weather is especially severe. As NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee reported during one of last year's bomb cyclones, this can happen when masses of cold and warm air collide:
""That's where the word 'bomb' comes in, says Jeff Weber, a climatologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. 'We call storms that drop 24 millibars in 24 hours a bomb, a bombogenesis, the beginning of a cyclone.' The more technical (and less eye-catching) term is a baroclinic midlatitude cyclone.""
A bomb cyclone on the East Coast around this time last year killed multiple people, shut down train and plane service and knocked out power to about 2 million people.
Scientists are still studying how bomb cyclones in recent years are, or aren't, affected by the larger trend of global climate change. The increasingly wide undulations of the jet stream the wind highway that blows from west to east around the Northern Hemisphere has allowed for more extreme temperature fluctuations in the continental U.S. And sea surface temperatures, which have been steadily rising, also affect the intensity of storms.
But, says climate scientist Jonathan Martin of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ""There isn't a direct link between the slowly changing climate and this event."" 
Although this storm is ""rather unusually intense,"" he notes, ""these things come around every few years.""","The storm is bringing high winds, snow, rain and dangerous road conditions. Meteorologists and local officials are warning people across the West and Midwest to cancel travel plans.",2019-03-13T16:28:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",A 'Bomb Cyclone' Is Thwacking The Central U.S.,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/702946797/a-bomb-cyclone-is-thwacking-the-central-u-s,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/03/13/20190721332_goes16-abi-conus-geocolor-1250x750_wide-303e63d7e0bb4920aefc4c5c0c6d443b4648eadb.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,snow storm,1
