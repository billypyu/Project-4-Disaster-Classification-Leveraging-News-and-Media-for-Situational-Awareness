Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

Adam Rogers,"Our in-house Know-It-Alls answer
questions about your interactions with science and technology.
Q: What is an atmospheric river?
A: Join me in song.*
three-four!
Dont know why its raining this wayAll this water and skies are so grayPack an umbrella; wear some Gore-TexYou havent seen the worst of it yetI wanna knoooooow you wont tell meThis rains gonna stay
Atmospheric river, drops on us the waterAtmospheric river, pours even more waterWashing us down, washing us down
Has this song been stuck in the heads of every Californian for a month? Kind of. But they know the drill. Atmospheric rivers, the so-called Pineapple Express, are a feature of almost every coastline in the worldcausing half the extreme wind events and dropping more than half of the water those coasts see in rainfall. They can be 300 miles wide and 1,000 miles long, and even though just 2.8 percent of the rainfall hours in California between 2004 and 2010 were atmospheric river hours, they dropped 60 percent of the states rain.
More hyperbolic stats? Sure, we got em. More snow in a day than Boston got all winter. More rain in eight hours in Palm Springs than in the previous eight months. San Jose breaks a century-old rainfall record. Sonoma County got 20 inches of rain in two days (and yes, there were floods). Half of Californias water supply is now frozen as snow in the Sierras (thats good; its literally cold storage).
I dont know why youre raining so hardAll this wind makes you a blowhardYouve dropped an ocean, a flood, a delugeA lot of water that, sure, we can useI wanna knoooooow you wont tell meThis rains gonna stay
Atmospheric river, drops on us the waterAtmospheric river, pours even more waterWashing us down, washing us
What causes them? The river part isnt just a metaphor; warm, moisture-laden air in the tropospherefrom the ground to between 6 to 12 miles up over the tropics blows eastward. The flow eventually hits mountains (in this case, the Sierras) that deflect it upward, where the air cools offand drops all that moisture. The key number is called Integrated Vapor Transport: the amount of water getting pushed. According to a recently devised scale, any storm that moves more than 250 kilograms of water per meter per second and lasts more than a day is an atmospheric river.
Soak me, spatter me, splash me, splatter meTill I cant, till I cant, till I cant take no moreDrop down more water, atmospheric riverRain down more water, atmospheric riverWashing us down, washing us down
I dont know why you snow and you rainWish my galoshes would fit on my brainFifty inches of rain is a slogAnd now I still have to go walk the dog
While its true that atmospheric rivers bring floods, mudslides, sinkholes, and a generalized emotional greying of the Golden State, they also are the monsoons that typically end Californias dry seasons and break the states frequent droughts. But even that upside-down might be turning into a frown. Climate change means that atmospheric rivers are getting warmer at higher altitudes, dropping rain instead of snow. Without that snowpack, the states people and agriculture dont have enough water. The rivers will flow, but the droughts wont end.
Atmospheric river, dont just drop waterAtmospheric river, we need more snowa lot-terKeep washing us down, washing us down.

Adam Rogers,"You can see it on satellite imagery—a chaotic blur of wind and water shaped like a giant alien starfish over Australia, extending a tentacle diagonally across the Pacific and right into the Golden Gate. It’s called an atmospheric river, over a thousand miles of water and wind. This weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April. On the official scale, the storm will probably top out at “strong”—it might have enough water vapor transport to rate as “extreme,” but probably won’t reach “exceptional,” the real freak-out level of flood danger. That means several inches of rain. This is how California gets most of its disastrous floods, but also most of its drinking water. It’s a crazy way to do business, but understanding these atmospheric rivers might be the key to making sure the human race doesn’t die of thirst. Atmospheric rivers come ashore on nearly every west-facing coastline on Earth. A few times a year one of them does what this weekend’s storm will do: shotguns over Hawaii and into Northern California. “It tails all the way back into the tropics, almost to the date line,” says Michael Anderson, the California State climatologist. “It’s going to come through pretty quick.” Onshore, the fast, wet air from one of these so-called Pineapple Expresses ricochets upward off the coastal mountain ranges like a tennis ball catching the top of the net. The air rises; the water falls. That’s called “orographic enhancement,” and it’s how you get massive bursts of rain and floods. Somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of California’s entire water supply comes from atmospheric river storms. And they are intense. In one study of six years of California rainfall, monitored hour-by-hour, just 1,460 hours qualified as atmospheric river storms. But that scant 2.8 percent of time accounted for over 50 percent of the rainfall the researchers measured. California hoards more than half of that rain as snowfall on the tops of the Sierras. The rest it tries to save in reservoirs—a dozen big ones and about 150 littler ones scattered up and down the state. In the rainy winter months, the reservoirs fill up—ideally—leaving space for the snowmelt to come in the summer. Ideally. During the winter, all the reservoirs stay empty enough to absorb flood waves from storms. “But on April 1, that reserve space starts being relaxed so they can capture snowmelt,” Anderson says. “With a storm this time of year, you still have that flood reserve space, so there’s room for the reservoirs to catch that water. The question will be, as that reserve space is being relaxed, can that water be kept for the conservation pool?” It’s a balance—hold onto water for a rain-free summer and possible drought, be ready to capture snowmelt, but leave enough room to store a flood wave during the storm season. Every reservoir has a rule curve that says how much water is too much. But atmospheric rivers can make it tough to know when to apply those rules. In November and December of 2012, the Lake Mendocino Reservoir absorbed water from two atmospheric river events, enough so that the water encroached into the “flood pool,” which is supposed to stay empty for emergencies. “So the reservoir operators released the water. It was the prudent thing to do,” says F. Martin Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “But nobody knew that there would be no more atmospheric rivers basically for the rest of the year, and that was the beginning of the drought. They never had a chance to refill the reservoir in the spring.” So Ralph, along with the Sonoma County Water Agency (which regulates the drinking water in Lake Mendocino), the US Army Corps of Engineers (which operates the flood prevention aspects of the reservoir), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which monitors the salmon fishery that’s part of the lake’s hydrology) are all working on a finer-grained system. “It’s possible that with modern weather prediction we can see with some certainty these atmospheric rivers coming a few days ahead, so hypothetically one could consider keeping some of that extra water temporarily, and every day looking at the forecast to see if there’s an atmospheric river,” Ralph says. “If there’s not, the chance of there being a flood problem is essentially zero.” The idea’s still in a planning stage; Ralph’s group is now trying these “forecast-informed reservoir operations” at Mendocino and Prado in southern California. (It's still status quo ante at other reservoirs, like Like Oroville—where the people in charge will be trying out their new spillway, rebuilt since the old one crumbled during last year's rains. But if the new approach works—and so far it seems like it may—reservoirs can keep the water for a not-rainy day. That day may be coming. Or it might not. Water in the American west was variable and unpredictable even before humans started pumping enough carbon into the atmosphere that it’d change the climate. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor. That by itself would strengthen atmospheric rivers. But a warmer atmosphere means warmer poles, which reduces the temperature difference between the middle of the planet and the ends. That means weaker winds and weaker ARs. “However, there’s a big asterisk on that. It’s inevitable that some storms will be just as strong in terms of wind as they are today, and they will have available to them more water vapor,” Ralph says. “There could be a class of atmospheric river storms that are a lot stronger than we’ve seen in the past.” Ralph’s ideas for managing reservoirs better might end up being a necessary adaptation to a changed climate —and not just in California. The northwestern US gets a quarter to a third of its annual rainfall from atmospheric rivers, and they cause floods there, too. Arizona’s and Idaho’s big winter floods are often due to atmospheric rivers; a few years ago one even caused major flooding in Nashville. They are the drivers of flood and drought around the world. So understanding those ocean-spanning tendrils on satellite maps may be the solution to what’s arguably going to be humanity’s most pressing problem: figuring out what to do when the rains come, and when they don’t.",An atmospheric river means this weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April.,2018-04-06T17:30:46Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",An Atmospheric River Will Hit California With a Month's Worth of Rain,https://www.wired.com/story/a-months-worth-of-rain-will-hit-california-this-weekend/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac6bb0b19970475a8fa4ab4/191:100/pass/sfrain_623351114208.jpg,wired,Wired,River floods,1
George Dvorsky,"From floods and rain to droughts and unseasonably warm conditions, here’s the weather that Americans can expect in the coming months. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its long term weather forecast for Spring 2018, the period running from April until the end of June. Importantly, NOAA’s projections are just that: projections. They’re based on probabilities churned from intense number crunching and historical data. As always, stay tune to local weather conditions for more accurate reports as the season unfolds. Temperatures are expected to be above average for the southern two-thirds of the continental United States, extending from California to the central Plains and into the Northeast. Places most likely to be warmer than usual this spring include an area extending from the southwest across Texas and into the Gulf Coast. The northern half of Alaska and Hawaii should also be warmer than usual. Only the northern rockies will see temperatures below the norm. Right now, more than a quarter of the United States is experiencing drought, including southern California, the southwest, the northern and southern High Plains, and parts of the Southeast. NOAA expects drought to continue in most of these places, and even expand by June. On the positive side, drought conditions should wane in the northern Plains and the lower Missouri Valley owing to the usual spring rains. Speaking of rain, those of you in the northern United States can expect wetter-than-average conditions this spring, from the northern High Plains through to the Great Lakes region, Ohio Valley, and into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Hawaii and northern Alaska are also expected to see a bit more rain than usual. Below average precipitation is expected in the west and south, including California, the south-central plains—and in Texas and areas of Oklahoma where drought conditions are in effect. Spring hasn’t arrived, but heavy rainfall has already triggered flooding in the Ohio and Mississippi River basins, and record flooding has been recorded in the lower Great Lakes region. Until the end of May, folks in the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio River Basin, the Illinois River Basin, and in parts of the lower Missouri River Basin, should expect moderate flooding. People living near the Columbia River and upper Missouri River Basin aren’t off the hook, either, where minor flooding is possible thanks to the heavy snowpack that built up this winter. Mike Halpert from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center can tell you a bit more about what to expect this spring in this video. Again, stay tuned to local weather conditions, and be prepared for changing conditions.

A highway in Riverside County outside of Los Angeles was completely eroded by flooding in staggering footage shared by the California Department of Transportation on Thursday. As of early Friday morning, road closures were still in effect throughout the region, and authorities cautioned drivers against attempting to drive through flooded areas.
Palm Springs also saw significant flooding, with the Palm Springs Desert Sun reporting that several people needed to be rescued after floodwaters left them stranded. According to the National Weather Service San Diego, Palm Springs was walloped by its third all-time rainfall in a 24-hour period and its wettest Valentines Day on record.
San Diego reported record moisture in the atmosphere, according to the National Weather Service, and San Diegos Palomar Observatory was hit with a historic 10 inches of downpour for its rainiest day since it began keeping a record. Road closures were reported throughout the area as the result of fallen trees and debris as well as other issues related to the storm.
Up north, a mudslide in Sausalito resulted in one home sliding down a hill and smashing into another house, the Associated Press reported, and more than four dozen properties needed to be evacuated as a result of the storm.
During the incident, a woman was reportedly buried under mud and debris for two hours while a rescue crew worked to free her. According to the Los Angeles Times, rescuers found her after noticing her hand poking out from under part of the wreckage.
Surprisingly, she was in great condition, Southern Marin Fire District Captain Doug Paterson told the Los Angeles Times. She was talking to us. She was alert. She was able to tell us exactly what had happened.
In neighboring San Francisco, the torrential downpour resulted in the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights. According to the National Weather Service Bay Area, several flood warnings and advisories remained in effect as of early Friday morning.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lokoja, where the Niger and Benue rivers meet Heavy seasonal rains are a regular feature of life in Nigeria and towns close to the country's main rivers are particularly vulnerable. This year floods have killed at least 100 people with many thousands displaced, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). A state of emergency has been declared in four of the worst-hit states: President Muhammadu Buhari has pledged $8.2m (£6.2m) for relief efforts. The NEMA has activated five local operation centres to coordinate emergency responses. Flooding regularly wreaks havoc in Nigeria: In 2017, floods affected 250,000 people in the eastern-central region In 2016, 92,000 were displaced and 38 died In 2015, more than 100,000 were displaced, with 53 deaths In 2012, devastating flooding forced two million Nigerians from their homes and 363 died, according to authorities ""Floods have become a perennial challenge with increasing intensity each year, leaving colossal losses and trauma,"" the Nigerian Meteorological Agency says. So why does Nigeria keep flooding, and is it getting worse? Affected areas Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Flooding near Kaduna River Nigeria hosts two of West Africa's great rivers: the Niger which enters the country from the north-west the Benue, which flows into Nigeria from its eastern neighbour Cameroon These two immense waterways meet in central Nigeria and then flow south as a single river on to the Atlantic Ocean. Much, though by no means all, of Nigeria's flooding occurs along these two rivers as their banks overflow in the rainy season. In 2012, hundreds of thousands of acres of land were flooded in Nigeria when the Benue and Niger over-spilled. That year, the Niger River reached a record-high level of 12.84m (42ft). In 2018, levels reached 11.06m, with fears that the heavy rain, expected to continue through October this year, could lead it to approach similar heights. There has also been extensive damage to farmlands, according ACAPS, a humanitarian data-analysis organisation, which is the mainstay of most livelihoods in the affected regions. Flooding is also caused by: the tidal movements of coastal waters, such as in the Delta region of the south-east saturated drainage systems, such as in the country's largest city, Lagos, in the south-west Are Nigeria's rains causing the floods? Heavy rainfall has certainly increased the likelihood of rivers overflowing and flash floods. And there's evidence to suggest increasing rainfall over time. Data from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency from 1981-2017, analysing 13 affected locations, reveals a rising trend in annual rainfall, which it says is likely to be a significant factor responsible for floods. But it's not just rain falling in Nigeria itself. Heavy precipitation upstream on the Benue and Niger rivers - in Cameroon, Mali and the country of Niger - contributes large volumes of water to Nigeria's river system, according to Zahrah Musa at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. Troublesome dams Another factor in Nigeria's flood problem are dams. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kainji dam Nigeria's three main electricity-generating dams, at Kainji and Jebba on the Niger river and the Shiroro dam on the Kaduna River, ""have become bloated"" by the heavy rains and excess water has had to be released downstream over the past month, says Hussaini Ibrahim, of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA). The uncompleted Zungeru dam, in Niger state, which is part-funded by the Chinese government, is also believed to be affecting areas once free from flooding. On the Benue River, the main concern is the Lagdo Dam, in neighbouring Cameroon, which has previously caused the river to swell by releasing water. In 2012, water flowing in from the Lagdo dam was blamed for 30 deaths in Nigeria. The Cameroonian authorities have yet to allow water to pour out from Lagdo during the current rainy season - but there are concerns in Nigeria that this might happen. Poor town planning Nigeria's population is expanding rapidly, currently estimated at 186 million, and the lack of proper town planning can make flooding worse in urban areas. ""Town planning in Nigeria is very weak,"" says Aliyu Salisu Barau, of Bayero University. ""These areas are affected by a lack of drainage networks."" The city of Lokoja, for example, at the meeting-point of Benue and Niger rivers, is particularly prone to flooding. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man in a town near Lokoja, a heavily flooded area ""If you go to Lokoja, you see massive developments along the Niger River,"" says Mr Barau. These developments are almost always unregulated, with people building on floodplains, reducing the surface areas for water to travel, and without constructing drainage systems. Because of the unregulated nature of town planning, there's also limited information on how much land has been built on and therefore little assessment of the impact. In the city of Makurdi, for example, on the Benue river, Mr Barau says, ""one can see all forms of informal activities"" along the river bank. New land developments along the Niger River has more than doubled in Nassarwa and Kogi States, according to estimates. The dumping of waste in the streets can also prevent the steady flow of water and put pressure on the few urban drainage systems. It's also common, after the floods, for people to come back and start rebuilding in the same vulnerable areas. Hussaini Ibrahim, of the NSEMA, also points the finger at deforestation, which he says is happening across Nigeria. It's a resource that people use for fuel or to sell - but trees play an important role in storing rain-waters. Future floods If the impact of flooding is to be reduced in the future, the consequences of rapid urbanisation and poor urban planning need to be addressed. And greater co-operation with Nigeria's neighbours in the control of river levels will need to be achieved in order to avoid dangerous surges in water levels during the periods of heavy rain. The wider issue of the increasing rainfall levels identified by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency is one that some in Nigeria have attributed to climate change.",An estimated 100 people have died in floods.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"About three-quarters of the land at Dos Rios was owned by a dairy farmer who was tired of dealing with flooding and sold it in 2012 to River Partners, with various state and federal agencies financing the $21.8 million cost. An adjacent farmer then sold his land to the group in 2014 for $9.3 million. The result is 2,100 acres, including three miles of frontage along the Tuolumne River and four and a half along the San Joaquin. River Partners is removing berms along the riverfront that the owners formed from earth and rubble to keep the smallest floods out. A higher, more permanent levee, built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s, protects about 1,000 acres in the core of the project, back from the rivers. Modifications will allow water to enter, so the area will serve as a giant bathtub, holding up to 10,000 acre-feet of floodwater. This will not only reduce river levels, but as the water percolates into the land it should provide another benefit, helping to recharge aquifers that have been depleted statewide because of pumping for agriculture. About 600 acres inside the levee have been converted from farmland to riparian woodlands, and another 700 acres inside and outside the levee are in the process of being restored. The entire project should be finished by the middle of next decade, Mr. Carlon said.

The planting, much of which is done by young workers with the state-run California Conservation Corps, is done with all the precision of modern agriculture.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","California gets most of its rain during the winter, but this wet season has proven especially juicy so far. The moisture parade continued on Wednesday with a major atmospheric river descended on the Golden State, raising concerns of flooding and mudslides as it dumps heavy rain and snow across a wide region through Thursday evening.
Atmospheric rivers are exactly what they sound like: long, narrow, sky-high bands of moisture originating in the tropical Pacific that speed across the ocean toward the U.S. West Coast, unleashing rain at lower elevations and snow at higher elevations. According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, big atmospheric river events can carry roughly the same amount of water as the mouth of the Mississippi.
Just a few of these events can deliver half of the West Coasts annual rainfall, making them an important source of replenishment for ever-precarious water supplies. But when theyre as intense as the moisture plume that began to arrive this morning, they can also cause flooding, which parts of the the Bay Area are already starting to experience. As warm, moist air sweeps over snow-covered mountains further inland, its likely to melt snow thats been building up at mid-elevations, triggering even worse flooding for communities in the foothills.
At the highest elevations in the Sierra Nevada, the remaining moisture will be squeezed out as snow that the National Weather Service says could total up to a whopping seven feet in some places.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLAs Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, said the rain Californias poised to receive could really decimate the middle elevation snowpack thats been building in the inland mountains between about 3,000 and 5,000 feet of elevation. Tonight, the big flood risk looks like itll come in those regions, Swain told Earther.
Further south, Los Angeles is starting to pick up some light rain, with a lot more expected on Thursday. The National Weather Service Los Angeles is calling for 1-2.5 inches of rain along the coastline with 2.5-4 inches of rain and even higher totals locally across the foothills and mountains through Thursday night. That raises the risk of roadway flooding as water hits soils that have already received more than their average dose of wet season rainfall. And floods arent the only worry: as all this water hits barren landscapes recently torched by wildfires, it could destabilize the soil, triggering rock and mudslides similar to those seen near Santa Barbara last year.
You might be wondering if all this wild weather is in any way connected to Seattles recent run of epic snowfall. The short answer is, kind of! Swain explained that the same atmospheric setup thats caused volley after volley of precipitation to fall as snow over the Emerald Citynamely, a parade of storms marching down the West Coast and encountering Arctic air over Western Canada, possibly a remnant of the recent polar vortex disruptionhas also brought a substantial amount of powder further south into California.
Thats part of the reason snowpack levels are high right now and flooding from the incoming tropical moisture could get hairy. Swain also emphasized that the merging of the subtropical jet stream bearing this weeks atmospheric river with the cold air already in place will create a big complex storm system that could be difficult to predict.
As a final note, this weeks rain event will be the first atmospheric river scientists can classify according to a brand-new scale. Developed by researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and detailed last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the scale takes into account the amount of time an atmospheric river lingers over an area and the amount of water vapor contained within it to give the event a 1-5 intensity ranking. In a sense, its not unlike the Saffir-Simpson scale used to rank hurricanes.
Swain reckons this weeks rainfall event is a pretty solid four out of five.
Thats where the impacts are expected to be high enough theres mostly hazardous rather than beneficial, he said.","California gets most of its rain during the winter, but this wet season has proven especially juicy so far.

"MITCH SMITH, JOHN SCHWARTZ and TIM GRUBER","Many of the levees, usually earthen and topped with grass, were built by farmers decades ago and are now managed by a patchwork of local government agencies known as levee districts that often do not coordinate or even follow the same rules. With increased flooding in the past few years, the levees are being tested more frequently than ever before, straining the finances and expertise of some of those districts. The levee situation has become so grave that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the countrys levee system a D grade in 2017, suggesting $80 billion in investment over 10 years.
When the next one comes along bigger, they either fail or are overtopped again, said Nicholas Pinter, an expert on rivers and flooding at the University of California, Davis.
According to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees infrastructure on the Missouri River and some of its tributaries, at least 62 levees had been breached or overtopped in the Midwest in March, and hundreds of miles of levees had sustained damage.
When they run water over the top of them, theres not anything you can do, said Pat Sheldon, the president of a rural levee district in southwest Iowa that was still paying off repairs from the 2011 flood. This time, Mr. Sheldon said, the damage to the levees was much worse, perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Its terrible, said Mr. Sheldon, whose farm was also cut off by the water.
In Missouri, Mr. Bullock pointed out a levee that last week had been split open and consumed by the river. A large log swirled in the water near where the earthen berm should have been. I dont know what were going to do this time, he said.
The Army Corps of Engineers, which helps determine water levels by operating a series of dams on the Missouri River, tries to balance the needs of many who use the rivers it manages, including farmers, barge shippers, endangered animal species and people who use the water for recreation. Those interests are sometimes at odds, and have been the subject of decades of litigation. Corps officials say they are not allowed to change the congressionally authorized purposes of the reservoirs, though they had been most focused on limiting floods for the past year.
The Corpss No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety, said Maj. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, the Corpss deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations, in a statement. Our current focus is to protect life, mitigate risks to flooding events and repair damages due to the recent events in the basin.","Hundreds of miles of levees in the Midwest have been overwhelmed by the floods, leaving “Swiss cheese” infrastructure and reigniting a flood control debate.",2019-03-31T09:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘Breaches Everywhere’: Midwest Levees Burst, and Tough Questions Follow",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/us/midwest-floods-levees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/us/00levees-01/00levees-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,River floods,1

Historic floods have deluged vast swaths of the Midwest even flooding a third of the U.S. Air Force base that houses the nation's critical U.S. Strategic Command. But the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the floods aren't nearly over. The agency's 2019 Spring Outlook found that nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states are at risk for flooding in the coming months. 
""The extensive flooding weve seen in the past two weeks will continue through May and become more dire and may be exacerbated in the coming weeks as the water flows downstream, Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center, said in a statement.

Regions in Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa have already seen historic flooding, with some major rivers particularly the Missouri River absolutely smashing previous flood records by some four feet. What's more, many of the nation's well-engineered levees have failed to contain the record floodwaters. 
The dramatic flooding which is already forecast to cost well over $1 billion in damages is consistent with a big uptick in heavy rains over the last half-century: Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of rain in the heaviest rainfall events in the Midwest shot up by a whopping 37 percent, according to U.S. government scientists. 
SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change
This is in large part due to Earth's changing atmosphere. Specifically, the climate has warmed by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit), and because of simple physics, the warmer air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water. 
After the rapid melting of winter snow and deluges of rain in mid-March, NOAA expects the flood risk to continue as more rain falls and then travels down already overloaded rivers.

""As this excess water flows downstream through the river basins, the flood threat will become worse and geographically more widespread,"" NOAA concluded.
The agency forecasts flood risk by accounting for how much snow is left to melt, areas experiencing drought, how saturated soils are with moisture, the depth of frozen soil, the height of rivers, and expected precipitation. As the floodmap shows, regions near the Mississipi river and vast swaths of land in the Great Plains and Midwest are at risk for major and moderate flooding.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.

After two record-setting floods in a single decade, Ms. Crain said, Im living it and everybody else here is living it.
The flood spoiled a time of cautious optimism in Hamburg, which like many rural Midwestern towns now has about half the population it once did. Next week, Dr. Wells, the school superintendent, was scheduled to ask state officials for permission to reopen the towns high school, a move seen as crucial to keeping young families in town.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions. The multibillion disaster centered in Nebraska will spread this spring, with above average rainfall expected to cause floods to impact some 200 million Americans living near rivers. And it wont necessarily end once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
This springs floods will shape this summers dead zone. The area of low oxygen is an annual occurrence driven in large part by nutrient-laden runoff that washes down the Mississippi River and its many tributaries, fueling algae blooms when it reaches the Gulf. The dead zone in 2017 was the largest thats ever been recorded at nearly 9,000 square miles, and while its much too early to say exactly how big this summers dead zone will be, the flooding weve seen so far doesnt bode well. Another enormous dead zone would put pressure on Gulf marine life and fisheries
The flooding we see this month, in March, may ultimately determine the size of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone in August, Kimberly Van Meter, a researcher who studies water and ecosystems at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Earther.
And this years floods are already shaping up to record setting. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the upper Mississippi and Red River of the North basins have doubled their normal spring rainfall totals. That includes areas that were smacked by a rare bomb cyclone earlier this month that dumped rain on snow and set the flooding overtaking the region in motion. NOAA forecasts indicate areas all along the Mississippi River basin could face major flooding through Mayas snow continues to melt amid a forecast for heavier than normal rainfall over the next few months.
As the floodwater wash over farmers fields, theyll do more than strip soil. They can also scoop up fertilizer and other organic matter and transport it downriver. The nutrient-rich water will reach the Gulf of Mexico sometime in June, which will kickstart the dead zone.
In the simplest terms, the more nitrate that is transported downstream to the Gulf, the larger the size of the dead zone, Van Meter said. Nitrate is food for algae, and spring floods essentially deliver a large, delicious meal to the Gulf just as temperatures start to rise and the algae start to grow. Decades of fertilizer application and intensive livestock production across the Mississippi River Basin have created large stores of nitrate in the landscape, just waiting for the next flood to carry them to the Gulf.
As that algae bloom grows, it hoovers up all the oxygen that marine life needs to survive. The process is known as hypoxia, and chokes marine life to death. But they also take a toll on humans as well. Separate algae blooms in Lake Erie have befouled drinking water. Those along Floridas coasts have harmed the tourism industry. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone creates its own hardships.
Weve got data that its essentially a doughnut hole that forms with brown shrimp where they are avoiding areas that are low oxygen and theyre congregating on the edge, David Kidwell, a researcher at NOAAs National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, told Earther.
Recent NOAA-funded research has shown that the dead zone can cause small and large shrimp prices to fluctuate, with fishermen catching fewer high-value large shrimp when a dead zone is present. Climate change is liable to make blooms worse by intensifying the hydrological cycle and warming waters. Whether the historic flooding that just hit the Midwest leads to a historic dead zone is not set in stone, though. 
Kidwell said that the annual dead zone forecast NOAA and the U.S. Geological Service puts out in early summer is based in large part on discharge of the Mississippi River as well as the pure nutrient levels in the river at that time, but other factors could dull their impact. A hurricanewhich would offer its own set of problemscould churn up the Gulf and staunch the algae bloom.
Regardless of what happens this season, its clear that something has to change in how we manage land and floodwaters. Nancy Rabalais, a marine ecologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, told Earther that it does not make sense is to rebuild in floodplains if the end goal is to limit the Gulf dead zone (to say nothing of exposing communities upstream to floodwaters). Reducing the amount of farmland in the floodplain so would ultimately cut down on fertilizer and animal waste being swept into streams and eventually the Gulf. Rabalais said, though, that she knew what this means economically to the agriculture community if floodplains were put off limits.
That neatly illustrates the tradeoffs and hard discussions society will be forced to havefarmers or fishermen? Midwest or Gulf Coast?the longer we put off addressing climate change, which is set to make heavy downpours and flooding even worse. Starting those conversations now makes a lot more sense than, say, holding sham votes.","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions.

Extremely heavy rain began on March 19, in total affecting about 1,900 cities, towns and villages. Many thousands of roads, bridges and buildings have been destroyed. 
So far, 86,000 people are living in emergency shelters, of which about 1,000 were airlifted to safety. 
Aid agencies are struggling to cope with the demands and Iran's state budget is under pressure due to US sanctions on energy and banking. 
Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has accused US sanctions - reimposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year - of impeding aid efforts to affected areas, saying that it has caused a shortage of rescue helicopters.
""This isn't just economic warfare; it's economic terrorism,"" Mr Zarif tweeted on April 1.

JACK HEALY,"As far as what condition those levees are in, and how vulnerable they are to flooding, it is almost impossible to know. According to the National Committee on Levee Safety, there are no national policies or standards on levee safety, and there is no full assessment of their condition and performance. Only 10 states keep a list of their levees, and fewer than half have a state agency responsible for levee safety.
Weve adopted this piecemeal approach, said Nicholas Pinter, a geology professor at the University of California, Davis. We built these walls up to give the illusion of protection.
From above, the lines of earthen levees that line the Missouri River in Mills County, Iowa, look like they have been decimated by a marauding army. Frigid, murky floodwater pours through huge, ragged gaps and spreads out for miles.
The countys levees held during 2011 floods that inundated towns across the Midwest, but this is different, said Mr. Hurst, the countys emergency management director.
Heavy rains from what meteorologists called a bomb cyclone storm that ripped across the plains fell onto frozen ground, and instead of soaking in, the rains and snowmelt poured into tiny creeks, tributaries and into the Missouri River.
Mr. Hurst said he watched the flow rate at one marker along the Missouri River soar from 16,000 cubic feet per second to 90,000.

DAMON WINTER and MICHAEL COOPER,"Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times When it comes to blood, Quentin Tarantino has nothing on the Metropolitan Opera. Stabbings, shootings, torture and beheadings are routine at the Met. But the bloodiest show of them all may be François Girard’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal,” which returns on Feb. 5 and floods the theater’s vast stage with some 1,250 gallons of the stuff. The stage blood — made from a recipe that includes tap water, glycerin, and red and blue dye, mixed to taste — is created in Brooklyn by a company called J&amp;M Special Effects, which heats and trucks it to the Met in 250-gallon rectangular tanks before each performance. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Since opera singers do not care for frozen feet, the blood is kept warm in the tanks, which are swaddled in industrial-grade heating blankets until the last possible moment. At eight minutes before the curtain went up at a recent rehearsal, Terry Ganley, a stage manager, gave the cue. “Fill ’er up,” she told a team of stagehands, many of whom wore rubber boots. The blood flowed. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The Met isn’t trying to create a slasher opera. “Parsifal” is Wagner’s metaphysical meditation on the knights of the Holy Grail, the goblet supposedly used at the Last Supper and which later caught Jesus’s blood on the cross. Their leader, Amfortas, suffers from a mysterious wound that will not heal. In Mr. Girard’s poetic 2013 production, blood is a central visual element. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times “The overall staging didn’t glue until we started playing with blood, because that is ultimately the voltage of the piece,” said Mr. Girard, who has included a river of blood; a bleeding bed; and, here, in Act II, a shallow pool of blood that covers the stage. “There was a lot of resistance: You can imagine the nightmare. But they’ve mastered it now.” Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The Met tries to keep the blood warm for the singers and dancers who must stand in it — for a typically Wagnerian hourlong act — by placing heating pads under the red vinyl that lines the pool onstage. But the blood begins cooling as soon as it pours out. Philip J. Volpe, the Met’s master electrician, monitors its temperature with an infrared thermometer. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times Keeping things neat and safe with over 1,000 gallons of fake blood sloshing around is not easy. An overflow trough sits behind the pool. Rows of chairs with towels and sandals are placed for the performers coming off the bloody stage, and absorbent mats and brown paper are taped along the path to their dressing rooms. Members of the stage crew are posted beneath the stage to make sure no blood seeps into the Met’s underground storage areas, where sets for operas like “L’Elisir d’Amore” and “Pagliacci” are currently stored. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times A unique kind of stage-prop dialysis is used to keep the blood hygienic. Following each performance, the tanks of blood are trucked back to J&amp;M, which filters out any newly added particles of foam and dust. The blood is then purified with ultraviolet light to kill bacteria. “We can’t use chlorine or anything like that because it would turn the water pink,” said David Feheley, the Met’s technical director. “Which is, you know, less dramatic.” Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The blood creates striking tableaus — drenching the dress Evelyn Herlitzius wears as she sings the role of Kundry, a wild woman in the thrall of an evil sorcerer; and helping the audience visualize the spiritual quest taken by Parsifal (the tenor Klaus Florian Vogt). And it fits squarely into Mr. Girard’s conception of the opera. “We’re talking about life, Christ, Amfortas’s wound, sexuality, all of those things,” he said. “Blood became the connector.” Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times When the rehearsal ended, stagehands used brooms to push the blood into a small well at the back of the pool, where sump pumps sent it coursing back into the tanks. “Where is the AB negative?” joked Stephen A. Diaz, the master carpenter. The dancers and choristers filed offstage dripping, their feet stained slightly red. The remedy for the stains, it turns out, is much simpler than the one for Amfortas’s wound, which requires the touch of a holy spear. Many of the performers have found that the red can be wiped away with Barbasol shaving cream.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities. The latest areas under scrutiny are Superfund sites, whose toxic pollutants can be spread far and wide by floodwaters.
 Currently on the radar for federal and state officials are seven Superfund sites and a landfill across Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri, states that are still experiencing some minor to major flooding as of Thursday. These are some of the most contaminated sites in the U.S., and when floodwaters hit them, they can become major threats to human and environmental health if their pollutants travel off site, as was seen in Houston after Hurricane Harvey.
Superfund sites contain some of the most dangerous chemicals known to humankind, Jacob Carter, a research scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists Center for Science and Democracy, told Earther.
Thats why the Environmental Protection Agency is nowmonitoring a bunch of Superfund sites closely, although so far, it seems to think all of them are doing okay.
The EPA has taken action on two Superfunds in particular, it announced Tuesday: Nebraska Ordnance Plant, a former munitions production plant in Mead, Nebraska, and Conservation Chemical Corporation in Kansas City, Missouri, which used to store chemicals. The agency hasnt spotted any contaminant releases at either, but floodwaters did hit them hard.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
The EPA told Earther italso flagged another two sites in Iowa with water on the property that didnt require actionthe Railroad Avenue Groundwater Contamination Site in West Des Moines and the Mid-America Tanning Company Site near Sergeant Bluff. The Lawrence Todtz Farm Site in Iowawasnt flooded, but its been made inaccessible due to the flooding, so the EPA is also monitoring it. And the EPA, in coordination with state environmental agencies, is keeping tabs on another two Superfund sites in Nebraskawhere the flooding has paused clean up activities, as well as a landfill in the City of St. Joseph in Missouri that isnt a Superfund. 
The Nebraska Ordnance Plant, which sits in the states still slightly-flooded southeast corner, has its soil and groundwater contaminated with potentially carcinogenic substances like trichloroethene (or TCE), as well as explosives. The facility saw its groundwater treatment plant and extraction wells, which help remove the TCE, temporarily shut down because authorities couldnt access them and to avoid any treated water from mixing with the floodwaters. They are all back up and running now.
This is only one of the facilities the state of Nebraska is monitoring. Others will still require close attention as the floodwaters recedeespecially if anything strange turns up in the states drinking water.
Right now, a combination of flood waters and damaged roads are keeping responders from a few of Nebraska Superfund Sites for inspection. Those sites have not been fully evaluated yet, Amanda Woita, a public information officer with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), told Earther in an email. DEQs primary responsibility is protecting public health. That includes testing drinking water and assessing other important infrastructure, such as community drinking water wells and sewage treatment plants. The department is in that phase right now. 
Back in Missouri, the Conservation Chemical Corporations soil and groundwater are also contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals like benzene and TCE. The site experienced flooding, but the EPA reports that it didnt stop its clean-up operations in response. Instead, more groundwater was extracted to help keep pace with the floodwaters. 
Half of Missouris St. Joseph City Landfill has become flooded, according to Brian Quinn, the information officer for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. He told Earther in an email that the non-hazardous landfill was last inspected in January 2018, and the department will conduct another investigation once the waters recede to make sure the asphalt and soil cap covering the garbage is still in place.
All in all, the EPA hasnt issued any public health alerts or advisories in wake of these floods, the agency told Earther. But there could still be trouble as the floodwaters migrate farther down the Mississippi River in Missouri. John Hickey, the executive director of the states Sierra Club chapter, is worried that the many coal ash disposal sites in the eastern portion of the state along the Mississippi could pose a threat if floodwaters breach them. Coal ash landfills and ponds often contain heavy metals like lead and mercury, which are hazardous to human health. Similar flooding concerns were raised in North Carolina in wake of Hurricane Florence last year. 
 But the Superfund sites that have already experienced flooding worry Hickey, too.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river, Hickey told Earther. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
Americans experienced that reality firsthand in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey damaged 13 Superfund sites in Texas, leading to mass contamination from one site alone. It took the EPA eight months to begin cleaning up that site, the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, and cleanup is slated to go on another year or more. Then, there was Hurricane Maria, which flooded a lead-contaminated Superfund in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, leaving residents worried about contamination long after the natural disaster.

As Carter noted, low-income communities and people of color tend to be closest to these facilities, so theyre the most at risk. 
These are some of the most disenfranchised communities in the United States, he told Earther. [They] dont have a ton of power in the United States, and they will be the ones impacted by this flooding at Superfund sites.
The EPA is well aware of the threat that floodingwhich is set to intensify in the Midwest in a warmer worldposes to these sites. Its Climate Adaptation Plan published in 2014 makes this clear: Inundation and flooding may lead to transport of contaminants through surface soils, ground water, surface waters, and/or coastal waters. 
Former President Barack Obama issued an executive order that wouldve required all federal departments, including those that manage Superfunds, prepare for future flood risks. President Donald Trump, predictably, rescinded it. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations spring flood outlook, heavier than usual rainfall is set to bring historic, widespread flooding to the Midwest through May.
Whether or not the latest bout of floods caused any Superfund sites to spread their contaminants, it seems clear these sites will only become more vulnerable. We better ready up.
Correction: An earlier version of this post indicated that eight Superfund sites have dealt with floodwaters. One of those sites, a landfill, is not actually a Superfund. The text and headline have been updated accordingly. We have also updated to clarify that the Nebraska Ordnance Plant was shut down to avoid treated water from mixing with floodwaters in addition to access issues.","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island Rescuers are searching for victims of a tropical storm in the southern Philippines, where nearly 200 people have died in mudslides and flash floods. Rescue teams have yet to reach some of the affected areas on Mindanao island. Many people are missing after Storm Tembin, with winds up to 80km/h (50mph), swept through the area. The towns of Tubod and Piagapo were badly hit, while the remote Dalama village was wiped out by flash floods. The storm is now moving west. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was saddened by the loss of life, adding that the UN was ready to help. There are fears the death toll will rise further. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. A number of homes in the two towns were buried by boulders. Speaking about Dalama, he said ""the river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there"". Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The loss of communications is hampering rescue efforts The official added that volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in Bukidnon, Iligan and Misamis Occidental. Power cuts and the loss of communications have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks of disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. Meanwhile, Richard Gordon, of the Philippines Red Cross, told the BBC: ""We have already provided water and hot food. ""And we're going to be distributing non-food items - certainly blankets, mosquito nets and certainly hygiene kits for those who are in evacuation centres so that we can alleviate the suffering of many of the folks there."" Storm Tembin made a second landfall on Balabac island in the Palawan archipelago and is forecast to travel west, south of the Spratly Islands, reaching southern Vietnam in about three days. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and DAVID ZUCCHINO","Around lunchtime, Steven Swank, 23, was packing a few cases of water into a little sedan. In 1999, the Grid was inundated by river flooding after Hurricane Floyd, and Mr. Swank wanted none of it. He and his girlfriend were going to his sister’s house for a while. “She lives over behind the Cracker Barrel, not near any water,” he said. “We don’t want to be stuck here.” Worries were running equally high in inland South Carolina. Fifteen miles northwest of the gaudy spectacle of Myrtle Beach sits the quiet county seat of Conway, a nearly 290-year-old town shaded by live oaks and straddling the Waccamaw River. Time and again — in Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew, to name just two occasions — Myrtle Beach has been spared the worst damage, while Conway has taken a heavy hit: flash floods with the storm itself, then river floods in the days that followed. “The water collects really quickly, and people think that’s the flooding, but it’s flash flooding,” said Le Hendricks, the Conway fire chief. “That goes down pretty quick, and then they think they’re free. B ut then what happens is, the Waccamaw River gets backed up.” Chief Hendricks described a kind of hydrological traffic jam: Water trying to leave the Waccamaw meets flooded waterways and a surging ocean at capacity. The river has nowhere to go but over its banks, onto highways and roads and into people’s homes. This kind of flooding might not happen at its worst until two days after the hurricane hits, but when it does, the water can sit for weeks. Meanwhile, places on the coast might have already begun rebuilding from any damage wrought by the winds and the initial surge. “Myrtle Beach, they did fairly will during Matthew,” Chief Hendricks said. “They had damage but were back up and running within a couple of days.” Conway, at first, thought it had dodged a bullet, as well, he said. “But it was the flooding. And it took about 18 days for us to get back out of that.”","The storm surge in the Carolinas could be deadly.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Rains that melted a historic snowpack swamped U.S. Central Plains states with record floods on Sunday, breeching river levees and causing two deaths. 
With water levels expected to rise through the week, evacuations were underway in communities along portions of the Missouri River on the Nebraska and Iowa border, as well as in Nebraska, on the Elkhorn River and Platte River. 
“The big ones are at record stages right now,” said meteorologist Marc Chenard with the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center. “There have been some levy breaks so there are towns that are flooded.” 
The deadly flooding was the aftermath of a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm that drenched the nation’s midsection and kicked into high gear snowmelt after unprecedented winter snowfall. 
The weather was blamed for two deaths, including one person who died at home after failing to evacuate, and another swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
“That system brought 1 to 3 inches of rainfall but, on top of that, there was already a deep snowpack over much of the area. So a combination of the rain and snow melt had a large volume of water going pretty quickly into the rivers,” Chenard said. 
Despite relatively dry weather ahead, flooding was expected to persist through the week in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois. 
“We’re looking at widespread flooding that continues until at least early next week in the Plains and Midwest region,” Chenard said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","This has been a winter of weird wonders. First it was snow in the Sahara. Then came ice balls on Lake Michigan. Now we’ve got to deal with ice jams. Sub-zero temperatures last week didn’t just instantaneously turn boiling water to snow. They also quickly froze rivers, ponds and lakes across the Northeast and Midwest. That’s been followed by what Capital Weather Gang aptly describes as a “brief and mildly disgusting warm-up” that’s softened all that ice with temperatures 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and rain. It’s also melted snow, which has run off into rivers and cracked up ice further. And that, my friends, is a recipe for ice jams. Wild roaming hordes of ice chunks from the size of baseballs to an average New York studio apartment have surged down waterways across the region. When these frozen flash floods meet with a bend in the river, a narrow strait, or a bridge, they can back up and overtop riverbanks with sometimes destructive results. Just how fast can ice pile up? The National Weather Service’s Burlington office shared what happened on the East Branch Ausable River in upstate New York over the course of three hours on Friday afternoon. Total jam sesh. This is what the the river gage looked like: Ice jams are no joke, ya heard? From New York to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Ontario (international ice!), fast-flowing ice jams have knocked trailers off their foundations, surrounded houses, and flooded basements.

JOSEPH HANANIA,"In a separate interview, the Parks Department commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, said that unlike passive parks that double as floodplains, like those by Jamaica Bay, East River Park has structures, lights and synthetic turf, which does not do well in floods. And with the river projected to rise two and a half feet in 30 years, raising the park is the only way to save it.
By bringing in landfill and soil by barge, the new plan allows for daytime construction away from the highway, minimizing traffic disruptions. After its scheduled March 2020 launch, the new plan can thus be completed in three years rather than five, with flood protection in place by 2022.
Still, the parks closing under either plan has left people like Joan Reinmuth, a retired nurse and 30-year East Village resident, doubtful. This park is more than a recreation facility, she said. These kids in NYCHA houses dont take vacation cruises. They dont shop at Zabars for fish; they fish to eat. Early mornings, men are shaving in the fountains.
At last weeks meeting, Susan Stetzer, district manager for Community Board 3, got a commitment that after initially shutting the park down, the city will look to reopen it in sections. Thats huge, she said.","A plan to protect the Lower East Side from flooding was just rejected by the city, replaced with a drastic revision that costs twice as much but does not disrupt traffic.",2019-01-20T01:26:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","To Save East River Park, the City Intends to Bury It",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/nyregion/to-save-east-river-park-the-city-intends-to-bury-it.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/nyregion/20PARK1/20PARK1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,River floods,1

It was very chaotic. No-one knew whether to run for the hills or along the road, whether to grab the children or grab the elderly. Everyone was going crazy,"" says Teresa Jaramillo recalling the moment on 12 May when flash flooding hit her small riverside community. Puerto Valdivia is just one of the communities affected by a series of emergencies which have hit Colombia's largest hydroelectric dam project, Hidroituango. Tens of thousands of people living downstream from the dam have been evacuated and the emergencies just keep coming. Rising water The Hidroituango dam over the river Cauca, about 175km (110 miles) north of the city of Medellín, was just months from completion when on 28 April a landslide near the site blocked a tunnel built to divert the river's flow while construction was going on. As the project was almost finished, two other tunnels built for the same purpose had already been sealed by the company building the dam, Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM). This meant that the tunnel blocked by the landslide was the only remaining outlet. Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption The project was due to be finished by the end of the year Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption Supporters of the dam say it will eventually account for 17% of Colombia's power capacity Further landslides followed and with water levels rising and all outlets now blocked, EPM decided to flood the dam's turbine rooms on 10 May to release the river's increasing pressure on the structure. While the move caused irreparable damage to transformers and other systems which had already been installed in the turbine room, it did reduce water levels. But only two days later, one of the sealed tunnels naturally unblocked, causing water to gush through it and creating flash floods further downstream. Cut off Puerto Valdivia lay in the path of the flash foods. Fifty-nine homes, a school and a health centre were destroyed and more than 600 people were displaced.

The peace of mind I had there, I won't ever be able to regain it, not living there or anywhere else."" And Hidroituango's troubles seem far from over. Experts have warned that there is a renewed risk of landslides from nearby mountainsides which could block the water-intake tunnels for the turbine room, as well as the spillway, potentially compromising the integrity of the entire hydroelectric project.

Another 380 people living upstream have been displaced by the premature filling of the dam's reservoir. And the residents of Ituango, the town nearest the dam, have been left cut off after the only bridge connecting it to the rest of the country was submerged by the rising waters on 4 May.

Even the areas not directly at risk of landslides or flooding have begun to feel the effects of the mass evacuation of the riverside communities and the lack of trade. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption With many communities cut off,,locals are worried about a lack of supplies ""We only produce plantain and yucca. Everything else is beginning to run out, all other goods,"" rural leaders say. Many have so far ignored calls for them to evacuate their land but they say the lack of food is becoming an issue. ""If we have to go to the camps, well, we will have to, but Valdivia is also collapsing with so many people,"" one man said. Continuing risk At a recent news conference, EPM's CEO Jorge Londoño said that communities near the dam would continue to be at risk until the company had figured out a permanent solution. He suggested that in order to fix the problem, EPM would have to construct a new tunnel to reduce the levels of the flooded river in a controlled fashion, a process likely to take several months. Environmental activists, who have long opposed the hydroelectric project because of what they say are the inherent dangers in damming Colombia's second-largest river, complain about a lack of oversight. ""How can it be that the same company that is causing so much damage is the one pretending to provide the solutions?"" asks Isabel Zuleta, leader of local environmental organisation Ríos Vivos. ""What does that tell us? That in Colombia there is no one that controls the big corporations,"" she says. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Isabel Zuleta has long been opposed to the hydroelectric power project Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption She says residents no longer trust EPM to fix the problems With the entire workforce evacuated from the site again on Tuesday because of new warnings of landslides, many people living both up- and downstream from the megaproject are in a state of fear. Ms Zuleta says trust has been eroded. ""They said there was no problem, that there was no danger, that everything was under control.""

But with the project far advanced - it was due to be completed by the end of the year - and its backers maintaining that it will account for about 17% of Colombia's power capacity, that is unlikely to happen.

Associated Press,"CINCINNATI (AP) -- The National Weather Service says heavy rains overnight have sent the swollen Ohio River at Cincinnati to its highest point in 20 years. Meteorologist Kristen Cassady says the river reached 60 feet (18.3 meters) Sunday morning, 8 feet (2.4 meters) above flood stage. It's the highest recording since 1997, when the river reached 64.7 feet (19.7 meters). Cassady says rain totals varied between 1.5 and 2.5 inches overnight. She says while no rain is forecast until mid-week, tributaries feeding the Ohio will likely keep the river above flood stage throughout the week. Flooding of smaller rivers and streams has caused road closings throughout central and southern Ohio. Gov.

Jessica Boddy,"Rivers and streams cover much more of the planet than geologists previously estimated, according to a new study published in Science. In total, this new estimate shows that, excluding land with glaciers, Earth is covered by just under 300,000 square miles (773,000 square kilometers) of rivers and streams. That’s more square footage than the state of Texas, and it’s as much as 44 percent higher than previous counts. The finding has implications for the study of climate change, because rivers exchange greenhouse gasses with the atmosphere, especially when humans pollute their waters. “It was assumed until about 2006 that rivers and lakes were just a pipe transporting carbon to the ocean,” John Downing, a limnologist and biogeochemist at the University of Minnesota Duluth, told Gizmodo. “But the rivers are leaking gasses into the atmosphere.” As pollutants like fertilizers and sewage seep into water supplies, gasses including methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide bubble out and drift up into the atmosphere. More river coverage could mean we’re sending even more of those greenhouse gasses into the air than current calculations account for. “Here’s another reason not to spoil water,” said Downing, who was not involved in the new study. “If you pollute it, you spoil fishing and swimming, but you also spoil the atmosphere.” To map out the planet’s rivers and streams, University of North Carolina hydrologists George Allen and Tamlin Pavelsky analyzed thousands of images from a NASA Landsat satellite. Using software developed by Pavelsky, the duo ended up with 58 million river measurements they then used to calculate the total coverage of rivers and streams on Earth. And they didn’t just blindly trust their software. To make sure the program was reliable, the researchers employed what Allen called “a small army of undergraduates” to vigilantly monitor whether the program was measuring rivers, not roads, and if it was avoiding other mistakes along the way. “They were so enthusiastic,” Pavelsky said. “They did such a great job.” Aside from their Texas-sized estimate, the researchers also found that rivers were both narrower and more sparse in human-developed areas, which surprised them. This could be because people are siphoning water for agriculture, draining swamps, and leveeing rivers, but more research will have to be done to say for sure. Other scientists have made estimates of Earth’s river and stream coverage in the past. Downing, for instance, used the distinct way rivers branch and how much water they move to estimate their global coverage. Others have used elevation and water runoff data to do it. But none have shown river morphology—a river’s shape and direction—like this satellite estimate does, the researchers said. “If you look around the world, rivers look different from place to place,” Allen, who recently began a professorship at Texas A&amp;M University, told Gizmodo. “They might be braided, or sinuous, or meandering. And for the most part, current technology doesn’t take into consideration the actual morphology of rivers. This data set is the first of its kind to do this at a global scale on high resolution.” Downing was impressed by the number of data points Allen and Pavelsky considered, and found their results exciting—especially because the duo’s estimate was within 15 percent of his own. “I think it’s absolutely terrific,” Downing said. “They put in a massive amount of effort and confirmed the numbers we already had that were created from basic physical principles.” Having a map of Earth’s river morphology may prove extremely useful when predicting floods, Downing added, or for studying the way rivers behave in the future as the Earth warms. Plus, now that this fine-tuned, river-measuring technique has some reliable results, he said it could be useful to see how river flow rates change from season to season—another good data set to have when working to keep communities safe from floods. “Rivers are so wonderful, but they can also be dangerous,” Downing said. “Water goes where it wants to go—so it’s good to know where it goes and how much area it’s covering.” [ Science ]","Rivers and streams cover much more of the planet than geologists previously estimated, according to a new study published in Science.

Mark Kaufman,"In 1948, Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington stationed the United States' long-range nuclear bombers at Offutt Air Force Base in eastern Nebraska, a location safe in the middle of the nation and well-insulated from the coast.
But 70 years later, the base now home to the U.S. Strategic Command which deters ""catastrophic actions from adversaries and poses an immediate threat to any actor who questions U.S. resolve by demonstrating our capabilities"" isn't safe from historic and record-setting floods. 
Intense rains on top of the rapid melting of ample snow has inundated large swathes of Nebraska and a full one-third of the Offutt Air Force Base, including the headquarters building.
NASA's Landsat 8 satellite captured before and after images of the flooding which the European Union Earth Observation Programme called ""biblical."" The overloaded river burgeoned in size, creeping into Offutt, neighborhoods, and farmlands.

A number of potent factors mixed to create what Offutt Air Force Base Commander Mike Manion has labeled a ""1,000 year flood"" meaning there's only a one in 1,000 chance of such an extreme event happening in any given year. 
NASA noted that exceptionally cold Arctic blasts (from a wobbly polar vortex) preserved bounties of snow that soon rapidly melted when ""unusually warm"" March air produced massive amounts of runoff. Exacerbating matters, the winter's freeze made the ground less absorbent when extreme downpours then slammed the region.

If that wasn't enough, big rains in 2018 had already ""loaded the dice even more,"" meteorologist Bryce Anderson noted on Twitter: A thawed ground, already saturated with water, wouldn't have been able to soak up much water anyway, he said
On top of this confluence of extreme weather events, Earth's atmosphere is considerably different than it was a century ago. Specifically, the climate has warmed by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit), and due to simple physics, the warmer air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water.
That means more intense downpours. Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of rain in the heaviest rainfall events in the midwest shot up by 37 percent, according to U.S. government scientists.
Forthcoming research will reveal the role climate change played during these floods, though atmospheric scientists expect this same climate lever to bring more intense precipitation blasts to other parts of the nation in the near future, notably California.

Karen Dillon,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Frigid floodwaters pushing down the Missouri River left ruins, death and drowned livestock in their wake across the U.S. Midwest’s farmland, and were expected to crest in northwest Missouri early Friday, with more cities and towns under threat. 
Voluntary evacuations were advised in the small riverfront city of St. Joseph, Mo., where the nation’s longest river is expected to crest about 6 a.m. local time. 
Debris-laden river water is expected to rise by between 29 and 31 feet (8.8 and 9.4 meters), just two feet below the height of protective levees, officials said, as the waters then head toward Kansas City about 55 miles (88 km) south and more population centers in Kansas and Missouri downstream. 
“This is serious, water could easily breach those levees,” David Roth of the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. 
The estimated crest height could quickly change just from a few degree differences in snow melt up stream, he said. The river could top levees or breach weak spots, he said. 
“Just an unexpected precipitation could fall upstream or temperatures spike up,” he said. 
Midwest daytime temperatures are already about 10-degrees Fahrenheit above normal, he said and will hit as high as 60 in parts of the Midwest Friday, including St. Joseph and Kansas City. 
Flooding of the Missouri River was triggered by last week’s so-called “bomb cyclone” storm that has already inflicted damage estimated at nearly $1.5 billion in Nebraska, killed at least four people in Nebraska and Iowa and left a man missing below Nebraska’s collapsed Spencer Dam.[L1N21809A] 
“This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk,” said Ed Clark, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in the agency’s spring outlook. 
Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency for his state Wednesday as high water forced evacuations of several small farm communities. 
The declaration allows state resources and assistance to be provided directly to counties and municipalities in need. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska, making federal funding available in nine counties there that bore the brunt of last week’s floods. 
The threat of extensive flooding lingers over the wider region and could grow dire in coming weeks with additional rainfall and melting snow runoff, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials said on Thursday.

Mark Kaufman,"On Wednesday, San Jose Mercury News photojournalist Karl Mondon spotted a man in flooded Guerneville, California rowing through town in a blue dumpster.
A potent atmospheric river a long band of water vapor that often transports ample amounts of moisture to the western U.S. like ""rivers in the sky"" deluged portions of Northern California this week. The Russian River, which winds through the Sonoma County town of Guerneville, reached over 45-feet high and swamped the area, prompting the Sheriff to announce on Twitter that the town had been surrounded by water with no way in or out.  
While California relies heavily on these wintertime atmospheric rivers for its water, scientists expect these storms to grow wetter as Earth's climate heats up. 
""We're likely to see rain in increasingly intense bursts,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview.
""This really was a firehose aimed at Sonoma County,"" Swain added.

Though it can be challenging to attribute any particular blast of rain to extreme weather stoked by climate change, this destructive event does have a telltale climate fingerprint. 
""It does seem to be another data point suggesting individual atmospheric rivers are becoming wetter,"" said Paul Ullrich, a climate scientist at the University of California at Davis.

Generally, scientists expect California's rainy season to become shorter and more contracted but still have about the same amount of rainfall as in the past. That means more extreme deluges. 
Once heavy rains repeatedly hit California, they set the stage for floods. The ground becomes oversaturated with water. 
""That sets up the whole system to overflow,"" said Ullrich.

Future atmospheric rivers are expected to bring loads of water from both the tropics and drier areas over the ocean, said Swain. Due to simple physics, as the atmosphere warms, the air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Large parts of Nebraska and the U.S. Central Plains were underwater on Saturday after a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm triggered historic flooding along the Missouri and Platte rivers, causing two deaths, tearing apart homes and swallowing roadways. 
The National Weather Service predicted dangerous flooding would continue through the weekend in Nebraska and in south and west central Iowa, particularly along the Missouri River. 
“We’re still in a very widely dispersed and intense flooding situation in the eastern third of Nebraska,” said Mike Wight, a spokesman for the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a phone interview. 
Nebraska has had two flood-related fatalities this week, Wight said. One person died at home after failing to evacuate, although the exact cause of death was unclear, authorities said, and the other was swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
The Missouri River was still rising on Saturday evening, local TV station KMTV reported, with a record crest of more than 47 feet expected early on Tuesday in Brownville, Nebraska, about 70 miles south of Omaha in the eastern corner of the state. 
“We’re looking at 4, 5, 6, 7 feet above the highest it’s ever been,” Wight said. 
The flooding came in the wake of what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm blew from the western Rockies to the Central Plains last week. 
The rising water has reduced stores and homes to rubble and ripped off a long chunk of a highway bridge, according to photos posted on Twitter by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Ranchers posted images on social media of their cattle being dug out of snowdrifts or stranded in fields. 
The flooding has all but blocked access to some small communities along the river, where potable drinking water has become scarce as the flood has contaminated wells, Wight said. 
Ricketts visited several flooded communities on Saturday and wrote on Twitter that he witnessed “unbelievable devastation.” 
“The whole state is pulling together as we respond to and recover from the ongoing #NebraskaFlood! #NebraskaStrong,” the governor tweeted.

SEE ALSO: The Doomsday Clock is a gimmick, but why it just moved closer to midnight is deadly serious By Wednesday, the water level had hit 16 feet, more than double the Seine's average 6.5-foot depth. While French meteorological service Meteo France no longer expects floodwaters to cross the 20-foot mark at their deepest, as previously predicted, it'll be close. Paris police told CNN that water in parts of the Seine will reach 5.95 meters, or just shy of 20 feet, during the evening hours of Sunday night into Monday morning. It's not quite at the level of a 1910 flood that saw the Seine's deepest point rise to almost 28 feet. It's also short of a June 2016 flood, which saw the Seine's water level hit 21 feet. The second incident is obviously more alarming, since this latest flood is the second such incident in a two-year period.

PENN BULLOCK,"On a typical summer day, high above the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan, rivulets of melted ice stream down the edge of the Tuyuksu glacier.
Melting is a normal process in the constant evolution of glaciers. But in a warming climate, snow in winter cant make up the difference, resulting in a net loss of ice.
Last year, scientists found that the Tuyuksu glacier was melting at a mad pace parts of it were three feet thinner than they were the year before. The glacier is getting shorter, too: In six decades, it has retreated more than half a mile.
Why it matters: Melting glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, can lead to disastrous floods and alter river ecosystems. Glaciers also feed rivers, which in turn provide water for cities and farmers. Flows will eventually decline, affecting hundreds of millions of people in countries like India, Pakistan and China.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Rescue teams were trying to reach hundreds of people on Monday and racing against rising rivers and floods that could last for days after Florence dumped record rain on the Carolinas and killed at least 31 people. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the two states and over 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The city, which took a direct hit when Florence plowed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. As the remnants of Florence moved into the U.S. Northeast, and the sun appeared in some areas for the first time in days, residents of the Carolinas confronted its after-effects, including power outages, impassable roads, and sewage spilling into flooded areas. Rex Gehring, 62, was unsure what he would do with the house he bought outside Fayetteville, another town on the Cape Fear River, after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 forced its previous owner into foreclosure. “We’re in a floodplain but a hundred-year one,” he said as floodwaters lapped at the house’s front steps. “I guess that means every two years now.” With 1,500 roads closed across North Carolina, fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Flooded roads have also prevented some North Carolina farmers from accessing their fields and livestock to assess damage, said Andrea Ashby, spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. ‘DANGER IS IMMEDIATE’ “For many parts of North Carolina, the danger is still immediate,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference Monday. “Flood waters are rising as rivers crest and they will for days.” Cooper said 2,600 people were rescued in North Carolina, along with 300 animals, and that the rescues were continuing. About 14,000 people are in shelters, officials said. The dead included a 1-year-old boy swept away from his mother as they tried to escape their car amid floodwaters. The woman had driven around barricades to reach a closed road, the sheriff’s office in Union County, near North Carolina’s border with South Carolina, said on Facebook. “Don’t drive around barricades. We’re seeing this happen now and the result is not good,” Cooper said. Over 450,000 homes and businesses in North and South Carolina were still without power on Monday evening, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. Major rivers are expected to remain flooded for the next two to three weeks as rainwater drains into already engorged rivers across the state, said Steve Goldstein of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DAMAGES UP TO $22 BILLION North Carolina had deployed around 2,000 boats and 36 helicopters to help people stranded in floods, Michael Sprayberry, the state’s director of emergency management, told ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday. The Coast Guard had 26 helicopters and 11 aircraft looking for people in trouble and rescuing people, Coast Guard Rear Admiral Meredith Austin told reporters on Monday. Property damage from the storm is expected to total at least $17 billion to $22 billion, but that forecast could be conservative depending on further flooding, risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. A power outage at a wastewater treatment plant in Wilmington resulted in partially treated sewage water being released into the Cape Fear River, said Reggie Cheatham, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. Sewage releases in the Neuse River also were reported, as well as overflowing manholes. Overflows also were reported at several hog “lagoons” - used to store waste from pig farms.

JULIE TURKEWITZ,"“In one of the poorest counties in the nation, the last thing we need is to be constantly sued by these predatory attorneys,” said Phil Lyman, a county commissioner. “Outside people try to put this into a racial divide that simply doesn’t exist in San Juan County.” Photo Top, homes in the northern part of the county; below, Ms. Coggeshell’s granddaughter, Kolela, catches the school bus in the south. The 10-mile trip takes over an hour, in part because of the poor road conditions. Credit Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times Fights over indigenous voting rights are playing out in the West and the Midwest, a trend that has the potential to tip tight races in states with large native populations, like Alaska and Arizona, and to influence matters of national importance, like the future of Bears Ears National Monument, a conservation area in this county that is at the center of a fierce debate over public lands. Today, Native Americans are suing over a new voter identification law in North Dakota, where lawyers say there is not a single driver’s license site on a reservation in a state that requires identification to vote. The outcome of the lawsuit could influence this year’s congressional election, helping to secure or flip the seat of Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat with wide Native American support. In the battleground state of Nevada, the Pyramid Lake and Walker River Paiutes won a lawsuit in late 2016 that charged that tribal citizens had to travel as many as 100 miles to vote. The suit forced officials to open new polling stations in tribal areas and spurred nine other tribes to request their own election sites. And in Alaska, where native people make up a fifth of the population, officials recently rolled out election materials in the Yup’ik, Inupiaq and Gwich’in languages, following federal rulings that found the state had failed to provide materials equivalent to those used by English speakers. After those changes, turnout in villages rose by as much as 20 percent, increasing the political power of the state’s native residents. Other native voting cases are proceeding or have been recently settled in Arizona, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. And a second case is open in San Juan County, this one challenging the county’s decision to move to an all-mail ballot. Plaintiffs contend this disenfranchises native people who live far from reliable mail service. Percentage of Native Americans in each district. District 1 District 1 Old New 11 percent 30 percent UTAH District 2 29 percent District 2 66 percent District 3 District 3 93 percent 80 percent NAVAJO NATION NAVAJO NATION District 1 Old 30 percent UTAH District 2 29 percent District 3 93 percent NAVAJO NATION District 1 New 11 percent District 2 66 percent District 3 80 percent NAVAJO NATION “It’s part of a larger political trend of Native Americans organizing and protecting themselves,” said Daniel McCool, a professor emeritus at the University of Utah and a voting rights expert who was hired by the plaintiffs in the Navajo redistricting case. There are 6.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, representing about 2 percent of the population. But many live in America’s most remote places — amid mountain passes or miles of near-empty plains — and the native path to the ballot box has often been less visible than that of other groups. It was not until 1924 that Congress granted native people the right to vote, and for generations afterward, local and state governments have blocked them from doing so, often saying that Native Americans living on reservations were not state residents. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a critical moment, prohibiting election practices that discriminate on the basis of race. But relatively few lawsuits were filed on behalf of native voters until the 1990s. The pace of legal challenges has picked up recently, something observers attribute to a realization that American Indians can influence local and national policy. The fate of Bears Ears, a conservation area that originally occupied a quarter of this 8,000-square-mile county, is one such issue. When President Trump slashed the size of the monument last month, one argument was that he was considering the desires of local officials. A Navajo-controlled commission, however, could oppose the decision, a move that could influence coming legal battles over the monument’s fate. Photo Top, San Juan County commissioners at a meeting in the north; below, a Navajo meeting in the south. Credit Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times San Juan County is a hardscrabble expanse in the state’s southeast corner, and home to some 16,000 people. The county population is about half Native American and half white, and battles over resources have often fallen along racial lines. The lower portion of the county overlaps the Navajo reservation, and native people bring millions of dollars to the county each year in the form of oil and gas revenue and other taxes. But those living on the reservation do not pay property taxes, frustrating many others who feel they pay more than their fair share. In the south, where most native families live, the library is in the corner of a trailer, there is no hospital or bank, and residents have spent more than a generation suing the county for services. Alicia Coggeshell, 52, lives in the south with two children and three grandchildren. She has no running water or internet service, and on a recent morning she traveled to the footbridge she uses to get to the market. These days, it is so dilapidated that her neighbors sometimes fall into the icy water below, she said. “We asked the county and the county says, It’s not our responsibility. This is what we mean: forgotten,” she said. Photo Top, the San Juan County Wellness Center in the northern part of the county; below, the closed swimming pool in the south. Credit Benjamin Rasmussen for The New York Times White families live mostly in the north, home to two expansive libraries, a community center on a golf course, a recreation center with a pool, and the seats of local power: the sheriff’s office, the courthouse, the school administration building. Tauna Larson, a retired educator who lives in the north, said she looked at the possibility of two Navajo commissioners with some trepidation. “I worry that they might tend to look out more for the reservation,” she said. “The majority tends to take care of their own.” The county also has a contentious relationship with the federal government, which controls 60 percent of the land here and has battled with local leaders over a range of issues, including the protection of Native American artifacts and access to a beloved public canyon. Commissioner Bruce Adams and Commissioner Lyman have been intensely critical of the federal government, and both said they believed the judge’s decision was a punishment for their resistance. “I think there is retribution,” Mr. Adams said. “We’re tired of being the scapegoat, saying we’re doing everything wrong, when we try to abide by the law.” Judge Shelby declined to comment. The old commission map made Native Americans about 30 percent of the population in two districts, and 93 percent in a third district. The new one makes them 66 percent in one district, 80 percent in another, and 11 percent in another. It will be used in a 2018 local election. Mr. Jones, the plaintiff in the case, is 62 and was born before most Native Americans could vote in the state. On a recent evening he pulled on a black cowboy hat and walked into a tribal meeting to explain the results of the lawsuit to a crowd. Kenny Victor, 57, sat on a couch in the back, looking a bit tearful. He said he was a Navy veteran and that he welcomed the decision. “I served for the right to vote,” he said. “It’s long overdue. We need representation.” A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2018, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Native Americans Pushing To Increase Sway at Polls.

Associated Press,"(PARIS) — Floodwaters were nearing their peak in Paris on Saturday, with the rain-swollen Seine River engulfing scenic quays and threatening wine cellars and museum basements. Unusually heavy rains have engorged the Seine and other rivers in the region, forcing a halt to all boat traffic in Paris, including tourist cruises. Some quay-side restaurants were submerged, and some roads and parks were closed as a precautionary measure — along with the bottom floor of the Louvre Museum. Groundwater was also seeping into some Paris cellars, and authorities warned residents of some neighborhoods to remove any valuables. However, authorities said Saturday that the flooding won’t be as bad as forecast earlier this week. The river is expected to peak in Paris on Sunday at 6 meters or less (19 feet, 8 inches) on the Austerlitz scale — below the 6.1 meters reached in exceptional floods in 2016, and well below the 8.6 meters hit in record floods in 1910. In normal times, the river measures about 1.5 meters (4 feet, 11 inches) on the Austerlitz scale. Hundreds of people have been evacuated along the Seine as floods caused significant damage in Paris suburbs in recent days, but no deaths or injuries have been reported. Parisians seemed to be taking the high water and closures in stride. Tourists took photos of water-covered embankments Saturday, as workers inspected water infiltrations on a road. Meanwhile, fishermen — and a visiting flock of cormorants — took advantage of the rushing, boat-free river to look for lunch. “The flood of the Seine river can be interesting from a fishing perspective, because many fish approach more easily the river banks and the surface,” said amateur fisherman Maxime Potier, an amateur fisherman casting his line from the Arsenal Port in eastern Paris. “I understand that people might fear the floods because of the strength of the current but here we are in a port, no current, so there is no fear.”","Floodwaters neared their peak in Paris, threatening wine cellars and museums",2018-01-27T19:34:07Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Heavy Rains in Paris Cause Dangerous Seine River Flooding,http://time.com/5121764/seine-river-flooding/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/seine-river-floods.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,River floods,1
Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Rivers and waterways, swollen after Florence’s historic deluge, rose dangerously across the Carolinas on Tuesday, closing roads, inundating communities, hindering rescue and repair efforts and preventing evacuees from returning home. Though slow-moving Florence has moved into the U.S. northeast, allowing glimpses of sunlight in the waterlogged state, at least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days, the state said. “One thing we know is that sunshine doesn’t necessarily mean safety,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a late-afternoon press conference and warned the 15,000 residents living in shelters against returning home too soon. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Florence, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane before it was downgraded, has already killed at least 33 people, including 26 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned some 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The White House said President Donald Trump would visit North Carolina on Wednesday. He was criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000. ‘DRIVING NOT ADVISED’ In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. “I haven’t been home since it started. I can’t get home either,” Chafin said. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised.” The Cape Fear River was also expected to keep rising in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has hampered efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow residents to homes. Florence dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” Cooper said. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, appeared with Cooper and said his agency would help restore power and open roads. “I think the next 48 hours are going to be incredibly critical,” he said. THOUSANDS OF RESCUES In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. More than 324,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina estimated on Tuesday 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 hogs died in the storm, exceeding the number killed in the state’s last major hurricane two years ago. Property damage from the storm is expected to range from $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When last weeks bomb cyclone hit the Midwest, it was hard to imagine the inundation it could bring amid whiteout conditions and more than a foot of snow. But the warm weather that wrapped in behind it quickly melted out all that white stuff and unleashed historic flooding across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri.
Floodwaters have worked their way down the rivers that run like arteries through the region, overtop the banks of the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, and more. Dams have been destroyed, bridges and other infrastructure have been washed away, and small towns have been cut off from the outside world, surrounded by moats of muddy water. The flooding has also paralyzed the various military bases scattered across the region, with waters lapping up against Fort Leavenworth and Offutt Air Force Base, home U.S. Strategic Command. As Task and Purpose helpfully notes, that means the base that oversees the Pentagons nuclear strategic deterrence and global strike capabilities is largely underwater. 
The situation also neatly illustrates how climate changewhich is leading to more intense precipitationis a threat multiplier.
As of Monday, nine flood gauges operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remained at major flood stage with another 17 in moderate flood stages. While the on-the-ground photos show the human toll of the floods, satellites are the best way to get a handle on the full scope of whats happening in the Midwest. Below are before and after images captured by the European Space Agencys Sentinel satellites.

DAN W. REICHER,"With the 2016 election, the chant to build that wall seemed to drown everything else. But interest in the Roosevelt idea is still alive on both sides of the river, even as President Trump seeks billions more for his wall and the Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on a resolution expressing disapproval of his emergency declaration. So whats the case for an international park?
The pitched battle over Mr. Trumps wall has focused on border security and immigration policy. These are critical issues, with lives at stake. But in the midst of this heated dispute, what if we could actually strengthen day-to-day relationships among people living on both sides of the border, without seizing any private land, and also enhance security in the process? An international park would send a strong message of cooperation and hope at a moment when the loudest words are about division and despair.
A jointly managed park would recognize the region as a single ecosystem and encourage collaboration by focusing the two nations on shared environmental and climate challenges along the border, like droughts, floods and wildfires, and invasive plants and endangered species. Joint efforts at habitat restoration and water conservation would increase river flows, discourage illegal crossings and support agriculture. And the park would increase tourism, helping struggling people on both sides of the river.
The park would be managed like its United States-Canadian counterpart, with the United States and Mexico retaining separate authority over their respective lands and park visitors carrying required documents as they cross from one side to the other. At the same time, park managers, with high-level support from both Washington and Mexico City, could collaborate on everything from search and rescue and wildlife protection to scientific research and native plant restoration.
Republicans have a strong tradition, extending back to Teddy Roosevelt, of supporting parks and international conservation. Republicans and Democrats recently came together in overwhelming numbers in Congress to approve a sweeping land conservation bill. Protecting natural areas is not an alien concept for Republicans, even these days.
On the Democratic side, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico is a strong supporter of the idea. His father, Stewart, was instrumental in enacting the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act as head of the Interior Department in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. That law protects 196 miles of the Rio Grande in Texas and 68 miles in New Mexico.
Across the river, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sees Mr. Trumps wall as an attempt to strong-arm and humiliate Mexico. But he also understands that Mexico and the U.S. are bound not only because of the common border, but by a shared culture and history.
A great international park that connects rather than divides our two nations would honor that relationship and stimulate important collaboration at a perilous time. Franklin Roosevelt would be pleased.

Storm surge floods up to 6 meters deep had caused “incredible devastation” over a huge area, World Food Programme regional chief Lola Castro said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Tokyo's recent baking temperatures may give way to major downpours, forecasters say Hundreds of flights have been cancelled in Japan as the country braces for a powerful typhoon, bringing winds of up to 180km/h (110mph). Typhoon Jongdari (or ""skylark"" in Korean), is expected to make landfall on the country's main island, Honshu, late on Saturday or early on Sunday. The storm comes less than a month after floods killed more than 200 people, and then a heatwave left dozens dead. Japan's Meteorological Agency has told locals to be ready for evacuation. At 18:05 local time (09:05 GMT) Jongdari was situated about 200km south of Tokyo and forecast to make landfall close to the city of Nagoya. More than eight million people were ordered to leave their homes earlier in July when torrential rain saw rivers burst their banks, but some became trapped after failing to heed the order. Critics said the official warning came too late, and officials are urging those in disaster-struck areas to stay vigilant. ""We are afraid that people may not be able to evacuate due to strong wind or floods blocking evacuation routes,"" said Hiroshima's governor, Hidehiko Yuzaki. ""I would like people to evacuate in advance so that they can save their lives.""

""We are paying special attention to the areas where restoration of river banks is under way as it would be the first heavy rain since the disaster."" ""It's going to deal a double punch,"" one Okayama man told Japan's public broadcaster NHK. ""We are seriously worried."" Sandbags are being rapidly deployed as barriers against the feared flooding. Images already show sizeable waves off the coast south-west of Tokyo, and ferry services are suspended. Forecasters say the area around the capital could see 40cm (15in) of rain in 24 hours from noon on Saturday. The floods earlier in July were Japan's worst weather disaster in decades, and were swiftly followed by an unprecedented heatwave which has been declared a natural disaster.

Sarah Jacobs and Rosie Perper,"The Gibe III Dam, Omo Valley, Ethiopia. Ethiopia is in the midst of an economic boom, with growth averaging 10.5 percent a year —double the regional average. One of the areas most impacted by this is the Omo Valley, an area of extraordinary biodiversity along the course of the Omo River, which rises in the central Shewan highlands and empties into Lake Turkana, on the border with Kenya. Some 200,000 people of eight different ethnicities live in the Omo Valley, with another 300,000 around Lake Turkana in Kenya. Many are reliant on the river for their food security: on fish in the river and lake, and on crops and pastures grown in the fertile soil deposited by annual natural floods. Gibe III Dam — at 243 meters the tallest in Africa, and generating some 1,800 MW of hydroelectric power — was built with a dual aim: to provide energy for the booming economy and for export, and to deliver an irrigation complex for high-value agricultural development. It was also said that the dam would become a tourist attraction, of socio-economic benefit. Both Ethiopian and Kenyan governments support the dam and have disputed claims of a negative environmental impact, but critics point to such adverse effects as the cessation of natural floods, diminishing biodiversity, falling water levels in Lake Turkana, and the displacement of traditional peoples who have lived for centuries in a delicate balance with the environment. The photographer visited the Omo Valley during the final years of the dam's construction, with the aim of producing a meditation on how important investments can nonetheless put the human-environment balance at risk, and on how the changes brought about by the presence of such large amounts of money disrupt existing equilibrium.","Founded in 1955 by a group of Dutch photographers, the World Press Photo contest has grown into one of the world's most prestigious photography competitions.

Jason Beaubien,"Third graders on board a floating school in Bangladesh run by the nonprofit group Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha. Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR On the Atrai River in the northwest of Bangladesh, a small beige boat is tied up in tall grass that lines the riverbank. The interior of the boat is packed with narrow benches which in turn are jammed with children. There are 29 students in this third-grade class and it would be hard to fit any more into the narrow vessel. The kids sit shoulder-to-shoulder facing a blackboard at the back of the boat. When the teacher asks for a volunteer to recite a multiplication table, 8-year-old Nila Khatun's hand shoots straight toward the unpainted ceiling. She leads the class in a chant that begins with ""6 times 1 equals 6"" in Bengali. They end with ""6 times 9 equals 54."" Educators in Bangladesh have a problem. Not only do they face many of the same challenges as teachers in other resource-poor countries — funding constraints, outdated textbooks, overcrowded classrooms — they also have to worry about monsoon rains. Flooding is so common in Bangladesh that students often can't get to the classroom. Nila Khatun, age 8, and her teacher, Mafya Begum, during a lesson on the floating school. Mahmud Hossain Opu for NPR So one local charity has decided to take the classrooms to the students in the form of schools on boats. This boat is one of 23 floating year-round schools in this part of Bangladesh run by Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, a local nonprofit group. Each morning the boat goes along the river picking up students. Once the whole class is on board, they pull over to the riverbank and school starts for the day. In addition to their standard primary school classes of Bengali, English, math and science, the students also watch a video about the adventures of Meena and her pet parrot, Mithu. Meena is an educational series developed by UNICEF and is the closest thing South Asia has to Dora the Explorer. In the episode that Nila and her classmates watch, Meena and the parrot foil a plot to marry off a young girl for a dowry of a motorcycle. Bangladesh is not only the eighth most populous nation in the world with 160 million people, it is also one of the countries most prone to flooding. The nation sits in a vast delta formed by the Ganges, the Meghana and the Brahmaputra Rivers as they carry brown sediment-rich water from the Himalayas out to the Bay of Bengal. Much of the country is less than 16 feet above sea level. In heavy monsoon rains, 70 percent of the country can end up under water. Mafya Begum, the lone teacher on the boat, says that during the monsoons, the local villages are cut off from the rest of the world. The roads end up under water and the only way out is by boat. Mohammed Rezwan, the founder of Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, grew up in this part of Bangladesh. ""If you visit these areas you'll find that during the monsoon season they get isolated,"" he says. ""It becomes very difficult to have the normal life."" Rezwan started his first floating school in 2002. ""If the children can't go to school for lack of transportation, then the schools should go to them,"" Rezwan says. ""The idea was to ensure all-year-round education."" His nonprofit now runs 23 boat schools in this part of Bangladesh. Shidulai also operates five floating medical clinics and just launched a playground-slash-library that plies the rivers. All their services are free. Rezwan says Shidhulai pieces together funds from national and international groups as well as individual donors to pay for its programs. In 2005, Shidhulai won an Access to Learning Award for $1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR and this blog). The group won a U.N. Prize for Inspiring Environmental Action in 2012. In 2006 UNDP honored Shidhulai with its Equator Prize and said the group is ""transforming the region's waterways from obstacles to human development into pathways for education, information and technology."" Groups like Shidhulai have helped Bangladesh make dramatic social progress over the last quarter century. The country has cut its poverty rate in half since the year 2000. It graduated from being a ""low-income"" to a ""lower middle-income"" country in 2015, according to the World Bank. The economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. But much of that economic boom hasn't been seen in the rural backwaters of Bangladesh. Rezwan says it's important to make sure that Bangladesh's annual floods don't keep kids from these remote areas from school and trap them in poverty. He refers to the floating classrooms as a combination ""school bus and school room."" After the morning session, the boatman fires up the diesel engine on the boat-school, delivers the students back to their villages and then picks up a group of older kids for the afternoon classes. Rezwan says the mobility of these schools has another benefit in rural Bangladesh. ""In the rural areas. the parents are mostly concerned with the safety of the girls,"" he says. ""If they [girls] have to travel a long way to go to school, then the parents would not let them go to school. But here the education comes at their doorsteps so they're not concerned about the safety."" And that's true for the family of third-grader Nila. Her mother Musa Khatun says that if it wasn't for the floating school, Nila probably wouldn't be in school at all. ""There's no school nearby,"" Khatun says. ""There's a school far away. That's why they chose this boat school."" Nila lives with her parents and her baby sister in a two-room house in a fishing village on the Atrai river. The walls are little more than woven reed mats. There's no electricity in the village except from some small solar panels that some residents have on their roofs. Khatun says that during the monsoons the village is only accessible by boat. Their family primarily survives by raising jute in the nearby plains. The long, fibrous plant is used to make burlap bags. Nila's mother, however, sees a different future for Nila. She says Nila is the smart one of the family. No one in their family has ever gone to college, yet Khatun insists her daughter is going to be a doctor. And Nila nods her head enthusiastically.",Monsoon floods won't stop these kids from going to school in Bangladesh — especially if the school comes to the student!,2018-09-12T09:11:39Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",'Floating Schools' Make Sure Kids Get To Class When The Water Rises,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/09/12/646378073/floating-schools-make-sure-kids-get-to-class-when-the-water-rises,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/10/20180814-mahmud-hossain-opu_mho9597-50_wide-ed78cc0198d8d14b66ee77d1651867d884eece08.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,River floods,1
Robin Epley,"Exactly three weeks after the Camp Fire flattened the town of Paradise, floods Thursday afternoon caused road closures and evacuations in the same area that burned. Lower Butte Creek Canyon was evacuated because of rising water, Highway 99 was closed south of Chico for a couple of hours, and the Chico Police Department issued a flash flood alert for southeast Chico, east of Bruce Road from Chico Canyon Road to Skyway. Nearly 100 cars were trapped for at least an hour on Honey Run Road, as two separate debris flows and flooding blocked cars from evacuating safely. At one point, officials from the Butte County Sheriffs Office confirmed the backup was two miles long. Paradise, at one point, received more than an inch of rain in an hour. Later, water rescuers were called out to Honey Run Road, in the lower area of Butte Creek Canyon, after a white Jeep Cherokee was reported floating down Butte Creek. Crews were mobilizing and being asked to prepare for additional rescues or other flood-related issues. The U.S. Army mobilized 19 high water vehicles that could hold 20-30 people for evacuations. Evacuation warnings are in place for the Hamlin Canyon and Lower Neal zones, and on the west side of the county at Hegan Lane south to Highway 162 to the Sacramento River. There were two debris flows across Honey Run Road, and about 50 people are stuck in their homes above the second debris flow. At least 3 families were rescued by boat and evacuated out of the area. An evacuation alert was issued for the 200 block of Honey Run Road to Skyway including Horse Run Lane due to flooding. With lower Honey Run Road closed, rescuers evacuated people up the canyon and Honey Run Road to Paradise, which is still under evacuation orders. Highway 99 south of Chico was temporarily closed in both directions but reopened at 3:40 p.m. When Highway 99 was closed and traffic was being routed to Midway and Durham, flooding was reported on the Midway near Jones Avenue. The National Weather Service in Sacramento issued a flash flood warning in the burn scar area of the Camp Fire. Locations under warning include Paradise, Magalia, Pulga, Concow, the Skyway, Highway 70 and Pentz Road. The warning, originally set to expire around 3 p.m., was extended to at least 9:15 p.m. and the weather service is warning people in these areas to be careful of debris flows, including possible rock and mudslides. Meanwhile a power outage affecting the Oroville and Thermalito areas started at 12:11 p.m. and impacted 2,500 customers. Crews found a failed electrical connection near Highway 70 and Oro Dam Boulevard and were working to troubleshoot.","The Mercury News Camp Fire: Fire, then floods: Evacuations and road closures The Mercury News Exactly three weeks after the Camp Fire flattened the town of Paradise, floods Thursday afternoon caused road closures and evacuations in the same area that burned. …",2018-11-30T14:35:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mercurynews.com'}","Camp Fire: Fire, then floods: Evacuations and road closures - The Mercury News",https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/30/flash-flood-warning-issued-in-camp-fire-burn-area-butte-county/,https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FLOOD21.jpg?w=1024&h=677,,Mercurynews.com,River floods,1
Associated Press,"(ELKHART, Ind.) — Crews used boats to help residents evacuate their homes in northern Indiana after rainstorms sweeping across the Midwest on Wednesday combined with melting snow to flood rivers, roads and other low-lying areas in several states. The storm system starting pushed heavy rain, snow and ice into the region this week, and the weather has already been blamed for hundreds of car crashes and several fatalities, including the deaths of four people in a crash along a slippery interstate in Nebraska. About 19 people had been evacuated from homes in Elkhart, a town just east of South Bend, by early Wednesday, said Mayor Tim Neese. Local schools were closed because of the flooding and an emergency shelter was set up to help evacuees overnight, The Elkhart Truth newspaper reported. “This city has not seen flooding like this in the last 45 years,” Neese said. “We also had record snowfall in addition to consistent rain.” Homes and streets also were flooded in the South Bend area, and forecasters predicted that the swollen St. Joseph River wouldn’t crest until Thursday. The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for parts of several states in the central and southern U.S., spanning from Texas to Illinois and Ohio to Arkansas, where strong winds topped power lines and damages buildings. Winter weather advisories also were issued, including in for Oklahoma and Kansas. In Michigan, flooded streets stranded motorists and a school bus in Flint, and a washout from heavy rains may have caused two freight train engines to derail near Grand Rapids. No injuries were reported there. Residents in Mattawan, in the southwestern part of the state, used sandbags to protect homes and businesses as a nearby river rose above its banks. “We just got to wait for it to go down,” Terry Teeter, who installed pumps to keep water away from his house, told WOOD-TV. “It’s going to be a couple of days like this.” In Illinois, the fear of rising water along the Illinois River forced the evacuation late Tuesday of the LaSalle County Nursing Home in Ottawa. Two days of rain in southern Wisconsin swelled waterways, leading to a handful of high-water rescues for people stranded in their vehicles. A 52-year-old woman from Bourbonnais, Illinois, was found dead Tuesday in a submerged car in Peotone, south of Chicago. The woman apparently lost control of her vehicle and ended up in a rain-filed ditch, said Peotone Fire Protection District Deputy Chief Bruce Boyle. In eastern Nebraska, speed and slippery pavement caused a crash between a pickup truck and a semitrailer along Interstate 80 on Tuesday that killed four people from Colorado, police said. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a 38-year-old woman died and two other people were injured in a collision on an icy highway late Monday. In Minnesota, state police said winter weather contributed to 400 crashes and 250 spinouts, including two fatal accidents. The storm system stretched to Texas, where weather service officials said three tornadoes hit. One struck early Tuesday in a rural area near Joshua, destroying at least two mobile homes and severely damaging several others. A mother and her disabled daughter were injured when one twister demolished their mobile home.","About 19 people had been evacuated from homes in Elkhart, Indiana, following the floods.",2018-02-21T20:12:20Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Rescuers Using Boats to Evacuate Victims as ‘Worst Floods in 45 Years’ Hit Midwest,http://time.com/5169171/severe-floods-midwest/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/south-bend-indiana-flood.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,River floods,1
Joe Wertz,"If Houston's record deluge during Hurricane Harvey highlighted the dangers of unchecked, sprawling development, then Tulsa — another conservative city built on oil — is a showcase for the opposite. For decades it has planned carefully and imposed wide-ranging regulations that aim to prevent the kind of devastating floods that used to make national headlines here. Other cities are taking note, as expanding development and a warming climate threaten to make flooding worse. On a recent afternoon, Bill Robison parks his city-issued car in front of a modest, beige ranch house in east Tulsa to carry out a key part of the city's program. ""That's the one I haven't been able to talk to yet,"" he says. Robison is lead engineer for Tulsa's storm water program, and this is one of 80 homes the city is currently trying to buy and tear down. Over the last three decades, Tulsa has cleared nearly 1,000 buildings from flood-prone areas. Typically, after people are flooded two or three times they're ready to sell out. Bill Robison ""Typically, after people are flooded two or three times they're ready to sell out,"" says Robison. Sure enough, the woman who answers the door tells him the house flooded not long ago. In fact, it's flooded repeatedly in recent years, and changed hands a number of times. She's open to a buyout. The great drainage war Tulsa is surprisingly vulnerable to flooding, from the Arkansas River and a spiderweb of 36 creeks. In the 1970s and 1980s the city was hit by a string of damaging floods. Activists and the public stormed city hall, but builders and property developers fought plans to address the flooding. Local media dubbed the dispute ""The Great Drainage War."" Then, in 1984, another flood disaster dumped more than a foot of rain leaving 14 people dead and hundreds injured. It galvanized the city. That, and a change of administration, allowed one of the nation's most aggressive flood control plans to move ahead. Tulsa's program is one of the few that accounts for urban growth. The city has built a network of drainage systems, and it's created green spaces that double as flood basins when needed. Bill Robison pulls his car over and points one out. ""You can see there's a Frisbee golf course here, walking trails and just a nice open area,"" he says. Tulsa's flood control plan includes multi-use drainage basins, like the athletic field at Will Rogers High School. It doubles as a detention pond for overflowing storm water. Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma Tulsa also enacted strict rules on where and how homes and buildings are constructed — rules that go far beyond national standards. Ron Flanagan, who helped write the flood control plan, says it can be tough mandating something that adds costs for developers. ""Elected officials are very sensitive to the development community's wants and desires and needs,"" he says. To help pay for the program the city added a fee to utility bills which was, and remains, unpopular. But having a strict program also means residents get big discounts on flood insurance. ""If you don't have the local people on board you haven't got a program,"" Flanagan says. ""The federal government can't enforce everything, and they have minimum standards."" Today, Tulsa's flooding problems are much smaller and officials say the prevention program has saved lives and millions of dollars. Other cities routinely reach out for advice. Even the State Department brings international groups to see the flood plan in action. Still, Flanagan worries. The longer Tulsa goes without a catastrophic flood, he says, the easier it is to forget why the city needed to change its ways.","For decades, Tulsa planned carefully and imposed regulations to prevent the kind of devastating floods that used to make national headlines.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over. A powerful storm is set to spin up in the Midwest this week. And if youre getting deja vu looking at the weather map up top, youre not alone.
The swirling mass of air forecast to blast the region with blustery winds, snow, and rain bears more than a passing resemblance to last months bomb cyclone that devastated the region. While this weeks storm might not be quite as strong, it will unleash a wave of misery in places still suffering from flooding.
The gnarly weather pattern will follow a similar evolution to last months bomb cyclone. A storm will come racing on the back of a strong jet stream dipping across the west through the first half of the week. As the jet stream swoops back up into the Midwest on Wednesday, it will pull ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico up to meet cold air from the north. Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota are all under winter storm watches. The contrasting air temperatures will have winds whipping up to 35 mph and six or more inches of snow are forecast, according to the National Weather Service. Other parts of the Upper Midwest could also see snow through Thursday before the storm swirls into the Ohio River Valley, and its extremely likely those winter storm watches could expand to other areas and be upgraded to warnings. Blizzard-like conditions are also possible, so it wouldnt be wholly shocking to see the National Weather Service issue blizzard warnings at some point either.
While the storm is no joke, its also not likely to be quite as potent as last months bomb cyclone, which arrived with hurricane-force winds and record-setting low pressure. Thats because the environment isnt as conducive to as powerful a storm this time around. The temperature gradient on either side of the fronta key ingredient for winter storms to bomb outwont be as extreme. That means this storm might not meet the textbook definition of a bomb cyclone, a term that applies to storms that see their central pressure drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. 
But textbook definitions aside, this storm poses a serious risk to the region still recovering from flooding last month. Data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows thatMidwest soil moisture levels are in the 99th percentile, which is to say that soils are extremely waterlogged. The new batch of rain and snow is like pouring a can of gas on a fire. Except instead of the flames rising higher, the water will. 
If youre wondering what climate change looks like, this is it. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, unleashing more deluges and with them, more floods. With saturated soil, water is once again expected to run off into rivers and streams, many of which are still swollen. In the Missouri River basin, 26 flood gaugesin NOAAs networkare in a state of major or moderate flooding. In the Upper Mississippi basin, 56 gauges are at those levels of flooding. The new influx of water will add to the flood woes and is likely to tip other gauges back toward moderate or major flooding.
That could add to the billions of dollars in losses and once again raise the specter of flooding at Superfund sites. And it will add to the slow moving torrent of water working down the Mississippi River toward the Gulf of Mexico. That wall of water is forecast to unleash historic flooding through May, according to NOAA.","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp ( DUK.N ) said it shut down a North Carolina natural gas plant due to flooding as the deluge of water continued in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people. Duke also said it cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash from another plant is flowing into nearby waters. Water breached the cooling lake dam at Duke’s 625-megawatt natural gas L.V. Sutton plant, causing the company to shut the plant. Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches, one large and several smaller, the company said in a statement. Site personnel are supplementing on-site supplies with large stones and other materials, and engineering experts are on their way to the site, Duke said. Hurricane Florence brought several feet of rain to parts of North Carolina over a period of days, and the historic level of storm flooding is not expected to subside until next week. Separately, company spokesman Paige Sheehan told the Associated Press they cannot rule out that ash might be escaping and flowing into the Cape Fear river from another plant. Reuters has not independently verified this information. Duke reported two coal ash leaks from a retired plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence. One came from its shuttered Sutton Power Plant on Saturday and a second on Sunday, according to federal officials. Officials had worried the water would overwhelm several pits where coal ash had been stored, potentially contaminating rivers. Duke said there is no visible ash in the river. Coal ash collects at the bottom of basins, making it difficult to determine when ash escapes from a site. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy had agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing.

Karen Dillon,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Record flooding along the Missouri River that left death and destruction in three Midwestern states appeared to have crested on Sunday in the Kansas City area without causing major damage and continued to move downstream, local officials said. 
Although the surge had begun to recede in Kansas City, Missouri’s largest city, a number of riverfront roads remained flooded and city residents were urged to conserve water to help utility crews cope with the deluge. 
Officials of two small, Missouri waterfront communities just outside Kansas City, Riverside and Parkville, which had been bracing for flooding, said early on Sunday that the worst appeared to be over. 
“The good news is the river has crested and is now dropping,” the Riverside Fire Department said on Twitter. 
Parkville, where high water was creeping to the edge of the scenic commercial district known for its antique shops, art galleries and restaurants, also said on Sunday that the river waters were starting to back away. 
“All businesses open,” the city declared on Twitter. 
But the flooding still threatened Kansas City’s drinking water. The KC Water utility issued a plea for conservation to its 170,000 customers “to help with ongoing treatment challenges created by current characteristics of the Missouri River.” 
The municipal water service issued an advisory on Saturday warning that the flooding had impaired its treatment of water, which it gets from the river, raising health risks for infants, the elderly and others with compromised immune systems. 
Conserving water will ease pressure on an upriver wastewater treatment plant where crews were struggling to replace broken pumps submerged by floodwater, the utility said. 
Although testing had shown excessive levels of turbidity, fine particles in the water that can carry bacteria, viruses and parasites, KC Water said late on Saturday that it “had not found any harmful bacterial organisms” in the water, which it said was safe for cooking and bathing. 
Floods were unleashed last week after a “bomb cyclone” storm dumped torrential rains on hundreds of square miles of the snow-covered Plains. 
No further precipitation is forecast for the area until midweek, when moderate rainfall is expected, National Weather Service Meteorologist Andrew Orrison said. 
“I think at the worst what it will do is just prolong the gradual receding of the water levels across the various river basins throughout the Midwest,” Orrison said by phone from the service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. 
By next month, however, melting snows further upstream in Minnesota and the Dakotas could trigger more flooding, he said. 
The record flows had cascaded down the Missouri, the country’s longest river, killing at least four people, drowning livestock and closing dozens of roads in Nebraska and Iowa. Property losses were estimated at more than $3 billion in those two states.

Humeyra Pamuk,"COLUMBUS, Neb./CHICAGO (Reuters) - Nebraska grain farmer Ryan Ueberrhein was barely breaking even after the U.S.-China trade war pushed prices for his soybean crop to a decade low. Then the nearby Elkhorn River burst its banks as flooding swept across the U.S. farm belt. 
Uberrhein’s farm was left covered in debris after the roiling water receded. He has mounting debts. And he is worried that President Donald Trump may not be able to strike a trade deal with China that would end tariffs on U.S. soybean exports - and allow him to sell whatever grain is left intact at a better price. 
Frustration is building across farm country at what feels like a never-ending season of bad news. 
The trade war “keeps damaging us,” said Ueberrhein, 34, of Valley, Nebraska, who voted for Trump. “What the president is doing, we stand by him, but ... we can’t keep getting hit just because a deal can’t be made quickly.” 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to arrive in China this week for another round of trade talks with their Chinese counterparts. The two sides have yet to agree on many core issues. 
Farmers who spoke to Reuters remained supportive of Trump. 
Soybean exports to China hit a four-year low in February because of the trade war. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, which are the largest single U.S. agricultural export. A near halt in exports has hit a rural economy already struggling after years of oversupply cut farm incomes by 50 percent in the past five years.

The Nebraska Rural Response Hotline, which provides support to farmers and ranchers, has received a record number of calls about financial distress, said John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union. Calls about suicide and depression were up, too, he said. 
The latest piece of bad news came on March 11, when the Trump administration released its 2020 budget and proposed a 15 percent cut for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, calling its subsidies to farmers “overly generous.” 
It did not matter to farmers, who helped vote Trump into office, that the budget will not pass muster with Democrats who control the House of Representatives, Hansen said. Some farmers took the proposed cut to subsidies for crop insurance as an insult. 
“How many times do you have to kick us when we’re down?” he said. 
That insurance is crucial to Richard Oswald, who farms near Phelps City, Missouri. The flood has already swallowed his childhood home, many of his fields and more than 20,000 bushels of corn. His four grain bins have burst, after water-logged corn expanded and split open. 
“If our government and leaders can’t step up and start to lead, we’re done for,” he said. 
For years, Oswald paid extra for flood insurance. He hoped that government talk of investing in improving U.S. infrastructure would come through - and bolster the levees and dams throughout the Midwest. 
But this year, as the trade war dragged on, he dropped the policy to reduce expenses. So he will get no insurance money for the lost corn, Oswald said. 
A few days ago, one of his lenders called. Oswald didn’t have to pay the loan right away, the lender said, but he would have to repay it sooner or later. 
“Help needs to come from Congress, but Congress is so divided, I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Oswald said. 
DISASTER DECLARATION 
Trump approved a disaster declaration for Nebraska on Thursday, making federal funding available in nine counties that bore the brunt of the recent floods. On Saturday, he approved one for flood-affected counties in Iowa. 
Greg Ibach, a USDA under secretary, is touring the damage in Nebraska, and Bill Northey, another under secretary, will head to Iowa, agency officials told Reuters. 
U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said the farm belt states would need more aid, suggesting a separate relief bill to offer compensation to farmers for livestock killed in the floods and grains in storage that will have to be destroyed. 
“The United States government has always been the insurance of last resort,” Grassley said in a phone interview on Friday. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts put agricultural flood damage for the state at nearly $1 billion. Iowa officials are projecting losses of at least $1.6 billion, with at least $214 million in damage to the agriculture sector. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said her state would need assistance beyond what is granted through disaster declarations. 
Farmers, meanwhile, are staring at waterlogged fields and expecting more floods. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said last week that the flooding would worsen in coming weeks as snow on the ground melts and water flows downstream. 
Iowa farmer Dave Newby said the standing water in his fields was already threatening his planned start to corn in mid-to-late April. Newby, like many farmers, had been looking to boost his corn plantings this year because such a large volume of soybeans had been left unsold because of the trade war. 
The same was the case in nearby Nebraska. Parts of flooded farmland remained under water and farmers had yet to assess the damage the piled-up sand, silt and debris caused to soil. Almost all said planting will likely be delayed, which could lead to lower yields. 
 “Normal planting would take place around May 1, but I doubt we will make it,” said Kendal Sock, a cattle and corn farmer in Genoa. “I wish they’d get this trade deal done, like now.”

BOONVILLE, Mo. After being gouged, carved, cut and shifted by glacial forces, the Missouri River flowed free and ran wild for millennia. The result was a surrounding bottomland nourished by the natural pulse of the river. Wildlife flourished in these bountiful surroundings.
Native Americans lived with the rhythms of the river for centuries, but things began to change after Europeans arrived. Commercial travel proved treacherous. In the century following Lewis and Clark, more than 300 steamboats sank in the Missouri, victims of the rivers countless snags, shoals and ever-shifting sands.
Eventually, the upper and middle Missouri were dammed; the lower river, including the winding 367-mile stretch that connects Kansas City and St. Louis, was channelized, the banks stabilized and the river made navigable.
Timber was felled and croplands appeared. The rich, lush bottomlands, no longer benefiting from the rivers natural ebb and flow, became less favorable to wildlife.
Then came the Great Flood of 1993 and its unequalled havoc. For months, the floodwaters raged. When the waters finally abated, the landscape had changed, as had the lives of many people who lived and worked near the river. Thousands of acres of productive farmland, for example, had been blasted by the torrent and scarred by the sands it had left behind. Many areas were marked with scour holes. The price tag for repairing the damage soared into the billions.
The year following the flood the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service established the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge. The refuge wouldnt prevent another flood but it would make some areas better suited to handle one.
There had been talk of establishing a refuge for a long time, said Anna Weyers, a refuge specialist for the Big Muddy property. They had talked about the importance of having a refuge that would protect the flood plain.
The historic flood helped push the refuge off the planning board and into reality.
No property was (or will be) confiscated for the refuge. Property is purchased only from sellers, several of which stepped forward following the crushing effects of the flood.
We had a lot of damaged flood-plain lands and a lot of willing sellers, said Big Muddy park ranger Tim Haller.  
Much of that property had been in crop cultivation. But what had been soybean and corn fields are, today, hardly recognizable thanks to reforestation, which has occurred at a stunning rate.
We have a mosaic out there, said Haller, who has seen much of the forest return during his 17 years at Big Muddy. We have some open lands and some that are pretty heavily forested, mostly cottonwoods and willows. Its amazing how quickly the forest has developed.
The refuge was officially established Sept. 9, 1994, although the first property wasnt purchased until the following year.
Today Big Muddy includes about 21,000 acres in 17 units from just east of Kansas City to north St. Louis County, not far from the Missouris confluence with the Mississippi River. Most of the refuge property hugs the river corridor, although there are a few small outlying tracts.
The Big Muddy (the name comes from the Missouri Rivers historic nickname, inspired by the heavy sediments the powerful river carries) is unique among the more than 500 properties in the federal national wildlife refuge system, according to Weyers.
Big Muddy is different because a lot of the refuges are protecting a specific species or several species. Or a migration, she said. At Big Muddy its to protect the flood plain. The flood plain and its species.

A lot of critters live here. Numerous fish species, of course. Deer and turkey, small game, snakes, turtles and birds, including migrating waterfowl. A few eagles.
Visitors are welcome and encouraged, although aside from the new and modern contact station (i.e., visitors center), which is located at the end of a gravel road off Highway 98 about 8 miles from Boonville, many visitors might be surprised to find the rules relatively lax and facilities practically non-existent.
The most popular pursuit, according to Weyers?
Hunting for morel mushrooms is the No. 1 activity on the refuge, she said. But we allow fishing, hunting, berry picking, hiking, wildlife watching. We are very open for the public.
Hunters are welcome. Most refuge hunting is managed under statewide regulations. The refuge is building a reputation as a deer destination.
It can be pretty good deer hunting but it can also be a bit of a challenge, he said. Some areas are pretty thick with new growth timber. But we have a lot of deer and for folks willing to work at it, it can be pretty good.
Camping is not allowed on the refuge, although sandbars on the Missouri River are managed by the state and typically open to camping. Caution is advised when pitching a campsite on a sandbar, however. They can and do shift.
Horseback riding and trapping are also off-limits, as are all-terrain/off-road vehicles and mountain bikes.
Weyers added that kayaking is growing in popularity, particularly in some of the slower-moving and protected side channels of the Missouri. Kayaking and canoeing the relatively recently formed scour holes is also popular.
Some of the scour holes are good fishing spots, too, Weyers added.
Three scour holes are located on the Overton Bottom North Unit, which is also home to the refuge headquarters. The 38-acre I-70 hole, 11-acre Cottonwood hole and the 8-acre Diana hole are accessible by road. Small boats/kayaks/canoes/float tubes can be launched from shore. 
If you go
The Big Muddy National Fish &amp; Wildlife Refuge is open year-round. Some areas are subject to flooding. Special regulations apply to some areas. There is no admission fee.
The refuge currently includes 17 units, including 13 along the river corridor. From west to east these include: Jackass Bend (950 acres), Baltimore Bottom (1,749 acres), Cranberry Bend (1,062 acres), Cambridge Bend (538 acres), Lisbon Bottom and Jameson Island (3,885 combined acres), Overton Bottoms North (2,550 acres), Overton Bottoms South (3,886 acres), Providence (570 acres), St. Aubert Island (1,124 acres), Berger Bend (440 acres), Boones Crossing (572 acres) and Cora Island (1,265 acres).
Most refuge lands and waters are open to hunting and fishing. State license requirements and bags limits generally apply. Deer hunting is limited to archery-only in some areas. A 100-acre block surrounding the visitors center is closed to hunting. There are several hiking trails on the property.

""My past four villages remain under those waters there,"" the 60-year-old adds. After being driven out of four different homes by the floods, she now lives in a makeshift hut erected on bamboo pillars. But she is anxious that her home is once again under threat. ""I don't know where I would go if the river floods again."" Many villages the BBC visited in the state had similar stories. Elderly villagers pointed at the water to show where their villages once stood before floods displaced them, again and again. Fear of flooding has been growing in the state ever since upstream China stopped sharing river data crucial for issuing early warnings. The data, which relates to the movement, distribution and quality of water, provides information on the water level of the river to alert downstream countries in case of flooding. ""We came to know about the Chinese decision through media reports and we have been very worried ever since,"" said Sanjiv Doley, a resident of Dhansirimukh village. Until now, they were always prepared for floods, he said, including evacuating villages. ""Imagine what could happen now that we will not be receiving any information from China,"" he said. ""None of our villages will be safe."" The Brahmaputra river, one of Asia's biggest, originates in the Tibet Autonomous Region in China, flows into India and then enters Bangladesh before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Brahmaputra floods large parts of Assam every year, displacing tens of thousands of people The river floods large parts of the state every year, displacing tens of thousands of people. Nearly 300 people died this year alone due to flooding in the state. A bilateral agreement between India and China requires the upstream country - China - to share hydrological data on the river during the monsoon season, between 15 May and 15 October. But Indian officials said in August that they have received no data for this year. The dispute over data comes on the heels of a recent standoff between India and China over a Himalayan plateau. The potential border conflict was defused after more than two months of tension. Chinese authorities said in September that they had no data to share at that point because their hydrological stations, which record the data, are being upgraded. That was the last statement they made on the issue. But the BBC found that despite its statement, China was still sharing data on the same river with Bangladesh, the lowest downstream country in the Brahmaputra basin. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Kaziranga wildlife park, home to India's one-horned rhinoceros, is often ravaged by the floods Anisul Islam Mohammad, Bangladesh's water resources minister, told the BBC in September that his country was receiving hydrological data from China. Chinese authorities did not respond to the BBC's request for their latest comment. It remains unclear if and when they will resume sharing data with India. Locals told the BBC that the floods were devastating enough while China was still sharing information, increasing their fears that things might be a lot worse if Indian officials have no access to data that could help them prepare in advance. ""China has never been open about what it is doing upstream of the Brahmaputra,"" said Ashok Singhal, member of Assam's legislative assembly, who also leads the ""save Brahmaputra"" campaign. ""I have asked several times for permission to visit the river upstream in Tibet but I have not been permitted to go (by China)."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Floods in 2016 killed 34 people in Assam The Chinese government has constructed several hydropower dams on the Brahmaputra, which is known as Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet. But the country insists that it does not store or divert water, and will not do anything that goes against the interest of downstream countries, such as India or Bangladesh. Assam's officials, however, say they have spotted worrying signs. Flooding, according to them, has become more frequent since May when China stopped providing river data. ""Earlier we used to have one or two rounds of floods during monsoon but this time, we have even had a third and fourth round of floods without rainfall in the upstream part of the river,"" Himanta Sarma, the state's finance and health minister, told the BBC. ""You need to see all this in the backdrop of the Doklam conflict,"" he added. He was referring to the border standoff between China and India earlier this year. Scientists in Assam said India was not doing enough to address the problem - such as setting up its own hydrological stations in the international border area (between China and India) to monitor the river. ""There has been no discussion between scientists, politicians and bureaucrats,"" Professor BP Bohara, a geologist at Guwahati University, said.

Sean Collins Walsh,"Built in 1969 and designed to withstand a 50-year storm, the two-lane causeway in Kingsland that succumbed to a raging Llano River was the third Central Texas bridge to be destroyed by floodwaters in recent years. Experts say it likely won't be the last as climate change and construction exacerbate the natural factors that led meteorologists to name the Hill Country ""flash flood alley."" With more than 53,000 bridges, Texas has more than any other state, and many were built in the mid-20th century based on federal weather data from the 1950s. Intense rain events are now more common, and rapid exurban development has created more impervious cover, leading to more runoff. ""It's inevitable that we will see more major bridge damage in the future, likely sooner rather than later,"" said Bruce Melton, an Austin-based civil engineer and founder of the nonprofit Climate Change Now Initiative. ""The 100-year storm is now the 25-year storm in Austin. PHOTOS: Major flooding throughout Central Texas on Tuesday"" The river crested at 39.9 feet Tuesday in the city of Llano, the closest flood gauge upstream from Kingsland, according to the National Weather Service. That was the highest flood level recorded in Llano since the record-setting 1935 mark of 41.5 feet. Most bridges on Texas Department of Transportation-constructed roads are built to withstand 25- or 50-year storms, while interstate highways are designed to withstand 100-year storms, said Travis Attanasio, a civil engineer in the Fort Worth area and an officer with the American Society of Civil Engineers. Some large Texas cities in recent years have started requiring bridges to be designed to withstand 100-year floods. A 100-year storm is a rain event that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year based on federal weather data. Those data, however, are being re-evaluated to reflect higher rainfall totals in recent years. Texas, for instance, has seen 500-year floods in each of the last three years. TxDOT spokesman Chris Bishop said the RM 2900 bridge was built with the assumption that the water levels in the Kingsland area, where the Colorado and Llano rivers meet at the top of Lake LBJ, are expected to stay stable. ""That section is considered to be for the most part a constant-level lake, so it’s not expected to do this. It normally would handle that, and it has for 50 years,"" Bishop said. TxDOT will not be able to estimate the reconstruction cost until after its inspectors evaluate the damage, Bishop said. Replacing a bridge of that type and size typically costs about $20 million, Attanasio said. In 2015, the deadly Memorial Day weekend flooding along the Blanco River destroyed two bridges between Blanco and Wimberley. As the state took a year to rebuild them, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a temporary span for the Fischer Store Road Bridge upstream from Wimberley. Austin bridges The city of Austin maintains six bridges over Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake, including the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and the Pleasant Valley Road bridge at Longhorn Dam. Most of those bridges are at or near the 100-year flood plain, said Pirouz Moin, interim city engineer. Redbud Trail downstream from Tom Miller Dam at Lake Austin is one of the bridges in the 100-year plain, but it is slated to be replaced if voters approve a $160 million transportation bond on Nov. 6. The city also is updating its flood plain maps, which could place several city bridges under the specification. Moin said new bridges are built to withstand 100-year floods. However, it is impossible for many of Austin’s roughly 1,700 bridges to be built at that height because they are in low-lying areas and could not serve roads that feed into them or provide access to surrounding properties. Requiem for a causeway The opening of the RM 2900 bridge came during a golden age for Kingsland, as the tiny town saw a population boom and a series of major construction and transportation projects. Local merchants bought a newspaper ad encouraging residents from nearby Sunrise Beach, Sandy Harbor and Blue Lake Estates to ""cross the bridge and save in Kingsland,” according to Highland Lakes Weekly. The unincorporated city now has about 6,000 residents and is home to the Antlers Hotel, where 1973's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was filmed. The bridge has become a vital connection between the town and smaller communities on the other side of the Llano River. Each day about 5,600 drivers use that stretch of RM 2900, according to TxDOT traffic estimates. Although video of the bridge breaking apart seems to show that the flood's wall of water simply overpowered it on Tuesday, Attanasio said the bridge likely met its end because of debris that accumulated underneath it. ""More than likely it was some kind of debris that hit the support columns, whether it be a large tree or a boat that broke away,"" he said. ""Weird stuff washes down the creek when it rains.""

https://www.facebook.com/michael.miller.1466,"Crews were engaged in multiple water rescues and buildings collapsed in historic Ellicott City on Sunday evening as flood waters raged through its streets following torrential thunderstorms, Howard County officials said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced at 6:40 p.m. he had declared a state of emergency in Howard County and was planning on making his way to Ellicott City to assess the damage. The Howard County fire department warned people trapped on the city’s Main Street to climb to the second floors of buildings as they awaited rescue and said the damage could rival devastating floods that occurred there in 2016. No injuries were immediately reported. “This is an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC situation and you must move to HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY AND STAY AWAY FROM ANYWHERE WHERE WATER IS MOVING,” the National Weather Service warned in a 5:30 p.m. tweet. Howard County public information officer Mark Miller said a torrent of water was rushing through the streets. Miller said the flooding “appears to be of equal magnitude as the 2016 floods.” “The town is flooding,” Miller said. “All of our first responders are responding.” The Howard County fire department warned people to stay away and said hundreds of rescuers were converging on Ellicott City from as far away as Northern Virginia. Howard County officials announced they were opening an emergency operations center to manage its response. Videos taken on Ellicott City’s Main Street show boiling brown waters flowing down the street, carrying debris and trash. The waters spilled into doors and windows and twisted traffic lights. Abigail Conte, 19, was at the Bean Hollow coffee shop in the historic section of the city when the rains began this afternoon. She said the staff announced they were closing around 3:45 because of a flood warning. She left the shop and began to make her way to her car about a half-mile away. “As I was walking outside, the street was becoming a river,” Conte said. She came to an intersection where it became too dangerous to continue. She eventually sought shelter at Cottage Antiques. As of about 6:30 p.m., she said she was trapped on the second floor of the building and had moved into a backroom because she was afraid a telephone pole might collapse on the shop. She said the owners of the antique shop said the basement of the building had flooded. She said she saw a garbage can and other detritus flowing down Main Street, but nothing larger. “It’s just flooded,” said a woman who answered the phone at A Journey from Junk. “I’m trying to work through my own panic attack.” Before declaring a state of emergency, Hogan activated the state’s emergency response, which sends extra rescue personnel to the scene from various state agencies, said his spokesperson Amelia Chasse. Several nearby counties — including Carroll, Frederick and Washington — sent swift water teams, she said. “The Governor sends his thoughts and deepest sympathies to those impacted, including residents and businesses in Ellicott City,” Chasse said. “He is warning people to be safe. Don’t come out to look at the flooding. There’s still danger out there.” The Capital Weather Gang reported radar indicated 3 to 6 inches of rain has fallen in just two hours in the Ellicott City area and it continues to rain heavily. Just to the south of Ellicott City, radar indicated as much as 7 to 8 inches had fallen. Jeff Halveson, professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County and a contributor to the Capital Weather Gang, said the storm pattern had essentially stalled over Ellicott City, the same phenomenon that caused massive flooding in the City of Frederick two weeks ago. He said the storm could drop 10 to 12 inches of rain total, before it finally ends between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. He said he thought the flooding could ultimately be worse than what was seen in Ellicott City in 2016. “To say lightning strikes twice is basically what’s happening,” Halveson said. “To have this happen weeks apart and 30 miles apart is extraordinary. Ellicott City sustained severe damage in a July 30, 2016, flash flood that killed two people. During that flooding, houses along Main Street shook as residents filmed the devastation out their windows. Some formed human chains to rescue those stranded in their cars as the rising waters roared through the historic downtown. Emergency workers climbed onto roofs and chopped holes into stores to save those trapped inside. In the 2016 flooding, Joe Blevins, a father of three, was swept away as he climbed with his wife from their flooding car. His body was spotted by a hiker the next morning on the shore of the Patapsco River. The body of another tourist, Jessica Watsula, was found under the Ilchester Bridge.

"Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone, CNN","(CNN) After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend. At least 44 people have died since the hurricane slammed into the coast last week. While the rain subsided, some rivers are still rising, and North and South Carolina officials warn the flooding danger is far from over. ""The Cape Fear River will crest again this weekend, along with the Lumber River,"" the North Carolina Department of Transportation tweeted Friday, adding that the Neuse will rise Monday. ""Additionally, new areas are flooding with little warning. Due to this, travel isn't recommended south of US 64,"" it said. While some roads are not flooded, they may have damage and hazardous debris that makes it dangerous to drive or walk on them, state officials said. In South Carolina, emergency officials issued a stern warning on avoiding the roads: ""I know we sound redundant, but it bears repeating: Turn around, don't drown!"" the state's emergency management department tweeted. A week after Hurricane Florence made landfall, the trillions of gallons of water it dumped over the Carolinas are slowly moving toward the sea and leaving a path of destruction behind. Residential streets have turned into rivers and freeways have morphed into waterways. Storm recovery will cost $1.2 billion In North Carolina, flooded rivers have left thousands of evacuees living in shelters and hundreds of roads underwater. The water has receded in some places, but as it moves downstream, officials say, thousands of people could be in danger until next week. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Friday a number of rivers -- the Waccamaw, Lynches, Little Pee Dee and Big Pee Dee -- are forecast to crest east of Interstate 95 this weekend and early next week. Residents were warned the confluence of the Big Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee rivers -- where they merge -- could reach flood levels even greater than those seen during Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the state's resources and personnel have shifted to the Pee Dee region. Authorities have said 23 out of the 46 counties in South Carolina could potentially be impacted by flooding. Residents in those areas are still recovering from the 2015 catastrophic floods in the Carolinas as well as from the widespread damage of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 In Conway, South Carolina, authorities said residents could see damage in homes that have not flooded before. Officials are also worried about contamination and environmental hazards from the storm, including the potential effects of coal ash. Coal ash is an industrial waste created by coal-burning power plants, and can carry health risks. Flooding from the Cape Fear River caused breaches in a dam at a cooling lake at Duke Energy's LV Sutton Plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, prompting the company to shut down the natural gas plant Friday, Duke Energy said in a statement. ""Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches -- one large and several smaller -- on the southern end of the impoundment,"" the statement said. It noted there are two coal ash basins on the site, but said there was ""no visible ash in the cooling lake. A landfill containing disposed ash from the site has not been affected by the cooling lake, it said. An earlier statement from Duke Energy explained the LV Sutton coal power plant was retired in 2013, and today the plant operates as a natural gas plant. Most of the people died in North Carolina Of the 44 people killed, three have been in Virginia, 32 in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina, officials said. The deaths include two mental health patients killed in South Carolina's Horry County. The women, Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van when sheriff's deputies couldn't open the doors of the vehicle, authorities said.","After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend.",2018-09-22T09:59:04Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",44 dead as Florence-weary Carolinas face more flooding and rising rivers,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/us/florence-carolinas-flooding-saturday-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920235843-03-florence-flooding-0920-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,River floods,1
Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane threatened to drench Hawaii’s most populated island of Oahu on Saturday, after lingering just south of the U.S. state and unleashing torrential rains and flooding on the Big Island, weather and civil defense officials said. Hawaii was spared a direct hit by a major hurricane as Lane, once a monster tempest, weakened on Friday into a tropical storm with sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100 kph). Early on Saturday it remained south of Hawaii and was moving slowly north-northwest through the Pacific Ocean, its outer rain bands producing severe flooding across parts of the islands. “Regardless of the storm’s track, life threatening flash flooding, along with locally strong winds and possible isolated tornadoes, will continue to extend far beyond the center’s location,” the National Weather Service’s Honolulu office said. “Do not focus on the exact forecast track or intensity of Lane.” Hawaii’s Big Island, properly called the island of Hawaii, was hard hit on Friday and much of it remained vulnerable to flash floods, the weather service said. Hilo, the Big Island’s largest community, received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Police and emergency crews conducted numerous rescues of people stranded in vehicles and homes by high water on Friday. On Saturday, Lane was creeping north-northwest at 3 mph (5 km/h), NWS meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said by phone. It was expected to turn to the west, away from Hawaii, later on Saturday, he said. “We have to get this thing out of here, and the biggest reason is the Big Island doesn’t need any more rain,” he said. NO INJURIES REPORTED No injuries were reported, but several structures were destroyed on the Big Island, said Melissa Dye, an NWS spokeswoman in Honolulu. She said two Hilo-area neighborhoods were evacuated. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Oahu, home to the state capital of Honolulu and to 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, could receive heavy rain later on Saturday if the storm lingers south of the state, forecasters said. More than 1,100 people stayed in emergency shelters in the city on Friday, according to its mayor, Kirk Caldwell. He told the Weather Channel that Honolulu is vulnerable to floods and mudslides because it is partly ringed by mountains. “We have asked our residents in these areas where they know it floods to be ready to leave,” Caldwell said on Friday. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, will diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. New Yorker Rigo Pagoada, 43, who was on vacation on Oahu with his family, said he felt lucky it had been largely spared, but that it was sad to see what had happened on the Big Island. “We’ve been very fortunate,” Pagoada said. Hawaii’s major airports stayed open during the storm, though some flights were canceled at Honolulu’s main airport and at Kahului Airport on Maui. Travelers should expect congestion at the airports through the weekend as a result, Hawaii Governor David Ige said.

Devika  Krishna Kumar,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. authorities ordered tens of thousands of people to heed warnings of life-threatening coastal floods, wind and rain and get out of harm’s way as Hurricane Michael churned over the Gulf of Mexico toward the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday. Residents and tourists were told to evacuate coastal areas in at least 20 counties in Florida. The Category 2 storm, which has already disrupted oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, strengthened as it headed north, carrying winds of 110 miles per hour (175 km per hour). It was forecast to become a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before coming ashore on Wednesday over the Florida Panhandle or the Big Bend area in the northwest of the state, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. At that strength, it would rank as the most powerful storm to strike the Panhandle in more than a decade. “Hurricane Michael is a monster storm and it keeps getting more dangerous,” Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Tuesday. “The time to prepare is now.” The Republican governor, who is campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat in the November congressional elections, warned of the potential for a deadly storm surge that could be as much as 12 feet (3.7 meters) over normal sea water levels. People in areas that could be affected should take no chances against such a powerful surge, Scott said, adding, “No one’s going to survive,” such a wall of water. As Michael moved over open water, energy companies halted nearly one-fifth of Gulf of Mexico oil production and evacuated personnel from 10 platforms on Monday. The Gulf of Mexico produces 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The partial shutdown ahead of Michael helped push oil prices slightly higher on Tuesday. Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties along the Panhandle and Florida’s Big Bend regions, mostly rural areas known for small tourist cities, beaches and wildlife reserves, as well as the state capital, Tallahassee. A hurricane warning was in effect for a more than 300-mile (480-km) stretch of coastline from the Florida-Alabama border to the Suwannee River in Florida. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had numerous teams deployed and ready to respond, said FEMA spokesman Jeff Byard. About 1,250 National Guard soldiers were assisting and more than 4,000 troops were on standby. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, said the country was very well prepared for the hurricane, adding it was much bigger than had been expected. CLOSURES AND LINES FOR GAS State offices, schools and universities were closed through the end of the week in Panhandle counties. Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. Regus, an international office provider, offered temporary space for rent in Birmingham, Alabama, for businesses evacuating neighboring Florida. “If you’re evacuating #HurricaneMichael and need a place to work, come visit a business lounge at any of our 5 locations in Birmingham! #evacuate #HurricanePrep #Michael,” the company wrote on Twitter. The last major hurricane - Category 3 or above - to hit the Panhandle was Hurricane Dennis, which made landfall near Pensacola in 2005, according to hurricane center data. Torrential downpours and flash flooding caused by the storm over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America. At 11 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) on Tuesday, Michael’s center was about 335 miles (535 km) south-southwest of Apalachicola, Florida, heading north at around 12 mph (19 kph), the NHC said. On its current track, it would make landfall somewhere along a coastline that includes the cities and towns of Fort Walton Beach, Panama City Beach, Port St. Joe, St. Teresa and the wildlife reserves bordering Apalachee Bay. However, forecasters always note it is not possible to predict where a hurricane will land until it is closer to the coast. The storm was forecast to move through the southeastern United States on Wednesday and Thursday, passing through the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. It would head off the Mid-Atlantic coast by Friday, the NHC said. The Miami-based center forecast as much as 1 foot (30 cm) of rain in parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

Associated Press,"(MIAMI) — A storm kicking up in the Caribbean Sea is threatening to bring heavy rainfall and flash floods to parts of Mexico, Cuba, Florida and the eastern U.S. Gulf Coast this weekend and possibly beyond. Subtropical Storm Alberto – the first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season – was roiling parts of coastal Mexico and Cuba with rip currents and dangerous surf on Friday. Both countries issued tropical storm watches. At 11 a.m. EDT, Alberto was located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south of Cozumel, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). It was moving north-northeast at 6 mph (9 kph). The U.S. was expected to start feeling Alberto’s effects Saturday. The National Weather Service said a flash flood watch would be in effect from Saturday evening through Tuesday evening for southeastern Mississippi, southwestern Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle. A subtropical storm has a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds are found farther from its center. Subtropical storms can develop into tropical storms, which in turn can strengthen into hurricanes. Alberto comes ahead of schedule: the six-month hurricane season doesn’t begin until June 1. Parts of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana have already seen heavy rain this week, and further deluges could leave those areas vulnerable to flash flooding and river flooding. Some beachfront and riverfront communities are already handing out sandbags. The downpours could dampen Memorial Day, the unofficial start of the summer tourist season along Gulf beaches. Along with heavy rains and high winds come rough seas and a threat of rip currents from Florida to Louisiana that can sweep swimmers out to sea. Red flags warning of dangerous surf conditions are already flying along some beaches. Jordan Sawmiller of Ohio tells WALA-TV that he was approaching the water with caution in Gulf Shores, Alabama. “It will hit you pretty hard. and it sucks you right back out. So, I don’t like getting in there very far,” Sawmiller said. A hotel owner in Panama City Beach, Florida, tells the Panama City News Herald that her family’s five hotels are normally full on Memorial Day weekend. But Julie Hilton said people are cancelling because of the weather and room reservations are down about 20 percent. Heavy rain could also be bad news for farmers. Georgia Peanut Commission Chairman and farmer Armond Morris and Tyron Spearman with the National Peanut Buying Points Association inspected a south Georgia peanut field Thursday. They told WALB-TV that farmers are worried about already-soaked young plants. “Just hopeful that all the peanut stands will be OK, but we may have to replant some peanuts,” said Morris. Only 65 percent of the 2018 Georgia peanut crop has been planted. “The crop is not growing as well as it should be,” said University of Georgia Tifton peanut agronomist Scott Monfort. “So we are getting some cases of yellow peanuts just not growing.”","The storm is threatening to bring heavy rainfall and flash floods to parts of Mexico, Cuba and Florida",2018-05-25T18:05:50Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Alberto Is Coming: First Named Storm of the 2018 Hurricane Season Is Aimed at Gulf Coast,http://time.com/5292106/alberto-hurricane-season-2018/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-598590592.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,River floods,1
Alejandro de la Garza,"The residents of Belhaven, North Carolina, know flooding. Most of the the homes in the town of 2,000 on the Pungo River in the Inner Banks region are built on stilts or have second-floor living spaces. But they weren’t prepared for Hurricane Florence. Videos from the small town have gone viral. One, posted by Amy Powell Johnson, has been viewed more than 980,000 times on Facebook and another 400,000 times on Twitter. They were some of the first images of the sheer volume of flooding that Hurricane Florence’s storm surge brought inland. “This one is just particularly scary because the water is so high,” Belhaven resident Michelle Hooper tells TIME. “Higher than we’re used to, but we are used to a lot of water. A lot of places are going to get flooded out.” The National Weather Service reported that storm surge levels for parts of eastern North Carolina had already reached the levels of Hurricane Irene in 2011, when the water rose more than 7 feet in some places. Hooper, who left under a voluntary evacuation order and went inland, has been receiving updates from her neighbors since Thursday night and posting them to her Twitter account. She worries for them and worries for the house she left behind. “I haven’t gone to bed. I’ve been stressed out that my house is going to go under, that my house is going to float out to sea. It’s just a little tiny house on five-foot stilts. It’s not built for something like this. It’s built for flooding but not for this. This is crazy,” she says. Hooper, a longtime resident who says she’s ridden out hurricanes in Belhaven since the 1990s, is glad she got out this time. “It is stupid to stay with a storm like that,” Hooper says. “But at the same time if you’ve been through these storms for decades in the same home you know where your boundaries are.” During the night, one of Hooper’s friends sent her a video that showed surging waves washing under the porch of her house. Another sent a picture of neighbors kayaking down the street to check on their business during a period of calm this morning. But for residents who chose to stay behind in this resilient waterfront town, the ordeal may be far from over. Some may have gotten more than they bargained for. “We don’t ever get hurricane-related deaths, it’s never that serious,” says Hooper. “I guess because we’re so prepared for it and used to it there’s just a plan always. But this one, I don’t know. Those waves were big in that video. It is scary. It’s still happening.”","The residents of Belhaven, North Carolina, know flooding.

Mélissa Godin and William Martin,"When Eliza Jasi saw enormous floods sweeping their way through her village in southern Malawi on March 8th, she had one thought: not again.
Malawi, a small, landlocked country in south-east Africa, home to 18.6 million people, has been hit by devastating floods in recent weeks. In early March, following unusually heavy rains, the Shire river in southern Malawi overflowed, sweeping away crops, homes—and people. More than 800,000 people have been affected and at least 59 people have died. (The toll is expected to rise.) On March 9, Malawian President Mutharika declared a state of disaster. On March 15, Cyclone Idai hit Malawi along with Zimbabwe and Mozambique, one of the worst climate-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere.
Villages are now completely submerged under water and Nsanje, the most southern district of Malawi has been the most severely affected. Although the government deployed its Defense Force, roads are flooded—preventing aid and rescue vehicles from getting to the worst-affected areas.
This is the third major flood that 35-year-old Jasi has endured. In Malawi, violent floods are becoming increasingly frequent and volatile, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Rising temperatures and atmospheric moisture are thought to increase the frequency and severity of floods. According to the United States Agency for International Development, Malawians are particularly affected by climate change because of their reliance on subsistence farming; 80% of Malawians work as farmers. According to the International Monetary Fund, Malawi is the fourth poorest country in the world with 50.7 % of people live under the poverty line and 25% live in extreme poverty. 
Women in Malawi are disportionately affected by climate change. Because women are expected to provide food, water, and firewood for their families, droughts have resulted in women walking longer distances to get these resources, increasing the time spent on unpaid household work. The Guardian reports that climate change is also resulting in increased poverty, which is exacerbating the prevalence of early marriages.
During environmental disasters — when people are sent to live in camps — women tend to suffer most, in part because of high rates of sexual violence in the camps.
Jasi is one of them. During the 2012 floods, one of her six children died. When Jasi sought refuge in an aid camp, there was no shelter and little food. Scared of losing another child, she was forced into prostitution to provide for her family and ended up contracting HIV. According to UNAIDS, one million people in Malawi were living with HIV in 2016, increasing the likelihood of women contracting HIV through these transactions.
After the water levels went down, Jasi had to rebuild her home and started regrowing crops that had been swept away. Three years later, another flood hit, displacing more than 230,000 people. Once again, she lost her crops and her home was destroyed. Her husband died shortly after. Now, in 2019, Jasi finds herself in the same predicament: her home and crops have been destroyed and she is once more living in a camp that is unable to provide basic necessities. 
Christina Wholy, 45, agrees. Her home was destroyed on March 8 and when she arrived at the Ngabu evacuation camp in Nsanje with her husband and children, she discovered there was not enough food, no soap or sanitary products, few toilets and no place for people to sleep. “I’m worried no help is coming,” she says. According to Relief Web, Ngabu camp is overcrowded, housing over 1000 families. 
Women are especially affected by the lack of food as they are expected to provide and care for their children. “We do not have freedom,” Wholy says.
The poor living conditions means many men choose to leave the camp. As Winard Ngano, a man living in the Bangula camp puts it: “Men are so desperate. They do not have food to feed the family.” According to Ngano, many men start relationships with women in nearby communities in the hopes of finding food and shelter. 
Some women, however, say their husbands are leaving the camp over frustrations with the sleeping arrangements in the camp. Families do not have their own individual tents to share, because of a lack of supplies. Instead, men and women are separated, sleeping in different parts of the camp. Aid organizations use this model around the world in the hope of preventing sexual violence. Esther Moyo, a Program Officer for the international NGO ActionAid says this model often results in men leaving their wives. 
During the floods in 2015, for instance, “the men were complaining that their conjugal rights were being violated,” Moyo says. Men subsequently abandoned their wives, embarking on relationships with women in nearby communities. 
“Things turned sour when he noticed that the tents could not accommodate a family,” says one woman affected by the 2015 floods who asked to stay anonymous for fear of retaliation from her husband. “My husband fled. To date, he is nowhere to be found. So that’s where the marriage ended. He couldn’t stand to see his wife sleeping separately from him.”
As a result of the difficult conditions within the camp, many displaced people say they wish they have sought shelter elsewhere. “I wish I had just stayed back at home,” Wholy says. “There is no food here and the situation is more tense. I do not know what the future holds.”
But returning home is not an option for those whose homes have been swept away. For years, the government has been encouraging citizens to settle away from the Shire River, the countries largest river running out of Lake Malawi to Mozambique, that is prone to flooding. Yet according to Moyo from ActionAid, the government has not provided adequate land for people to move to nor have they ensured that land rights are secured. As a result, many families will likely return to the disaster prone areas once the flooding has dissipated.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","A window-rattling winter storm brought blustery conditions, stretching from the northern Rocky Mountains to Texas.
 USA TODAY
Days of heavy rain and snowmelt brought historic flooding to the Upper Midwest on Friday. The floods have left one man dead, threatened a Nebraska dam and nuclear power plant, and halted traffic on the Missouri River. 
The situation has prompted evacuations in Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota.
Heavy rain was courtesy of the massive ""bomb cyclone"" that battered the central United States this week with heavy snow, howling winds and several tornadoes. Rain and melting snow from the storm have already produced record high water levels along portions of the Boyer and Floyd rivers in Iowa and the Loup River in Nebraska, AccuWeather said.
So far, 19 locations in the Midwest have set new flood crest records, said weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman. Overall, more than 300 river gauges were in flood stage in the central United States, the National Weather Service reported.
A Nebraska farmer was killed Thursday after the tractor he was in got carried away by floodwaters, the Omaha World-Herald said.

Also in Nebraska, the Cooper Nuclear Station along the swollen Missouri River will likely be shut down early Saturday as the river keeps rising, officials reported Friday. The shutdown is a precautionary measure only: even if it floods there is no danger, thanks to built-in safeguards, according to Nebraska Public Power District spokesman Mark Becker.
The U.S. Coast Guard says all traffic on the Missouri River from about 50 miles south of Omaha, Nebraska, downstream to St. Joseph, Missouri, has been shut down due to the rivers high water levels.

Flooding also reached the Dakotas: In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, at the Leif Erickson YMCA camp, executive director Mike Murphy said ""the severity of this particular flood event isnt something that anybody has ever experienced. It came up so rapidly, we weren't able to get our vehicles out or get anything out that we could drive or save,"" he said.

Though dry weather is forecast for the next several days across much of the USA, this round of Midwest flooding should persist into the weekend, the weather service warned. 
AccuWeather warned that the worst flooding may be yet to come for some areas along the upper and middle portions of the Mississippi River over the next several weeks, as much of the snow over the northern Plains, Upper Midwest and central High Plains melts.

Aylin Woodward,"In parts of California wine country, 8 feet of floodwaters have inundated homes and vineyards over the last 24 hours. 
 While the towns of Sonoma County are no strangers to flooding, record-breaking torrential rainfall this week caused the Russian River and its tributaries to inundate the area with the worst floods since 1995. 
 ""A slow-moving storm is moving into the West Coast from the Pacific, which has been the cause of very heavy rainfall that has occurred over northern and central California,"" Accuweather meteorologist Frank Strait reported. 
 Parts of Sonoma County received more than 20 inches of rain, and the National Weather Service reported that Santa Rosa broke the 100-year rainfall record by more than 3 inches with a whopping 5.66 inches in 24 hours. 
 The rainfall caused the Russian River to crest to more than 45 feet — 14 feet over the flood mark — on Wednesday evening, causing further damage to local homes and businesses. 
 Hundreds of roads across the county shut down, and the rains also caused numerous mudslides in the area. 
 Guerneville and Monte Rio, two towns about 80 miles northwest of Sacramento, were disconnected from surrounding areas by up to 8 feet of water. Local sheriff departments declared Guerneville ""an island"" and warned that it was accessible only by boat. 
 Flood warnings are in effect through Thursday afternoon, but the National Weather Service expects waters to recede throughout the day. More rain is expected later this week, though.

Jessica Boddy,"Scientists have discovered a new species of sheet-weaving spider, and it only dwells in one cave in southern Indiana. As its name suggests, this spider spins flat, tightly-woven, horizontal webs. There are thousands of species of sheet-weavers, and you’ve probably walked through one of their webs by accident some point. “In the morning when there’s dew on the grass, and you see the little horizontal webs—those are sheet webs,” Marc Milne told Gizmodo. Milne is an arachnologist at the University of Indianapolis who identified the new spider in Indiana. This new sheet-weaver, dubbed Islandiana lewisi, is most likely not dangerous to humans. It’s only about 2 millimeters long and probably eats other small arthropods, like springtails. “Springtails are like little lunch sacks for spiders. They’re soft and packed with nutrients,” Milne said. “When the springtails hop into the air, they can land and get stuck in these sheet webs.” Though he hasn’t observed it directly, Milne thinks this is what’s happening in Stygeon River Cave where I. lewisi live. As described in his study published in June in Subterranean Biology, Milne named the new spider lewisi as a nod to his colleague Julian Lewis, an independent isopod taxonomist who first brought his attention to the spiders hiding out in the Indiana cave. Milne went to see the spiders for himself, and found the cave to be a little treacherous to navigate. “It’s actually a bit of a tight squeeze,” he told Gizmodo. “It’s small and narrow. You have to crawl to get in.” He added that the cave occasionally floods, leaving it very wet and mucky. But the spiders seemed right at home, spinning their sheet webs between giant, mud-covered boulders. While the spiders had lost some of their pigment and were slightly translucent (a common trait among light-deprived, cave-dwelling creatures) he noticed their eyes hadn’t shrunk. This led him to believe the spiders hadn’t occupied the cave as long as many other cave-bound animals we know of—maybe just a few million years as opposed to hundreds of millions of years. Thought it may seem strange that a new species of spider has been lurking undetected in Indiana, Milne says it’s a misconception that all new spiders are going to be found in sparsely populated areas. “When people think of new spiders being discovered, they think of the Amazon or the ice underneath Antarctica,” he said. “But even in our backyard, there are a lot of new, undiscovered organisms that we don’t know much about. People think we know everything about the organisms in the Midwest and the United States because we’ve scoured the land, but in reality, we haven’t. A lot of groups are really understudied. Spiders are just one of them.” [ Subterranean Biology ]","Scientists have discovered a new species of sheet-weaving spider, and it only dwells in one cave in southern Indiana.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Watch drone footage of the swollen river Seine in Paris The swollen River Seine in the French capital, Paris, has peaked at more than four metres above its normal level. It rose to 5.84m (19.2ft) early on Monday, and is not expected to begin receding before Tuesday. Weeks of rainfall have produced a relentless rise in the water level. Around 1,500 people have been evacuated from their homes in the greater Paris region, while a similar number of homes remain without electricity, the authorities say. In 2016, the last significant flood in Paris, the river reached a high of 6.1m. Seven stations of a main commuter line, the RER C, have now been closed until at least 5 February, and some expressways that run alongside the Seine have been closed. The city's famous Bateaux Mouches tourist boats are out of service, with only emergency services allowed to use the river. Image copyright EPA Image caption Perching seagulls enjoy the spectacle of the high waters At the Louvre, a lower level housing Islamic artwork was closed to visitors. Other famous attractions like the Musée d'Orsay and the Orangerie gallery were on high alert. Several areas on the city's outskirts are under water, and some residents are getting around by boat while dozens have been evacuated from their homes. Some schools are closed. ""Everyone is getting around by boat"" on the island of Migneaux in Poissy, a western Paris suburb, said local Serge Matikhine. ""The mood is still good, we are used to it - in 20 years we are on our eighth or ninth flood,"" he told the AFP news agency. Water levels are expected to remain high all week, as more rain is expected to worsen an already waterlogged soil. Have you been affected by the floods in Paris?

Some basements in the city have already sprung leaks after the river surged following heavy rainfall, reports said. The Seine is forecast to swell even further this weekend, adding several metres of water above its normal level. Many roads in the region are already waterlogged. Boat traffic - including the capital's famous tourist cruises - has also been interrupted. The water level in the river is expected to peak at around 6m (19ft 6in), which is at least 4m above its normal level.

WRAL,"By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press About 3.4 million chickens have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped at least 60 farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Sanderson Farms said Tuesday 1.7 million of the losses occurred at independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn't restored quickly, the company said. The Department of Agriculture said that about 5,500 pigs were also killed in the storm, and that number could changed based on further recovery efforts. The pork industry trade group says farmers have been working before and after the storm to move at-risk animals to higher ground. The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another 25 of the pits containing animal feces and urine have either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. Even though the sun shown in parts of the state Tuesday, major flooding is continuing after Florence's passage and is expected to worsen in some areas. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday with an additional three forecast to peak by Thursday. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant's former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke's assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke's handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029. In South Carolina, workers with electricity provider Santee Cooper erected a temporary dike in hopes of preventing flooding of an old coal ash dump at the demolished Grainger Generating Station near Conway. The dump is adjacent to the Waccamaw River, which is expected to crest at nearly 20 feet (6 meters) this weekend. That's nine feet above flood stage and would set a new record height. ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck","WRAL.com 3.4 million chickens drown as NC rivers swollen by Florence WRAL.com By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press.

Anthony Boadle,"A structure lays in ruins after a dam collapsed near Brumadinho, Brazil, on Jan. 25, 2019.
Leo Drumond/The Associated Press
Brazilian rescuers were searching for some 200 missing people after a tailings dam burst on Friday at an iron ore mine owned by Vale SA, the second major dam disaster involving the company in just over three years.
Seven bodies had been recovered by nightfall, said Avimar de Melo Barcelos, the mayor of the town of Brumadinho where the dam burst in the mining-heavy state of Minas Gerais.
The toll was expected to rise sharply.
Story continues below advertisement
Vale Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said only one-third of the roughly 300 workers at the site had been accounted for. He said a torrent of sludge tore through the mines offices, including a cafeteria during lunchtime.
Minas Gerais is still recovering from the collapse in November 2015 of a larger dam that killed 19 people in Brazils worst environmental disaster. That dam, owned by the Samarco Mineracao SA joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton , buried a village and poured toxic waste into a major river.
Neighbors of an iron ore mine belonging to Brazilian miner Vale SA were evacuated on Friday in southeastern Minas Gerais state, when a tailings dam ruptured, pouring out mud into the surrounding area, the company and authorities said. Rough Cut (no reporter narration).Reuters
Schvartsman said the dam that burst on Friday at the Feijao iron mine was being decommissioned and had a capacity of 12 million cubic meters a fraction of the roughly 60 million cubic meters of toxic waste released by the Samarco dam break.
The environmental impact should be much less, but the human tragedy is horrible, he told journalists at Vales offices in Rio de Janeiro. He said equipment had shown the dam was stable on Jan. 10 and it was too soon to say why it collapsed.
Television footage showed a vast swathe of thick red mud scarring the verdant hills below the mine, cutting through farms and residential areas and levelling everything in its wake.
Fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant Pedro Aihara said the torrent of mud stopped just short of the local Paraopeba river, a tributary of Brazils longest river, the Sao Francisco.
Our main worry now is to quickly find out where the missing people are, Aihara said on GloboNews cable television channel. Scores of people were trapped in nearby areas flooded by the river of sludge released by the dam failure.

Helicopters plucked people covered in mud from the disaster area, including a woman with a fractured hip who was among eight injured people taken to hospital, officials said.
The Inhotim Institute, a world-famous outdoor contemporary art museum a few miles from downtown Brumadinho, evacuated visitors and closed its doors out of precaution.
PARAOEBA COMPLEX
The Feijao mine is one of four in Vales Paraoeba complex, which includes two processing plants and produced 26 million tonnes of iron ore in 2017, or about 7 per cent of Vales total output, according to information on the companys website.
Feijao alone produced 7.8 million tonnes of ore in 2017.
Brazils recently inaugurated President Jair Bolsonaro dispatched three ministers to survey the disaster area and will visit himself on Saturday, his chief spokesman said.
Former environmental minister and presidential candidate Marina Silva said Brazilian authorities and private miners had not learned anything from the 2015 Samarco disaster near the city of Mariana and called it unacceptable.
Story continues below advertisement
Operations at Samarco remain halted over new licensing, while the companies have worked to pay damages out of court, including an agreement that quashed a 20 billion reais ($5.31 billion) civil lawsuit last year. Federal prosecutors suspended but have still not closed an even larger lawsuit.
Three years after the serious environmental crime in Mariana, with investigations still ongoing and no one punished, history repeats itself as tragedy in Brumadinho, Silva said on Twitter.
Iron ore prices are likely to rise in the wake of the disaster as there may be less supply on the market for the short term, said Chris LaFemina, a Jefferies mining industry analyst.
That could boost the share price of rivals Rio Tinto Plc and Anglo American Plc, while weighing on Vale, he said. U.S.-listed shares of Vale closed 8 per cent lower on Friday.
While we hope the reports of fatalities are inaccurate, we do believe this is a material negative for Vale, LaFemina said. The full extent of the damage and the potential impact on iron ore markets are not clear.
Schvartsman declined to comment on how output would be affected.","Desperate search for survivors after dam bursts at Brazilian iron mine, hundreds missing The Globe and Mail Several dead, hundreds missing after mining dam bursts in Brazil CBC.ca Dam collapse in Brazil leaves 7 dead, 200 missing, floods city with mining wast…",2019-01-25T20:56:32Z,"{'id': 'the-globe-and-mail', 'name': 'The Globe And Mail'}","Desperate search for survivors after dam bursts at Brazilian iron mine, hundreds missing - The Globe and Mail",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hundreds-missing-in-brazil-after-dam-breaks-area-evacuated/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/Ly3eoISuYJatp1mVMbE_LR0tIHk=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FR4IGGFO3BBZHNHLU2WYKDKZRQ.jpg,the-globe-and-mail,The Globe And Mail,River floods,1

McDowell County Emergency Management confirmed 200 people from campgrounds and residential communities near the Lake Tahoma Dam were in shelters Tuesday night. Patsy Barnwell was praying the rain stops. Her camper, where she lives full-time, was flooded by high water along the Catawba River. She and others woke to the sound of a loudspeaker ordering everyone to get out. ""It's dangerous,” Barnwell said. “We have seen a lot of people pulling people out and saw some of them just about washed down the river."" Around 10 a.m. on Wednesday, officials said they were closing those shelters and that residents could return home. Engineers deemed the dam safe and the mandatory evacuation order was canceled. ""The soil became saturated and slid off a rock face but it's well below the toe of the dam, so there's no concern at this time,"" dam engineer Jeffrey Brown said. Marie Belton spent the night in a shelter with her family and isn't sure what will be left when she finally gets home. ""I'm terrified,” Belton said. “There's no insurance on that camper so if it is gone, it is gone and there's nothing we can do about it.” Old Fort and Marion were the hardest-hit communities Tuesday night. Emergency management officials said there had been several landslides in the county as well as moderate flooding in western and central communities. Four swift water rescues were carried out. Two NCDOT workers were rescued after the tandem dump truck they were using to help clear a mudslide was pushed off a road by another slide and into the Catawba River. They climbed out through a passenger window and stood on the side of the truck in the water until emergency crews got them to safety. ""Our emergency response and transportation crews have been working through the night to keep North Carolinians safe as conditions deteriorate,"" Cooper said. ""But this storm isn't yet over. I'm urging people to keep a close eye on forecasts and flood watches, and asking drivers to use caution especially when traveling in our western counties,"" said Governor Cooper. Early Wednesday morning, the Charlotte Fire Department sent a 16-person water rescue team to McDowell County. That personnel is trained in boat operations and technical water rescue.

In Asheville, numerous streets were flooded, particularly in Biltmore VIllage. [CLICK HERE for Asheville flood updates] I-40 reopens following mudslide On Tuesday evening, a mudslide in Old Fort forced the shutdown of a portion of Interstate 40. Officials said some of the vehicles on the roadway were trapped after the slide occurred. All of the occupants were able to get out and no injuries were reported. In Rutherford County, a State of Emergency is in place for communities along Lake Lure and the Broad River. River levels rose over seven and a half feet, and the town of Lake Lure has repeatedly opened the floodgates to release some of that water. Campgrounds in the area have been evacuated and residents living along the river have been told to get to higher ground.

"Asheville Citizen Times, Joel Burgess, Asheville Citizen Times","Tropical Storm Florence is continuing to dump dangerous amounts of rain as it continues its slow slog across the Carolinas. (Sept. 15) AP Ryan and Heather Roscoe look at the rising waters of the Cape Fear River Saturday in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The river reached above the railroad trestle's stone columns during floods from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The river is expected to swell higher than that by Tuesday. (Photo: Joel Burgess/jburgess@citizentimes.com) Story Highlights The Cape Fear was at 12.15 feet at 5 p.m. Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Emergency service workers will also go to homes FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. – The sixth-largest city in North Carolina may experience two 500-year floods within two years. Still bearing the trauma of deadly Hurricane Matthew in 2016, Fayetteville and Cumberland County officials Saturday morning weighed whether to call for mandatory evacuations. What they're facing now with Tropical Storm Florence is potentially worse than two years ago, when at least four people died as a result of flash flooding. This time, the danger from flash floods is not as great. But as the rain keeps pounding the east of the state, two rivers in the area are rising — the Little and the larger Cape Fear. Last Slide Next Slide The Cape Fear was at 12.15 feet at 5 p.m. Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Flood level is 35 feet. During Matthew, it reached 58 feet. By Tuesday, officials expect more than 62 feet for the river that runs through the center of the city. Leaders of the county and city joint response team are already strongly encouraging people who live within a mile of the little River to voluntarily evacuate due to what they're calling potentially ""life-threatening flooding."" Those within a mile of the Cape Fear are also being asked to consider evacuating. That encouragement might become mandatory Saturday afternoon, said Sally Shutt, assistant Cumberland County manager. ""We are monitoring it and communicating with the National Weather Service,"" Shutt said. If officials deem the evacuation necessary, they'll send out alerts via texts, emails and phone calls. Emergency service workers will also go to homes, Shutt said.

"Opinion contributors, Jacob Frey, Frank Klipsch and Sharon Weston Broome, Opinion contributors","Americans are now seeing the nightmare unfold that mayors throughout the Midwest have warned about for years.
Breached levees, flooded farms, washed out roads and drowned homes are disrupting lives, devastating communities, and straining state and city budgets. But the floods that made headlines and caught the attention of 2020 presidential campaigners are not the first and wont be the last. 
In the past 26 years, the Midwest has seen multiple 100-, 200- and 500-year  flood events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that the flooding will get worse, bringing an unprecedented flood season to the heart of America. In fact, more flooding is expected in the coming days as a result of this week's  giant spring snowstorm.
Midwesterners are used to intense storms, but this extreme weather overwhelmed us. Torrential rains throughout the region washed the deep layer of snow into the rivers, causing record-breaking river rise and catastrophic flooding starting upstream and rushing downstream on the regions major waterways. Our river infrastructure is no match for what scientists predict is the new normal.

How I spent my summer vacation: Fleeing wildfires as a climate change refugee
The damage is staggering. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds says the flooding has cost her state an estimated $1.6 billion and submerged at least 1,200 homes. Roughly 70 miles of levees operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are damaged or destroyed, and the cost to repair them is estimated at $350 million. An additional 175 miles of levees that are not federally owned and operated also need repairs costing roughly an additional $175 million.
Minnesota is facing a  massive snowmelt, and Louisiana has been dealing with high water levels and the threat of floods since last November.
What does that mean? We are entering an unprecedented flooding season with an outdated and broken river infrastructure. Absent the necessary systemic solutions and support, we are left to pile sandbags around our homes, along our roads and around military bases, and hope for the best. Sandbags should not be our only option. Not in America. Not when we already know what we need to do to prepare and protect our communities.
Climate disasters require national response 
As leaders of the  Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, we work alongside  85 other mayors from  10 states bordering the Mississippi River to grapple with the environmental challenges facing the region. We understand the need for systemic solutions to climate challenges. When it comes to the environment and the critical national asset that is the Mississippi River, we are all in it together. 
For the past seven years, the mayors have presented to Congress and federal agencies a unified  infrastructure and investment plan to address the regions growing vulnerability to disasters. Each year, our plan has become more advanced, highlighting new and innovative partners across the globe. But the sheer scale of the challenges we face can only be met through bold congressional action like a comprehensive infrastructure bill. An infrastructure package that includes transformative proposals like a resilience revolving loan fund and projects such as natural infrastructure restoration, sustainability, resilience and climate risk mitigation is critical.
Our work with the Mississippi River Caucus in the U.S. House and Senate has yielded progress. But it will take the will of a nation to meet the problems at the scale we face today the wildfires of the West and floods of the central United States are prime examples that this is a national challenge.
The current administration proposed a budget that would set us back. It contains deep cuts to the Army Corps of Engineers, whose public servants maintain much of the levee system that we still rely on. The budget also threatens to deplete funding for critical domestic programs that cities along the Mississippi need. 
Rebuild old infrastructure for new reality
It would be easy to forget about the damage here once the headlines move on to the next crisis. But ignore the Midwest at your own peril. The Mississippi River and its tributaries span  31 states, covering 41% of the nation and supporting one of the most  agriculturally productive regions on the planet.
The river is the linchpin of the nations domestic freight and water infrastructure,  transporting 40% of the nations agricultural output, creating nearly $500 billion in annual revenue and directly supporting more than 1.5 million jobs. If we dont invest in maintaining our nations busiest waterway, the losses will ripple throughout the country.
Mayors dont have the luxury of distance and denial. We cant complain about gridlock or blame the opposition. We have little time for grandstanding. We live in our communities, and we feel the consequences of our decisions. When it comes to tackling the immense challenge of rebuilding old infrastructure for a new climate reality, its long past time that Washington take some direction from leaders on the front lines.

Cathleen O'Grady,"Enlarge / Riverfront Ave. in Calgary during the Alberta floods 2013. reader comments 0 In June 2013, Keith Musselman was living in the Canadian Rockies when the nearby Bow River flooded. “We were in a valley, so we were stuck for about five days,” Musselman told Ars. “The community was devastated.” The flood was one of the costliest and most devastating natural disasters in Canada’s history, with five people killed, more than 100,000 evacuated, and extreme property damage. Heavy rainfall falling on late snow in the mountains had overwhelmed rivers and reservoirs, and Musselman, a hydrologist, realized that this kind of rain-on-snow flooding wasn’t properly understood. “Forecasters have a good handle on what happens when rain falls,” he says. “But when that rain falls in mountains where there’s deep snow, we don’t have a good handle on what the flood volume will be.” Musselman and a group of colleagues used historical data to sketch out what the rain-on-snow flood risk looks like across western North America—and how that risk is likely to change in a warming world. Their paper, published in Nature Climate Change this week, finds that some areas will see reduced risk thanks to declining snowfall. But at higher elevations, there’ll still be snow, and the increasing amount of rain falling on that snow will have implications for flood risks. The perfect storm At drier and higher elevations, rainfall on snow isn’t so much of a problem, either because there’s not enough rain or not enough snow for it to matter. But when the conditions are just right, heavy rainfall can combine with snowmelt to produce floods that are more catastrophic than the rainfall would cause. When Musselman moved to work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), his colleagues there had also identified this as something they wanted to study—and “they had a great dataset,” Musselman says. “We used that to understand how rare these large flood events are.” Work has been done on this before, but this team was able to use more fine-grained data to build up a detailed picture. They built a simulated world of weather systems that would produce rain-on-snow floods in the same places and with the same frequency as the 13 years of historical data they used. Once they were sure that the simulation matched the historical patterns of snowpack, snowmelt, and other factors, they used it to build up a picture of how those kinds of events might change over the next 13 years. The model showed shifting patterns: areas that currently have a high risk of flooding will see a decrease, as precipitation will occur more frequently as rain than snow. But at higher elevations, where once there would have been snow falling on a snowpack, rising temperatures will now cause rain to fall on that snow. The Sierra Nevada, Canadian Rockies, and Colorado River headwaters saw the highest increases in risk, with floods twice as likely in some cases. Philip Mote, who studies climate-related snowpack change and wasn’t involved in this work, points out that the starting rate of floods might not be particularly high, so a doubling of the risk might not necessarily mean a region suddenly awash with floods. The shifting landscape will nonetheless demand a rethink of flood management—but for that, more data will be needed. Computational limits “Climate scientists like to look at [periods of] 30 years,” Musselman notes. But his team had to limit the time window because they were running into the limits of computational power available to them. “We’re up against this wall of computational demand to simulate all the physics that are involved,” he explains. The two 13-year simulations took up a year of NCAR supercomputer time, so they were also only able to look at one climate change scenario—the average of all 19 different climate models in a “business-as-usual” emissions scenario. Ideally, it would also be good to know what the projections look like under additional climate scenarios. The 13-year simulation is “OK if it’s treated carefully,” says Prof. Mote. “That’s a constraint if you’re running a 4km resolution over the whole of the US—that’s a whole heck of a lot of computing and data.” It does make things tricky for regions that have rare events that might be represented only a few times across 13 years, he explains: “The exact way those events change is probably less robust than if they had a 30- or 50-year simulation.” Opening the floodgates In anticipation of winter and spring rainfall, reservoir managers in many regions release large amounts of water in the fall, creating space to buffer the incoming deluge. “Reservoir managers follow tight rules,” Musselman explains. “They have guidelines based on historical data. The challenge is, as the climate changes, our rules and regulations aren’t adjusting accordingly.” The simulation suggests that the flood risk isn’t the only thing set to change—seasonal timing will change, too. In some regions, the highest risk is likely to shift from spring to winter; in others, from winter to spring. This means new rules both for providing flood buffers and for ensuring enough refill during dry periods. The current rules are “heavily focused on dates,” says Charles Luce, a hydrologist who studies water management. Changing the rules is complicated because of all the different people involved, but there’s already work underway to figure out how to update the rules in the face of climate change, he says. That work will likely be “looking to this paper for guidance.” The flood protection infrastructure itself also needs a look, says civil engineer Farshid Vahedifard : “Levees and dams need to be re-analyzed to see if they can safely withstand and handle this new pattern of flooding.” This is particularly crucial, he adds, since “most of these dams and levees are old, and a good percentage of them are currently operating under marginal conditions.” There’s still work to be done to turn this risk projection into useful information, though. “It’s the first step in a series of studies that aim to better understand the hydrology,” says Musselman. Future work will need to look at how this translates to a very local scale, including how factors like soil saturation and vegetation affect the risk of runoff becoming a flood. And ongoing observation of the real situation on the ground will also be essential. Hydrologist Wouter Berghuijs agrees with Mote that the simulations match what intuition would predict, but it’s “good to see it confirmed in harder numbers,” says Berghuijs. “These models are not perfect, and there are uncertainties associated with them,” he adds “That does not mean they don’t provide useful insights.” Nature Climate Change, 2018.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of people in the Georgetown, South Carolina, area were urged to evacuate their homes on Tuesday as rainwater unleashed by Hurricane Florence surged down rivers, threatening to submerge some neighborhoods under 10 feet of water. Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers, was largely spared the initial fury of Florence, which came ashore on Sept. 14 as a Category 1 hurricane, killing 46 people in three states. But the port city of more than 9,000 stands in the path of what the National Weather Service has said could be significant flooding as water dumped by the storm system drains to the ocean. “We are urging people to take this event seriously. We expect the flooding to be worse than Hurricane Matthew a couple years ago,” said Randy Akers, deputy public information officer for Georgetown County. “We always urge people to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” Akers said between 6,000 and 8,000 people have been exhorted to leave, but it was not clear how many had done so as of Tuesday evening. He said the county lacked authority to mandate evacuations. “We do have some concerns that people are not taking this event as seriously as they should,” he said. Parts of Georgetown could be submerged in up to 10 feet (3 meters) of water in the coming days as the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers overrun their banks, the National Weather Service said, adding that the deluge threatened to cut off highways and isolate communities. COAL ASH POND COULD FLOOD In neighboring Conway County, the Waccamaw, which was already well above flood stage on Tuesday, could inundate a coal ash pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic ash, according to Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility. Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was forecast to crest on Thursday at 22 feet in Conway and at 21.2 feet in Georgetown, a representative with the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said. The potential flood zone encompasses roughly 3,500 homes in Georgetown, 37 miles (60 km) south of Myrtle Beach, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island where as many as 8,000 people live, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers said. Authorities warned residents in harm’s way with recorded telephone messages and home visits. The county opened two emergency shelters on Monday, and hotels in nearby Myrtle Beach were offering discounts to evacuees. Public schools were closed until further notice. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Monday that seven rivers in the southeast part of the state were at major flood stages and three others at moderate flood stages.Meanwhile a new storm was brewing in the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Florence dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on Wilmington, North Carolina, alone. Insured losses from Hurricane Florence will range from $2.8 billion to $5 billion, according to RMS, a risk modeling and analytics firm.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Marina Zurkow, an environmental artist and professor at New York University, embarked on designing a set of climate change-themed emojis, every little detail was intentional. She didn’t hold back one bit. Released in October, the current Climoji sticker set, available for Apple and Android users, paints a pretty grim picture of what climate change looks like. The set includes emojis of dying, starved animals, pollution, extreme weather, and even drowning people—not exactly a hopeful outlook, but that was kind of the point, said Zurkow. “We felt like one of the big problems is people don’t call climate change what it is,” Zurkow told Earther. “People don’t connect to the outcomes of a lot of anthropogenic destruction that we all participate in a really everyday way. ” Some of these outcomes aren’t far off. Climate change is already threatening more than 700 species of mammals and birds, so the dead penguins and starving polar bears emojis make sense. The world also got a taste last year of what flooding will look like under climate change: in Houston, in Florida, in Puerto Rico, and across South Asia. People are dying due to floods today, and climate change will threaten tens of millions more in the next few decades as river flooding risk and sea level rise worsens. The woke, racially observant eye (like mine) will notice a subtle—but key!—difference among Climoji’s cartoon characters. Four people are included, all of whom are dealing with some sort of flooding scenario. One, however, is sitting on a lifeboat, visibly startled but safe. The other three are either drowning or about to. Guess which one is white? You got it: The lady on the boat, who is most likely to survive. “Sometimes solutions can put us back to sleep.” Zurkow was grateful when I brought this up. No one else had asked her about it yet, and it was no coincidence. “Skin tones were not subconscious,” she said. “It’s not an accident that people who are saved in boats are not brown.” These emojis, a form of climate art, mirror the realities of today. The majority of people who die due to natural disasters live in predominantly non-white, low-income countries, according to a United Nations report from 2015 that looked at 20 years worth of data. Storms were the most deadly killers, claiming 242,000 lives between 1995 and 2015. South Asia accounted for 80 percent of those deaths. The set’s frank (and grim) pictures may seem depressing, but they serve a purpose of helping people “practice being awake to the problems around us.” As Zurkow put it, “sometimes solutions can put us back to sleep.” She and the rest of the team who helped put Climoji together aren’t necessarily trying to solve climate change through these emojis. They’re trying to start a conversation. They want the words “climate change” to become more a part of our everyday language. They do hope to launch a second emoji set once they secure funding—cartoons with a more hopeful tone. That set would include things like solar panels, windmills, reusable bags, electric cars, and recycling bins. Zurkow doesn’t want users—of which there are currently only about 350—to confuse these for solutions, though. “I don’t believe that any of these are solutions,” she told Earther. “They’re responses to produce a more resilient society.” A societal change, a shift in consciousness, is what’s needed to actually solve climate change. But emojis can’t do all that. Can they? Who knows. They certainly don’t hurt, though, especially as people struggle to understand the role they play in climate change. Only 52 percent of Americans believe humans are driving this global crisis. They need to get woke—and quick—because climate change ain’t waiting for no one.","When Marina Zurkow, an environmental artist and professor at New York University, embarked on designing a set of climate change-themed emojis, every little detail was intentional.

Associated Press,"BERLIN (AP) — Global warming will increase the risk of river flooding over the coming decades, endangering millions more people around the world, according to a study published Thursday. Using computer simulations, researchers in Germany examined the impact of changing rainfall patterns by region and found that flood defenses will need to be improved particularly in the United States, parts of India and Africa, Indonesia and Central Europe. River floods are already one of the most widespread and damaging forms of natural disasters worldwide. Additional protective measures include enhancing dykes, better river management, improving building standards and even moving settlements, according to the study published in the journal Science Advances. The number of people affected by the worst 10 percent of river flooding will double from 76 million to 156 million in Asia alone by 2040, said the authors at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. In North America the number of people at risk could increase tenfold, from 100,000 to a million. ""The real numbers might be even higher in the future as population growth and further urbanization is not taken into account,"" they said. Researchers said even in developed countries with good infrastructure the need for adaptation is big. They also warned that the risk of rivers flooding will rise regardless of current efforts to curb climate change because of greenhouse gases already emitted in past decades. Still, a failure to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.7 Fahrenheit) may result in changes to river flooding patterns that populations can't adapt to, the authors said. ""The time has come where mitigating future climate change must be accompanied by adapting to the climate change that we already caused,"" said Anders Levermann, one of the study's authors.","BERLIN (AP) — Global warming will increase the risk of river flooding over the coming decades, endangering millions more people around the world, according to a study published Thursday.",2018-01-11T15:46:00Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}","Global warming puts millions at risk from river floods, study shows",http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/01/11/global-warming-puts-millions-at-risk-from-river-floods-study-shows.html,http://www.foxnews.com//a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/science/2018/01/11/global-warming-puts-millions-at-risk-from-river-floods-study-shows/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1515686094940.jpg?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,River floods,1

Erin VanDyke,"The Pathfinder, the first NASA rover mission on Mars, has imaged an ancient Mars sea edges about 22 years ago, in 1997. That, according to a new study conducted by Planetary Science Institute Senior Scientist Alexis Rodriguez.
The edges of an ancient Mars sea, where the Pathfinder landing took place, was the same region of the planet from where the sediments and catastrophic subsurface floods were released. According to the lead author of “The 1997 Mars Pathfinder Spacecraft Landing Site: Spillover Deposits from an Early Mars Inland Sea,” Alexis Rodriguez, that mission could have been transformed into finding evidence of Martian life. The paper appeared in Nature Scientific Reports.
The Mariner 9 spacecraft, about fifty years ago, has returned to Earth with images of some of the most extensive river canals in the Solar System. The orbital observations of the gigantic channels were seen by scientists as suggestions that cataclysmic floods caused them about 3.4 billion years ago.
The first NASA Mars rover explored an ancient Mars sea edges in 1997
NASA deployed the Sojourner, its first Martian rover, part of the Pathfinder mission, in order to test the Martian mega-flood hypothesis in 1997. NASA spent about $280 million on that mission, including the operations needed for it and the launch vehicle.
“Our paper shows a basin, with roughly the surface area of California, that separates most of the gigantic Martian channels from the Pathfinder landing site. Debris or lava flows would have filled the basin before reaching the Pathfinder landing site. The very existence of the basin requires cataclysmic floods as the channels’ primary formational mechanism” said Rodriguez.
“The basin is covered by sedimentary deposits with a distribution that precisely matches the inferred extent of inundation from potential catastrophic floods, which would have formed an inland sea. This ancient Mars sea is approximately 250 kilometers upstream from the Pathfinder landing site, an observation that reframes its paleo-geographic setting as part of a marine spillway, which formed a land barrier separating the inland sea and a northern ocean,” explained Alexis Rodriguez.
Erin VanDyke lives on her family farm and has more than 35 years of hands-on experience with the use of livestock guard dogs for predator control. On their farm, Jan and her family use corgis as herding dogs and have raised Shetland sheep, Fainting goats, Morgan and Trakehner horses, and historic breeds of chickens and turkeys. Erin is also an active beekeeper.","Ancient Mars Sea Edges Explored In 1997 By The First NASA Mars Rover Canadian Homesteading In 1997, NASA's Pathfinder Mission Unknowingly Landed Near the Shores of a Ancient Martian Sea Gizmodo This is Opportunity last view from Mars ZME Science The sad reaso…",2019-03-16T08:09:19Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Canadianhomesteading.ca'}",Ancient Mars Sea Edges Explored In 1997 By The First NASA Mars Rover - Canadian Homesteading,https://canadianhomesteading.ca/science/ancient-mars-sea-edges-explored-in-1997-by-the-first-nasa-mars-rover/8908,https://i1.wp.com/canadianhomesteading.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ancient-mars-sea-edges-explored-in-1997-by-first-nasa-mars-rover.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,,Canadianhomesteading.ca,River floods,1

Parts of southern Africa have been left devastated after Cyclone Idai swept through Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands more have been affected. Even though the cyclone hit Mozambique over a week ago, aid agencies are warning that the disaster is getting worse. Here are three reasons why:
1. More floods
The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday 14 March, and the subsequent flood submerged much of the city. 
But aid agencies warn that other areas continue to be at risk of becoming submerged. 
That's because it is still raining.
Two rivers, including the Buzi, burst their banks after rain in Zimbabwe and Malawi at the weekend, sending even more torrents of water into Mozambique.
And more rivers risk bursting their banks, says Rotafina Donco, Oxfam programme manager in Mozambique.
She told BBC Newsday that this rain was affecting most of the rivers in Mozambique that flow into the Indian Ocean. 
She said she expected more casualties. 
As late as Tuesday, she received information that people in Manica province, near the Zimbabwean border, much further inland from the epicentre of the crisis, Beira, were stranded on rooftops because one of the rivers had burst and the area had become submerged. 
In Mozambique waters are expected to rise by up to eight metres, putting at least 350,000 people at risk, says the Disaster Emergencies Committee (DEC).
A similar situation is playing out in Zimbabwe. 
Herve Verhoosel, spokesperson for the UN World Food Programme said in a statement that heavy rains in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces continue to cause massive destruction. 
The Marowanyati dam in Buhera, Manicaland has overflowed, raising river levels, he added.
2. Cholera
An outbreak of cholera could lead to the death toll increasing exponentially. 
Cholera is spread through human waste in the water supply. 
The flood water itself isn't the primary risk. Instead the risk comes because the existing drinking water supplies having been damaged by the flooding. 
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 Water supplies have been cut in Beira since the cyclone hit
This means people are finding it harder to find safe water. Larger groups of people are also sharing the same water supply, which increases the risk of cholera spreading quickly. 
""It's bound to rear its head at some point,"" says Paolo Cernuschi, Zimbabwe Country Director at the International Rescue Committee.
But that doesn't mean inevitable disaster. 
That's because cholera is relatively easy to contain when there is good healthcare available - people just need rehydration salts and to be put on an IV drip, he says. 
So, Mr Cernuschi says, there is the ""race against time"" to get the healthcare all set up before an outbreak happens.
More on Cyclone Idai: 
The worst-case scenario is that cholera breaks out in an area that is inaccessible, where there is no health care and spreads, Mr Cernuschi, said. 
Currently an area his organisation is finding it difficult to access is Zimbabwe's south-eastern town of Chimanimani - making it difficult to tell whether cholera has already begun to spread. 
Other waterborne diseases like typhoid and malaria also pose a risk, Mr Cernuschi says. 
Malaria in particular is likely to spread because the aftermath of the flood there is an increase in stagnant water - the preferred breeding ground of mosquitoes that spread malaria. 
Standing water also creates a risk of diarrheal diseases, Christian Lindmeier of the WHO told Newsday. 
Even though there is water everywhere it is not safe enough to drink.

Access to safe water is vital to prevent any further disease, says Mr Lindmeier.
Relief efforts need to deliver clean water or water purification tablets.
And that's the issue. 
""Getting there is the biggest challenge,"" he says.
The floods have cut off land routes and the only way to get to people is by air or water. 
3. Starvation
While people may make it through the next few weeks with the energy biscuits and water purification tablets that are currently being airdropped, a more long-term threat of starvation still looms.
Mr Cernuschi explains that the cyclone has compounded a crisis that was already there. 
He says drought in parts of Zimbabwe had already written off an estimated 75% of crops in the areas affected by the cyclone.
""Whatever crops that were being grown despite the drought have now been destroyed in the floods,"" he says.
He warns of a food insecurity crisis in the next six to 12 months - when people will face starvation as a result of the cyclone destroying their crops. 
As for the country that is worst hit by the cyclone, Mozambique, a total of 600,000 people are believed to be in need of help, writes Andre Vornic from the World Food Programme.

Max Golembo,"Some of the worst Midwest flooding in decades, which has claimed at least three lives, is continuing across the central U.S., from the Dakotas all the way to eastern Illinois.
The Missouri River in Nebraska is finally receding, but downstream the river is rising -- especially in St. Joseph, Missouri, and Atchison, Kansas. The flooding there could surpass what the region experienced in 2011, which was the worst since 1993.

Naomi Grosman,"Before the spring of 2011, Clifford Anderson’s home in Pinaymootang First Nation, Manitoba, was surrounded by greenery. The yard had towering elm trees reaching as high as 40 feet that he and his wife Terry had planted when their sons, Stephan, 34, and Evan, 27, were kids. Theirs was the sort of garden that would make any property feel like home and the Andersons worked hard to maintain it. Seven years later the house that the Andersons had called home since the 1980s stands abandoned and uninhabitable. The Andersons’ life was uprooted that spring when one of the worst floods in the province’s history forced the family to evacuate. Anderson, 59, was born and raised in Pinaymootang, about 200 kilometres north of Winnipeg, a reserve located on the banks of the Fairford River, between Lake Manitoba and Lake St. Martin. “In 1982 we got a house, one of the better ones, built off the reserve and delivered to our site,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “We had a full basement — not too many houses have that kind of basement — and in the basement we built a rec room with a big-screen television. That is where our boys had their stuff, games and everything.” In the spring of 2011, Pinaymootang and nearby reserves Little Saskatchewan, Lake St. Martin, and Dauphin River First Nations were flooded, displacing more than 7,000 people, mostly from the First Nations communities. As part of a class-action settlement, the Manitoba and federal governments agreed to pay $90 million to the four First Nations communities affected by the flood. The Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench approved the settlement on Jan. 12, 2018, which will be distributed among claimants who come forward. The settlement is compensation for disruption costs accrued by the plaintiffs due to the flood. But the situation for Anderson, and others affected by the flood, is far from settled. One of the terms of the settlement is that the federal and Manitoba governments do not admit wrongdoing. But Anderson maintains that the government’s flood mitigation actions, mainly its control of dams and water diversion decisions, saved some communities while sacrificing others. “We never heard about [the water controls] or were consulted,” Anderson said. “Nobody told us how much water was going to come through.” Heavy rains started falling in April 2011, dousing the east end of Pinaymootang, causing water levels of the Fairford River to rise. On a normal day the part of the river that runs through the reserve is about 180 metres wide. At the flood’s peak it was more than 1.6 kilometres wide and would eventually flood 25 homes, just in Pinaymootang, including Anderson’s. The water levels rose slowly but steadily. There was no evacuation order so the Anderson family relied on common sense and left when it became clear it was absolutely necessary. “We had to leave when there was water in the basement,” Anderson said. “The sump pump was running to get the water out but eventually we started getting sick, getting nosebleeds and headaches, and moved into the trailer we had.” When the Andersons left their home that June it didn’t occur to them they were leaving for good so they packed only the essentials. Some clothes, about one suitcase each, but not much else. They didn’t even take winter clothes (winter temperatures in Pinaymootang easily dip below -20 degrees Celsius) because they thought they would return by the end of the summer. “We didn’t take anything. Our winter clothes are still hanging in the closet,” Anderson said. “The furniture is still there, the television is in the living room — we just left everything there. We didn’t think we would be away for seven years, we thought we were leaving for a short while, but it turns out it has been a bit longer than that.” A proud father, Anderson recalls his boys’ life accomplishments and laments how the water destroyed some prized family mementos, particularly Stephen and Evan’s high school graduation jackets they were given to celebrate the milestone. “I always try to teach them to be good kids — a rarity on the reserve,” Anderson said. “They never got in to trouble, never been to court, they don’t drink, smoke, or gamble, and did well in school. In the flood we also lost their graduation jackets which are still hanging in the closet but we can’t get to it.” By the winter of 2011 the magnitude of the floods and its repercussions became crystal clear — returning home was never going to be an option. That is when Anderson and his youngest brother decided to take action to see if they could get compensation for the disruption and what they had lost. Instead of relying on the reserve’s chiefs and councils for compensation, Anderson and his brother sought the advice of Winnipeg-based law firm Troniak Law. When the Troniak lawyers took on the case, it brought on Ontario-based class-action experts McKenzie Lake Lawyers. Residents of the neighbouring reserves caught wind of the Anderson brothers’ legal action and wanted to get involved. Eventually representatives from Little Saskatchewan, Lake St. Martin, and Dauphin River First Nations were included in the class-action lawsuit. (Troniak Law emphasized that this class-action case was initiated and directed by individual plaintiffs and is entirely separate from negotiations between the governments and the chiefs and councils of the four reserves.) The first meeting to discuss the lawsuit was called on Jan. 26, 2012, and the class-action suit was filed on April 3, 2012. “We didn’t want to have the meeting on the reserve, because right from day one my brother and I didn’t want this to be a political issue. We wanted to file this as individuals,” Anderson said. He added that, historically, people living on reserves often rely on their chiefs and councils for support. But Anderson wanted to get back what he had lost through self-determination. “There has been … that mentality that they have to get approval from somebody to do something but [my brother and I] talked about it and said nobody is going to do anything for us,” Anderson said. “We lost a lot personally. We lost our belongings and our chosen place on the reserve. My family had to practically start from scratch.” If the brothers had decided to go through the reserve band, the only compensation they could have received would have been for property losses — and nothing else. And it wasn’t just keeping their independence that was important but also settling the class-action lawsuit in an expedient manner. Anderson knows of lawsuits between bands and governments that have dragged on for decades. The $90 million settlement was reached within six years, in October 2017. But the amount isn’t close to the $950 million for which the plaintiffs originally asked. However, the lawyers’ original contingency fee of 25% was lowered to 15%. Eric Troniak, a consultant at Troniak Law Firm, said the government was caught off guard with the amount of water that spring and that showed in the lack of preparation, including inaccurate weather forecasting. Troniak emphasized that the government’s water control decisions — to divert the water from Winnipeg and Portage La Prairie — were tough but it had the legal right to do so. “The [Manitoba] government controls the dam and how to release the water,” Troniak said. “There was a conscious decision to divert the water [which led to] flooding the four First Nations communities.” He said the four reserves’ chiefs and councils and residents, have confirmed that very little notice of the water diversion decision was given to residents, leaving little time for evacuation or mitigation measures. “Nobody is disputing that [the government] didn’t have the right,” Troniak said. “We are not saying that they should have flooded Winnipeg and flooded other people out. But if you flood somebody, you adversely affect them, and dislocate them and destroy their life … you come to the table and negotiate and say, ‘We know you paid the price and we are going to compensate you for that’.” Which is ultimately what the government did. A Manitoba 2011 Flood Review Task Force report, published in 2013, found that the province provided adequate flood mitigation measures and worked effectively with rural municipalities, including First Nations. Troniak said the report’s findings do not match the sentiments of the flood victims he spoke with. “That is not what the First Nations feel and [of course] the government is going to come out and say they have that interpretation,” Troniak said. “They may feel that a phone call and giving 24 hours’ notice to put up a few sandbags is working effectively, but to me it’s not and not to most reasonable people — that was just their opinion.” Manitoba’s water woes are far from over. If anything, water is increasingly a problem for all Manitobans including the province’s First Nations. “There has been a lot of flooding after that,” Troniak said. “There are going to be many more of these [cases] in and outside of Manitoba — this is just the start of potentially more.” What if the province had allowed water to flow naturally that spring in 2011? What if flood victims were in Winnipeg and not First Nations communities? Legal action is not a potentiality for First Nations but all Manitobans in major flood events. “Just because people happen to be First Nations and live on reserves, should we wash our hands and [pretend] it doesn’t matter?” Troniak said. “This is about fairness and there are a lot of flood issues here that are coming to the fore.” Floods and other natural catastrophes don’t stop the passing of time. Houses flood, families lose everything, but life goes on. And Anderson experienced that first-hand. Once the Anderson family evacuated they still had jobs to go to and bills to pay. So the family settled temporarily in an RV at a campground just outside the reserve. The RV was an old one. It didn’t have air conditioning, had no stove, nor a fridge. Realizing that the family couldn’t stay in those living conditions long-term, especially during winter, the Andersons had to take out a loan to buy another RV, one that could house them more comfortably. And that’s how expenses due to the evacuation started adding up — the new RV alone cost $14,000. And as the years pass, the victims of the 2011 Manitoba flood age and their health deteriorates. One of Cliffords’s biggest regrets is that his mother Ruth will never see her home again. He is not just sorry his mother had to evacuate but that her last memory of her home was that of flooded property, not the home that had been in the family for generations. One day, after Ruth had evacuated, she returned to the area, which is when Clifford spotted her outside the house, crying. “I asked her why she was there and she said she wanted to see what it looked like but didn’t realize it was that bad — the house was sitting in a lake,” Clifford said. “Ever since she had to move out of the house it was stressful for her.” Ruth always talked about going back once the water receded but she died in March 2013 from a heart attack. Some victims, including Clifford’s mother and two of his sisters, have since died. These were factors in Clifford’s and his co-plaintiffs’ decision to agree to the settlement. “In the years since 2011 there have been a lot of people who have passed on because of health issues, and suicide and depression is really bad for some people,” Clifford said. “It’s not perfect — nothing ever is — and I don’t know what the ideal [settlement] amount would have been.” “Even though it took this time, I think it happened fairly fast. I knew we were never going to get the original amount but I can’t say I’m satisfied with what we got. When you divide this among the four reserves, it’s not very much.” Clifford and his wife have a new house back on the reserve and live close to their relatives. They have once again started to tend to their garden with the hopes of growing it to the stature of their previous one. But despite all of their losses, everything they had to go through due to the floods, they are the lucky ones. Because there are others who will never have the chance for a new beginning, whose last memories of their family homes are of abandoned property engulfed by water. ● Got a confidential tip?

Stephanie Pappas,"When record rains mingled with spring snowmelt in the lower Mississippi River Basin in April 2011, liquid disaster flowed southward and forced some hard choices: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blasted a hole in a levee in the river system to save the city of Cairo, Ill., from inundation—at the expense of more than 100,000 acres of farmland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in Memphis, where floodwaters lapped at historic Beale Street. Officials opened two spillways in Louisiana to protect New Orleans and Baton Rouge, sacrificing farms and coastal oyster beds. The crisis would ultimately cause $2.8 billion in damage, according to the Corps. And it is one of many recent examples of the way the restless river has pummeled surrounding communities. Unusual floods struck throughout the basin during winter 2015–16, and more swamped parts of Illinois, Arkansas and Missouri after torrential rains in 2017. Snowmelt swells the Mississippi every spring, but the river reached flood stage in Memphis a month earlier than usual in 2018 due to heavy February rains. Now a new study raises the possibility much of the effort humans have put into trying to control the mighty river has paradoxically made its large floods more destructive. The magnitude of so-called 100-year floods—massive inundations defined as having a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year—has increased 20 percent in the past five centuries on the lower Mississippi, researchers reported this month in Nature. The bulk of the increase has been in the last 150 years, when human engineering of the river has been most intense. “We’ve channelized the river, we’ve straightened it,” says Samuel Muñoz, lead author of the new study and an assistant professor of marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern University. “We’ve made the gradient steeper, and we’ve encased the river in concrete mats and lined it with levees.” The resulting physics is straightforward, Muñoz explains. With little leeway to meander and limited floodplain to spread over, the waters of the Mississippi in places are corralled into a relatively narrow chute, making peak flows higher than they would be otherwise. Muñoz and his colleagues estimate about 75 percent of the increase in 100-year-flood magnitude is due to river engineering, with the rest attributable to natural climate cycles. The study was not able to factor in the influence of anthropogenic climate change effects, though, leaving open the question of how much rising flood levels are driven by engineering and how much by a warming climate. MAGNIFIED FLOODS If left to its own devices, the Mississippi follows a sinuous and impermanent path. The river has “whipsawed” back and forth over the last 10,000 years, changing course when the sediment it deposits blocks its route, says Craig Colten, a geographer at Louisiana State University who was not involved in the new research. If not for Herculean human efforts, he says, the river would likely have switched its outlet during major flooding in 1973 and would empty into the Atchafalaya River—not the artificial route it now flows through before hitting the Gulf of Mexico. Human control of the Mississippi has caused obvious problems along the Louisiana coast. Damming upstream, for example, traps sediments that would otherwise build up the river's delta; this makes the coast more prone to rapid erosion. But a natural-running Mississippi would devastate much of the economic activity that depends on the river, says Clinton Willson, a civil engineer at L.S.U. who also was not part of the new study. The river is a crucial shipping route, Willson notes, and big barges could never navigate natural meanders. Since a historic flood tested the Corps’s nascent taming of the river in 1927, Colten says, the three overarching goals of river engineering have been to protect navigation, New Orleans and the petrochemical industry along the lower Mississippi’s banks. As much as humans have made over the Mississippi, there is a lack of understanding of how it behaved before we started mucking with it, Muñoz says. The oldest depth gauge records cover a mere 150 years, a period that started after human engineering began. Muñoz and his colleagues have attempted to extend this record back to roughly 1500 by sampling bottom sediments from three oxbow lakes in Mississippi and Louisiana. Oxbow lakes are former river channels that were cut off by sediment; they retain all the sands and silts the river carried when the now-lakes were still part of its main channel. Sediment layers left by floods stand out because faster flows carry and deposit larger grains of sediment, Muñoz says. To more precisely date floods that occurred before formal record-keeping began, the team also turned to another data source—trees. Certain types including oak show cellular-level damage when swamped, and which is visible in the trees’ growth rings, providing an annual record of when the river overflowed. The researchers also pulled in data from written records kept since the late 1800s. Taken together, their results showed 100-year floods in recent decades have been about 20 percent larger (in terms of cubic feet of water per second) than 100-year deluges 500 years ago. That increase in flood discharge, or the volume of water flowing past a given point, is “what hydrologists sometimes call ‘flood magnification,’” Muñoz says. “You’re taking what could have been a moderate event and turning it into a larger event.” Teasing apart the factors that magnified the floods has been the tough part of the new research. WHERE DOES CLIMATE CHANGE COME IN? Along with the infrastructure humans have added to the river since the 19th century, climate also affects flood severity. Two natural ocean-temperature cycles influence moisture in the Mississippi Basin, but the team’s modeling found these could explain only 25 percent of the increased flood magnitude. Human engineering explains the rest, Muñoz says. But that leaves out any role that global warming—and accompanying changes in precipitation—might be having on flood levels, says Scott St. George, a paleoclimatologist who wrote an editorial in Nature accompanying the new study. Some research has attempted to untangle these climate threads. A study led by Utah State University meteorologist Simon Wang, published in 2017 in Geophysical Research Letters, found the precipitation that caused major flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016 may have been 20 percent heavier than it would have been without warming that has occurred since 1985. A 2016 paper in Hydrology and Earth System Sciences showed warming over the past century has likely increased the chance of that flooding by a factor of at least 1.4. But how any global warming–fueled changes in precipitation affect flooding along the vast span of the Mississippi depends on when and where those changes happen, Wang says. Most of the river’s floods happen during spring when rains combine with snowmelt. So more or less spring rain or winter snow could affect flood levels. And where those precipitation changes occur—in the upper or lower Mississippi, for example—affects where the water enters the river, as well as which areas are likely to flood. Climate scientists are still trying to pick out these seasonal and regional precipitation trends. At the same time that rainfall patterns might be shifting, rising temperatures could be affecting evaporation from soils and transpiration of moisture from vegetation, St. George says, affecting how much water ultimately makes it into the river and its tributaries. Humans have also been impacting that influx of water through changes in land use and agricultural practices, he says. “I think [the new study’s] explanation is plausible—and it’s possible,” he adds. “But I think it’s also true that we need some more information to really sort out whether human modification—river engineering—is the only thing that may have pushed the Mississippi River floods to be more severe.” The uncertainty over these factors kept Muñoz and his colleagues from addressing the climate change question in this study, but he says they hope to do so in future work. One way to approach this, St. George says, is to look toward the upper reaches of the Mississippi, which are subject to less management. If flooding has increased significantly over long time periods on the river’s northern stretch, it would point to climate as the bigger driver, he notes, whereas minimal change would implicate river engineering. Whichever turns out to be the main culprit, the Mississippi’s levees, spillways and other human-made structures are not likely to go away anytime soon—particularly because there is still excess capacity to handle high water flows—Colten says. The Morganza Spillway in Pointe Coupee Parish, La., for example, has only been opened twice: once in 1973 and again in 2011. Until that excess capacity is exhausted, Colten says it is unlikely the state or the Corps will fundamentally alter their approach to the river. “Decisions about managing the river are very much a human undertaking,” he says. “We have to know the size, we have to know the hydrology and the physics of rivers, but…those decisions are financial and political and regional, and don’t have a lot to do with the science.”","Human meddling with the river is blamed for most of the rise in flood levels, but the role of climate remains unclear -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-04-10T10:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Taming the Mighty Mississippi May Have Caused Bigger Floods,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/taming-the-mighty-mississippi-may-have-caused-bigger-floods/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/6AB41048-9FEF-4A17-B4A149AF52C8B8C8_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,River floods,1
HAVEN DALEY and OLGA R. RODRIGUEZ / AP,"(GUERNEVILLE, Calif.) — A Northern California man was swept away by floodwaters and died trying to get to his home where three children were trapped, authorities said Thursday, as residents of two communities hundreds of miles to the south were marooned by the worst flooding there in more than 20 years.
The unidentified man was trying to walk from a barn to his home in Ferndale through up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water Wednesday evening when he was carried away by the fast-moving current, said Samantha Karges, a spokeswoman with the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office.
Two adults and a child tried to rescue the man, but their tractor stalled in the water. Deputies in a boat then rescued them and the three children from the home, Karges said.
The missing man’s body was found Thursday morning. He was the father of a 12-year-old trapped in the home with two children under 4, Karges said. She was not sure if all three children were related.
The low-lying rural area about 215 miles (473 kilometers) north of San Francisco is home to many dairy farms and was flooded when the Eel River went over its banks.
About 150 miles (330 kilometers) to the south in Sonoma County, floodwaters from the Russian River were receding after a two-day storm inundated the area. One National Weather Service station measured 20 inches of rain in 48 hours.
Guerneville and Monte Rio were cut off by the floodwaters that swamped the communities. About 2,000 homes, businesses and other structures were flooded by water up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) deep and about 3,500 people were under evacuation orders.
In addition, two wastewater treatment plants were not working, leading to concerns about sewage spills, said Briana Khan, a Sonoma County spokeswoman.
The Russian River in wine country north of San Francisco crested at more than 46 feet (14 meters) Wednesday night, Sonoma County officials said. The water was not expected to return to the river’s banks until late Thursday.
The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that officials received no calls for help overnight Wednesday from hundreds of people who stayed in their homes instead of heeding evacuation orders. No injuries or deaths in the area have been reported from the flooding.
The river frequently floods in rainy weather, but it had not reached this level in more than two decades.
In Guerneville, streets became seas of muddy brown water. Jeff Bridges, a hotel co-owner who is president of the Russian River Chamber of Commerce, spent Wednesday canoeing through town and gave a ride to a couple and their dog who were stranded in a low-lying apartment.
Five people whose homes were flooded were bunking down at his two-bedroom home.
“We saw quite a few fish swimming by my front porch,” he said.
Bridges said this flood was the fourth he’s experienced in 33 years, and the locals took the disaster calmly.
“It’s the price you pay to live in paradise,” he said. “Buffalo, New York, puts up with blizzards. Miami and Houston put up with hurricanes. … We have floods.”
However, Bridges said it will take weeks to clean up his R3 Hotel, as he has done in past floods. More than 8 feet of water inundated the 23-room business.
“Anything that’s been flooded, you’ve got to rip it out, sanitize everything … and rebuild,” he said.
“Everything’s fixable,” he added.

ABC News,"The Latest on a storm that has forced evacuations in California (all times local): 9:25 a.m. The National Weather Service has issued a flood advisory for southern Santa Barbara and western Ventura counties in California as a strong Pacific storm moves through. The weather service says rainfall rates with a band of rain at midmorning Wednesday have been close to a half-inch (1.14 centimeters) an hour and recent wildfire burn areas will likely experience mud and debris flows. During a January storm, Montecito on the south coast of Santa Barbara County was devastated by massive debris flows that killed 21 people and left two others missing. ——— 6:45 a.m. Rain from a powerful Pacific storm is falling across areas of central and southern California at risk of mudslides but there are no reports of problems like significant flooding or debris flows. The storm was being closely watched Wednesday in Santa Barbara County, where a January storm unleashed debris-laden flash floods that ravaged the community of Montecito, killing 21 people. County spokeswoman Suzanne Grimmesey says debris catch-basins that filled up in January were completely cleared and have so far been fully functioning in the current storm. Grimmesey says that forecasters expect rainfall to intensify through Wednesday morning. Many California communities are at risk of storm runoff damage because of large wildfires that have left barren landscapes. ——— 11:06 p.m. A powerful Pacific storm is moving across central and southern parts of California, drenching communities previously ravaged by wildfires and mudslides. Thousands of residents evacuated their homes ahead of the storm while others were waiting it out and hoping for the best. Late Tuesday, Los Angeles County authorities told thousands more to be ready to evacuate from neighborhoods in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, which have also been badly hit by wildfires. Many residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings.

(Photo: ERIC CABANIS, AFP/Getty Images) PARIS Flash floods tore through towns in southwest France, turning waterways into raging torrents that killed at least 13 people, nine of them in just one town, authorities said Monday. People had to be helicoptered to safety from the roofs of their homes as overnight storms dumped the equivalent of several months of rain in just a few hours. Worst hit was the town of Trebes, east of the medieval walled city of Carcassonne. The rains that swept in from the Mediterranean killed nine people there, Interior Ministry spokesman Frederic de Lanouvelle said. He told BFMTV that the floods in the Aude region also killed four other people in other locations, left one person missing and seriously injured five others. In the town of Villegailhenc, witness Ines Siguet said the waters rose so quickly that people were stranded on the roofs of their homes and had to be helicoptered to safety. She posted video of a ripped-up road where a bridge used to be, torn away by a flood torrent that cut the town in half. Theres nothing left. Theres just a hole, the 17-year-old resident told The Associated Press. It was very violent. Other roads also were flooded, leaving the town cut off, she said. Siguets school was shut down amid the destruction. Two people were killed in the town, according to the Aude regional government. Alain Thirion, the prefect of Aude, said some of the dead appeared to have been swept away by floodwaters. In the town of Conques-sur-Orbiel, the river rose by more than six meters (20 feet), he said.

Television images showed waters coursing through towns and villages, with cars stranded in the floods and piled up on top of each other like childrens toys. The French government rushed hundreds of rescue workers into the flood zone and helicopters buzzed overhead. Schools were closed and authorities were urging people to stay home.

Associated Press,"(ELLICOTT CITY, Md.) — Roaring flash floods struck a Maryland city Sunday that had been wracked by similar devastation two years ago, its main street turned into a raging river that reached the first floor of some buildings and swept away parked cars, authorities and witnesses say. News outlets showed photos and video of sudden and violent floodwaters surging down Main Street in Ellicott City, some 13 miles (20 kilometers) west of Baltimore. The community, set along the west bank of Maryland’s Patapsco River, was also stricken by deadly flash flooding in July 2016. This time, witnesses say, the flash flooding came with a roar of onrushing water amid a pelting rain that had soaked the region around Baltimore. After the floodwaters receded, emergency officials had no immediate reports of fatalities or injuries. But by nightfall first responders and rescue officials were still going through the muddied, damaged downtown, conducting safety checks and ensuring people evacuated. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who declared a state of emergency for the flooded community, traveled there late Sunday for a firsthand look at the destruction. Footage of Sunday’s flash flooding showed the seething floodwaters engulfing cars and pickup trucks. The Howard County Fire &amp; EMS agency tweeted that water was above the first floor of some buildings at the height of the disaster. Flash floods struck a Maryland community wracked by similar flooding in 2016, authorities said, and water rescues were being carried out as raging brown waters surged through the streets Sunday. (May 27) Some residents of Ellicott City told The Baltimore Sun the flooding appeared to be worse than the 2016 flooding that killed two people and destroyed local businesses. Jessica Ur, a server at Pure Wine Cafe on the city’s Main Street, told the paper she watched as gushing waters swept three or four parked cars down the street. She had been around the last time the area flooded, but said this time it appeared worse. “It’s significantly higher than it was before,” she told the newspaper, comparing the floodwaters to those of 2016. Some reported a blaring alarm had sounded. Others said they gathered in the second story of a building to anxiously watch the seething waters. One sight during the flood: a handmade, white flag hung from an upper story of a Main Street building bearing the letters SOS. “If you are trapped, we are coming,” the Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services tweeted at one point. It added that multiple rescues were carried out, and rescue swimmers were called in to help. The department also said swift water units from as far away as Northern Virginia were summoned. There were no reports of fatalities, said Howard County spokeswoman Karen Spicer. Meanwhile, some roads were also flooded in neighboring Baltimore County. A spokeswoman in Baltimore County said the fire department has received dozens of calls about cars stuck in high water and flooded basements. Ellicott City has been rebuilding since the 2016 flooding damaged and destroyed businesses. Local officials recently said that 96 percent of the businesses were back in operation and more than 20 new businesses had again opened in the Main Street area. Just two weeks ago, Hogan announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had awarded the state and county more than $1 million to pay for projects aimed at reducing the flood risk in areas around Main Street. On Sunday, officials opened a shelter at a community center in Ellicott City for the victims. The disaster came on a day when the National Weather Service said a flash flood warning had been issued for what it described as an “extremely dangerous situation.” A meteorologist said about 8 inches (20 centimeters) fell in Ellicott city in a 6-hour period.",There were no immediate reports of fatalities or injuries,2018-05-28T02:04:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A State of Emergency Has Been Declared as Flash Floods Strike a Maryland City,http://time.com/5292877/maryland-ellicott-flash-floods/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/8004.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,River floods,1

Aung Kaung Myat,"Large areas of Myanmar are struggling to cope in the aftermath of heavy monsoon floods that have killed at least 16 people, including 3 soldiers involved in rescue operations. According to the latest figures, more than 140,000 people in several states of the southeast Asian nation have been displaced and forced to seek shelter in one of 327 makeshift camps set up by the country’s National Natural Disaster Management Committee. Thousands of acres of farmland have been destroyed in low-lying, flood-hit areas. “All the grain in the barns has gone,” farmer Saw Lay Nge told TIME, with his village still surrounded by floodwaters. “The paddy fields are submerged.” He said that rescue teams had yet to reach his community. Several charity organizations and civil societies are engaged in rescue efforts but are having trouble penetrating remote regions. In a social media post, the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network said that communities in Karen State were suffering from a lack of shelter and a shortage of food supplies. Phyu Lei Lei Htun, director at the Myanmar’s Department of Disaster Management, told TIME that the country had been seeing more frequent flooding since 2015, when 181 people died in floods that hit almost the entire country. Saw Tha Phoe, a spokesperson for the environmental group Karen Rivers Watch, blamed long-term deforestation and climate change for the recent natural disasters. “In the past, floods occurred regularly but not as badly as they have this year. This year, it’s record-breaking.” He also expressed concern over state-sanctioned plans by Chinese enterprises to build hydroelectric dams along the Salween River. Such projects have been in the spotlight since last month’s dam collapse in neighboring Laos, killing at least 26 people and leaving thousands homeless, with scores still missing.",Officials told TIME that the country has been suffering from more severe flooding in recent years,2018-08-03T07:16:37Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Myanmar Struggles to Cope in the Aftermath of Catastrophic Floods,http://time.com/5357095/myanmar-floods-monsoon-burma/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-1007005752.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,River floods,1

Virtually the entire town is flooded and inaccessible except by boat. (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) GALIVANTS FERRY, S.C. – With muddy river water still washing over entire communities on Friday, eight days after Hurricane Florence slammed into land with nearly 3 feet of rain, new evacuation orders forced residents to flee to higher ground amid a sprawling disaster that’s beginning to feel like it will never end. At least 42 people have died, included an elderly man whose body was found in a pickup truck that had been submerged in South Carolina, and hundreds were forced from their homes as rivers kept swelling higher and higher. Leaders in the Carolinas warned residents not to get complacent as it became plain that additional horrors lie ahead before things get much better. “Although the winds are gone and the rain is not falling, the water is still there and the worst is still to come,” said South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. Speaking in Las Vegas, President Donald Trump said South Carolina is in for a “tough one” as flood waters continue to rise. “They got hit, but the big hit comes days later and it will be the biggest they’ve ever had,” said Trump, who visited North and South Carolina this week.

Rescuers wearing night-vision googles used helicopters, boats and big-wheeled military vehicles overnight to evacuate about 100 people from a southeastern North Carolina county where high water breached a levee and flooded a town. And in South Carolina, emergency managers ordered about 500 people to flee homes along the Lynches River. The National Weather Service said the river could reach record flood levels late Saturday or early Sunday. Shelters are open. In tiny Galivants Ferry, Audra Mauer said she lost her home two years ago when Hurricane Matthew hit and she’s losing it again to Florence. No improvements were made to the area after Matthew, she said, and a frustrated Mauer has no faith any will happen now. “They didn’t clean the ditches,” she said. “Same levee. Same dams. What have we been doing for two years? … Where did the money go to fix everything, to make the power lines stronger and to replace the poles?” About 25 miles (40 kilometers) nearer to the South Carolina coast, Kevin Tovornik was tearing soggy carpet out of the house he has owned for 20 years in Conway, where the Waccamaw River was still rising. Bridges are starting to close because of flooding, he said, and friends were struck in traffic for four hours trying to get through the town of 23,000 people. “This is ridiculous. This is the worst I’ve ever seen, and that includes hurricane evacuations,” Tovornik said. Roads also were a major problem in Wilmington, a city of 120,000 people still mostly cut off from the rest of North Carolina. A photograph posted by the state transportation agency showed flowing water and buckled asphalt on a highway that had been one of the few passable routes into the city, where officials have distributed food and water to residents. Along the Cape Fear River, David and Benetta White and their four children were given short notice to evacuate overnight when floodwaters came rushing on to their property. By the time they got loaded into their van, water was waist-high and they had to slog through a foul-smelling soup to get to a neighbor’s pickup. “We almost lost our lives, I’m here to tell you we did,” said White, whose family previously evacuated last Thursday as Florence approached as a hurricane from the Atlantic. The South Carolina governor estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion. In a letter he said the flooding will be the worst disaster in the state’s modern history. McMaster asked congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he knows the damage in his state will add up to billions of dollars, but said with the effects on the storm still being felt, there was no way to make a more accurate estimate. As environmental worries mount, Duke Energy said a dam containing a large lake at Wilmington power plant had been breached by floodwaters from Florence, and it was possible that coal ash from an adjacent dump was flowing into the Cape Fear River. Paige Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, said the company did not believe the breach at the L.V. Sutton Power Station posed a significant threat for increased flooding to nearby communities because the river is already running high. Something else could be a problem, though. The National Hurricane Center said it was monitoring four areas in the Atlantic for signs of a new tropical weather threat. One was off the coast of the Carolinas with a chance of drifting toward land. Greg Lovell has called his Hampstead, North Carolina, neighborhood home for 15 years, but only while battling floodwaters after Hurricane Florence has he met other members of his community facing the same struggles.

"USA TODAY, Christal Hayes, USA TODAY","One witness says water was coming in through the walls. Witnesses are describing the chaos in Ellicott City, Maryland, where torrential floods left downtown buildings heavily damaged and filled with mud on Sunday. (May 28) AP Rescue personnel examine damage on Main Street after a flash flood rushed through the historic town of Ellicott City, Md., on May 27, 2018. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE) ELLICOTT CITY, Md. — Jason Barnes watched helplessly as a torrential downpour fueled a fierce river winding through Ellicott City, waters pounding his toy shop and other businesses that had just started to rebound after an eerily similar flood in 2016. He watched as those trapped inside shops moved to the second floor as the waters rose, some shouting for help. And he watched as a street where he had parked washed out before his eyes, pieces of asphalt falling like breadcrumbs as the rapids grew stronger. Now, Barnes and other weary shop owners are grappling with a cruel reality: How could the unthinkable happen again Sunday night — a catastrophic flood — in just a short two years? And should they stay, rebuild and once again be ""Ellicott City strong""? “I honestly don’t know if we’re going to reopen. This is going to be a tough uphill battle not just for me, but for everyone because there are no more reserves, no more backup or savings,” Barnes said, noting he’d poured more than $100,000 into repairs after 2016. “Next year this might be a ghost town.” Tuesday, Barnes and other business owners and residents were getting their first glance at the devastation as crews took residents through the flood zone to grab belongings, cash registers and any other property they might need as workers try to render the area safe. Eddison Alexander Hermond, 39, a resident of nearby Severn and an active duty member of the Army National Guard, was still missing Tuesday after helping a woman in the raging waters.

But after Sunday’s storm, it has become apparent the so-called “thousand-year” storm might not be such a rare phenomenon, leaving the future of this quaint downtown up in the air and some shop owners questioning its safety. Barnes said as much as he loves the charming atmosphere of Ellicott, he doesn’t know whether the shops should be reopened to the public. Toy shop owner Jason Barnes doesn't know whether he will rebuild again after a second flood in two years in Ellicott City, Md. (Photo: Christal Hayes, USA TODAY) “We can’t keep losing people to this madness,” he said. “These floods go from inches to feet in the blink of an eye. No amount of detection or warnings are going to help. This area isn’t worth saving if it’s going to cost people’s lives.” He said the whole debacle was déjà vu. Barnes got stuck in the 2016 floods after water crashed through a door at his shop, All Time Toys. He ended up creating a human chain to save a woman stuck in a vehicle that was being carried away by water. Despite the devastation, Barnes and 96% of other businesses decided to stay and reopen. “Everyone knew they wanted to come back, but not just come back. They wanted to create a bigger and better Ellicott City,” he said. “And we did. We got there. It was coming back. It was strong, vibrant. We still needed more time, but it was there. There was new life sprouting up from that destruction.” The 2016 floods reshaped the community and it’s a familiar talking point among residents. The marquee at the historic Ellicott Theater still reads “EC Strong” — the motto that bonded the community after the last disaster. After the floods ravaged his family-run store, Antique Depot, two years ago, David Robeson and his family started shopping at many of the stores along Main Street they’d never been in before. It became more about supporting a network of family members rather than competing businesses. “We were all close before the floods, but man, after them we became like family,” he said. “I think that’s what makes this even worse because you’re not just sad and in shock for your own situation, you’re seeing what happened to everyone else, too.” The family spent more than a month shoveling out about a foot of dirt, debris and grime that flooded the basement of their store.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Violent storms across swathes of the Southeast have caused several deaths and caused major flooding this weekend, with landslides also reported in several areas. Rain in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee reached an astonishing one to one and a half feet, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli.
Per the Associated Press, a tornado in Columbus, Mississippi killed one woman in a house undergoing renovation, while a man in Knox County, Tennessee drowned after his vehicle was submerged in floodwaters. The tornado resulted in 12 other injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening, Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. told the AP. An additional death was reported in Craighead County, Arkansas, after a 76-year-old man and his vehicle was swept away by high water after seemingly driving around barricades, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Destruction in Columbus included damage at First Pentecostal Church that Rev. Steve Blaylock described as a total loss, while sheds and outbuildings in the citys east side were mostly demolished, the AP wrote. Used-car dealer Lee Lawrence said the storm demolished four buildings on his lot and blew out car windows, telling the AP it will be a start-over deal. I cant say it will come back better or stronger, but well come back.
The AP wrote:
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrences lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Some 300 river gauges across the Southeast remained above flood levels on Sunday, according to CNN.
Tennessees Knox County was put under a flash flood warning on Saturday afternoon, CNN reported, with the National Weather Service advising residents that this is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now. Amid the rising floodwaters, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Officials also implemented regional states of emergency in Alabama and Mississippi.
There were additional reports of rockslides wiping out part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, with all lanes covered by rocks, trees, and dirt. Construction engineer Ted Adams of the North Carolina Department of Transportations District 14 told the Citizen Times it was a small slide with rocks falling from a pretty high elevation, and when they were hitting the road, they were bouncing into the eastbound lanes. The road may be closed for up to a week, the paper wrote.
Mudslides in Chattanooga also wiped out a Subway retail location on Saturday morning. Per the Times Free Press, owner Owen Megahee closed the location on Friday after observing an adjacent hill seemed about to collapse.
If they had it open, and employees and customers had been in there, wed be talking about something much more serious, fire department spokesman Bruce Garner told the paper. People could have been hurt or killed for sure.
Nearby, the Dunlap Fire Department posted a video of rising floodwaters spilling well over the boundaries of a waterway on Saturday.
The city of Nashville broke a rainfall record, with its February the wettest in over a century, CNN reported. In Lynchburg, between Nashville and Chattanooga, the grounds of the Jack Daniels distillery were flooded, though employee Henry Feldhaus IV told CNN that all employees and stores of whiskey were safe.
While the storms are largely over, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said that many of the floods will not crest until later in the week as rains continue to drain into waterways. According to the AP, tens of thousands of Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia remained without electricity as of Sunday afternoon.

Annalee Newitz,"Enlarge / This Nilometer at Cairo is an ancient device that Egyptians used to measure Nile flooding, to predict the harvest and set tax levels. Scientists used historical data from Nileometers to see how volcanic eruptions affected Nile floods (and by extension, the health of the harvest). reader comments 1 From 305-30 BCE, ancient Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic Dynasty, a Greek family put in place after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt. Though Egypt's wealth and importance were legendary during this time, it was also a period of great civil unrest. Perhaps because they were being ruled by foreigners, the Egyptian people revolted against their leadership several times during the 200s, sparking civil wars. But now scientists believe these revolts may have broken out in part because of a chain reaction started by volcanoes halfway across the world. There's no doubt that the Egyptians were chafing under the yoke of their foreign monarchs. The days of the great pharaohs were over, and leaders from the north were replacing Egyptian culture with Greek gods and architecture. But why did the Egyptians' resentment boil over into open revolt sometimes and remain at a steady simmer otherwise? Historian Francis Ludlow of Trinity College, Ireland, and his colleagues believe that ash, dust, and other particles released by volcanoes during the 200s BCE caused temperatures to cool around the globe. Cooling resulted in less water evaporation, which meant less rain for northern Africa and, therefore, less flooding of the life-giving Nile River. Because the ancient Egyptians were a farming culture that lived and died by the harvest, the annual Nile flood was key to survival. Floods meant nutrient-rich waters fed the fields and everyone could eat. Nile levels were so important to the Egyptian economy that the government based tax amounts on readings from ""Nilometers,"" stone wells fed by the river where they could measure its height in cubits. If the levels were trending too high (destructive flooding) or too low (drought), taxes were scaled back to account for people's diminished fortunes. Years with low rainfall inevitably meant people wanted for more and had less to lose. Gripes with the government became full-scale rebellions, like the 20-year ""Theban revolt"" that started in 207 BCE and the ""Egyptian revolt"" against Ptolemy III between 245-238 BCE. Both came after periods of increased volcanic activity. Though many other factors were in play, there is an undeniable correlation between eruptions and rebellion against the Ptolemaic regime. The volcanic house of cards Ludlow and his colleagues gathered data for their hypothesis from a range of sources. They consulted the historical record to figure out when rebellions and unrest took place in Egypt. In addition, they measured social unrest by looking at when the Ptolemaic government issued new edicts, such as the famous Rosetta Stone (erected during the Great Revolt of 206-186 BCE), affirming the king's power over a restless population. The researchers did this under the assumption that the king would only need to issue such edicts if he felt his regime was threatened. Having established a chronology of uprisings, the researchers went volcano hunting. Volcanoes large enough to affect the climate also leave behind a telltale debris signature of volcanic sulfates in the ice of Greenland and Antarctica. By drilling out cores of ice from these areas, scientists can reconstruct when an eruption took place in the geological record. But could they be certain that these eruptions affected Nile flooding? To answer this question, the researchers returned again to the historical record, observing that eruptions in the 20th century had reduced Nile floods. Another treasure trove of data came from careful records of flood levels measured by keepers of the Islamic Nilometer between 622–1902 CE. By analyzing this data, Ludlow and his colleagues were able to model how much a given eruption would affect the Nile's annual flood cycle. The researchers found a clear connection between volcanic aerosol levels in the atmosphere and weak Nile flooding. University of Hawaii classicist Robert Littman, who was not involved in the study, urged caution when looking at flood levels. He's studied Nilometers extensively and noted that fluctuations in the level of the Nile would have varied greatly from region to region. ""We have texts that say 16 cubits is the ideal level in Luxor. But in the north, in the delta, it's seven cubits."" So there's no guarantee that an eruption would have affected all areas in Egypt the same way. Littman added that we also can't discount political pressures, such as ongoing wars in Syria, as catalysts for revolt. Ludlow agreed with Littman that poor flood seasons were just one part cause for social unrest. He acknowledged the revolts were ""the result of many conditions that happened to coalesce at the right time—these include ethnic tensions, with some resentment bubbling away among the native Egyptian populace against the new Greek elites ruling Egypt after Alexander the Great's conquest, combined with... economic policies enacted by the Ptolemies, such as the decision to move to a great focus on free-threshing wheat—as opposed to other grains that were less vulnerable to drought—because this was the favorite bread grain in the Greek world and could be exported for greater profit."" But, he added, the low flood levels could be a tipping point. ""We frame the volcanic eruptions and the associated failures of the Nile summer floodwaters as triggers because their impact occurs suddenly without warning. There may be decades without a major volcanic eruption, but then one or more suddenly occurs,"" he explained via email. ""Another way of putting it is that you could consider ethic tensions and economic stress as a chronic contribution or cause, while the sudden and short-term shock from a volcanic eruption is an acute contribution of cause."" In other words, the already-troubled Egyptian polity was teetering on the brink. The abrupt reversal of fortunes caused by bad flood seasons pushed them over into armed rebellion. Climate and future social problems There are interesting exceptions. During the 40s and 30s BCE, Egypt suffered greatly from reduced flooding and its attendant perils like mass starvation, plague, and inflation. But Queen Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, managed to quell revolt. She did it, Ludlow said, by ""offering grain relief from state granaries and banning exports of grain."" Volcano-induced revolts were not inevitable. Good public policies could make up for environmental disasters. Ludlow and his colleagues say the climate history of the Nile offers a lesson to cities coping with disaster today. Yale environmental scientist and study co-author Jennifer Marlon noted that ""it is very rare in science and history to have such strong and detailed evidence documenting how societies responded to climatic shocks in the past."" UC Berkeley public policy professor Solomon Hsiang, who was not involved in the study, has spent most of his career showing correlations between natural disasters and long-term socio-economic problems. Over the past several years, he's worked with the Global Policy Lab to show that disasters caused by climate change, such as typhoons and wildfires, can lead to economic downturns from which nations may never recover. Still, speaking at a recent conference, Hsiang said these studies should make us hopeful. ""This is the first time in human history when we have the technology to look ahead at what might come down the road,"" he mused. ""In past societies, leaders relied on fortune tellers to make decisions. We have data and science and analytics that allow us to see what's coming more clearly. So we can make informed decisions.""

Storm Tembin brought flash flooding and mudslides to parts of Mindanao island. Two towns badly hit were Tubod and Piagapo, where a number of homes were buried by boulders. Tembin, with winds of up to 80km/h (50 mph), has now passed across Mindanao and is heading over the southern tip of Palawan before moving further west. The Philippines suffers regularly from deadly tropical storms, although Mindanao is not often hit. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency tha there had been at least 19 deaths in the town. ""The river rose and most of the homes were swept away.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Officials say rivers in South Carolina could reach their highest levels by the end of this week or early next Two mental health patients have died when the police van they were being transported got caught in floodwaters in the US, police say. The two officers escorting the pair were eventually rescued. The patients' deaths bring the death toll from Storm Florence to 37. Thousands of homes and roadways in the region remain underwater less than a week after the storm made landfall. President Donald Trump arrived in North Carolina on Wednesday to survey damage. Mr Trump praised the response to the ""devastating"" storm by federal and local disaster officials at a news conference in North Carolina on Wednesday morning. ""Unfortunately, the money will be a lot, but it's going to come as fast as you need it,"" Mr Trump said. ""We're going to take care of everybody."" Mr Trump will be heading to South Carolina next. The storm's latest victims in South Carolina were identified as Wendy Wenton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, by the Marion County Coroner, US media report. The Horry County Sheriff's Department said in a statement that when the waters overtook the van, they rose too quickly for the pair to be saved. A high water team eventually rescued the two deputies who were escorting them. The deputies were able to climb atop the van as waters inundated the vehicle. ""Despite persistent and ongoing efforts, floodwater rose rapidly and the deputies were unable to open the doors to reach the individuals inside the van,"" the police statement said, according to the Greenville News. ""At this time, the recovery effort is ongoing, and the transportation vehicle cannot be removed due to rising waters and dangerous conditions.""

""Tonight's incident is a tragedy,"" Sheriff Phillip Thompson told the Greenville News. ""Just like you, we have questions we want answered. We are fully co-operating with the State Law Enforcement Division to support their investigation of this event."" The tragic incident occurred near the Little Pee Dee River, which continues to rise as water from upriver North Carolina makes its way into South Carolina's waterways. The Little Pee Dee has crested in some regions at over 46ft (14m) and its flooding has impacted town water supplies, officials say. Florence has claimed eight lives in South Carolina thus far, and flooding is expected to worsen later this week and into next. A long road to recovery Thousands of homes are still underwater in the Carolinas and thousands of families have had to be rescued from the floods. As of Wednesday, more than 3,000 people had been rescued in North Carolina and 20,000 federal and military personnel are supporting state efforts. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper called Florence ""a storm like no other"" during a news conference with Mr Trump and federal officials on Wednesday. ""We are a beacon in the South and we have weathered storms before in our state. But Mr President, we have never seen one like this. This one has been epic. It has been disastrous. It has been wide spread."" Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the government is pushing disaster survivor assistance teams into the Carolina. ""A disaster response like this takes all of us working together, not just the federal government,"" he said. ""This event's not over. The rivers are still cresting we still have a lot of work to do."" The president has promised to completely support the Carolinas' recovery efforts. ""We will be there 100%,"" he said.

""It’s hard to predict how that water is going to rise and how quickly it’s going to come,"" said Sgt. Paul Parizek, spokesman for Des Moines police. ""The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise."" For the near future, the heavy rain has ended across central Iowa, according to Kelsey Angle, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines. Between 3 to 8 inches of rain fell rapidly across the Des Moines metro Saturday, contributing to ""catastrophic flooding,"" Angle said. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street recorded the highest crest on record just over 19 feet, Angle said. Take a look from above as water spills over the banks of Walnut Creek in Windsor Heights. Rodney White and Michael Zamora, The Register The Saylorville Lake reservoir is forecast to crest at about 888 feet by next weekend — a depth that is above the lip of the concrete emergency spillway, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday. On Sunday, 20,500 cubic square feet was flowing out. ""We are not anticipating a flood release that is uncontrolled out of Saylorville,"" said Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie. Much of the Des Moines area got 6 to 7 inches of rain in less than three hours Saturday, and the flash flooding resulted in one death, rescues of people stranded in their vehicles, apartment evacuations and a house explosion in Urbandale. At least 100 people have been displaced, according to the American Red Cross. As of 9 a.m. on Sunday, the Saylorville Lake reservoir stands at 878.39 feet, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. It increased over 2 feet in the last 24 hours. Saylorville Lake reached 866.6 feet above sea level Tuesday afternoon, an increase of more than 15 feet in just five days. The top of the dam's spillway is at 884 feet; that figure can be increased to 890 feet with the use of pneumatic crest gates. When in use, the inflatable pneumatic crest gate pushes water back from the lake's spillway dam and allows engineers to keep channeling it through the dam's main gates. This helps control erosion on the spillway. Last Slide Next Slide Saylorville Lake hit a historic high level on July 11, 1993, when it crested at 892 feet above sea level. On June 12, 2008, the lake level rose to 891 feet above sea level. The most heavily damaged areas in the Des Moines area are along Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek in the metro, said A.J. Mumm, Polk County Emergency Management Director. The worst flooding damages are along the Fourmile Creek from East Douglas Avenue all the way to Pleasant Hill, until it meets the Des Moines River. Damage is along Walnut Creek through Urbandale, Clive, Windsor Heights and Des Moines. Walnut Creek flooded at record levels during Saturday's deluge. A little east of Clive, the creek at 63rd Street in Des Moines set a record when it crested at 11:45 p.m. at 19.08 feet. The previous high was 18.7 in 2015. ""We've seen truly historic crests on both of the waterways,"" Mumm said. Fleur Drive in Des Moines appears to be safe as of Sunday morning, but residents in the eastern side of town should use caution near the Fourmile Creek area, where numerous buildings were evacuated Sunday because of record flooding, said Chad Christensen, Des Moines Public Works flood systems engineer. How to deal with a flooded home: The latest forecast from the National Weather Service in Des Moines shows the Raccoon River cresting at 16.5 feet near Fleur Drive — just on the brink of when water comes on to the road. If no additional rain hits the metro, the road will not have to close, Christensen said. Public works is focusing its attention along the Fourmile Creek area, which was hit with 6 to 10 inches of rain along its base, Christensen said. Drivers are advised to stay away. Road damage has been reported along Second Avenue, where water peeled and displaced the asphalt. Birdland Drive and Prospect Road are also closed. The city closed the gate that’s a part of the Birdland levee across from Saylor Road as a precaution. It’s been all-hands-on-deck in the public works department as crews survey and fix damages since 8 p.m. Saturday, Christensen told the Register.

Diego Arguedas Ortiz,"Cecilia Tortajada recalls making her way down a long staircase and into of one of Japan’s engineering marvels, an enormous water tank that crowns Tokyo’s defences against flooding. When she finally reached the tank’s ground, she stood among the dozens of 500-tonne pillars supporting the ceiling. In the cavernous, shrine-like cistern, she felt humbled. “You find yourself being a tiny part of this humongous system,” recalls Tortajada, a water management expert at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy’s Institute of Water Policy, in Singapore. “You realise how well prepared Tokyo is.” If Japan is a pilgrimage destination for disaster and risk-management experts like her, this is one of its main temples. The floodwater cathedral hidden 22 meters underground is part of the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC), a 6.3 km long system of tunnels and towering cylindrical chambers that protect North Tokyo from flooding. In the past several decades, the Japanese capital perfected the art of coping with typhonic rains and moody rivers, and its intricate flood defence system is a global wonder. But the future seems uncertain as the climate changes and rain patterns shift. Tokyo’s battle with flooding stretches back through its history. The city sits on a plain crossed by five rowdy river systems and dozens of individual rivers that naturally swell each season. Intense urbanisation, rapid industrialisation and imprudent water extraction that caused some regions to sink have exacerbated the city’s vulnerability. View a stunning tour of the floodwater cathedral above “I don’t know who decided to set-up Tokyo there,” Tortajada, who’s worked in water management for over two decades, says only half-jokingly. Even if Japan has dealt with floods for centuries, Tokyo’s current system truly started to take shape in the post-war years. Typhoon Kathleen hit in 1947, destroying around 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people; one decade later Typhoon Kanogawa (also known as Ida) devastated the city when around 400mm of rain in a week. Streets, homes and businesses were inundated. Amidst the chaotic aftermath, the Japanese government stepped up its monetary commitment. “Even in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Japanese were recovering from the war, the government was investing 6-7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction,” explains Miki Inaoka, a disaster expert at the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Tokyo’s planners must be wary of serveral different kind of floods. If heavy rain falls upstream, maybe a river breaks it banks and inundates a centric neighbourhood downstream. Perhaps a downpour in the city overpowers that area’s drainage system or a high tide or tsunami could threaten the coastline. What if an earthquake destroys a dam or a levee? After decades of planning for these scenarios and non-stop construction, the Japanese capital now boasts dozens of dams, reservoirs and levees. Cut into the city’s ground, as you would with a birthday cake, and you will find an underground maze of tunnels alongside the subway lines and gas pipelines that criss-cross the city. You might also like: The $2 billion Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC) and its ‘floodwater cathedral’ is one of the capital’s most impressive engineering feats. Completed in 2006 after 13 years of works, it is the world’s largest diversion floodwater facility and the result of Tokyo’s continuous improvement efforts. “Japan is a country that believes in learning,”, says Tortajada, who visited the MAOUDC in 2017. “That makes it a very interesting case for study.” The Channel sucks in water from small- and mid-size rivers in Northern Tokyo and moves it to the bigger Edo River, which can handle the volume with more ease. Each of these tanks is big enough to accommodate a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty When one of these rivers overflows, the water falls to one of five enormous 70-meter tall cylindrical tanks spread across the Channel’s length. Each of these tanks is big enough to accommodate a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty and they are interconnected through a 6.3km long network of underground tunnels. As the water approaches the Edo River, the ‘floodwater cathedral’ Tortajada visited reduces its flow, so the pumps can push it to the river. A mental exercise can explain the potency of the Discharge Channel. Imagine a standard 25m pool, filled to the brim, connected to the 13,000 horse power pumps that release water from the Channel. If the pumps went on, if would only take them two to three seconds to empty the pool, as they can push 200 tons of water per second. “It’s like a science-fiction kind of facility,” says JICA’s Inaoka, whose job involves collaborating with experts from developing countries to share Japan’s expertise. Yet Inaoka also acknowledges that changing patterns in rainfall will challenge Tokyo’s infrastructure. Climate change makes it very hard to plan ahead, she says. Based on historical rainfall records, the city planning authorities designed Tokyo’s defences to withstand up to 50 millimetres of rain per hour, particularly in areas were people and property are concentrated. But what was considered normal fifty years ago is not anymore. As in other parts of the world, the number of days with heavy precipitation have increased in the past 30 years says the Japanese Meteorological Agency, a sign that patterns are changing. Some estimates suggest that over the 21st Century, rainfall in Japan could increase by 10%. In the summer, that number could go up to 19%. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Construction claims to be aware of these shifts and has raised the rainfall criteria in response. In at least three areas, projects are now built to withstand between 65 and 75mm of rain per hour. But experts like Nobukuyi Tsuchiya, former chief civil engineer of Tokyo’s Edogawa ward, say the authorities are lingering too long on discussing what to do. “Unfortunately, the flood control action in vision of climate change has not yet been established in Japan,” says Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Centre. In his 2014 book “Shuto Suibotsu” (‘Capital Submerged’), Tsuchiya warns that Tokyo is not prepared to deal with the downpours that could arrive with with global warming. On the low-lying areas of Tokyo, around 2.5 million people could be affected by flooding in the event of record-high tides and their fate should be a major planning priority, says the Japanese expert. Earlier in 2018, heavy rains in Western Japan killed hundreds of people and caused millions in economic damages as rivers burst their banks and overflowed. Were that to happen in Tokyo, Tsuchiya says, the city would be devastated. That risk is not unique to Tokyo. Major cities like New York, Shanghai and Bangkok will become increasingly vulnerable to floods and storms as a result of climate change and, like Japan’s capital, most showcase a mix of assessing options and slowly working to set up new defences. London’s climate change adaptation plan, for instance puts flooding as its number one threat, as one fifth of the city lies on the Thames river floodplain. The area is well-defended by embankments and the robust Thames Barrier east of the city, but planners believe there may come a time when those safeguards fail. Across the Atlantic, Miami is already battling rising sea level rise one street at a time. In Singapore, Cecilia Tortajada and other experts are working on how to protect the city-state from rising waters in the years to come. The local Building and Construction Authority (BCA) recently commissioned a study to inform the national framework for coastal protection and new measures are introduced yearly. But everyone is keeping an eye on Tokyo, trying to gauge how well it weathers the typhoons and summer downpours testing its shields. “If a country as prepared as Japan is suffering, and a city like Tokyo suffers, we should all be paying attention,” sighs Tortajada. -- Diego Arguedas Ortiz is a science and climate change reporter for BBC Future.

Christopher Weber / AP,"(LOS ANGELES) — The second storm in a week brought record-breaking rainfall to parched Los Angeles on Thursday, jamming traffic on Southern California highways and prompting evacuations in wildfire-scarred areas. A mudslide shut down Pacific Coast Highway and surrounding roads in and around Malibu neighborhoods charred by last month’s massive fire that destroyed hundreds of homes. Kirby Kotler and his neighbors spent days before the storm stacking 18,000 sandbags behind their homes along the highway. But when heavy rains arrived, mud, water and rocks blasted through the bags and across their properties. Kotler, who wielded water hoses to beat back the flames in November, used a tractor to keep the debris from entering his home. “Saving my house once again,” said Kotler, 57, a lifelong Malibu resident. “I’m more than a little concerned. If we get another blast of heavy rain there’ll be no stopping the hill from coming down.” Malibu officials reported no injuries and no major property damage. At Hollywood Burbank Airport, about 15 miles (33 kilometers) north of downtown Los Angeles, nobody was hurt when a Southwest Airlines plane from Oakland skidded off a wet runway as it landed. The plane came to a stop in a graded area designed to slow aircraft that overshoot the runway, the Federal Aviation Administration said. “As we landed, you could feel the brakes,” passenger Grant Palmer told KABC-TV. “Then I started noticing the plane going sideways.” Palmer said he was prepared to tuck into an emergency posture while his unflappable co-worker continued writing emails during the rough landing. Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California sorely need rainfall. Virtually the entire region is experiencing drought conditions, with portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties and areas along the Mexican border in extreme drought. The storm provided a big boost in and around Los Angeles. The downtown area set a new rainfall record for the day with 1.9 inches (4.8 centimeters) of rain, nearly double the previous record set in 1997, the National Weather Service reported. Normal monthly rainfall for December is only a bit more — 2.33 inches. While rain caused numerous accidents and backups on LA-area freeways, heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley. The hours-long shutdown along the key north-south route caused backups for miles. Motorists were urged to use caution on mountain passes, where up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) of snow was predicted at higher elevations. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for hundreds of homes in Trabuco Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains south of Los Angeles and Lake Elsinore neighborhoods in Riverside County. Both were burned in another massive wildfire earlier this year. Video showed a churning, muddy torrent full of tree trunks smashing down a bridge guardrail. In Orange County, flooding closed several schools. Floodwaters also submerged several cars in Costa Mesa and rain partially collapsed the roof of a commercial building in Irvine but no injuries were reported. A portion of southbound State Route 170 in Los Angeles was shut down after mud flowed onto the roadway. Firefighters rescued motorists from cars stuck in a flooded intersection in the city’s North Hollywood area. East of Los Angeles, a 13-car crash snarled the morning commute for several hours on a rainy freeway near Moreno Valley but caused only one minor injury, authorities said. Firefighters also rescued a man from the flood-swollen Los Angeles River in suburban La Habra. Storm waters in the concrete flood-control channel have swept away people in previous years.

Christopher Joyce,"Waves crash onto the beach near Brighton Pier in England, in January 2007. Gale force winds and heavy rain brought disruption to large parts of the country. Severe weather events like this one may be linked to more frequent fluctuations in the polar jet stream, according to a new study. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images A new study suggests that the polar jet stream has been fluctuating more than normal as it passes over the parts of the Northern Hemisphere, and that's affecting weather in Europe and North America. The jet stream is like a river of wind that circles the Northern Hemisphere continuously. That river meanders north and south along the way, however. When those meanders occur over the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, it can alter pressure systems and wind patterns at lower latitudes in Europe and North America. And that affects how warm or rainy it is on those continents. Researchers at the University of Arizona and the Swiss Federal Research Institute studied tree rings to get a fix on how widely and how often the jet stream meanders. Biologist Valerie Trouet took samples from four species of trees in Europe, including Scots pine, dating back to 1725. These revealed what kind of weather Europe had each year. And that helped them establish the normal pattern of the jet stream's fluctuations. What surprised the scientists was that the jet stream's meandering has become more frequent. ""Since 1960 we get more years when the jet is in an extreme position,"" Trouet says, either in its northernmost or southernmost position. She adds that this pattern of more frequent, extreme shifts north and south has never been seen before in her 290-year record. Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers say these more dramatic fluctuations may be responsible for some recent extreme weather events, not just in Europe, but also North America. ""Heat waves, droughts and floods affect people,"" says Trouet. These ""happen on top of already increasing temperatures and global warming — it's a double whammy."" In the U.S., she says, extreme summer heat in the Midwest is also associated with shifts in the jet stream. When these shifts occur as the jet passes over the Pacific Ocean, they affect warmth and dryness in California and the Southwest. While the researchers don't attribute these more dramatic shifts to any one phenomenon, some climate scientists have suggested that oceans warmed by climate change cause changes in the behavior of the jet stream.",A new study says unusual patterns of the polar jet stream circling the Northern Hemisphere may have led to dramatic weather in Europe and North America.,2018-01-12T21:54:07Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Scientists Say A Fluctuating Jet Stream May Be Causing Extreme Weather Events,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/12/577688119/scientists-say-a-fluctuating-jet-stream-may-be-causing-extreme-weather-events,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/12/brighton-pier-1_wide-60e093692a2126483035d3a8ec4477ac1d11f02e.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,River floods,1
Aria Bendix,"The population of Lagos, Nigeria, may be growing, but the city is also becoming more vulnerable to sea-level rise. 
 Hauser said Lagos is particularly susceptible to floods due to its low-lying terrain and location on a river delta. In 2016, researchers predicted that Lagos could see 260,000 deaths due to flooding in the next 10 years. 
 According to Rood, the increased frequency of flooding and extreme weather in cities like Lagos could make it difficult for the areas to recover after each event. 
 But both he and Hauser say the impacts of climate disasters can be mitigated with appropriate planning and infrastructure. 
 ""Your probability of getting into a car accident is relatively low for any given drive, yet we wear seat belts. In any given year, your probability of dying is relatively low, yet you buy life insurance,"" Hauser said.

Adele Peters,"Sitting on former swampland in a low-lying river delta, Bangkok has always flooded. In the 1800s, the majority of the population lived in floating homes and a Venice-like network of canals served as major streets; some of the land was used for farming. But as the area has grown into a sprawling megacity, canals have been filled to make way for development. Rice paddies and fruit plantations have been paved over. As there’s less room for water to go, floods have gotten worse. The problem is compounded by the fact that the city is slowly sinking, while sea levels rise. Climate change also makes heavy storms more common. At the center of the city, a new park is designed to help with flooding: In a major storm, the 11-acre park can hold nearly 1 million gallons of rainwater. “It floods in the rain garden rather than on the street,” says Kotchakorn Voraakhom, a landscape architect and founder of the urban design firm Landprocess, who designed the park for Chulalongkorn University, the city’s oldest university. Voraakhom is also a TED fellow. [Image: Landprocess] The park, called Chulalongkorn Centennial Park, slopes gently upward, creating a small hill in the otherwise flat city. Built on land owned by the university, the park is part of a plan to revitalize this area of central Bangkok. At the highest end, a museum is topped with a large green roof covered with native plants. When it rains, water filters down into three large storage tanks under the museum; in the dry season, the water can be used to irrigate the park. Rain also flows down through four wetlands in the park, where a series of plant-filled ponds help filter the water. At the lowest point in the park, water ends up in a small retention pond. When rainfall is light, the retention pond can contain all of the water. But in a heavier storm, the water can expand upward into the main lawn of the park. Next to the museum, the slightly concave lawn can hold more than 100,000 gallons of water. “This infrastructure is not about getting rid of flooding,” says Voraakhom. “It’s about living with flooding.” [Image: Landprocess] When the rest of the city floods–overwhelming the sewer system–the park can continue to hold the water. At the retention pond, a couple of stationary bicycles sit next to the water; as people ride for exercise, the bikes turn small wheels in the water, helping add oxygen to prevent the growth of algae. For people living in Bangkok, the park offers green space in a city that’s mostly concrete. Bangkok has only 3.3 square meters of green space per resident, versus 66 square meters per person in Singapore, or 23.1 square meters per New Yorker. “The surroundings of the park will become high-rises and many other developments in the future,” says Voraakhom. “But at least we have the opportunity to really open up this big concrete surface of the city to be a green public space.” Like other parks, it helps offset the urban heat island effect–the fact that paved-over cities suffer more in heat waves. On the busy street next to the park, some of the road space has become a bike lane and sidewalk. But the most critical function is the park’s ability to deal with floods that will become more frequent as climate change exacerbates both droughts and extreme rainfall in the area. It’s a shift from Bangkok’s usual thinking about parks. “It’s not so much about decoration,” says Voraakhom. “It’s about infrastructure that we need.” The city also needs other infrastructure. Voraakhom believes that the city should also restore some of the former canals. Bangkok plans to improve its system of drains, which are both inadequate and deluged with plastic trash. But it may need more land to absorb water directly, making up for the plantations and wetlands that have been replaced by condos and roads. As people experience the park, which was completed in 2017, Voraakhom believes that it will help build more support for similar green space throughout the city. Her firm recently completed another green roof on top of a local hospital, and a park for another local university (more than three times larger, at 36 acres) will be completed in 2019. She also founded Porous City Network, a social enterprise that is helping train young landscape architects to help climate-threatened cities throughout Southeast Asia become more resilient. She has been inspired by the Netherlands–another low-lying country, with designs like a public square and parking garage also designed to flood in storms –but also recognizes that Thailand and other developing countries don’t have the budget to address flooding in some of the ways that the Dutch have, such as a massive seawall. Patterns of rainfall and drought, along with sinking land, also vary depending on location, and designers will need to create local solutions. “There are patterns of climate change that I think each country needs to understand,” she says. “You can’t just buy technology and install it.”","Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn Centennial Park can hold a million gallons of rainwater to help control the city’s increasing floods.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Can one town’s solution to flooding be another town’s nemesis? The question goes to the heart of a long-running debate in suburban St. Louis, where a half-dozen communities along the lower Meramec River are grappling with the worst back-to-back floods in recent memory. One of the towns, Valley Park, has a high earthen levee protecting its downtown from rising water. It stayed dry during the epic Meramec floods of 2016 and 2017. The other towns have no levees, and twice they were inundated to the rooftops. Now, as the rebuilding of homes and businesses winds down, a debate over the future of flood risk—and how to defend against it—is stewing along the Meramec, just as it is on other rivers across the country. What is the best way to protect vulnerable communities from severe flooding when the rivers themselves are undergoing dramatic changes? And if one river community takes steps to reduce its flood risk, does it have a responsibility to make sure its solutions doesn’t negatively affect downstream neighbors? Nowhere is that discussion more relevant than on the Meramec, one of the longest free-flowing rivers in Missouri and the site of some of the worst river flooding in the United States over the last 25 years. Along its 220-mile path to the Mississippi, the Meramec drains 4,000 square miles of land from the Ozark highlands to the St. Louis suburbs. It takes on water from forests, farms, industrial sites, and commercial and residential developments. And like many American rivers, it has a checkered health history born of logging, farm runoff, industrial discharges and other ills associated with human development, particularly in its lower basin. Perhaps no symbol of human fouling of the lower Meramec lies just upstream and across the river from Valley Park, where the Peerless Park Landfill sprawls across part of the historic floodway, forming a terraced mini-mountain on the site of what used to be a drive-in theater. Environmentalists contend that the landfill itself has altered the Meramec’s flood profile. On most days of the year, the Meramec flows lazily to its confluence, drawing recreational boaters, tube riders and fishermen who catch bass and catfish from its brown-tinted water. But twice in less than two years—just before New Year’s Day 2016 and again in May 2017—the rain-swelled Meramec rose out of its banks and inundated riverside communities. Among them were the postcard towns of Eureka and Pacific, lying upstream, and the more urbanized suburbs of Fenton and Arnold, which anchor the lower reaches of the Meramec before it joins the Mississippi. Valley Park took a major hit from both storms. Its primary access from all directions—Interstate 44 running east-west and State Highway 141 running north-south—were completely submerged in floodwaters during the two events. The town was stranded from emergency personnel and utility crews. Valley Park city attorney Tim Engelmeyer remembers standing atop the town’s levee as the river crested in 2017, thinking he was watching the second of two biblical floods in just 16 months and wondering if, after more than 125 years of existence, Valley Park would finally succumb to the big one. “What I saw out there was a ridiculously high level of water, like nothing I’d ever looked at before,” Engelmeyer recalled. “It was bad, and it was horrible for every community on this river.” 46 feet of water, 5 deaths Yet while Valley Park takes comfort in the fact that its levee has twice held back historic flooding, other communities up and down the Meramec’s muddy banks face very different risks. “I was here for the floods of the early ’80s and the ’90s,” said Joe Maurath, a 40-year resident and alderman of the city of Fenton, just downstream from Valley Park. “And it’s just at a point now where what we’re seeing is unprecedented. The back-to-back floods [of 2016 and 2017] were unparalleled compared to what we’ve seen in the past.” Agencies charged with investigating flood disasters agree. A report by the U.S. Geological Survey summarizing the 2017 event revealed that the flooding resulted in five deaths in Missouri, while 53 counties were declared federal disaster areas by the Trump administration. At four flood gauges along the Meramec, the river broke century-old streamflow and peak stage records, including a whopping 46.1-foot crest at Eureka, Mo., more than 27 feet above flood stage. In the following months, the Federal Emergency Management Agency paid out $62 million in National Flood Insurance Program claims to Missourians affected by the 2017 floods, while an additional $18 million in low-interest loans and grants was awarded to homeowners, renters and businesses caught in harm’s way. Those kinds of statistics undergird a growing belief among many here that the Meramec is a more dangerous river than it used to be, even though it has experienced major flood events dating to the early 20th century, including a landmark flood in 1982. “It’s overwhelming,” Fenton resident Sue Haskins told the Army Corps of Engineers at a public meeting last November. “I have a small business out of my home.... We never had water for 25 years, and all of a sudden, we got water.” While state and federal officials have identified numerous factors driving the Meramec’s worsening flood profile—including increased rainfall intensity across the region due to climate change, the conversion of historic floodplains into impervious surfaces and backflow flooding from the Mississippi River during high water phases—other observers see a culprit at the river’s edge: the Valley Park levee. Completed in 2005 at a cost of $50 million, the levee is for some a source of consternation. It has helped to drive a wedge between flood control agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the communities the corps has pledged to protect from floods. That’s because floodwater that would normally flow to the outer reaches of the floodplain—including downtown Valley Park—is being displaced and redistributed to other areas. That can raise water levels on nearby properties. Robert Criss is among the most outspoken scientists on these risks. He’s a professor in Washington University in St. Louis’ Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and a national expert on river hydrogeology. In an interview at his campus office in St. Louis, Criss accused government agencies, including the Army Corps, of downplaying the substantial role that levees and other human-built structures play in flooding events. “Don’t let anyone tell you these big floods are about climate change,” he said. “It’s all about the constriction of rivers.” Criss acknowledged that on small to midsized rivers like the Meramec, a heavy rainfall can lead to flash flooding. But such floods usually rise and fall quickly, he said. The main reason that communities on the Meramec are experiencing more destructive floods, he said, is that levee district boards and other oversight agencies keep approving projects that channel the water with new control structures. “The game is that if you build a big levee and you declare to everyone that it protects against a 100-year flood, then you can allow all kinds of new development to happen behind it,” said Criss. “The problem is you’re not only walling off the river from people, you’re also walling it off from its natural floodplain,” he added. “It’s a no-brainer that all of that water is going to be shunted somewhere else, and where it’s going is to communities up and downstream.” ‘Nobody is surprised anymore’ Floodwater was pumped over the Valley Park levee into the Meramec River on Dec. 31, 2015. Patrick Evenson/Missouri Air National Guard/Flickr Not everyone sees it that way. Valley Park city officials and federal river managers, notably the Army Corps of Engineers, refute those claims. They say analyses of peak flow data on the Meramec, including during the two most recent floods, indicate that the Valley Park levee is not a factor behind worsening flood conditions. “This levee did not cause all of this destruction up and down the river,” Engelmeyer, the city attorney, said. “A biblical flood did.” Don Duncan, assistant chief of engineering and construction for the Army Corps’ St. Louis District office, also pushed back on the notion that Valley Park’s levee contributed to the severe flooding. “I’m sure you’re aware that anytime there’s a flood, someone wants to point a finger at why water got inside their home or business,” Duncan said. “After the last two Meramec floods, people latched on to the Valley Park levee and ran with it. They liked the fact that they had a scapegoat to point to.” But flooded neighbors and academics aren’t the only ones making the case about levees. The St. Louis-based Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, which represents environmental, recreational and hunting interests throughout the Mississippi and Missouri basins, has also taken a tough line on levees. The group points to environmental and economic concerns. David Stokes, the alliance’s executive director, said that since the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993, communities up and down the watershed have proposed an unprecedented number of new levees, often spurred by the promise of new development and associated tax revenue. “There has been a lot of argument back and forth about it, but we generally subscribe to the view of the scientists who have done a lot of work in this area,” Stokes said. “The bottom line is when you combine [levee building and floodplain development] with climate change and you get a couple of these horrendous rainstorms over a particular basin like the Meramec, nobody is surprised anymore by what’s happening out there.” Gerald Galloway, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Maryland and a retired Army brigadier general who spent decades analyzing the Mississippi River Basin for the Army Corps and other agencies, acknowledged that the pace of levee building has increased in Missouri and river communities across the country. So, too, he said, have the debates over the impacts of those structures in places like the Meramec. Galloway said he places a high degree of trust in the Army Corps’ analyses of river flows. But he acknowledged that some of the thorniest questions about flooding can only be answered with more comprehensive study of river basins. “Every year, the analysis gets better, our information inputs get better and we learn more and more about what’s happening out there,” he said. “But frankly, this is the type of debate that can go on and on and on.” Here’s his bottom line: “If you live on a river and your property is in a floodplain of some kind, you’re eventually going to get wet.” Even so, federal, state and local agencies are not standing still on the Meramec. The U.S. Geological Survey, in conjunction with the Army Corps, FEMA, the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and others, recently produced a new set of digital flood inundation maps spanning 16.7 miles of the Lower Meramec Basin, including Valley Park and Fenton. The simulations incorporate data from the New Year’s 2016 flood and should provide critical insights as river communities get more serious about disaster planning and flood mitigation. USGS has also initiated a second analysis, still in the planning phases, to determine how land-use change and development over the last 80 years have altered the conveyance of water through the lower part of the basin. “The big story we’re trying to tell is what’s happened over time,” said Paul Rydlund, surface water program manager at the USGS Missouri Water Science Center in Rolla. “We know anecdotally there has been a lot change in the basin since the early 1900s. Our target is looking at how all of that development has changed the way water moves through the floodway.” Meanwhile, the corps is working closely with Meramec communities to identify new strategies for getting people and properties out of harm’s way. One of these approaches involves drafting a new floodplain management plan for the lower basin to help guide land-use planning and development. Matt Jones of the Army Corps St. Louis District’s plan formulation section said a key focus of the new Meramec management plan will be on non-structural solutions to reduce flood risk, such as elevating homes, buying out high-risk properties, and working with municipalities to toughen zoning regulations and building codes. “It’s a way for us to really go to each community to tailor solutions and see what’s in their best interest,” he said. Residents are waiting for answers. Jeff Haase, who has lived on a hilltop subdivision near Arnold since 1993 and who walks regularly in the Meramec River bottom, said he has watched the river change over the last decade as more strip malls and subdivisions have been wedged into the floodplain. It has exacerbated stormwater runoff that has been a problem for years, he said. “If I were to ballpark it,” Haase said, “I’d say a hard rain flows down this hill at about 50 percent higher volume than it did when we came 25 years ago. All of this used to be farmland, and it was wooded over. Now, more and more of the higher areas are being developed.

Jessica Conditt,"With more data than ever and a rapidly evolving ecosystem, the Fourth National Climate Assessment lays out in clear, authoritative terms how humans are driving global warming, how its dangers are manifesting in our everyday lives, and how much worse it could become in the future. Here's how it begins: Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future -- but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. The report lays out a handful of current catastrophes caused by climate change, including drought in the Colorado River Basin and Nebraska, dying coral reefs off the coasts of Hawaii, heavy flooding in Louisiana, unprecedented rain damaging farms across the Midwest, massive fires in the Northwest, and hurricanes in Texas. All of these disasters were catalyzed by human-driven climate change. No question. However, Light and other experts are still struggling to convince some people that climate change is a reality. Some people, like the President of the United States. ""It's a sense of frustration that we continue to have to fight yesterday's battles over and over and over again,"" Light said. President Donald Trump denies climate change as a fact, consistently calling into question the science behind global warming and undermining the authority of researchers in the field. Under Trump, the US has withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement (an international accord to curtail global warming), dismantled the Clean Power Plan (an Obama-era mandate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants), and unwoven clean-air proposals handled by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Trump administration was congressionally mandated to release the Fourth National Climate Assessment, and it did so on Black Friday, a chaotic day of full-bore capitalism and post-Thanksgiving coma observed across the country. Many climate scientists saw this move as an attempt to bury the report. On top of that, Trump tweeted the following message on November 21st, two days before the report's publication: ""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?"" Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018 ""Which is a fundamental mistake,"" Light said. ""There's been decades of trying to educate people that there's a difference between climate and weather.... One can't help but feeling disheartened when the President of the United States, who has access to the hundreds of government scientists that produced this report -- this is his government. He has access to them and there isn't any reason he should be making mistakes like that."" The Fourth National Climate Assessment isn't designed to make policy recommendations, and it doesn't. It's a comprehensive, apolitical investigation of climate change backed by more than 300 scientists, and it's also a warning. If steps aren't taken to slow the effects of climate change, the US can expect bigger fires, heavier floods, more destructive hurricanes, and all of the negative social consequences that come with. The report describes the future as follows: Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities that result in higher exposure and sensitivity to extreme weather and climate-related events and other changes. Marginalized populations may also be affected disproportionately by actions to address the underlying causes and impacts of climate change, if they are not implemented under policies that consider existing inequalities. Unchecked, global warming poses dozens of threats to life on Earth, from rising sea levels and melting ice caps, to devastating drought, fire, famine and disease. Light called out a handful of real climate-change effects that are at the forefront of his mind, playing out right now: intense, long-lasting heat waves that pose a danger to people without access to air conditioning, and extreme rainfall making it more difficult for crops to grow in the Midwest. ""We can attribute the wider spread of certain kinds of diseases, especially tropical diseases and vector diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, toward changes in the climate,"" Light said. ""And this is a slowly but nonetheless increasingly unfolding public health crisis that is not terribly well acknowledged, but I think that all of us have to be more concerned about and we know will get worse as we move forward."" ""We don't have that leadership at the federal level right now."" While the federal government drags its feet on addressing climate change, states and cities are stepping up with clean-air protections of their own. For instance, the US is on track to uphold its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement, due in part to efforts by the United States Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 17 governors committed to seeing the accord through a reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. ""We can avoid the worst scenarios and impacts that we talk about in the report, but it is something that's going to require a lot of more effort,"" Light said. ""We've got great leadership coming out of California in particular, but also more than a dozen other states, hundreds of cities, thousands of businesses, but we don't have that leadership at the federal level right now. That's the part where we have a lot of improvement we can still do."" The Fourth National Climate Assessment is clear. It doesn't inject politics into its science, and it doesn't mince words -- even in the introduction, which closes as follows: [The Fourth National Climate Assessment] concludes that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising. These impacts are projected to intensify -- but how much they intensify will depend on actions taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the risks from climate change now and in the coming decades.","Hurricane Katrina claimed nearly 2,000 lives when it struck the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005, submerging New Orleans in floodwater and devastating the region for more than a decade.

Amber Jamieson,"The banks of the River Seine in Paris burst on Saturday, after days of heavy rains and rising floodwaters, submerging parts of the city's bridges and sidewalks. Over 650 people in the Paris region have been evacuated from their homes. The French flood agency Vigicures downgraded its flood estimates, saying it expected to reach a peak in the capital on Sunday morning of 19 feet and six inches (6 meters), which would be several inches less than the city's 2016 floods. Boat traffic, including tourist cruises, have been banned because of the floodwaters. Water engulfed restaurants and playgrounds along the Seine. A lower level of Paris' most famous museum, The Louvre, has been closed since Wednesday out of fear it may flood.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Deeper flooding loomed in the hours and days ahead from rivers in the Carolinas swollen by Tropical Depression Florence, which has killed 23 people, even if rain-weary residents got a brief glimpse of sunshine on Monday. The slow-moving storm, a hurricane when it hit the North Carolina coast, has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday, displacing thousands. The flooding could persist for several weeks in some areas. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by flood waters from the Cape Fear River on Monday. Further inland, the same river, running through Fayetteville, a city of 200,000, was expected to reach major flood levels later on Monday, and would not crest until Tuesday. Florence was headed through Virginia and toward New England and flash flood watches extended from Maryland through New York and southern New England. In the Carolinas, the National Weather Service continued to warn people the floods were worsening. “The worst is yet to come,” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, an NWS meteorologist. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately.” Major rivers are expected to remain flooded for the next two to three weeks, said Steve Goldstein, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration liaison to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The death toll from Florence, which came ashore in North Carolina on Friday, rose to 23 on Monday. The dead included a 1-year-old boy who was swept away from his mother as they tried to escape their car amid floodwaters. The woman had driven around barricades to get on a closed road, the sheriff’s office in Union County, near North Carolina’s border with South Carolina, said on Facebook. North Carolina officials reported 1,200 road closures, including a stretch of Interstate 95, a major transportation artery running the length of the U.S. East Coast. About 509,000 homes and businesses were without electricity on Monday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states. POWER OUTAGES, BLOCKED ROADS The sun appeared in some areas for the first time in days, allowing some people who had been forced to leave their homes to return home to assess damage. Eric Tryggeseth, 59, found his home in Leland, North Carolina, without power and with a tree lying in his front yard. He had been evacuated a day before by troops in a truck. “The floodwaters were rising so I figured I better get out of there,” he said. “I can’t thank the first responders enough.” There were currently 2,000 federal workers working on storm response, supporting state efforts, said Tom Fargione, FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer, during a press conference. Sean Adams, 29, a contractor from Leland, said his home suffered only minor damage but he had no idea when power might be restored. With so many roads in and out of the region flooded, he could not access supplies to help start rebuilding. “We really can’t get much done right now. It’s getting frustrating,” he said. The storm killed 17 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator.

"Daniel Cusick, Chelsea Harvey, E&E News","Low-lying communities from Minnesota to Missouri are bracing for what could be the Mississippi Basin’s worst flooding since 1993 as temperatures rise and rainstorms continue to track over areas with deep winter snowpack.
The weekend brought some of the worst flooding in decades to towns along the Missouri River and its tributaries in Nebraska and Iowa, killing two and forcing evacuations from communities south of Omaha, Neb.
By yesterday, the focus was shifting south and east toward Kansas City and then to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers north of St. Louis.
“We’re expecting some considerable impacts over the next few weeks,” said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative based in St. Louis. “This is going to test the limits of some of our member cities.”
Col. Doug Guttormsen, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City District, cautioned residents along the lower Missouri to be “very mindful of high water” and prepare to quickly evacuate if ordered by state and local emergency managers.
The Army Corps was also working with local levee districts on sandbagging and other temporary flood control measures along the river as far east as Alton, Ill. Officials reported at least nine levee breaches along the Missouri south of the Platte River and four breaches of nonfederal levees closer to Kansas City.
The National Weather Service said it expected the Missouri to crest later this week in St. Joseph, Mo., at the third-highest level ever recorded.
Hundreds of homes were flooded in Nebraska and Iowa as of yesterday afternoon, and many thousands of acres of corn and soybean fields are inundated with water, according to local media reports.
Much of the weekend flooding was attributed to the recent “bomb cyclone” that brought late-season snow, rain and hurricane-force winds to the Great Plains and Midwest. But weather experts say a second wave could come this week as 50-plus-degree temperatures extend into Minnesota and Wisconsin, melting what remains of the region’s record February snowfall.
NOAA reported earlier this month that the winter of 2018-19 was the wettest on record, and it was accompanied by marked swings in temperature.
Spring thaw and snowmelt are routine in the northern half of the country. But experts say the current flood crisis is exacerbated by several conditions occurring at once. Heavy rain is falling onto a dense layer of snow atop frozen ground. With little or no soil absorption, the water is forced to run off into streams and rivers.
Scientists say such events may become a greater concern with climate change, as rising average temperatures mean precipitation may fall more variably—as both rain or snow—over the northern half of the country. Climate projections also suggest that heavy precipitation events will become more severe in many places.
The 2014 installment of the National Climate Assessment cites the northern Great Plains as one region expected to see an increase in winter precipitation in the future. It notes that “increased snowfall, rapid spring warming, and intense rainfall can combine to produce devastating floods.”
Some scientists have suggested that climate change may affect major atmospheric circulation systems in ways that could affect weather patterns and severity. For example, some believe the jet stream is becoming prone to wider up-and-down fluctuations in its flow over time—and that these atmospheric changes may be linked to rapid warming in the Arctic.
A wavier jet stream could also cause an increase in severe weather events, like the bomb cyclone, or cause severe weather to linger in one place for longer periods, potentially causing more damage. Such ideas, though, remain a point of debate among climate scientists.
What is not debatable is the amount of water flowing south from the nation’s snow-covered regions into the middle of the country, where the Missouri, Ohio and other smaller river basins meet an already swollen Mississippi River.
While dozens of cities, large and small, face higher flood risk this spring along the Mississippi, Wellenkamp said the basin’s mayors have worked individually and collectively to better prepare for floods and to adapt to climate change risks. For instance, Dubuque, Iowa, and Grafton, Ill., have taken steps to restore large wetland areas in their cities’ floodplains to allow the river more room to swell during flood tides.
Mayors have also improved flood response coordination so that upstream communities don’t worsen conditions for cities downstream.
“Mayors up north are not dumping snow into the river the way they used to,” Wellenkamp said. “They are placing it outside the watershed.”
River communities have also become more engaged in relocating residents out of floodplains where they face much higher risks to life and property.
“After 1993, we started moving people out, and we’re still doing that today,” Wellenkamp said. “It’s very expensive, but the cost of rebuilding flooded homes is much higher.”

Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane, greatly diminished from the major hurricane it once was, drifted away from the Hawaiian coast on Saturday, but lingering showers threatened to trigger more flooding and landslides. The National Weather Service (NWS) lifted all remaining tropical storm warnings and watch advisories for Hawaii as trade winds finally began to nudge Lane off to the west. But a flash flood watch remained in effect for Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu and 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, through Sunday morning, emergency management officials said. Civil defence officials on the Big Island said more rain and flooding were also possible there, and a high-surf advisory was posted through the day for south- and east-facing shores of all the islands. Lane’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 50 miles (80 km) per hour, but residual moisture would produce excessive rainfall that could lead to “additional flash flooding and landslides,” a weather service bulletin said. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas one year ago Saturday, then stalled over the Gulf Coast as it drenched the region in rain for several days, causing devastating floods. BIG ISLAND BEARS BRUNT OF RAIN Ahead of Lane, Hawaii residents had spent days stocking up on food, water, gasoline and batteries and boarding up their windows. The island chain was spared the calamity of a direct hit from a major hurricane as the storm steadily weakened on Friday. However, by then torrential showers had drenched the windward side of Hawaii’s Big Island for more than two days, unleashing severe flooding and mudslides that forced multiple road closures and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and other structures, authorities said. At least two neighbourhoods around Hilo, the largest city on the Big Island, were evacuated on Friday, and emergency teams have rescued more than 50 people trapped by high water since Thursday, Hawaii County Civil Defence spokeswoman Kelly Wooten told Reuters by phone. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Rains finally abated on the Big Island on Saturday, she said. Hilo received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, would diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. By Saturday morning the water had receded enough that many residents of Hilo were mopping up several inches of mud. Jillane Bosscher, a 45-year-old chef, and her family spent Thursday night and Friday in a local shelter. By Saturday the water had receded enough that they were able to return home and start cleaning. In another sign of improving conditions, most harbours around the state were reopened or placed on “hurricane preparedness” status allowing shippers to resume operations with caution, a according to the state Transportation Department. On the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, evacuees have returned home from emergency shelters, and those facilities were being closed, local officials reported.

Zoe Szathmary,"California residents, brace yourselves: an atmospheric river could bring multiple inches of rain to central and southern parts of the state over the next few days. Read on for a look at the meteorological phenomeonon -- and what to expect from the storm. ""Rivers in the sky"" An atmospheric river is a huge plume of subtropical moisture. “Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says. “When the atmospheric rivers make landfall, they often release this water vapor in the form of rain or snow,” according to the agency. They may also bring severe precipitation and destruction, though “most are weak systems that often provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to the water supply.” The NOAA says atmospheric rivers are typically 250 to 375 miles in width. CALIFORNIA MUDSLIDES: WHERE AND WHY THEY HAPPEN What’s going on with California? The storm spread more rain across the state March 22, flooding streets and threatening to unleash mud and debris flows into communities near areas burned bare by wildfires. The National Weather Service (NWS) said there were numerous reports of street flooding in Fresno and Clovis. A flood warning was issued for areas east and south of Sacramento as rain caused the lower San Joaquin River system to rise along the western flank of the Sierra Nevada. In the south, the weather agency warned of potential flash floods as radar showed heavy rain falling near recent burn areas in coastal Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The storm came ashore earlier this week on the central coast and spread south into the Los Angeles region and north through San Francisco Bay. It also moved east into the central California interior and Sierra Nevada, where winter storm warnings for heavy snow were in effect. ""Sierra foothill burn scars could be at risk for debris flow under heavier rain this afternoon,"" the agency tweeted Thursday afternoon. ""Stay tuned and be prepared to leave the area if needed.""

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","Flooding is seen in Ellicott City, Maryland, on May 27 in this still image from video from social media. Two years ago, Ellicott City, Maryland, was hit by a debilitating flash flood that turns the town’s historic Main Street into a raging muddy river. Scientists said the July 2016 rainstorm was a once-in-a-thousand-year event. But on Sunday it happened again: 7 to 9 inches of rain fell in the area, 10 miles west of Baltimore, and another torrent swept cars and trees through town. More than 1,000 911 calls were recorded on Sunday afternoon, more than 300 residents were evacuated, and a National Guard sergeant died trying to rescue someone. This is outside right now. pic.twitter.com/IBeikcijKo — Max Robinson (@DieRobinsonDie) May 27, 2018 “This is worse,” said Howard County executive Allan Kittleman, compared with the 2016 storm, which caused tens of millions in damages and lost business. Ellicott City isn’t some post-war boomtown built inside a reservoir or a vacation community playing chicken with the ocean waves. It’s a 250-year-old river town, and like many river towns, it’s known flooding, chiefly from the rising waters of the Patapsco, the river at the foot of town that drains into Baltimore Harbor. But these past two storms—as well as September 2011 flooding from Tropical Storm Lee—have worked differently. Instead of the water rising from the river at the base of the town, it’s come roaring in down two tiny tributaries, the Tiber and the Hudson, which merge just before entering the Patapsco. According to a Baltimore Sun investigation, prior to 2011, it had been 60 years since runoff on the Tiber stream produced a flash flood. Now it has happened three times in seven years. It’s a reminder that heavy rain, rather than rising seas, may be the earliest severe consequence of climate change. We’ve prepared for it in the worst way possible. Between 1958 and 2012, according to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the amount of rain falling in “very heavy events”—those at the top 1 percent of all rainstorms—has risen by 27 percent in the Southeast, 37 percent in the Midwest, and a whopping 71 percent in the Northeast. The most extreme downpours are getting more extreme. (Coincidentally, this weekend also saw just the ninth classified storm to make landfall before hurricane season since 1851 when Alberto hit the Florida panhandle, and a virtually unprecedented Category 3 Tropical Cyclone in Oman.)

Unchecked sprawl has built a concrete funnel around Ellicott City. “All this natural vegetation that would act as sponges is being replaced by concrete and impervious surfaces,” explains Stephen Strader, a professor at Villanova who studies environmental risk. Nearly one-third of the Tiber–Hudson “sub-watershed” was covered by hard surfaces 10 years ago, according to the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and sprawling development hasn’t stopped since. The result, Strader says, is a flash-flood scenario more reminiscent of the American West, where naturally impervious land creates the conditions for sudden, dramatic floods that, over time, have carved out slot canyons. The sprawling, asphalt-based model of American post-war planning has permanently altered the way the landscape drains water. FEMA bases flood maps on elevations and channels but ignore the impact of the built environment. Doing so, Texas A&amp;M professor Samuel Brody told me a few months ago, is a critical mistake. “The bigger issue is that we’ve completed misconceptualized what flood risk is,” he argues. “We’re not baking in the human element that’s driving some of these flood problems.” How urban floods form and move owes as much to parking lots, soundwalls, highways, railroad tracks, and sewer backups as to natural topography. Going back to 1972, about half of all flood insurance claims in Harris County—home of Houston—have been made outside the FEMA flood plain, according to Brody’s research, and the rate was even higher after Hurricane Harvey dumped dozens of inches of rain there last summer. That’s in part due to the increased severity of modern storms, but also to the category error by which FEMA plans without accounting for the postwar landscape. In Cook County, Illinois, more than $773 million was paid out for urban flooding damage between 2007 and 2011. There was no correlation between ZIP codes with FEMA floodplains and those with damage payouts. To further complicate matters, new development can change flooding patterns miles away. In the 1960s developers built Meyerland, one of the Houston neighborhoods that flooded for the third year running during Hurricane Harvey last year. At the time, only a sliver of it was in the flood plain along the bayou. Since then, the booming exurbs of Harris County have thrust more and more of the neighborhood into flood territory, leading to hundreds of millions in federal insurance payouts. Three-quarters of the absorbent Katy Prairie grassland has been paved over, sending water rushing downstream through obsolete infrastructure. “You get flood plains moving into people, not just the other way around,” says Brody. That is what seems to have happened in Ellicott City, too: An old downtown in a new flood plain.","Two years ago, Ellicott City, Maryland, was hit by a debilitating flash flood that turns the town’s historic Main Street into a raging muddy river.

Jose Devasia,"KOCHI, India (Reuters) - India deployed thousands of soldiers and dozens of helicopters to rescue people marooned by the worst floods in a century in Kerala, where the death toll of 186 people as of Saturday could rise fast as rains continue. The weather office warned of more heavy “red” category rains on Saturday as tens of thousands of people were still stuck on the rooftops of houses and community centres. Rescue workers have yet to reach many flooded areas, some too narrow for boats to navigate. People trapped without food, water and electricity worried about being left without help as their phone batteries were dying. An adviser to the state’s chief minister put the initial loss estimate at $4 billion. “There are seven families in this apartment now. We’re safe compared to many others, but we’re cut off,” said James Joseph Moolakkaat, owner of an agricultural business who lives in a 10-story building across the southwestern state’s Periyar river. Map of Kerala flooding: here “This is my second phone and to save power I have been turning data on and off intermittently. If this goes out, I will have some charge left in my laptop and then it will be incommunicado.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was taken by helicopter over inundated farmland and villages, promised more helicopters, boats and other equipment needed to expand the rescue operation in the still unfolding emergency. He said the Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard were assisting disaster relief agencies in the rescue, and a total of 38 helicopters had been pressed into service along with a number of aircraft and ships to ferry resources. “More helicopters, boats and other equipment are being sought and Modi promised to provide all of these as fast as possible,” Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told journalists. “The air marshal in charge of the air operations said more helicopters are on the way.” GRAPHIC: here According to a lawmaker in Pathanamthitta district, some 10,000 people were stranded and in grave danger unless they were rescued urgently. A Reuters witness in Aluva town, nearly 250 km (155 miles)from state capital Thiruvananthapuram, said army helicopters airlifted up to 14 marooned residents, including children and elderly people from an apartment. FOOD SHORTAGES With hundreds of thousands of people converging in halls and auditoriums of schools, temples, churches, and mosques with little or no toilet facilities, people from less affected areas moved in to help those badly in need. But some people in the relief camps were finding it difficult to access food and water. Videos on social media showed groups of people breaking open shops to take food. Chief Minister Vijayan has estimated that more than two million people have been forced to move into relief camps since the monsoon season brought torrential rains three months ago. He put the death toll from floods and landslides since the start of the rainy season at 324. One of his advisers, Prabha Varma, told Reuters 186 people had died since Aug. 8, when the waters began to rise. She said the floods had destroyed 26,000 homes and damaged crops across as much as 40,000 hectares, with estimated losses of 277 billion rupees. Modi declared initial assistance of 5 billion rupees ($71 million) and promised more later. He also assured that the federal government would send desperately needed grains, as storage in the state had been flooded and stocks destroyed. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, where many Keralites work, said he had formed a committee to extend emergency assistance to the flood victims of the state, whose people he said “have always been and are still part of our success story”.

Because of this boulder mobilization, GLOF impacts far exceed those of the annual summer monsoon, and GLOFs may dominate fluvial erosion and channel-hillslope coupling many tens of kilometers downstream of glaciated areas.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Our benign version of Skynet is about to be one step closer to completion. A new weather satellite is set to launch next Thursday courtesy of NASA and a Atlas V rocket. It will provide some of the most detailed imagery of the western U.S. as well as Alaska, Hawaii, and the Pacific region ever captured from space. The satellite, dubbed GOES-S, will be the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) latest next generation weather satellite to keep an eye on the atmosphere. For meteorologists, it’s a huge asset to improve forecasting and a real opportunity to save lives. For the average person, it’s a chance to marvel at the beauty of our planet from 22,000 miles above the surface. “The eye candy is awesome but the science is why so much money is put into these projects.” Let’s talk about what the nerds get first. James Yoe, the chief administrator of the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation, told Earther the satellite is a “three-four-five” kind of benefit because its instruments capture three times as many spectral channels at four times the resolution five times as fast as GOES West, the satellite it’s slated to replace. Its cousin satellite, GOES-16, is already in space keeping an eye on the Americas and the Atlantic Ocean, and has the same capabilities as GOES-S so scientists know what they’re getting. “It’s like looking at an old grainy black and white photo vs. a digital camera snapping pictures in multiple colors in real time,” Yoe said. “That detail is not juts a ‘gee, wow neat’ factor. That enables us to identify features in meteorology that can make forecasts that affect business and citizens.” So what’s in the box? The satellite’s sensors capture 16 bands of imagery (as opposed to GOES West’s five). That allows scientists to get a better view of atmospheric phenomena like snow, fog, clouds, and volcanic ash, as well as vegetation on the ground. It also has sensors that can map lightning and return data on solar flares and space particles. It’s able to return views to every five minutes, but it also has the ability to rapidly scan up to two smaller areas at the same time every 30 seconds. “If you’re looking at severe weather event, you can get updates as those storms are evolving or decaying almost as fast as it’s happening,” Yoe said. “You can give warning faster than you’ve ever previously been able to.” Forecasters have already been able to do that with GOES-16, which was put in orbit early last year and has the same equipment as GOES-S. It had a prime time view for the destructive Atlantic hurricane season that wreaked havoc from Texas to Puerto Rico. That included Hurricane Harvey’s eye. Using the near-real time imagery, Yoe said NOAA was able to tell emergency managers in Corpus Christi—which bore the brunt of Harvey’s winds before the storm transitioned to an historic rainmaker —almost exactly when the worst of the storm was about to roar ashore to provide pinpoint warnings. GOES-S will be able to provide hurricane insights over Hawaii and powerful Gulf of Alaska storms, both areas not covered by GOES-16. It will also provide better coverage of the West Coast where its lightning mapper will come in really handy. The mountains that slice up the West from California to Colorado can obscure radar station’s view of storms. With a high-level view from GOES-S, scientists will be able to detect lightning and in turn can warn forest managers where to look for lightning-sparked wildfires. That could cut down on response time and improve forest management. It would also be a boon to river forecast managers looking to provide earlier, more accurate warnings on flash floods. “The improvement of weather models and forecasts is the reason these satellites are up there,” Dakota Smith, a meteorologist and Twitter’s resident GOES-16 afficinado and visiting scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Earther. “The eye candy is awesome but the science is why so much money is put into these projects. We haven’t even scratched the surface when it comes to the science these satellites will help us accomplish.” Yeah, but about that eye candy. There’s a lot of it when it comes to the GOES series of satellites. Smith is perhaps one of the biggest purveyors of it. He’s even inspired a weird Twitter account that ranks what he finds a la @dog_rates. “We’re seeing our atmosphere in a way that we’ve never seen before,” Smith said, describing why he thinks GOES-16 imagery gets the people going. “It’s a new frontier and that excites people.” While GOES-S won’t necessarily improve our views of hurricanes, it will provide a clearer picture of amazing West Coast happenings. Smith cited this recent von Karman vortex sighting as a good example of imagery that would be improved with a more West Coast-centric satellite: There are still two more GOES satellites on the docket after GOES-S as part of an $11-billion satellite upgrade. The recent Trump budget includes a $335 million planned cut in funding for the program. “I like being able to measure winds in Pacific and to put them in long-term weather models to give us guidance 3-7 days ahead,” Yoe said about one of his favorite GOES-S meteorology advances. “What moves me as a human being, being able to see this whole range of weather and environmental phenomena that impacts people’s lives, property, plans, and economic opportunities. I get really excited about that.”","Our benign version of Skynet is about to be one step closer to completion.

An ""atmospheric river"" triggering torrential rains across much of California flooded roads Thursday and could lead to dangerous mudslides in areas swollen from days of rain and still recovering from devastating wildfires.
Up to 3 inches of rain will fall along the coast from San Diego to the Oregon border, AccuWeather said. Some mountain slopes could see twice that; 8 inches or more was possible in mountainous areas.
High in the Sierra, already overwhelmed with snow, up to 7 feet of snow could fall.
""Enough rain will fall in the major cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego and others to lead to incidents of urban flooding,"" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said. In the mountains and canyons, road will close ""due to flash flooding, mudslides and other debris flows.""

Atmospheric river is a plume of tropical moisture that can result in heavy rainfall or snowfall in a narrow swath where persistent winds can ferry moisture from tropical areas. This one was rolling through California from Hawaii, the National Weather Service said.
The system is also bringing high winds. Gusts reaching 60 mph are likely over parts of Southern California, AccuWeather said. Power was out to more than 100,000 homes and businesses across the state.
California, coming off of years of drought, has been awash in rain in recent months. On Wednesday, San Francisco was hit with a ""hefty 2.49"" inches of rain, the fifth wettest for any February day on record, the weather service said.
""Theres a lot of standing water and some flooded roadways,"" Caltran's Bay-area director Tony Tavares said. ""Please drive carefully and never drive through flooded roadways.""
Caltrans was reporting road closures in San Diego. Mandatory evacuations were in effect for areas blow Los Angeles recovering from wildfires.

Suzanne LaBarre,"The Netherlands is a common case study– and top exporter –of coastal resiliency. And for good reason: Catastrophic floods have threatened the country for centuries, a technical and social challenge that the Dutch have learned to live with over the years. In the flood-prone city of Nijmegen–one of the country’s oldest towns sited along the Waal River–water levels can rise more than 12 feet in a span of 5 to 12 days each year, according to Michel Schreinemachers, a partner at NEXT Architects. That variance is what inspired the firm, in collaboration with H+N+S Landscape Architects, to design the Zalige footbridge with a subversive and dynamic presence. [Photo: Jan Daanen/courtesy NEXT Architects] Originally commissioned as part of Room for the River, a nationwide, government-sponsored series of infrastructure projects designed to better accommodate flooding, NEXT was tasked with creating a bypass off the northern bank of the Waal that would access a new recreational island within an urban river park. The program, budget, and site were all set in stone–but rather than devising a way to forgo the city’s floodplain, the architects built the walkway to coexist directly within it. “Bridges are part of the broader landscape or urban fabric. They connect to the different issues that are at play in a given location,” says Schreinemachers, who specializes in infrastructure and also designed the Lucky Knot bridge in Changsha, China. “In the case of the Zalige bridge, it is about our relation to water.” When the water level rises, the bridge’s concrete-block pavers become partially submerged, making the walk across a bit like a game of hopscotch. It’s a playful design crafted for user experience, in which the visitor is made to pause, note, and even appreciate the water level. “It was important to design something that would strengthen people’s experience of the environment in a positive way,” adds the architect, particularly for the residents of Nijmegen, which evacuated a quarter of a million people in the wake of a flood in January 1995. The Zalige, which has been open since March 2016, faced its biggest test last week. As the city anticipated its highest water level in 15 years, the bridge’s fully submerged blocks became a point of excitement and conversation among locals. “Hundreds of people came out to see and walk over the stepping stones. People are eager to use the bridge,” says Schreinemachers–apparently, even when instructed not to. “Due to the high water, authorities had closed off the area with a fence and a sign of no entry. People just made their way past it on their own risk because they really wanted to experience the landscape and the high water from the bridge. We succeeded in making something that really speaks to people’s imagination.” The project is yet another case study demonstrating how the Dutch have learned to adapt and live with water, emphasizing public engagement in the process. Along the 85-year-old Afsluitdijk levee, which stretches 20 miles along the Dutch coastline, creatives are using its current renovation as an opportunity to present a public showcase of artworks that frame the structure as a “smart landscape.” “Living with water is not seen as a struggle with nature anymore,” says Schreinemachers. “The idea that keeping water out is the only thing we need to do is losing ground in favor of an approach whereby the water is welcomed, brought in, and given more space.”",The Zalige Bridge by NEXT Architects plays with the notion of walking on water–a practical idea in the age of climate change.

Flash floods tore through towns in southwest France, turning waterways into raging torrents that killed at least 13 people, nine of them in just one town, authorities said Monday. People had to be helicoptered to safety from the roofs of their homes as overnight storms dumped the equivalent of several months of rain in just a few hours. Worst hit was the town of Trebes, east of the medieval walled city of Carcassonne. The rains that swept in from the Mediterranean killed nine people there, Interior Ministry spokesman Frederic de Lanouvelle said. He told BFMTV that the floods in the Aude region also killed four other people in other locations, left one person missing and seriously injured five others. In the town of Villegailhenc, witness Ines Siguet said the waters rose so quickly that people were stranded on the roofs of their homes and had to be helicoptered to safety. She posted video of a ripped-up road where a bridge used to be, torn away by a flood torrent that cut the town in half. ""There's nothing left. There's just a hole,"" the 17-year-old resident told The Associated Press. ""It was very violent."" Other roads also were flooded, leaving the town cut off, she said. Siguet's school was shut down amid the destruction. Two people were killed in the town, according to the Aude regional government. Alain Thirion, the prefect of Aude, said some of the dead appeared to have been swept away by floodwaters. In the town of Conques-sur-Orbiel, the river rose by more than six meters (20 feet), he said. Floodwaters were in some cases too powerful for emergency services to get through, even on boats, he said. Television images showed waters coursing through towns and villages, with cars stranded in the floods and piled up on top of each other like children's toys.

(Photo: Daniel Mears, The Detroit News) The thermometer should drop into the 20s at night as skies clear. Thursday’s forecast calls for highs in the upper 30s, about average in late February, weather service records show. That’s a shift from Tuesday, which seemed more like spring. Detroit Metro Airport tied a record high, 63, last set in 2016, according to the weather service. More than 1.10 inches of rain fell, beating the previous record of 1.07 set in 1891. Other rainfall totals since Monday include 2.73 inches in Pinckney; 1.95 inches in White Lake Township; and 1.88 inches in Farmington Hills. By Tuesday night, the National Weather Service reported moderate flooding in Clinton Township after the Clinton River reached its 16-foot flood level. The Rouge River was 1.36 feet above its 12-foot flood stage in Southfield and 1.16 feet above the 15-foot flood level in Detroit, the weather service reported. The Huron River in Ann Arbor was at 14.53 feet, near the 16-foot flood level, according to the weather service. The rainfall caused flooding in Redford Township, police said, where officials closed Graham at Lennane for hours, in Canton Township on Sheldon Road and on Hanover in Dearborn Heights. “Due to the heavy rainfall, frozen ground conditions coupled with rapidly melting snow, many of the ponds, creeks and streams in the area are at capacity,” city officials said in a statement. “Sheldon Road is currently closed between Palmer Road and Geddes Road due to flooding of the Lower Rouge River. Sheldon will only be open to local traffic until the water recedes. Motorists are advised to avoid driving onto roads that are covered with water. Even a shallow depth of fast-moving flood water produces more force than most people imagine.” AAA advises drivers to avoid flooded roads and standing water, to drive slow, to avoid using cruise control, and to check their tires. The insurance company says about 5,700 car crash deaths per year in America occur on wet pavement. Michigan State Police also warned to prepare for flooding. “Floods can be both damaging and life-threatening,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, deputy state director of emergency management for the state police, in a statement. The Road Commission for Oakland County also urges drivers to use caution on gravel roads. The snow melt and rain causes roads to soften, become bumpy and has “contributed to washout-like conditions, especially in hilly areas,” the commission said in a statement. Further north, the Mackinac Bridge was closed to traffic due to ice falling from the cables and towers on the bridge.

Ben Paynter,"Several years ago, one of the eventual founders of One Concern nearly died in a tragic flood. Today, the company specializes in using artificial intelligence to predict how natural disasters are unfolding in real time on a city-block-level basis, in order to help disaster responders save as many lives as possible.As Fast Company wrote in November 2018:
“In 2014, Stanford student structural engineer Ahmad Wani was visiting family in his native Kashmir when a catastrophic flood struck. The rising waters stranded him and his family for seven days without food or water, during which they watched their neighbor’s home collapse, killing everyone inside.
After this horrifying experience, Wani was struck by just how disorganized the emergency response was. “There is no science behind how people should be rescued,” he says. “Disaster response is really random.”
To fix that, One Concern debuted Flood Concern in late 2018. It creates map-based visualizations of where water surges may hit hardest, up to five days ahead of an impending storm. For cities, that includes not just time-lapse breakdowns of how the water will rise, how fast it could move, and what direction it will be flowing, but also what structures will get swamped or washed away, and how differing mitigation efforts–from levy building to dam releases–will impact each scenario. It’s the winner of Fast Company’s 2019 World Changing Ideas Awards in the AI and Data category.

So far, Flood Concern has been retroactively tested against events like Hurricane Harvey to show that it could have predicted what areas would be most impacted well ahead of the storm. The company, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 2015, started with one of that region’s pressing threats: earthquakes. It’s since earned contracts with cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Cupertino, as well as private insurance companies.
Either way, a live field test is imminent as extreme weather events become more common. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, the U.S. has experienced 241 severe weather events with damages exceeding $1 billion. In 2019, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report ranked extreme weather like floods and storms its number one most pressing concern.
One Concern’s first offering, dubbed Seismic Concern, takes existing information from satellite images and building permits to figure out what kind of ground structures are built on, and what might happen if they started shaking. If a big one hits, the program can extrapolate from the epicenter to suggest the likeliest places for destruction, and then adjust as more data from things like 911 calls and social media gets factored in.

Flood Concern works similarly, but with a more dynamic set of variables. It includes soil saturation and building stability estimates but also how topography will affect potential runoff. Then it adds in factors like National Weather Service forecasts and U.S. Geological Survey data about nearby river or tidal flows to create a model that adjusts as the situation changes. “We look at how things change over space and time,” says One Concern cofounder and CTO Nicole Hu.
That allows emergency crews to figure out ahead of time what roads may still passable, and plan evacuation routes accordingly. The company can also overlay maps with existing demographic data to highlight what areas of a city might be especially in danger if people there don’t evacuate. It can also pinpoint crucial infrastructure like water tanks, electric plants, and hospitals that will need protecting–and run if/then hypotheticals about how to do that.
So far, the state of Arizona has signed on as a public partner. One Concern remains in discussion with other cities and is working with international development groups for how to affordably apply its services in developing countries. It’s also building another simulator, this time for wildfires. “For too long, we have only focused on how we can use technology to make things more convenient,” Hu says. “We want to bring innovative tech into the space to help [people] make better decisions, to help make those life-saving decisions.”","Flood Concern can help cities model flood damage and prepare better flood responses.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","On Thursday, The Trent River overflows its banks and floods a neighborhood during Hurricane Florence in River Bend, North Carolina. Hurricane Florence came ashore as a Category 1 this morning near Wilmington, North Carolina just after 7 a.m. Heavy flooding from the storm surge hit towns up and down the North Carolina coast overnight, as hundreds of thousands of people lost power. Emerald Isle, a barrier island town northeast of Wilmington, reported water levels 7 feet above normal just before dawn—a level that had been rising slightly even as the tide receded. NEW: #Hurricane #Florence has made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina at 7:15 AM EDT (1115 UTC) with estimated maximum winds of 90 mph (150 km/h), and a minimum central pressure estimate of 958 mb (28.29""). https://t.co/tW4KeGdBFb pic.twitter.com/vzpe6MjTf9 — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 14, 2018 In New Bern, a town at the mouth of the Neuse River about 80 miles north of Wilmington, a map of high water calls indicated the storm surge was at or past the 100-year level—nearly 7 feet above normal around high tide early Friday morning, according to a USGS gauge. The National Hurricane Center’s color-coded storm surge prediction map tops out at 9 feet or above. The mayor said 200 water rescues had been performed. High water calls (blue circles) against a map of New Bern, North Carolina. High water calls (blue circles) against predicted outlines of a 100-year flood. The next high tide comes in the early afternoon, which could bring the worst flooding of the day. Even at low tide, the National Hurricane Center warned this morning, “the water levels in Pamlico Sound”—America’s biggest lagoon, which lies inside the Outer Banks—“remain elevated. These waters are expected to rise as the tides come back in.” (You can follow along with the National Hurricane Center on Twitter or check out the maps on their website.) Under normal circumstances, this afternoon might be the worst of it. But Florence is not a normal hurricane. Like Harvey, it’s a lumbering beast of a storm that crawled ashore at just 6 mph—one of those slower hurricanes that scientists have been predicting climate change would bring. That means the Atlantic Ocean is likely to stick around in local back yards, blocking roads, inundating houses, trapping residents, and poisoning fields and forests. And then there’s the rain. As Molly Olmstead wrote in Slate yesterday, The amount of rain Florence is expected to drop is shocking: One meteorologist put it at 10 trillion gallons over the next week in North Carolina alone. Deadly flash floods—the second leading direct cause of death from hurricanes—are essentially a guaranteed, experts warn. The current forecast has Florence dropping between 20 and 30 inches of rain on a wide swath around Wilmington, breaking the state rainfall record and possibly the East Coast hurricane record. Some areas could receive as much as 50 inches—approaching the amounts recorded during around Houston during Harvey. As predicted, the surge is highest at towns like New Bern, on the tributaries of the Pamlico Sound, where the storm surge rushes up estuaries and piles up against high ground. For those places, the worst is yet to come. River towns may get pinched between a surging Atlantic Ocean and swollen rivers with nowhere to drain. A record 24.5-foot surge on the Cape Fear River, for example, isn’t predicted until Tuesday. Further inland, there are many ways in which North Carolina is unprepared to handle what’s coming. Those include: low-lying communities, lax building codes, and a vast network of hog farms that have flooded the region in toxic waste during much smaller storms.","Hurricane Florence came ashore as a Category 1 this morning near Wilmington, North Carolina just after 7 a.m.",2018-09-14T12:09:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Florence Makes Landfall Near Wilmington; 9 Feet of Storm Surge Reported in Places,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/florence-nears-landfall-near-wilmington-massive-storm-surge-reported.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/b436264a-4693-450b-acb0-3c9b4735a1ff.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=3000x2000&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,River floods,1
Ashley Collman,"Florida is bracing for yet another hurricane. On Sunday, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 26 counties ahead of Hurricane Michael's arrival. The storm is expected to strengthen to at least a Category 3 hurricane as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico today and tomorrow, and make landfall in Florida on Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday morning at 11 a.m. ET, the hurricane was churning about 50 miles south the western tip of Cuba. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane warning for the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio, while a hurricane watch is in effect along the Florida coast, from the Alabama border to the Suwannee River. The storm is already bringing rain to the Florida Keys, and is expected to reach the state's Panhandle or Big Bend areas on Wednesday, the NHC said. Its maximum sustained wind speeds are around 75 mph, but that's likely to increase over the next two days. Hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall sometime on Wednesday or Thursday. National Hurricane Center Gov. Scott implored those living in northeast Florida to keep track of the storm and evacuate if necessary. Residents in that region have been told to stock up on enough water, food, and medicine to last three days. Michael is expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and life-threatening storm surge. The coastal area from Indian Pass to Crystal River — an hour and a half north of Tampa — is expected to see the highest storm surge, with 8 to 12 feet predicted. In the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend areas, residents could see 4 to 8 inches of rain, with a few areas getting up to 12 inches. That could lead to life-threatening flash floods, the NHC warned. In Cuba, hurricane conditions are expected spread across the western part of Pinar del Rio starting this afternoon. After making landfall, the hurricane will push inland, bringing rainfall to the southeastern U.S. late in the week.

"Ula Chrobak, Ula Chrobak","Historic flooding in the Central Plains, set off by last weeks bomb cyclone, devastated cities from Minnesota to Missouri this weekend, and will continue to inundate areas throughout the week. As of Monday, 41 river locations, mostly in the Missouri River Valley, have set all-time records for water levels, according to Jonathan Erdman, a meteorologist for the Weather Company. Cities in eastern Nebraska, western Iowa, and southeastern South Dakota are among the hardest hit, with homes and roads wrecked and at least three deaths.
While the heavy rains from the last weeks winter storm were a tipping point for the floods, says Erdman, a number of factors led to the extreme event.
Cold, snow, and then a rapid warming
The Midwest has faced several cold snaps this winter. Thanks to this years polar vortex disruption, gusts of Arctic air have chilled the region and brought some of the lowest temperatures in decades. Even early in March, Nebraska was having subzero lows, well below normal for that time of year. Snowfall continued through early March, too, bringing in an extra six to eight inches to the area.
These cold temperatures froze stretches of rivers and the top layer of waterlogged soils. The ground couldnt absorb any water, says Erdman. It was almost like concrete.
Then, temperatures jumped after the March cold snap, pushing into the 50s and starting to melt the snow on the ground. River ice started cracking and breaking into chunks, and then piling up against bridges and bends on waterways, forming whats called ice jams.
But the real kicker is when the bomb cyclone dumped one to three inches of rain over this part of Nebraska and western Iowa, says Erdman. This powerful winter storm formed after a swift drop in pressure in the area, triggering warm air and heavy rains.
Water from the rains flowed over the frozen ground as if it were pavement, streaming into the waterways in the Missouri River Valley. River levels broke all-time recordssome dating back to the late 1800smostly in Nebraska and Iowa, with additional records shattered in South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois.
Then that water hit the ice jams, where it pooled up and then started breaching and breaking dams and levees. Water and ice slabs rushed outward and into streets, farms, and homes. Ive been following national weather for about 22 years now, says Erdman. And this is about the most extreme ice jam event Ive seen anywhere in the U.S.
Ice and flood impacts
Officials issued mandatory evacuations in cities in Iowa and Nebraska as flows swept in. At least three people have died from the floods, one man after attempting to use his tractor to save another person stranded in their car. A third of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha is underwater and 30 buildings are damaged, despite a continuous 30-hour effort to protect it with sandbags between Friday and Saturday, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Even the National Weather Service office in Omaha needed to evacuate, according to Erdman.
In addition to water, ice slabs coursed through communities, too. After the Spencer Dam on the Niobrara River, a tributary of the Missouri River, failed, massive blocks of ice crashed into a gas station and other structures in Niobrara, Nebraska. Piles of ice as high as eight feet continue to litter farmers fields and roads, says Erdman.
Whats to come
It seems the tributaries in the Missouri River Valley have either all crested or will soon, and floods will start to dissipate over the week. But the Missouri River, especially south of Omaha, will stay quite high at least for the next several days, says Erdman. In those areas, record floods might continue through Wednesday.
Much of the soils across the states are currently soaked, thanks to what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared the wettest winter on record dating back to 1895. Many areas have significant snowpack, too. Fargo, North Dakota has some 20 inches of snow on the ground right now, says Erdman.
This means theres potential for more flooding. It depends on how quickly temperatures warm as we head into spring and if theres more storms ahead, which would bring more water to already-saturated areas. Im a little concerned to see what might happen up in the Red River Valley in North Dakota and Minnesota, but theres a lot of wild cards ahead, says Erdman.","Environment It's the perfect storm.

Jenny Gathright,"Alberto, which is moving north through the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of 15 miles per hour, is still categorized as a Subtropical Storm. But the National Hurricane Center said Sunday morning that ""it is gaining some more tropical characteristics."" According to an update from the National Hurricane Center, the center of the storm is predicted to reach the northern U.S. gulf coast as early as Sunday night, and once it makes landfall, it is expected to weaken to a tropical depression. The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of nearly 45 miles per hour. In its advisory issued at 8:00 a.m. ET Saturday, the National Hurricane Center maintained a storm surge watch along the U.S. gulf coast from Crystal River in western Florida to the Mississippi-Alabama border. The water could reach heights of 2 to 4 feet, with the deepest water expected along the immediate coast. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Dry Tortugas off of Florida's gulf coast, which has already started to experience tropical storm conditions. The Tropical Storm warning extends to the area from Florida's Bonita Beach to the Mississippi-Alabama border. A tropical storm watch is in effect along the Mississippi-Alabama border to the mouth of the Pearl River in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center also warns of possibly life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in Cuba, where Alberto could bring an accumulation of 5 to 10 inches of rain and isolated storm totals of up to 20 inches of rain. On Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties of Florida. In an update on preparedness efforts issued Saturday, Scott said the Florida National Guard has 5,500 guard members on call to help with storm-related emergencies. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has also issued a state of emergency, effective 6:00 a.m. local time Sunday, for several counties in Alabama: Autauga, Baldwin, Barbour, Bibb, Bullock, Butler, Chambers, Chilton, Choctaw, Clarke, Coffee, Conecuh, Coosa, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Dallas, Elmore, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Hale, Henry, Houston, Lee, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Mobile, Monroe, Montgomery, Perry, Pickens, Pike, Russell, Sumter, Tallapoosa, Tuscaloosa, Washington and Wilcox. Water, not wind, tends to be the deadliest factor in storms like Alberto, according to a 2014 study by Dr. Ed Rappaport of the National Weather Service. Rappaport found that during the 50-year period of 1963 to 2012, about half of all U.S. deaths from tropical cyclones were caused by storm surge. In addition, about 90 percent of the deaths happened in water-related incidents, most often drowning. The Atlantic hurricane season officially starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30. The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center's annual forecast says up to four hurricanes could form in the Atlantic this hurricane season, and that overall the intensity of this hurricane season will probably be near or above normal. According to NPR's Camila Domonoske, even an average hurricane season can be tremendously harmful, especially for places like the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico, which were hit hard by the hurricanes Harvey and Maria last year. ""The seasonal outlook can't predict landfall areas, but the forecasters warn that even an average season involves 'quite a few hurricanes.'

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Numerous flood rescues were reported in areas east of Los Angeles as heavy rain pounded California on Thursday. The desert resort city of Palm Springs urged residents to stay where they were because of flooded streets. (Feb. 15)
 AP
Californians were in clean-up mode Friday as the state slowly recovers from an onslaught of rain, wind and snow, which brought widespread flooding, mudslides, and washed-out highways.
At least two deaths have been blamed on the storm.
Although the worst of the storm had moved well inland early Friday, forecasters said some leftover showers and snow was still likely to fall across the state on Friday and Saturday. The higher elevations of the Sierra could see an additional 3 to 6 feet of snow over the next few days, on top of the 3 feet that fell Thursday, the National Weather Service said. 
So much snow has fallen in the area that cities are running out of places to put the snow, according to Kevin Cooper of Lake Tahoe TV
In Southern California, officials said rain-drenched hillsides could still loosen and collapse, bringing down mud, boulders and debris.
The ground is still so saturated and the water is still flowing down from the mountains, said April Newman, spokeswoman for Riverside County Fire Department.
California flooding: Woman rescued after mudslide destroyed her home

In Sausalito, north of San Francisco, a home smashed into another house after sliding down a hill. One woman was buried under a tree and mud for two hours before fire crews rescued her.
The National Weather Service reported staggering rainfall amounts across California. A rain gauge at Palomar Observatory, 60 miles northwest of San Diego, picked up over 10 inches of rain Thursday, that location's wettest day ever recorded.
Heavy rain also spread into Arizona and southern Nevada, AccuWeather reported. Four people were rescued in Las Vegas after rushing water trapped them under a bridge. It was the rainiest Valentine's Day on record in Vegas, with 1.11 inches reported.

The deluge was courtesy of an atmospheric river, which are ribbons of water vapor that extend thousands of miles in the air from the tropics to the western USA. They are responsible for up to 65 percent of the western USA's extreme rain and snow events, a 2017 study said.
What's left of the storm will continue to move across the country Friday and Saturday, spreading mostly light-to-moderate amounts of snow across the nation. Later Friday and into Saturday, a corridor of snow can be expected from eastern Missouri to the mid-Atlantic region.
Snow totals along the path of the storm will be less than 6 inches in most locations.
By next week, the weather service said heavy rain with potential flooding will be possible over the southern U.S. And wintry precipitation, perhaps a mix of snow and ice, will impact the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast by early to mid week.

"Chelsea Harvey, ClimateWire","Climate change will put tens of millions more people around the world at risk of exposure to flooding rivers over the next 25 years, an alarming new study reports—unless policymakers invest in significant adaptation measures. While rising sea levels can increase the risk of coastal flooding, the study focuses instead on fluvial floods, which happen when rivers overflow their banks. As global temperatures rise, storms and heavy rainfall events are expected to become more severe in many parts of the world, increasing the risk of these flooding events. According to the study, published yesterday in Science Advances, more than half the United States alone will need to double existing flood protections—through the building of new dikes, levees and other infrastructure updates—to prevent additional people from being affected in the future. Other regions around the world, including central Europe and parts of Africa, Central and South America, as well as large areas of India, Pakistan, Indonesia and China, will also need to take similar measures to protect their populations. Otherwise, millions more people in each region may be hit by future floods. In the United States and parts of Canada, the affected population could rise from 100,000 people to a million, a tenfold increase. In China, high-end flood risks could rise from 24 million affected people to 55 million. And that's only if human populations remain at their current levels, the researchers note. If communities in affected areas continue to grow over the next few decades, even more people could be at risk. ""We ask the question: How much do you have to improve your local protection levels now in order to keep the flood risk in the next 25 years the same as you had it in the last 25 years?"" said study co-author Anders Levermann, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Populations in different parts of the world experience differing levels of flood protections. For instance, infrastructure in many U.S. states is designed to protect citizens from floods severe enough that they should only be expected to occur once every 100, or even 500, years. In other parts of the world, protections are designed for much less severe events, meaning greater proportions of the population would be affected by more damaging floods. But the new research investigates the amount of action that must be taken in any region simply to keep conditions at their current levels—in other words, to prevent any more of the population from being affected than is already at risk. That means parts of the world with relatively low flood risks, such as the United States, may need to work similarly hard just to keep those dangers from rising as regions with much higher flood risks. The research shows that ""the adaptation need is similarly high in highly developed countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia, as well as for developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America,"" the study authors write. The researchers focused only on the next few decades of climate change mainly because ""the next 25 years of climate change are already determined by the emissions that we have carried out so far of greenhouse gases,"" Levermann noted. Even if nations around the world halted their carbon emissions tomorrow, the climate system would still experience additional warming for years afterward. It's a phenomenon known as ""climate inertia""—the idea that some climate effects don't occur immediately after emissions are put into the atmosphere, but take some time to unfold. This means the change in flood risk over the next few decades is likely to be the same regardless of global climate mitigation efforts. If immediate measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gases over the next few decades, these risks may not rise much more throughout the rest of the century, Levermann pointed out. But if not, flood risks beyond the next 25 years will likely grow even more severe. The researchers conducted their study using the help of hydrological and climate models, which helped them simulate future climate change and its effects on precipitation and global water systems. They were able to calculate the risks to populations in different regions using a special database of flood protection standards around the world. The paper comes on the heels of a new report, just issued by NOAA, that found 2017 was the most expensive year on record for damage caused by natural disasters. The cumulative cost of all the events, including storms, wildfires, floods and droughts, was more than $300 billion. Included on the list were the February flooding in California and the April floods in Missouri and Arkansas. Both events were spurred by heavy rainfall. The new research reinforces the need for immediate adaptation efforts to prepare for the next few decades, if even more damage is to be prevented. And it underscores the idea that even greater flood risks can only be avoided through strict climate mitigation, starting now. ""Everything beyond the next 25 years will be determined by what we are doing now,"" Levermann said. Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

One of the best ways to monitor the weather where you live and receive those severe weather alerts is through our FREE WTXL First Alert Weather app on all your Apple and Android mobile devices. In addition to the severe weather alerts we provide, you can also view our interactive radar, get hourly forecasts, and watch video updates on the go, when you want it, at your convenience, all in the palm of your hand. First Alert Chief Meteorologist Casanova Nurse is warning residents on what to expect on Sunday morning into the afternoon: Expectations for occasional strong and severe storms Sunday morning have not drastically changed. A line of severe thunderstorms will enter the western Panhandle later Saturday night. Because of the expected progression of this line of storms in the Sunday morning hours, the system may lose some ability to maintain its organization, and some (but not complete) weakening is possible. Threats: Officially, the entire region is in the ""slight risk"" category, meaning scattered instances of severe-level wind gusts and isolated tornadoes are possible. A severe thunderstorm or tornado watch may also be issued under these conditions. Timing: A warm Saturday locally can help support at least borderline severe storms with strong wind gusts. Wind profiles are marginally supportive for an isolated tornado. The line of storms will sweep through the area from west to east. A late-morning to afternoon arrival in the Suwannee Valley could mean a re-generation of some of the strength of the storms. Based on the current forecast: Apalachicola River area (5-8 a.m.) - Central Big Bend (Tallahassee) mid to late morning (8-11 a.m.) Suwannee River midday (11 a.m. - 1 p.m.) Unknowns: Because of the morning passage of this system, intensity will be somewhat reduced, but instances of storm-related wind gusts may produce localized damage. Preparations: Have your NOAA Weather Radio programmed with fully-charged batteries available for it. If you must travel, make sure to check the weather conditions, watches, warnings and advisories before venturing out the door.

Mindy Weisberger Senior Writer,"WASHINGTON — The history of maritime vessels in the U.S. is preserved in an unlikely place — at the bottom of a river. Nearly 200 military shipwrecks — dating as far back as the Revolutionary War and including ships from the Civil War and both World War I and World War II — were deliberately sunk over centuries, in an area of the Potomac River called Mallows Bay, in Maryland. Over time, this so-called ghost fleet of wooden ships has come to serve as habitat for local wildlife. But is this artificial ecosystem stable? Researchers recently investigated how the shipwrecks have changed over time; their findings, presented here on Dec. 13 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), explained how the bodies of the ships weathered river conditions — in some cases for hundreds of years — and how that might affect the future of the ghost fleet ecosystem. [ Mayday! 17 Mysterious Shipwrecks You Can See on Google Earth ] The four researchers were accompanied at AGU by a chaperone, as they are all fifth-grade students attending the J.C. Parks Elementary School in Maryland. A school trip to Mallows Bay last year inspired them to question how the ships got there and what happened to them after they were sunk, Renata Ashton, age 11, told Live Science. They consulted aerial maps of the ghost fleet that were created decades apart, ""and we looked at them to see which ones had moved and decayed,"" said Shyla Lancaster, also 11. After comparing known ship positions across different maps, they discovered that some ships were definitely not staying put — most of the ships were shifting eastward, some by miles, they reported. Natural forces that affected the ships included storms, floods and erosion, according to 10-year-old Annabelle Naught. The best-preserved parts of the shipwrecks were deeply embedded in mud, while the exposed parts showed greater signs of deterioration, explained Kharylle Deramos, age 10. Together, the ships form an elaborate infrastructure that has become a habitat for bald eagles, fish and other animals, and the site is currently under consideration for designation as a marine sanctuary by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But degradation and drift could disrupt the balance of this ecosystem. Further evaluation of the site with underwater remotely operated vehicles will help determine how changes in the ghost fleet could impact the wildlife that live there, the researchers concluded.

https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908,"LUMBERTON, N.C. — The storm known as Florence is creating a slow-motion natural disaster for the Carolinas that could prove deceptively lethal as swollen rivers and streams spill over their banks and continue to rise. The hurricane, now downgraded to a tropical storm, was blamed by authorities for at least five deaths as of late Friday. Though Florence did not arrive with winds as violent as once feared, forecasters got the storm surge and rainfall correct. They have made clear that this event is all about the water — which the storm has delivered in devastating quantity. The storm made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., in the gloom of dawn Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. As the storm sat along the edge of the Atlantic, some stretches along the coastal Carolinas received close to 20 inches of rain. Florence is projected to migrate at barely more than a walking pace across northern South Carolina, passing close to the city of Florence — truly — on Saturday. The great danger now, experts say, is river flooding and then, once the remnants of the tempest reach the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians, flash floods, mudslides and debris flows. Relief will not come quickly. The National Weather Service said the floods are likely to last for weeks. This is a perilous moment for the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the roads to escape the storm’s fury. The rivers are in most cases several days from cresting. The parts of the country still in the storm’s path have been saturated by summer rains and cannot soak up any surplus from Florence. More than a dozen major rivers in the Carolinas and Southern Virginia are forecast by the National Weather Service to reach flood stage, and some — including the Neuse, Pamlico, Lumber, Waccamaw, Northeast Cape Fear and Pee Dee rivers — are expected to set flood records. There is really nowhere for the water to go. “We’re in God’s hands,” said Rick Foreman, pastor at West Lumberton Baptist Church, as the Lumber River steadily rose Friday and local residents filled sandbags. “We all know that.” The Weather Service forecast the Lumber to reach major flood stage Saturday and to keep rising through Sunday. State Sen. Danny Britt (R) put out a call on Facebook for volunteers to fill the sandbags and, with the help of 40 members of the National Guard, dam a railway channel that has been problematic during floods. “Pretty soon I had a hundred of my closest friends out here helping us out,” Britt said. “Sixty mile-per-hour winds, shingles flying off their own homes, and they’re here working for everyone else.” The river swamped the town after Hurricane Matthew came through two years ago: One church parishioner drowned during that storm, more than 700 families were displaced from their homes, and two of the city’s largest public housing projects were destroyed, Foreman said. And so as a pelting rain fell Friday, residents worked in soaked T-shirts and shorts to try to stave off another disaster. Usually hurricanes this far north deliver their punch and quickly leave town. Florence has been a strange tropical cyclone since it materialized in the distant Atlantic and took an unusual path toward the mainland United States. On Friday afternoon it was traveling at just 3 to 5 mph, still near the coast. “There’s nothing to steer it. It’s all about the steering currents. We don’t have any right now,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. “It’s like a bubble with no wind, it just floats. You don’t want slow, but that’s what we have.” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) urged patience, emphasizing that his state has never seen “a hurricane staying on top of us for this long.” The coast has been battered, and the mountains appear to be next. The remnants of Florence are expected to hit the peaks of western North Carolina in a couple of days. National Hurricane Center meteorologist Joel Cline said the mountains will wring water out of the moist tropical air: “It’s like running into a wall, and that moisture has to go somewhere, and it goes up, creates rain, and you have torrential rain in that area.” Cline said July was the wettest ever in that part of North Carolina, and the water table rose 21 inches higher than normal. Florence could add an additional six to 10 inches of rainfall this weekend. Flash floods can materialize within minutes of intense rain as the water rushes down hillsides. “You evacuate from water,” Cline said. “That’s why we’ve been preaching to people that you have to get away from the water.” Appalachian State University in Boone canceled its first home football game scheduled for Saturday. “It’s not often that we have to prepare for a hurricane in the mountains, but we are doing so on our campus,” Jason Marshburn, the director of safety and emergency management at the university, wrote in a letter to students and faculty members. Florence’s remnants are expected to keep traveling north and then northeast, and they could drop several inches of rain in eastern Tennessee and eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Flash flooding is a threat in those states as well. The Carolinas know all about hurricane-related flooding, having experienced Matthew two years ago and Floyd in 1999. Floyd, like Florence, hit Wilmington directly and dumped record amounts of rain. Rivers swelled not only with water but also with the carcasses of livestock. A number of motorists died trying to drive through moving water. Hence the refrain Friday from emergency management officials: Turn around, don’t drown. With the center of the storm still at sea early Friday, scores of residents had to be rescued from homes and the tops of cars in New Bern, N.C. Power outages mounted until nearly 700,000 customers were in the dark in North Carolina alone. Duke Energy said late Friday that it anticipates 1 million to 3 million outages in the Carolinas, and that full power restoration could take weeks. “The storm is wreaking havoc on our state, and we’re deeply concerned for farms, for businesses, for schools and even for whole communities that might be wiped away,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D). The eyewall of Florence struck the coast before dawn. At 5:30 a.m. a reporter in a downtown hotel in Wilmington heard the signature hurricane sound — a low, heavy humming combined with an almost musical high note. Eight-foot waves, a local record, ruffled the surface of the Cape Fear River. At 6 a.m. the electronics chirped for a moment as the power went out. Buildings swayed for several hours. The wind in Wilmington gusted to 105 mph, the strongest since Hurricane Helene on Sept. 27, 1958, the Weather Service said. The winds became less violent as the eye, no longer well-formed but instead welling with rain, passed over the city after it made landfall at 7:15 a.m. Trees went down, as did power lines, and streets filled with debris. A Waffle House downtown remained open for a few hours — sandwiches only, no coffee — before closing at noon. Metal signs and roof coverings littered the biggest commercial byway, Market Street, and trees blocked many roads. Traffic lights were out. Residents mostly heeded police commands to stay home and off the streets. In Kinston, a city southeast of Raleigh, two people died in the storm. A 78-year-old man connecting extension cords in the rain was electrocuted, according to Roger Dail, the Lenoir County director of emergency services. And a 77-year-old man died when he was knocked over by wind, he said. In Pender County, officials said that a woman died of a heart attack Friday morning as emergency crews tried to reach her; they were delayed because of downed trees and debris in the road. The crews tried to move the debris with a front loader, but a tree went through the windshield, causing further delays, the officials said. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,” Cooper said in a statement. “Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.” Sullivan reported from Wilmington, N.C. Berman and Achenbach reported from Washington. Jason Samenow and Angela Fritz in Washington and Lori Rozsa in Miami, Rachel Siegel in Jacksonville, N.C., Sharon Dunten in Savannah, Ga., Ray Glier in Atlanta, Kristine Phillips in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Sarah Kaplan in Lumberton contributed to this report.","Washington Post Record flooding projected as Florence rolls slowly across the Carolinas Washington Post LUMBERTON, N.C. — The storm known as Florence is creating a slow-motion natural disaster for the Carolinas that could prove deceptively lethal as swollen r…",2018-09-15T00:26:51Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",Record flooding projected as Florence rolls slowly across the Carolinas - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/record-flooding-projected-as-florence-rolls-slowly-across-the-carolinas/2018/09/14/576d2a5e-b833-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5ZtgkksdipDt3FtQrU72CUfLAZk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NDCK25VYHEI6RIWFGGD7IJ7CKM.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,River floods,1
Hilary Brueck,"Around 2 p.m. on Tuesday, New York City descended into a cloud of darkness. The skies opened up, thunder rained down, and lightning flashed across the sky. Photojournalist Gary Hershorn snapped this image from Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson river from Manhattan: Nearby, Twitter user Max Guliani spotted this gnarly cloud formation: It's all prompted by the sweltering temperatures that have been bathing the New York City region in sticky heat. On Tuesday, New York declared a heat advisory would be in effect until 6 p.m., and the city opened up emergency cooling centers, as temperatures topped out at 86 degrees Fahrenheit in Central Park, with the humidity hovering near 70%. When it's that hot, the steamy surface of the Earth heats up, and all that air has nowhere to go but up. Thunderstorms form when that ""warm, moist air rises into cold air,"" as the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) explains on its website. As more of the warm air hits the cold above, it mixes in and cools off, forming water droplets and creating a moving cell. Cooler air, in turn, falls down into the atmosphere and continues mixing with the heat, creating a perfectly dynamic system for a thunderstorm to thrive on: a mix of moisture and unstable air. The phenomenon can be even more pronounced over cities like New York, which are laden with dark, hot asphalt and big black buildings, creating heat islands. Scientists predict that the worst summer storms are only going to get more violent as the planet warms.So far, they've been right. As people create pollutants, those greenhouse gases trap more of the sun's heat, which raises the planet's temperature. Increased precipitation is a side effect of that process: the hotter the atmosphere gets, the easier it is for evaporation to occur on the surface of the Earth. Warmer air can also hold more water, which prompts heavier rains and more summer floods.

"USA TODAY, Rick Jervis, USA TODAY","Founded in 1718, New Orleans will turn 300 years old this year. The city plans to celebrate with a series of talks, concerts and street parades. Rick Jervis, USA TODAY Street musicians busk on Frenchmen Street in the Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans. (Photo: EDMUND D FOUNTAIN FOR USA TODAY) NEW ORLEANS — Ever since Canadian-born French explorer Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville chose the swampy, flood-prone bend in the lower Mississippi River in 1718 as the spot for a new French colony, New Orleans has been a non-stop roller coaster of historical events. Nouvelle-Orléans, as it was originally known, was ruled by three countries in less than a century — France, Spain and America — and swelled with Caribbean, European and African immigrants. It endured outbreaks of yellow fever, slave uprisings, river floods and one debilitating hurricane after another. The most recent big one, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, submerged 80% of the city, led to about 1,400 deaths and threatened the city’s very existence. This year, New Orleans, birthplace of jazz and jambalaya, celebrates its survival from three centuries of tumult with a 300th birthday party filled with exhibitions, panel discussions, street parades and parties. Throughout the city, large “300” signs have been set up in plazas and parks, each big enough for visitors to snap pictures beside. Sean Cummings, a New Orleans hotelier and entrepreneur, said the tricentennial is as much a tribute to the city’s resilience as it is its existence. “For me, it’s a (sign) that something here works,” he said. “It’s lasted for 300 years, and New Orleans has managed to be not only part of the physical landscape as an American city but in many ways part of the poetic landscape.” Last Slide Next Slide The city that today is New Orleans almost wasn’t. British explorers nearly claimed the area for themselves, and even the 18th-century aristocrats in Paris originally wanted their French outpost in Biloxi or farther upriver near modern-day Baton Rouge. Only Bienville’s machinations brought New Orleans to its present spot. After surviving disease, starvation and storms, New Orleans in the 19th century became a thriving center of commerce, reaping profits from cotton, banking, slaves and anything that floated up or down the Mississippi, said Lawrence Powell, a Tulane University historian and author of The Accidental City: Improvising New Orleans. By 1840, New Orleans was the third-largest banking center in the U.S., behind only New York and Baltimore, he said. “There was a time when this town was practically the center of the universe,” Powell said. New Orleans, like the rest of the nation, was gripped by World War I during the city’s 200th anniversary in 1918 and didn’t roll out much of a celebration. This year, expect the city to throw a true party, he said. “Three hundred years is a pretty good run,” Powell said. They'll be street performances at Congo Square, where slaves would meet and dance to beating drums, displays of 18th-century artifacts and documents explaining the city's founding, and a tricentennial fireworks show. More than anything, the city will be celebrating the various groups and cultures that have descended onto New Orleans over the years and forged its uniqueness, said Steven Bingler, a New Orleans architect and urban planner. Each new wave of immigrants to the city — from Spanish settlers to Sicilians to Senegalese — brought with them their particular style of food, music and architecture. Spanish settlers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries used local ingredients to morph their beloved paella dish into jambalaya. They also filled the French Quarter, the city’s oldest neighborhood, with homes decorated with ornate wrought-iron balconies and center courtyards, more akin to homes in Havana and Sevilla than anything found in the U.S., Bingler said.

(Photo: EDMUND D FOUNTAIN, FOR USA TODAY) Each new style had to somehow merge with the older traditions, a trend that continues today, Bingler said. “Almost every art form in New Orleans is connected to an earlier era,” he said. “That’s what distinguishes New Orleans.” Into the 20th and 21st centuries, New Orleans struggled through waves of economic depression, more blistering storms and a steady brain drain of its educated class. Hurricane Katrina infused billions of dollars of recovery money into the economy and led to some significant flood protection and public school improvements. Still, the economy appears stalled, job growth is slowing, and the poverty rate still lingers at around 24% — nearly double the U.S. average, according to the Brookings Institution. Murders and violent crime also remain challenges. Benny Jones Sr., leader of the Treme Brass Band, before performing at the d.b.a. nightclub in New Orleans.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption During Hurricane Harvey, Port Arthur in Texas experienced some the most extreme impacts of flooding Scientists and engineers have teamed up across the Atlantic to ""redraw"" the flood map of the US. Their work reveals 40 million Americans are at risk of having their homes flooded - more than three times as many people as federal flood maps show. The UK-US team say they have filled in ""vast amounts of missing information"" in the way flood risk is currently measured in the country. They presented the work at the 2017 American Geophysical Union meeting. This mapping project includes areas across the US that are on river floodplains and those at risk of flash floods associated with heavy rainfall. It focuses on rivers and does not include areas at risk of coastal flooding. Image copyright Oliver Wing Image caption Cutting edge flood map: blue areas on the map are within the '100 year floodplain' Speaking to BBC News ahead of this international gathering of Earth and planetary scientists, one of the researchers, Oliver Wing PhD from University of Bristol in the UK, said the new maps were based on ""cutting edge science"", simulating every river catchment area. The biggest issue, Mr Wing explained, is the how incomplete the network of river gauges is in the US. So he and his colleagues created a model based on decades of analysis of the way in which river systems behave. This model ""fills in those data gaps,"" he told BBC News, meaning the probability of flooding can be worked out in every river catchment area. 100-year flood Combining those probabilities with population and land-use data, Mr Wing said, revealed that ""40 million people and $5.5 trillion worth of assets"" are within an area that has a 1% chance of flooding each year. When you combine population data with government flood maps, which are created by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), ""they only have 13 million people on that floodplain"", said Mr Wing. This area with 1% chance of flooding every year - also called the 100-year floodplain - is nationally recognised as the area of high flooding risk. FEMA charts this area on its official flood hazard map, which is used to inform a national flood insurance programme. Flooding insurance is mandatory for the homeowners who have mortgages from federally regulated lenders. And for people whose homes were built before this law was passed, there is government support for their insurance policies. But FEMA ""simply hasn't covered the whole of the USA"" in its mapping, Mr Wing told BBC News. ""Even in areas they claim to have studied, a lot of the smaller river reach has just been ignored."" A Department of Homeland Security report, published earlier this year, also concluded that FEMA needed to ""improve its management and oversight of flood mapping"". FEMA said it had not carried out a full study of the number of people living in what it called Special Flood Hazard Areas, so it could not confirm the figures the team quoted. But Roy Wright, director of the National Flood Insurance Programme, said that the organisation wanted ""the best answers as the science advanced"". ""We haven't seen the details of this study,"" Mr Wright told BBC News. ""But we welcome what these scientists have done and, if it improves our maps, we'll look at it."" Modelling the strangest floods Hydrologists in a Princeton-Bristol University Partnership have also been examining and modelling some of the strangest floods to have happened in the UK and US. So-called ""strange floods"" are floods that are much larger than or that occur at unexpected times of year compared with more regular flooding in an area. These researchers developed what they termed a ""strangeness index"" for flooding. That is worked out by dividing the volume of water recorded in the largest flood, by the volume from a more typical flooding event. ""The higher that value on the strangeness index, the more likely the flood is to happen at an unexpected time of year,"" explained Alexander Cox from Princeton University. Prof Paul Bates from the University of Bristol says their unexpectedness makes them difficult to prepare for, meaning they often cause large amounts of damage. Two of the strangest floods to have happened in the UK were on the River Darent at Hawley in Kent in September, 1968. ""This was 10 times larger than the 10-year flood here,"" according to Prof Bates. More recently, a flood of the River Dearne at Barnsley Weir in South Yorkshire in 2007 was nine times larger than the 10-year flood in that area. According to the scientists, seven out of the top 10 strangest floods happened in only two years - 1968 and 2007. Alexander Co, lead researcher on the UK strange floods project, said understanding the strangest floods could add a whole new dimension to calculating flood risk. Mr Wing added that the 100-year flood had the potential to cause $1.16tn worth of damage. ""That is if the 100-year flood happened everywhere at the same time, which is not going to happen in one period,"" he said. ""But this gives you a rough idea of what has been put in harm's way.

Aria Bendix,"For years, scientists have warned of the ""next big one,"" an earthquake so powerful that it could topple buildings, slash power, and take lives across California. As far as natural disasters go, the quake represented the worst-case-scenario for cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are both located along the San Andreas Fault. 
 Now government experts claim there's an even bigger threat to California residents: a potential mega-storm that could inundate cities and cause up to $725 billion in damage. 
Read more: Natural disasters set records around the world in 2018. These were some of the worst.
 That's more than double the damage that could hail from the ""next big one,"" according to the latest estimates from data analytics firm CoreLogic. 
 In 2011, a team of scientists and other experts at the US Geological Survey (USGS) likened the mega-storm to the California winter storms of 1861 and 1862, which killed thousands and left a 300-mile-long lake in the center of the state.

The future doomsday scenario — known ""Atmospheric River 1,000,"" or ARkstorm for short — could surpass levels of precipitation that are only seen every 500 to 1,000 years. 
 If ARkstorm does hit, its effects could be exacerbated by the failure of a single piece of infrastructure: the Whittier Narrows Dam in Los Angeles County. 
 A recent report from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) found that ARkstorm could breach the dam, causing water to spill over the top or triggering the premature release of the dam's spillway. The resulting floods and landslides pose an ""unacceptable"" risk to human lives, the report said.

Already, California's flood-protection systems have showed signs of malfunction in places like the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2017, the near-failure of the Oroville Dam outside Sacramento prompted the evacuation of more than 180,000 people. 
 The USACE points to the Whittier Narrows Dam as ""one of the highest risk dams"" in their portfolio. If their models are borne out, around 1.5 million people could be forced to evacuate due to catastrophic flooding, with some areas witnessing floods of up to 20 feet. As weather conditions worsen due to climate change, these predictions could become even graver. 
 Though scientists can't pinpoint when ARkstorm or the next big earthquake will occur, both disasters are considered likely, if not inevitable. 
 But the USGS has found that preparations for the ""next big one"" could help combat a storm as well. 
 By setting up shelters, testing aid agreements, and piloting early warning apps, the state can ready itself for whichever disaster comes first.","Scientists predict that California could be struck by a rare mega-storm that threatens lives and yields $725 billion worth of damage.

The Conversation,"Coastal counties in North and South Carolina are still assessing damage from Hurricane Florence, which dropped up to three feet of rain in some areas in September. Now, along with southern Georgia, they face new forecasts of dangerous flooding from Hurricane Michael. Since the 1950s, coastal communities have ordered evacuations to move people out of the paths of dangerous storms. Coastal residents also prepare by building homes elevated above anticipated high water levels, and building codes commonly call for reinforced construction to endure high wind speeds. Today, however, risk from hurricanes is extending inland. Some of the worst damage from Eastern Seaboard hurricanes in the past several decades has come from inland flooding along rivers after storms move ashore. Hurricane evacuations typically direct coastal residents to retreat inland, but river flooding can put them at risk if there are not enough shelters and accommodations in safe locations. And inland communities may not take adequate measures to ensure the safety of their residents. Much of my research, including my book, "" Southern Waters: The Limits to Abundance,"" has focused on the complex historical geography of water in the American South. What I have seen is that inland river flooding linked to hurricanes and heavy storms is a huge risk in the Southeast, but receives far less attention in emergency plans than coastal areas. Warm, rainy watersheds The US Gulf coast and eastern seaboard are particularly susceptible to river flooding due to tropical weather that moves onshore. From New England to Georgia, a dense network of rivers flows down from the eastern Appalachians across the Piedmont — a broad, rolling plateau extending from the mountains to the coastal plain — and drains into the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Steep gradients move water quickly down the mountain slopes. On the Piedmont, many small streams merge and then become meandering rivers on the low-lying coastal plain. When tropical weather systems lumber onshore and move inland, they rise up the steep face of the Blue Ridge Mountains. As the saturated air moves upward, it cools and releases huge quantities of rain — a process known as orographic precipitation. This phenomenon, coupled with heavy rainfall dumped on lower elevations by these tropical systems, unleashes dramatic downpours that funnel into river networks and rush toward the sea, often spilling over the banks of overwhelmed channels. This map shows the rivers draining to the southeast US Atlantic coast. García, Ana María, Anne B. Hoos, and Silvia Terziotti/Journal of the American Water Resources Association/CC BY Planning centers on coastal communities A series of storms in the 1950s prompted federal agencies to start planning for extreme tropical weather events. In August 1954, Hurricane Carol grazed the Outer Banks of North Carolina before battering Long Island and Rhode Island and causing extensive flood damage in New England. Hurricane Edna followed a similar path two weeks later, but remained offshore. And an October storm dumped up to 10 inches of rain across the Appalachians as it moved inland, causing serious flooding, damage and fatalities in Maryland and Pennsylvania. In 1955 Hurricane Connie unleashed huge amounts of rain over upstate New York. Days later, Hurricane Diane produced modest damage along the coast, but caused extensive river flooding as it continued across New England. Although both of these storms made landfall in North Carolina, their impacts in the more heavily populated northeast spurred federal action.

Although both of these storms made landfall in North Carolina, their impacts in the more heavily populated northeast spurred federal action. The growing inland threat Hurricane Floyd in 1999 showed that tropical weather events could wreak havoc inland, mainly through river flooding. Floyd moved onshore near Cape Fear, North Carolina, in mid-September with wind speeds of about 105 miles per hour and traveled northward, dumping up to 20 inches of rain along a path stretching into New England and Canada. Copious rainfall pushed inland ahead of the storm's eye overwhelmed most of the rivers in eastern North Carolina. Emergency responders conducted hundreds of inland freshwater rescues. Some river flood crests did not occur until over a week after the storm had passed. Millions of hogs, chickens and other farm animals drowned, and dozens of animal waste lagoons overflowed, contaminating water supplies. Floyd's impact was compounded by the fact that it followed Hurricane Dennis by about 10 days, so soils were already saturated. And rivers were still at higher-than-normal stages when Hurricane Irene arrived a month later. Total damage from Floyd alone was estimated at US$6.5 billion, much of it from inland flooding. Massive floods in Columbia, South Carolina, in 2015 and southeast Louisiana in 2016, caused by rare heavy rainfall events, soaked major urban areas and triggered evacuations — again, mainly through river flooding. And in 2017, Hurricane Harvey dropped at least 52 inches of rain on Houston in six days, an amount NASA described as ""unfathomable."" Prepare inland As the record shows, places adjacent to the sea are not the only danger zones during hurricanes. Inland river flooding from hurricanes is a major risk, particularly in areas with dense populations. Urban expansion and suburban sprawl have placed more people in areas where no one lived in 1955. The Florida panhandle and Georgia Piedmont have seen extensive development. As warmer ocean temperatures contribute to heavier rainfalls and slower moving hurricanes, inland flooding is likely to increase. Until hurricane planning fully incorporates this threat, coastal communities will risk evacuating people straight into harm's way and inland residents will share a false sense of security.","The southeast of the US is at risk for more flooding from Hurricane Michael because they are still recovering from Hurricane Florence.

Stan Horaczek,"Right now, a section of the Mohawk River in Schenectady, New York, is doing its best impression of a giant snow cone. Enormous chunks of ice, some weighing thousands of pounds, have crawled up onto the shore and covered the surface of the water just down the road from the original GE plant. The phenomenon is called an ice jam, and while it’s fascinating to look at, it can cause serious floods in surrounding areas. This winter has proven especially conducive to ice jamming, due in large part to the wild temperature swings we have endured. Here’s what’s happening. This type of jam is called a breakup jam. “Rain and snowmelt cause the water level to rise and break its connection to the bank,” says Steven Daly, a research hydraulic engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab in Hanover, New Hampshire. “It breaks up the ice and the water starts moving the pieces until they reach a point where the capacity of the river can’t carry all the ice.” This typically happens when the temperatures get cold enough to form a thick layer of ice on top of the water, then warm up rapidly, which is exactly the situation the Mohawk River has been in this year. The average temperature during the first week of January stayed well below freezing, with a high that remained below zero on several days. Then, by the 13th of January, it was 60 degrees with rain, which is a perfect recipe for a pile-up like this. “The Mohawk River is famous for ice jams,” Daly says. “Long, cold winters make thick ice to cover the river. If it warms up gradually, you won’t get an ice jam. It’s rapid rise and flow that causes it.” The Army Corps of Engineers keeps an Ice Jam Database, which has already tracked more than 100 jams in 2018. New York is in the lead with 25 ice instances so far, but other states—many of which are in the northeast part of the country—are already approaching double digits. These icy traffic jams tend to happen in the same places each year because of the structures of the rivers. “Any structure that crosses the channel, like a dam, lock, log boom, or even a bridge with a lot of piers, or a sharp turn in the river can cause a jam,” says Daly. In the case of the Mohawk, it’s this railroad bridge near the old Schenectady train station that impedes the flow. Beyond the bridge, the water is frozen, but smooth. Breaking up is hard to do Once a jam is in place, there’s not a whole lot anyone can really do about it. “We would never send a boat out into a jam like this,” says Daly. “The only thing you can do is try to pick up ice from the shore using equipment.” It is, however, possible to get ahead of the problem. In 2004, a Department of Environmental Conservation project installed a jam-prevention system in a flood-prone section of the Cazenovia Creek, roughly two miles southwest of Buffalo. The system consists of nine steel-jacketed concrete piers, spaces 17 feet apart. They extend 10 feet out of the water and are five feet in diameter. In essence, they’re big cement pillars designed to control the flow of ice chunks down river to prevent them from piling up and causing floods. While the project has helped the flooding problem, it didn’t come cheap. The DEP report puts the total cost of construction at $1,828,962.60. So, while these problems may persist in some areas, it takes considerable investment in infrastructure to solve the issue. More jams are coming If temperatures continue to fluctuate, we can expect to see more of this phenomenon going forward. And while it’s very cool to look at, Daly says you certainly shouldn’t go walking on it. “It may look solid, but it’s not,” he says. “It’s impossible to get you out.” Mohawk River ice jam Some of the chunks are more than a foot thick.

Chuck Burton and Martha Waggoner / AP,"(WILMINGTON, N.C.) — With Wilmington still mostly an island surrounded by Hurricane Florence’s floodwaters and people waiting for hours for handouts of necessities like food, North Carolina’s governor is pleading with thousands of evacuees to be patient and not return home just yet. “I know it was hard to leave home, and it is even harder to wait and wonder whether you even have a home to go back to,” Gov. Roy Cooper said as officials began distributing supplies to residents of Wilmington, population 120,000. The death toll rose to at least 37 in three states Tuesday, with 27 fatalities in North Carolina, as Florence’s remnants went in two directions: Water flowed downstream toward the Carolina coast, and storms raced through the Northeast, where flash floods hit New Hampshire and New York state. Cooper warned that the flooding set off by as much as 3 feet of rain from Florence is far from over and will get worse in places. “I know for many people this feels like a nightmare that just won’t end,” he said. Still stranded by Florence’s epic floods days after the hurricane hit North Carolina, Wilmington residents lined up by the hundreds for free food, water and tarps as officials struggled to open new routes to one of the state’s largest cities. Addressing roughly 10,000 people who remain in shelters and “countless more” staying elsewhere, Cooper urged residents to stay put for now, particularly those from the hardest-hit coastal counties that include Wilmington, near where Florence blew ashore on Friday. A second shelter is opening in Carteret County. Roads remain treacherous, he said, and some are still being closed for the first time as rivers swelled by torrential rains inland drain toward the Atlantic. In South Carolina, two women died after a van was overtaken by rising flood waters near the Little Pee Dee River. Marion County Coroner Jerry Richardson told The Associated Press that the women, detainees being transported to a mental health facility, drowned at around 6 p.m. Tuesday when a van tried to cross a roadway and was overtaken by water. Their names have not been released. Two other people were sent to a hospital for observation. The White House said President Donald Trump will visit North Carolina on Wednesday to see the damage. Beforehand he boasted on Twitter: “Right now, everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence — and they are 100% correct.” He warned that the Democrats will soon start criticizing the government response, and “this will be a total lie, but that’s what they do, and everybody knows it!” In Wilmington, workers began handing out supplies using a system resembling a giant fast-food drive-thru: Drivers pulled up to a line of pallets, placed an order and left without having to get out. A woman blew a whistle each time drivers had to pull forward. Todd Tremain needed tarps to cover up spots where Florence’s winds ripped shingles off his roof. Others got a case of bottled water or military MREs, or field rations. An olive-drab military forklift moved around huge pallets loaded with supplies. Brandon Echavarrieta struggled to stay composed as he described life post-Florence: no power for days, rotted meat in the freezer, no water or food and just one bath in a week. “It’s been pretty bad,” said Echavarrieta, 34, his voice breaking. Nearby, about 200 people lined up to buy 40-pound bags of ice as quickly as a Rose Ice and Coal Co. could produce it. Supplies have been brought into the city by big military trucks and helicopters, which also were used to pluck hundreds of desperate people from homes and other structures. Mayor Bill Saffo said two routes were now open into Wilmington, which had been completely cut off by floodwaters, but those roads could close again as water swells the Cape Fear River on the city’s west side. At Fayetteville, about 100 miles inland, near the Army’s sprawling Fort Bragg, the Cape Fear River had risen about 50 feet toward a crest predicted to be more than 25 feet above flood level. On Tuesday, logs and other debris became trapped under a rail bridge as rushing brown water pushed against the span. The flooding got so bad that authorities closed a vehicle bridge in Fayetteville after the river began touching girders supporting the bridge’s top deck. Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin said it was unclear if the bridge was threatened. “We’ve never had it at those levels before so we don’t really know what the impact will be just yet,” he said. The river swallowed trees, lamp posts and a parking lot near its banks. City officials warned still-rising water threatened some neighborhoods and businesses that seemed safe, but said the worst was nearly over and life was beginning to return to normal downtown. Businesses were re-opening and owners removed sandbags and plywood from storefronts. Human and animal waste is mixing with the swirling floodwaters, which have killed about 1.7 million chickens on poultry farms. More than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage spilled into the Cape Fear River after power went out at a treatment plant, officials said, and the earthen dam of a pond holding hog waste was breached, spilling its contents. The governor said 16 rivers statewide were at major flood stage and more than 1,100 roads were closed. Emergency workers reported rescuing and evacuating more than 2,200 people and around 575 animals, he said. In a bright spot, the Lumber River appeared to be falling in hard-hit Lumberton, about 70 miles inland. Power outages in the Southeast also were down, from a high of more than 910,000 to about 245,000, nearly all in North Carolina.",North Carolina’s governor is pleading with thousands of evacuees to be patient and not return home just yet,2018-09-19T09:14:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",North Carolina Governor Pleads for Patience as Florence Evacuees Grow Anxious to Return Home,http://time.com/5400361/north-carolina-florence-evacuees-shelters/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/800-41.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,River floods,1
"USA TODAY, Christal Hayes, USA TODAY","It's deja vu for the small Maryland community in Ellicott City where devastating flash flooding has struck again, just two years after raging floods decimated the town and killed two people. USA TODAY Water rushes through Main Street in Ellicott City, Md., May 27, 2018. (Photo: Libby Solomon, The Baltimore Sun via AP) ELLICOTT CITY, Md. — Dave Callaway tried to retain his anger, frustration and sadness watching crews pile his belongings into a dumpster. It was the second time in two years he'd been forced to trash sofas, rugs and furniture because of floodwaters that crept into his Main Street home. He's watched roads turn into rivers and the rapids wreak havoc and destroy homes and businesses throughout the quaint historic mill town. And he's watched the slow pace of government officials over the years that have yet to solve the community's reoccurring flooding issues that allowed for two ""1-in-1,000-year"" rain events in two years. Local leaders have long known that storms could leave the city, which sits at the bottom of a valley, in shambles. But critics say very little over the years has been done to take on the threat head-on, even though study after study has offered both warnings of disaster and possible solutions. At the heart of the issue is a complicated web of changing threats, inadequate and expensive solutions and red tape that have left many in the town feeling they must fend for themselves to solve the town’s flooding problems or leave before they’re hit again. ""They say they care, they say they'll look at it, but how long do we have to wait to fix this?"" Callaway said. ""People are dying. People are losing everything they own. I can't do this again."" Leaders in Howard County crafted a thorough plan in the aftermath of the 2016 flooding disaster and say large changes to mitigate a flood simply can't happen overnight even though they're moving quickly. But, the downtown area, which is woven with three different rivers, isn't a stranger to flooding and numerous reports over the years, including as far back as the 1970s, have warned that Ellicott City, in particular, was in danger and a flood could devastate the area. Historically, the flood threat to Ellicott City has been from the Patapsco River overflowing. The water moves up Main Street, which was built on a hill and encompasses many of the city’s historic buildings and businesses. It happened multiple times in the 1970s, allowing a river to form throughout the community, a similar scene to what the area looked like on Sunday. More recently, the threat has changed. Water is moving down the valleys and hitting the city hard, almost acting as a bowl to catch all the rain. When Tropical Storm Lee passed through the area in 2011, homes were pummeled due to the changing threat. But little was done after. “To look in hindsight is always interesting. But when we looked at that storm, we saw it as an anomaly,” said Mark DeLuca, the deputy director of public works in Howard County. More: 'No words to describe the devastation' after Ellicott City flooding in Maryland More: In flood-hammered Ellicott City, Md., the question lingers: Do you rebuild once more? DeLuca said after the flood, Howard County commissioned a study that pointed to blocked water channels as one of the primary reasons for flooding. Another study found that the walls along streams that wind through the city needed repairs and wouldn’t hold up against heavy floods. Other studies identified solutions to the threat: The clearest way to help mitigate flooding was through retention ponds. The county rejected the plans because of the high expense and low reward since the fixtures wouldn't be a cure-all for the floods, especially for intense storms like what the area saw on Sunday. The county reversed its decision after the 2016 floods. Four stormwater retention facilities are in the progress of being planned and constructed. Last Slide Next Slide ""It’s study after study after study. That’s all they do is conduct studies,"" said Ron Peters, a property owner who works on a citizen flood group with Howard County. ""It’s just another way for them to not actually do anything."" USA TODAY read through about eight studies and reports on flooding in Howard County dating back to 1976. All highlighted Ellicott City as a high-risk threat for floods. Many offer different solutions, some of which the county implemented. But all of the posed solutions wouldn't completely fix the community's problems since much of it is centers on old structures that don't have to meet current standards for storm water management, such as retention ponds that could absorb rain.

Before, many property owners said they would have been forced to pay for upgrades out of pocket, which many could not afford. ""The county had a chance to take on and try and fix a lot of this after 2011. All of these things could have been implemented then but I don't really think the threat was taken seriously,"" Lori Lilly, another volunteer on the county's flood water group. Lilly said the measures taken up after 2016, while helpful, are coming too late. Disaster struck. Then struck again.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast. But while the winds are generating headlines and there’s a lot of questions about what category it will be when it makes landfall, the real issue is the water. And there’s going to be lots of it. It’s not that Florence’s winds aren’t a big deal—they are likely to be extremely dangerous and produce deadly flying debris—but there’s going to be a potentially historic amount of rainfall inland and powerful storm surge along the coast. Together, they’re responsible for 76 percent of all direct hurricane deaths. “There’s an old saying that those that live near the water will eventually live in the water,” Stephen Strader, a geographer who studies disasters at Villanova, told Earther. So let’s talk about that water likely to inundate people. Florence is likely to be a copious rain maker owing to how it fast (or slow) it moves ashore. Unfortunately, the National Hurricane Center calls for it to slow down as it reaches the Carolinas and then crawl inland as the winds in the upper atmosphere steering it slacken. That means the storm will have more time to unload heavy rain over the entire area under its shroud. But the slowing also means the bands of the heaviest rain that swirl around the hurricane are likely to do what meteorologists call training, a phenomenon where rain bands pass over one location repeatedly. It’s essential a race track for rain and can cause massive amounts of water to pile up on the ground in a very short period. While the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting a wide area of 15-20 inches of precipitations, higher localized totals are likely because of training. Some model runs show upwards of 40-50 inches could fall, obliterating the rainfall record for wettest storm set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when it dropped 24 inches of rain as it strafed the North Carolina coast. Models are but one piece of putting together a forecast, but the guidance they’re providing right now is really worrisome. “When these environmental wind patterns weaken, there is no mechanism to continue moving the [tropical cyclone],” Sarah Griffin, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of Wisconsin, told Earther. “A similar set-up happened with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area last year, causing Harvey to move very little for about 2 days.” Harvey was, of course, the biggest rainfall event to ever hit the U.S. so this is an extremely worrisome comparison. Compounding the issue of flooding is the type of summer North Carolina has had. In a word, it’s been a rainy one. A number of weather stations right in the center of Florence’s cone of probability have had some of their wettest summers on record. That means soils are saturated and won’t be able to handle the deluge that’s coming. “A lot of regions are associated with soil that drains poorly to begin with,” Strader said. “One thing we do know is when you replace natural vegetation with parking lots and homes and impervious surfaces, you increase the runoff.” So the rain is a huge issue. But it will likely be compounded by powerful storm surge on the coast, which also has the potential to be exacerbated by the storm slowing down as it approaches land. “If it stalls offshore or near the coast, storm surge threat will increase dramatically,” Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Needham said the size of the storm will also play a big role. Right now, Florence is wrapping up an eyewall replacement cycle, a sign that the storm is re-intensifying and could grow larger. If it does grow, the bigger wind field will give it a wider reach to whip more water toward the coast. Since we’re more than two days away and surge is very localized, we don’t yet have specific forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. But again, there’s bad news preceding the storm. Areas in Florence’s path are already seeing floodwaters rising ahead of the storm and tides are projected to remain high in the run up to Florence’s arrival. You can in part thank sea level rise for that, as it makes sunny day floods more common. “Even if you don’t think you’ll have to evacuate, the best thing to do is treat this as a trial run.” We can’t talk about the potential impacts of this storm without talking about how many people now call the area in Florence’s path home. Strader pointed to the fact that since 1940, the population residing in Florence’s cone of probability grew 1,325 percent, including a large spurt in the wake of Hurricane Hugo—the last major hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas—in 1989. That includes growth ringing metro areas like Myrtle Beach and Wilmington on the coast and Raleigh-Durham inland. “I’m concerned people may be taken off-guard by a change in forecast track,” Needham said. “People need to think not only about their elevation but their evacuation route. I’m also concerned for people inland who may think they will not be impacted by this event.” All the growth also means there’s a lot more of the pavement, which increases runoff and flooding. “It’s a backhand forehand slap with this event with the removal of natural wetlands that protect cities and landscape,” Strader said. Both Strader and Needham urged residents to have a plan in place before the hurricane arrives and pay attention to local authorities. South Carolina has already ordered the evacuation of a million people, and residents in the Outer Banks and elsewhere in North Carolina being told to go inland, ideally out of the river flood zone. If you live in these areas or anywhere else evacuation orders pop up, follow them even if you don’t feel you’re in harm’s way.","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast.

Rafael Nadal spoke with emotion about the devastation caused by flooding on the Spanish island of Mallorca. A torrential rainstorm on Oct. 9 caused flash flooding that left a trail of piled vehicles and damaged infrastructure from surges of water and mud, killing 13 people. Nadal, who is from Mallorca, knew some of the victims and his eyes filled with sadness when recounting the events in Paris on Sunday, Oct. 28. (AP Photo/Francisco Ubilla, file) (Photo: The Associated Press) PARIS (AP) His eyes saddened and his voice marked with pain, Rafael Nadal spoke about the devastation caused by the deadly flooding on the Spanish island of Mallorca. A torrential rainstorm on Oct. 9 caused flash flooding that left a trail of piled vehicles and damaged infrastructure from surges of water and mud, and killed 13 people. A vehicle carrying a 5-year-old boy and his mother was dragged away by a river of water and mud, claiming both of their lives. Nadal, who is from Mallorca, knew some of the victims. ""The mother and the son, I know them. They are cousins of one of my best friends. So I lived the situation from very inside and I really saw the drama of all these people looking for the kid,"" Nadal said Sunday in Paris, his words measured and his voice tinged with grief. ""That's part of this life and is a very unlucky situation that is almost impossible to recover from."" Some parts of the island received up to 23 centimeters (nine inches) of rainfall in around four hours, more than one third of the area's average annual amount. ""The disaster has been just like 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) away from where I live. I was at home and the rain never stopped,"" Nadal said. ""It was terrible all the things that happened in the village next to my house, and not only one, a few villages but especially Sant Llorenc."" A strong current of water and mud buried cars and pulled up trees on its way through the streets of the town of 8,000. Swamped streets and piles of overturned cars, some of them along the guardrails of a major road, were a common sight in Sant Llorenc. There were also victims in Arta, a nearby town, and in the coastal village of S'illot. Nadal described the huge sense of loss felt within the close-knit community. ""If you were not there, you can't imagine how the things were inside that village. I have a lot of family there in the village,"" Nadal said. ""The family from my mother, my grandmother, sisters and all the family from that side are from there. So I have a big connection with all of them."" Nadal helped residents to clear mud from their houses in Sant Llorenc and his tennis academy on the island offered shelter to people affected by the floods. He wants to continue offering his support. Nadal, who is making his comeback from a knee injury to play at the Paris Masters, said an exhibition event will be held in Mallorca in December to help the people of Sant Llorenc. ""In some way, the only thing that we can do is just try to support them in terms of try to help them to recover all the things that they lost. (For) human losses, there's nothing to do,"" Nadal said. ""We are trying to create something to (raise) some money for the people that lost everything in terms of material values, because people who lost life (there) is nothing to do. Things are so sad."" ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Concorde, perhaps the most iconic airliner in history, made its first commercial flight between London and New York 40 years ago today. Enjoying a journey that took a mere three hours, the rich and the rushed quaffed champagne and scoffed lobster while travelling at twice the speed of sound. Fans of the aircraft included the Queen Mother who, after taking an earlier flight on Concorde, mentioned to Captain Jock Lowe that whenever she heard the plane approaching her Clarence House home in London, she would go out on to the balcony and wave. He told her that from then on when he flew Concorde over central London he would flash the aircraft headlights in salute, which then became a tradition for all the Concorde captains. Twenty of the birdlike planes with their distinctive droop-noses were built. Seven went to the then state-owned British Airways and seven to Air France. The remaining six were prototypes that never went into passenger service. Here are some of the stories of Club Concorde members who were inspired and enthralled by their experiences of ""the pocket rocket"".

""Soon after accelerating to supersonic speed, the chief steward came on to the flight deck and informed me that among the passengers was a jazz band, complete with instruments. Moreover they wanted my permission to perform in the cabin. ""I was mildly surprised at this notion but decided that as the passenger load was quite small, 'why not?' They did play and, I learned later, made a recording of a tune that they had specially written called The Mach 2 March. ""Later, after we arrived in Bahrain, they came round to our hotel and gave a small performance in our hotel's crew party room. I then learned that our erstwhile passengers were The Temperance Seven. ""On a later visit to Bahrain their leader, whose name I have sadly forgotten, came to dinner at the crew hotel and gave me a recording that they had made and which included the aforesaid March, interspersed with my in-flight announcements.""

Forward-fast a few years and our paths had crossed. ""In 1987, the young man - Steve Dainton - and I got engaged. We married in 1988 and made a promise that we would do something very special like travelling on Concorde for our 10th year as a married couple. We were so serious about it that we opened a 10-year joint endowment policy and paid into it every month. ""We were absolutely thrilled to find we had been allocated seats 1A and 1B. These are the seats at the very front of the plane and where the information board was. ""The in-flight service was immaculate, as would be expected. We were pleasantly surprised we could get to meet the captain and other members of the crew and take photos. ""The memories of that time are now even more precious. In 2011 aged just 49, Steve died from Huntington's disease he had inherited from his father. Although he did not have the gene formally diagnosed until seven years after our trip, when we married we knew that there was a risk we wouldn't be growing old together so it was imperative we did not put off things for too long.

Sarah Boon,"Jessica Cherry. Formerly an Arctic hydrologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Jessie Cherry is now a senior hydrologist with the US Alaska-Pacific River Forecast Center in Anchorage, where she predicts river levels and flow. Shortlisted twice for NASA’s astronaut programme, she is also a commercial bush pilot with two single-engine planes. Why did you leave academia? I loved Earth science and being outside. But I spent most of my time finding funding for my research programme and staff. And as the chief scientist of the Geographic Information Network of Alaska, I had to raise another US$2 million a year. I was also unhappy with the shift towards projects with multiple principal investigators. Why did you get a pilot’s licence? Planes are the main form of transport in Alaska, so a licence is handy. From the air, I’ve photographed methane bubbles frozen in lakes, and ice build-up under bridges. What made you a good candidate for NASA’s astronaut programme? I applied because the independence required to live and work in the Arctic — like doing my own plumbing and electrical work — made me highly qualified. As a commercial pilot, I’m familiar with aviation and aircraft systems, and I can make quick judgement calls about safety and risk. Describe your job. We forecast river levels and flows — floods in particular — for public safety. I compare measured river observations against forecast data, check the weather across Alaska and forecast how precipitation will affect river flows. And I get to do side projects, such as studies of glacial outburst floods. Why did you join the forecast centre? In academia, I was so overwhelmed with grant writing that I couldn’t keep up with my field. Now I can become an expert in Arctic hydrology and examine the relationship between river flows and snowmelt, for example.

Chris Hockman,"Will bring heavy rainfall to the Southwest. It may have been downgraded, but Tropical Storm Rosa is still going to have a big impact on northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, reports USA Today. At one point, Rosa was classified as a Category 4 hurricane, but it is now listed as a Tropical Storm, and is expected to make its first landfall in Baja California — Mexico’s far western peninsula. The storm is expected to touch down on Monday night, with residents of Baja California already reporting heavy rainfall. Flood watches have been issued by the National Weather Service in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. That puts more than 12 million people at risk of the flooding that the storm will bring, with a flood warning being issued for almost all of Arizona. Arizona will see the worst of the storm, where rain is expected to reach at least six inches in some areas. The National Hurricane Center warns that the floods will be life-threatening and could also trigger landslides in the path of the storm. Flash flooding is not unusual for Arizona, with a sudden flood turning a swimming hole into a virtual raging river in Payson last year, killing 10 people after heavy rain came through the area. Rain is starting to push into Southern AZ this afternoon beginning several days of flash flood concern as moisture from TS Rosa streams into the region. Water can quickly rise in normally dry creek beds. Avoid low water crossings and turn around, don't drown. pic.twitter.com/2MAhYbedcY — NWS (@NWS) October 1, 2018 With so many desert areas in the path of the storm, the expected rainfall is expected to have a significant impact in some parts of the state. One of the towns in the path of the storm, Yuma, Arizona only sees 3.6 inches of rain a year on average. That number could be doubled in the coming days, which will cause serious issues for residents of the city. Some of the rain will be useful in the southwest which could, at least temporarily, relieve drought conditions. Approximately 40 percent of Arizona is considered to be experiencing a drought at this time. With drought conditions, the rains will sweep away dry soil much quicker than would normally happen under heavy rains, raising the chance for potential flash floods. Several schools in Baja California were closed today, with the storm sitting 75 miles west of Punta Eugenia this afternoon, with wind speeds of 45 miles per hour. Cities throughout the area have been making various preparations, on top of helping residents who wish to evacuate the area for their own safety. Many cities in Arizona have been issuing sandbags to any residents that want them to protect their properties, while airlines have issued travel waivers for travel to the southwest.",The Inquisitr Tropical Storm Rosa Expected To Make Landfall In Coming Days The Inquisitr It may have been downgraded but Tropical Storm Rosa is still going to have a big impact on northern Mexico and the southwestern United States reports USA Today.

If you're one of the millions Americans traveling for Christmas, a soaking rainstorm could lead to air and road headaches across a large part of the southern and eastern U.S. on Thursday and Friday.
A huge area of the eastern U.S. could see flooding: Some 67 million Americans live where flooding is possible, according to the National Weather Service.
In many ways, thanks to mild temperatures, the storm looks to be quite similar to the one that drenched the eastern U.S. last weekend: Lots of rain, but little in the way of snow or ice. 
The storm should start to ramp up in intensity on Thursday, which is expected to be the busiest travel day of the season this year, according to AAA.  
Folks traveling for the holidays will have lots of company this year: 112.5 million travelers are expected to take to the nations runways, roads and rails, AAA said. This ""represents a 4.4 percent increase over last year and the most since AAA has been tracking holiday travel,"" the organization said in a statement. 
On Thursday, rain is likely from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley, weather.com said. The National Weather Service said ""widespread rainfall totals are forecast to be 1 to 2 inches across the Southeast and the Appalachians eastward, with higher widespread totals of 3 inches in the Florida peninsula, eastern North Carolina, and southern New England.""
Flood watches have been posted for much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Strong winds could cause downed trees and power outages, AccuWeather warned. Beach erosion is also possible along the coast.
""Enough rain may fall to not only cause urban and poor drainage area flooding, but also lead to small stream flooding and new rises on some of the major rivers from Florida to New England as an atmospheric river sets up for a time,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Anderson said.
Some severe thunderstorms could also wallop parts of Florida, which would lead to airline delays in Tampa, Orlando and Miami. Damaging winds and tornadoes are possible, especially in eastern Florida, the Storm Prediction Center said.
Soggy conditions will continue for most of the East Coast by Friday, including the Northeast and New England. On Friday, snow could mix in on the back edge of the precipitation across the Ohio Valley and into the Appalachians, the National Weather Service said.
The storm will move away on Saturday, and clear sailing is expected for most of the East on Saturday.
The other travel trouble spot will be in the northwestern U.S., where a series of storms should continue to pelt the region with rain and snow into the weekend. The weather service said that the higher elevations of the Cascades could see 12 to 18 inches of snow, and the Northern Rockies are expecting 6 to 10 inches of snow.
Most of the central and southwestern U.S. should see dry weather this week. 
Temperature-wise, almost from coast-to-coast; above-average readings are likely. No big cool-down is likely in the days just before Christmas, which means chances for a white Christmas are very low for most of the nation.

"August Rick, Harry Cheadle","Photo illustration by Lia Kantrowitz from a photo of an Everest glacier by Heath Holden/Getty Central Asia’s glaciers make up the third-largest mass of frozen fresh water on earth, the planet’s “third pole,” The region’s “thousands of glaciers and regular snow melt form the headwaters for 10 of Asia’s biggest rivers, which bring drinking water, power and irrigation directly to 210 million people, while these river basins indirectly support more than 1.3 billion people,” according to the World Wildlife Federation. That resource is now doubling as a hazard, with glaciers skipping the melting process altogether to rupture and flood in a region that has warmed at twice the global rate of climate change. Last week, a glacier in northeastern Afghanistan burst and flooded the Panjshir River basin, killing at least ten people. The floodwater triggered landslides as it carved through the valley and damaged 56 houses, washed out two bridges, wrecked a highway, broke an irrigation canal, and swamped farmland, according to an internal report from the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental agency based in Nepal. That same week, a glacier in western China released 35 million cubic meters—or 14,000 Olympic swimming pools—of fresh water into the Yarkant River basin, prompting evacuations, Greenpeace East Asia reported. Both disasters struck in places that are not traditionally at risk for glacial outbreak floods, but catastrophes like these seemed poised to become the new normal. As glaciers heat up, meltwater can pool into lakes at their feet. The resulting glacial lakes sit behind walls of ice and debris collected by the glacier’s downhill slide called terminal moraines. Think of these as natural dams. But those dams can break due to any number of environmental triggers, including rainfall. In the Panjshir flood, an icecap melted, reportedly triggering a small landslide, which then in turn caused a glacial flood. Glacial lakes are more likely to form if the glaciers they are under intense heat, which is now very common amid global deglaciation. Different altitudes of the Yarkant River Basin have warmed between 2°C and 3.5°C since 1961, according to data that Greenpeace East Asia collected from the Taxkorgan and Shache meteorological stations in west China. These kinds of floods are increasing in frequency and tend to occur at lower altitudes, where glaciers often sit closer to civilization, said Arun Shrestha, the regional program manager for river basins and cryosphere at ICIMOD. In the Yarkant River basin, glacial outbursts have increased markedly since 1980s, research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences shows. In the Yarkant River basin, glacial outburst floods have become far more common since the 1990s. And before last week’s Panjshir flood, Shrestha told me, ICIMOD didn’t even consider glacial outbreak flooding a big issue in Afghanistan. Historically, glacial outbreak floods were normally isolated to high-altitude glaciers. But that’s no longer the case. “In the eastern Himalayas, the glaciers are quite high up. In the western Himalayas and Karkoram [a mountain range in Northwest India and Pakistan], the glaciers are quite low and quite close to the villages. So, outbursts are very dangerous,” said Shrestha. ICIMOD is now setting the groundwork for the tricky process of mapping and assessing Afghanistan’s glaciers for hazards. Because of the vast number and immense isolation of glaciers, most of the analysis needs to be done by locals trained in the proper methodology and assisted by remote sensing. The Hindu Kush mountain range in Afghanistan contains more than 3,000 glaciers and China has more than 40,000. To the north, climate change’s impact on the glaciers of Central Asia’s Tien Shan mountains, which stretch from Kyrgyzstan to China, also remains poorly understood. The vast size and complex landscapes of the Central Asian region defy generalization. Information on the conditions that lead to glacial outbreak floods, or even the solutions that mitigate the damage, do not easily translate from ecoregion to ecoregion. But the stakes of understanding these landscapes are now immense. Glacial outburst floods are geomorphic events—catastrophes by definition. And as bad as the floods are, they aren’t the only consequence of climate change on the third pole. A warmer world means less snow and more rain during winter, and quicker glacial melt in spring. Earlier melts and runoff through winter and spring could cause less fresh water resources when demand is highest, in summer and fall. “We have seen a lot of cases in the Karakorum and western Himalayas where people are already having problems getting enough fresh water to irrigate their farmlands,” said Shrestha. “In that area, the only source of water is glacial melt. Without any irrigation, they will not have any agriculture.” In Pakistan, Shrestha said, farmers have turned to innovative means of supplying fresh water for irrigation, namely solar-powered pumps and hydraulic ram pumps, which pump without electricity or diesel by capitalizing on water pressure to convey water through the irrigation system. That’s not enough, said Liu Junyan, a climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace East Asia, who added in a statement that monitoring of glacial hazards should be strengthened, climate projection modeling needs to be enhanced, and hydraulic engineering that could mitigate flood damage needs to be constructed. But the mountainous terrain of Central Asia presents a political problem as well as a glacial flooding risk. The mountain ranges themselves are often borders. Funding, innovation, communication, and policies jigsaw unevenly over the region. Shrestha works in Kathmandu, Nepal. But when we spoke, he was in Delhi, India, struggling to work his way through the various hoops of securing a visa into Afghanistan. Once there, his work will require different strategies for different communities in different places. But when asked which problem is more urgent—the flooding or the droughts, which now disturbingly come hand-in-hand—Shrestha balked at the question. “These are different kinds of problems,” he told me. “One is a slow onset problem, but with deep impact into livelihood, economic conditions, food security, nutrition, etc. Where the other—the flood—is very rapid onset, and very visible.”",Climate change is creating yet another dangerous new phenomenon.,2018-08-24T04:00:00Z,"{'id': 'vice-news', 'name': 'Vice News'}","The Glaciers on Earth's 'Third Pole' Are Bursting, Causing Deadly Floods",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3q9je/the-glaciers-on-earths-third-pole-are-bursting-causing-deadly-floods,"https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5b7cb42e06343b000ca34571/lede/1535066546034-glaciers5.jpeg?crop=0.9977777777777778xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*",vice-news,Vice News,River floods,1
Dalia Mortada,"Water levels in overflowed creeks are slowly starting to decline on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
""What used to be a dry creek is now a swelling, raging river,"" said Peri Pourier, South Dakota state representative for the district that includes Pine Ridge.
The freshman representative has been coordinating relief efforts for the community, where many residents were cut off by flooded roadways.
""There are community and tribe members getting on horseback to reach people and get them supplies,"" Pourier told NPR. 
Henry Red Cloud is a resident of the reservation and lives beside what was once a dry creek bed. He spoke to NPR as he oversaw the rescue of his dog, Chief, from his home's front porch.
""Currently we're in waders and there's a gentleman here to help me save the dog,"" he said. 
The 60-year-old Oglala Sioux Tribe member was born and raised on the Pine Ridge Reservation. 
""It's usually dry here we never get this kind of flooding,"" he said. ""It's like a 100-year flood.""
Some residents have spent nearly two weeks stranded in their homes and some have alluded to a slow response from state and federal assistance, according to The New York Times.
On the 13th day of flooding, Pourier said she's not sure why it took until the weekend for South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to deploy National Guard soldiers to the reservation. 
""I know that requests [for assistance] were made early on,"" Pourier said.
But Noem, who visited the reservation on Saturday, told The New York Times that she approved formal requests for assistance soon after the Oglala Sioux Tribe, which administers the reservation, made them.
Over the weekend, I visited Pine Ridge, Porcupine, Oglala, and Wounded Knee to see the impact of the flooding. Thankful to the SD National Guard, tribal leadership, and volunteers who are working hard to help people in need. pic.twitter.com/U02iYuX5Qq
— Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) March 25, 2019
By the weekend, Pourier confirmed, the state had deployed several teams, such as a water rescue team, and the South Dakota National Guard to distribute potable water.
""We were in Pine Ridge within 24 hours of our deployment,"" said Lt. Col. Anthony Deiss, a spokesperson for the South Dakota National Guard. 
""We were already preparing so that we could move very quickly, and our unit traveled from Watertown, which is 8 hours away,"" from the reservation, Deiss told NPR.
A blizzard followed by rapid snow melt caused fast-rising waters on the reservation, jeopardizing nearby dams and overflowing creeks and rivers. Pine Ridge community members are far from alone in the central U.S., as historic floods down the Missouri River breached levees and submerged towns through Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri over the past 10 days.
But for residents of Pine Ridge, the flooding has taken what was already a dire situation and made it ""devastating,"" Pourier said.
""We're already under-funded and strapped for resources,"" from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, she explained. ""We're already in survival mode every day."" 
Red Cloud also pointed to the situation being exacerbated by deteriorating infrastructure and a lack of support from the federal government.
""If we had funding to fix our waterways, our infrastructure here, our dams have been built like 80 years ago they're outdated,"" he explained. ""If funding was set in place we wouldn't be in the predicament that we are now.""
""Things are hard and have been hard here for generations,"" Red Cloud added.
""People are devastated,"" Pourier said.
She said that, for now, water levels seem to be stabilizing and declining on Pine Ridge, but as the region warms up through mid-week temperatures are expected near 70 degrees in Pine Ridge on Tuesday officials are bracing for the potential of more flooding.
""We still have snow that hasn't melted that could melt,"" Pourier said.","""There are community and tribe members getting on horseback to reach people and get them supplies,"" a state lawmaker told NPR.

HNN Staff,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - The Big Island appears to have taken the brunt of Lane, with more than three feet of rain in parts that triggered widespread flooding and closed roads. Parts of the Big Island continue to see torrential downpours on Saturday — even though the tropical storm warning was dropped for the region. There were reports of at least one home in Hawaiian Acres being flooded, and motorists abandoning their vehicles in rising floodwaters. On Thursday, heavy rains forced more than 100 residents to evacuate from their homes in Reeds Island near Hilo. Police and firefighters went door-to-door to urge people to flee. In Piihonua, Douglas Odell and his family were cleaning up Friday, picking through layers of muck. He said on Thursday night, the a river of water came crashing into his home. ""I could hear it coming,"" said Hilari Odell. ""When I looked outside the porch, the whole yard was covered with water."" The nearby Wailuku River often rages in heavy rains but even the Odells didn't expect so much water. They say the county has tried preventative measures, but it hasn't worked. ""They dug a trench a few years back but it's not big enough, it's really short,"" Odell said. The Odells were able to get some items and their dog out with the help of a neighbor, and they're working to clean the debris the floods left behind. The National Weather Service called the flooding on the Big Island ""catastrophic,"" and rain gauges measured more than 40 inches of rainfall in several spots over the course of three days, with Waiakea Uka receiving the most at over 45 inches. According to the Weather Channel, this makes Lane one of the wettest tropical cyclones to impact the U.S. since 1950. It's now the fourth wettest U.S. tropical cyclone on record, topped by Tropical Storm Amelia — which made landfall in Texas in 1978 with 48 inches of rain — and Hurricane Hiki — which slammed Kauai in 1950 with 52 inches of rain. No. 1 on the list: Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas last year with over 60 inches of rain. This is also the wettest three-day period ever observed at Hilo — receiving —31.85 inches — with records dating back to 1949. Hilo also measured 15 inches on Friday, making it the fifth wettest calendar day on record. Here's a look at the highest rainfall totals on the island: Waiakea Uka: 45.80 inches Piihonua: 44.68 inches Saddle Quary: 41.87 inches Waiakea Experiment Station: 41.15 inches Mountain View: 38.76 inches Glenwood: 28.61 inches Keaumo: 22.94 inches Pahoa: 22.87 inches Kawainui Stream: 14.83 inches Puu Mali: 13..21 inches The rain on the Big Island started falling late Wednesday and continued into Saturday. The heavy rains forced major road closures on the island, and residents reported widespread flooding near Hilo Bayfront. The state also closed Akoni Pule Highway north of Hawi after multiple landslides were reported. Route 130 from Keeau High School to Hawaiian Paradise Park was also closed due to severe weather and flooding on Friday night. Severe flooding also blocked parts of Highways 11 and 19. Residents are being urged to stay off the roads until the rains stop and the floodwaters recede. This story will be updated. Copyright 2018 Hawaii News Now.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence moved across western North Carolina early on Monday and continued to dump rain that has nowhere to go except to swell rivers, flood highways and homes, and threaten more lives as it heads towards Virginia and New England. For the water-logged Carolinas, “the worst is yet to come” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain, so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately,” he said. “Those rivers are going to start to crest later today and Tuesday and maybe longer.” Flash floods, landslide warnings and “prolonged significant river flooding” throughout the region will continue for the next few days, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by high flood waters early on Monday, tens of thousands of homes were damaged and at least 17 deaths were reported in North and South Carolina. Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, is expected to decline in force again on Monday before re-intensifying on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It has dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on North Carolina since Thursday and continued to produce heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the NWS said. An additional 2 to 5 inches of rain is expected with isolated areas of 8 inches possible through Tuesday in the Carolinas and Virginia. “The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference. More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said. Many rescues took place on swift boats in Wilmington, a coastal city of about 117,000 people on a peninsula between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews negotiated downed trees and power lines to reach stranded residents, Mayor Bill Saffo told WHQR radio. “There are no roads... that are leading into Wilmington that are passable because of the flooding that is taking place now inland,” Saffo said. Officials urged people who had been evacuated to stay away. “Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home, but you can’t come yet.” UNPRECEDENTED FLOODING In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 meters) over Highway 17 in what local people called unprecedented flooding. The sheriff’s department and volunteers rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets. Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable. More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. Florence set a state record for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous high of 24 inches (61 cm) from Hurricane Floyd which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather. The storm killed at least 11 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator. South Carolina’s governor urged anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate. “Those rivers in North Carolina that have received heavy rainfall are coming our way,” Governor Henry McMaster told a news conference. “They have not even begun (to crest). But they will. And the question is how high will the water be, and we do not know.” By 5 a.m. on Monday, Florence’s winds had dropped to about 30 miles per hour (45 kph), the NWS said, with weakening forecast over the next 24 hours before intensifying again as an extratropical low-pressure center.The center of the storm was about 125 miles (200 km) west southwest of Roanoke, Virginia and moving northeast at 13 mph (20 kph), the weather service said.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence was likely to weaken on Sunday as it swept through the Carolinas but dozens of communities are devastated and “epic” amounts of rain could still fall, officials said. The storm is expected to become a Tropical Depression as it trudged inland early Sunday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters kept rising. North Carolina officials have reported at least seven storm-related fatalities with unconfirmed reports of a further three deaths. South Carolina authorities reported one death. “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Winds have dropped to about 40 miles per hour (65 kph) since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane and it is crawling west over two states at 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Sunday. Taylor said the storm already dumped 30 inches of rain on some parts of the N.C. “This storm is still deadly and dangerous and it’s expected to turn northward later today into Virginia and the mid-Atlantic,” he said. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said: “This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches.” Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said. Around 50 stranded people were airlifted by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters. Roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. As of Saturday, about 676,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region next week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who had lost their lives. WORST YET TO COME Florence was drifting westward over South Carolina, reaching about 25 miles southeast of Columbia S.C. at 2 a.m. Sunday, the NHC said. Up to 40 inches (102 cm) of rain are expected along coastal areas of the Carolinas and up to 10 inches in southwestern Virginia, it said. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River. Near the Sutton Power Plant in Wilmington, coal ash leaked from a Duke Energy landfill. The site lost enough material to fill around two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement, adding that it did not believe the incident posed a risk to health or the environment. Officials had warned before the storm rains could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. Florence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths. Floyd produced 24 inches of rain in some parts of the state, while Florence has already dumped about 30 inches in areas around Swansboro. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. Some area residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern.

Ernest Scheyder,"CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. (Reuters) - As Hurricane Florence bent trees and began to peel away part of his neighbor’s roof late on Thursday night, E.J. Griffin wondered if he had made a mistake by staying at his house in Carolina Beach in defiance of a mandatory evacuation order. “There were a couple of points when I was kind of questioning my decisions in life,” he said on Friday after a harrowing night of whipping winds and soaking rain as Florence bullied across the North Carolina coast. “But we made the decision, and now we just got to ride it out.” State officials spent most of the week issuing increasingly dire warnings to people about the need to flee their homes in the face of Florence’s fury. Residents cannot be forced to follow evacuation orders. “Don’t risk your life riding out a monster,” Governor Roy Cooper pleaded on Wednesday evening, as the storm neared the coast. But some hardy - or foolhardy - residents elected to stay, gambling that the storm would fail to deliver on the worst fears of forecasters. As of Friday morning, many of those holdouts appeared to have won that bet, with a handful of exceptions. In New Bern, on the Neuse River, more than 100 people had to be saved from floods, and the downtown area was underwater. Officials warned the weakened storm would still bring life-threatening flooding to huge swaths of the state over the next couple of days. “We’ve lucked out so far,” said Cory Summer, 47, a 25-year resident of Carolina Beach, a shore town on a peninsula south of Wilmington, wedged between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic. It was virtually destroyed by Hurricane Hazel more than 50 years ago. Like many other holdouts, Summer said he had weathered numerous hurricanes in his house, evacuating only one time, for Hurricane Fran in 1996. He had bags packed just in case but decided to stay put on Wednesday, when forecasters downgraded the storm to a Category 2 hurricane. David Cain, who lives in Sea Breeze, just north of Carolina Beach, said he had two kayaks and life jackets on standby in case the storm’s flooding threatened his home, which sits a few hundred yards from Cape Fear River. “Fortunately, we haven’t found anything that’s come down on the house,” he said. “I’m pretty seasoned. We’ve done about 12 hurricanes.” Many holdouts said they were wary of leaving their houses to the mercy of the storm and then finding themselves unable to return for days, or even weeks, if flooding washes out local roads. In Morehead City, Jim Howell, 65, said he and his wife, Betsy, have lived through about 10 hurricanes, evacuating only once. That experience involved hours of bumper-to-bumper traffic and a days-long wait for authorities to reopen the bridge that connects the mainland to Carolina Beach. They were convinced staying was the better option, unless Florence strengthened into a Category 3 or 4 storm. Ryland Mason, who owns a roofing business in Carolina Beach, said he wanted to stay put so he could help neighbors – he has four-wheel-drive trucks, generators and chainsaws. “I just don’t feel like I can leave this island,” he said. “I just feel like I need to help my people. That’s the only reason we stayed.” But the potential threats presented by Florence are not yet over. With the National Weather Service predicting the slow-moving system could drop up to eight months’ worth of rain in two or three days, the risk of flooding is still real. Storm surge is another danger. “If the flooding comes from the storm surge, we could have problems,” said retiree Phil Auth, 76, who stayed behind on Hatteras Island on the Outer Banks, a string of barrier islands. Tom Pahl, a commissioner in Hyde County who lives on Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks, said he slept better on Thursday night in the midst of the storm than he had the previous three, when he was debating whether to evacuate. “It’s not true with every storm, but in this particular case, the anticipation was more agonizing than the storm itself,” he said. Kathleen O’Neal, 69, was also feeling good about her decision to sit tight on Ocracoke Island, having weathered more than 30 hurricanes in the past. She said the hurricane had passed by with little incident, though the howling wind kept her up much of the night and the power went out. “We made out very well here,” she said.

Katharine Schwab,"The Mississippi River meanders through the continental United States for 2,320 miles before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. This vastness is hard to envision–until you see a new model at the Louisiana State University Center for River Studies, complete with sand and flowing water. The super-realistic model is part of an effort to understand how the area will be impacted by climate change and other environmental phenomena in the future–and in particular, how the river’s many man-made levees impact southern Louisiana’s ability to replenish its wetlands and stave off sea level rise. These levees are basically walls that prevent the river’s natural flooding process. The problem is that without the sediment those normal seasonal floods bring to the area, the local wetlands are receding. The state has lost 1,900 square miles of land since the levees were built in the 1930s at the rate of about a football field every hour. This decades-long problem will be exacerbated with climate change-related sea level rise. If nothing is done, studies have shown that Louisiana’s coast could lose 4,120 square miles over the next 50 years, resulting in billions of dollars of damages. This is already impacting people’s lives: Louisiana is home to some of the country’s first climate change refugees. That’s where the Center for River Studies ‘ giant model of the lower 179 miles of the Mississippi comes in. Clocking in at 10,800 square-feet, or about two basketball courts, the model is a way to test and study the impact of a relatively new type of infrastructure intervention called “ sediment diversions.” These are structures built along the banks of the river that create channels through the man-made levees. They’re designed to bring sediment from the river out to the areas beyond its banks by mimicking the flooding process. In essence, diversions allow the area to reap the benefits of flooding–in a very controlled manner. If diversions are successful, they can replenish the state’s battered wetlands, counteracting the effects of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion–problems that will likely worsen because of climate change. The model also does something else: It gives people a visceral way to understand how the river works and why studying it is so important. [Photo: courtesy LSU] This isn’t LSU’s first model of the Mississippi. In the early aughts, the university and the Coastal Protection Restoration Authority (CPRA), which run the River Studies Center together, built a much smaller, 900-square-foot model to study how the river would respond to sea level rise. But this new model, which opened this month, gives the scientists far more quantitative tools to examine how the river will react to certain circumstances. The previous model covered about 60 miles of the river, but the new one covers 179 miles–necessary for the scientists to evaluate projects the CPRA is thinking about doing that are further upriver. The new model itself is far more detailed, and uses lightweight plastic fake sand that better mimics the way real sediment moves down the river. Scientists can change the locations of miniature sediment diversions, as well as the flow rate of the river and other parameters, and then test to see what happens. Because the fake sand moves much faster than real sand, they can simulate one year’s worth of time in one hour. Projectors above the model make it look more realistic and indicate the landscape, coastal features, and diversion locations. “We can look at future projects and how that would impact the river, the movement, flow rates, stages, and ultimately how that might impact river sediment diversions,” says Clint Willson, the center’s director and a professor of civil and environmental engineering. [Photo: courtesy LSU] He plans to do experiments by creating a particular scenario–like what might happen if the CPRA doesn’t build any sediment diversions–and running the physical model for 50 “years” to see what the impact looks like. Then, the scientists can add in a diversion in a particular location, or another, and see how that changes the river and the wetlands 50 years later. “It’s kind of going back to the scientific method,” he says. Why not just use a computer to do all this modeling? Willson says that using the physical model is actually faster than a computer because of the complexity of the simulations involved. To make the computer models run faster, he says that scientists often use approximations, but comparing the computer’s results to the physical model’s results might help them build better models overall. In essence, it’s another tool to study the river, one that can augment digital methods as well as the work of hydrologists out in the field, working with real-time measurements. The work is so vital because of the increasing threat of climate change, which is exacerbated in this particular region because the wetlands are sinking as the sea levels are rising. “If you think about those wetlands, a lot of them are not getting replenished,” Willson says. “When you have stresses like storms or future stresses like sea level rise, they don’t have material to help them bounce back or be more resilient.” [Photo: courtesy LSU] But there’s a delicate balance to be struck–because the Mississippi is a huge driver of the region’s economy. The levees are necessary to navigate the river and protect Louisiana’s coastal industries. “Y ou can’t just break open holes in the levee and let the river water go. The entire Midwest of the United States and the agricultural economy is depending on being able to use barges that go up and down the Mississippi River,” Willson says. “ It’s an extremely challenging problem from a political, social, economic, engineering, and ecological perspective.” That’s the final piece of what the Mississippi River model could do: Act as a physical argument for the importance of the CPRA’s work while doubling as a scientific and educational tool. After all, seeing a giant model of the river is far more interesting than reading scientific papers. “As engineers and scientists we love our PowerPoints. You think, I’ll jazz it up, we’ll show animations of our numerical models. But it’s an animation of a computer model,” Willson says. “But to have someone come out and see the river and be convinced that we’re replicating the relevant processes in our physical models, and look at the way it responds, look when the sediment moves? That’s all extremely valuable.”","With fake sand, real water, and super-realistic details, the model is a powerful tool in the fight against sea level rise.

news.com.au,"Two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers, the world’s “Third Pole”, could melt by 2100 if global emissions are not reduced, scientists warned in a major new study.
And even if the “most ambitious” Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is achieved, one-third of the glaciers would go, according to the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment.
Glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region are a critical water source for some 250 million people in the mountains as well as to 1.65 billion others in the river valleys below, the report said.
The glaciers feed 10 of the world’s most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income.
Impacts on people from their melting will range from worsened air pollution to more extreme weather, while lower pre-monsoon river flows will throw urban water systems and food and energy production off-kilter, the study warned.

As the glaciers shrink, hundreds of risky glacial lakes that could burst and unleash floods have formed in the foothills of the mountains, which include giants such as Everest and K2.
The new report was published by the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Nepal, one of eight countries on the front line.
Five years in the making, it involved more than 350 researchers and policy experts, 185 organizations, 210 authors, 20 review editors and 125 external reviewers.
“Global warming is on track to transform the frigid, glacier-covered mountain peaks... cutting across eight countries to bare rocks in a little less than a century,” Philippus Wester of ICIMOD, who led the report, said in a statement.
“This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” he added.

Kaitlyn Schallhorn,"As the southeastern coast braces for the impact of Hurricane Florence, a powerful Category 2 storm, those who live further inland could experience treacherous weather conditions as well. Florence’s winds and rains began to batter the Carolinas on Thursday. Forecasters warned as the storm continues to widen – and it is likely to linger along the coast for days – the hurricane will bring seawater surging onto land along with torrential downpours. Those who live more inland could experience flash flooding, potential tornadoes and mudslides, forecasters said.

And 15 counties in North Carolina were under a tornado watch by Thursday morning, including: Beaufort, Carteret, Craven, Dare, Duplin, Greene, Hyde, Jones, Lenoir, Martin, Onslow, Pamlico, Pitt, Tyrrell and Washington Counties. “Just because you’re not on the coast doesn’t mean you won’t get some big impact,” Graham said. Just inland in North Carolina, the hurricane is pushing water up the sounds and rivers, Joel Cline, a tropical storm program coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told Fox News. And in the Outer Banks, there are only three inlets, creating a bottleneck effect holding water upstream for an extended period of time. As the storm continues to track toward western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina, heavy rains in the mountains could trigger mudslides due to the region’s topography, Cline added. The hurricane brings “an impact that can potentially put your life at risk, so you need to plan for it,” Cline said.

Rebecca Hersher,"Mike Stone, left, and Andy Sherman in the pumping station for Hannibal, Mo., during a flood in 1993. The city has since constructed a flood wall, and flood managers have built up levees to protect against flooding. But scientists warn those structures are making flooding worse. Cliff Schiappa/AP Floods on the Mississippi River are getting more frequent and more severe. But scientists warn that the infrastructure meant to protect towns and farms against flood waters is making the problem worse. A series of analyses have helped confirm what engineers have posited for more than a century: that earthen levees built along the river are increasing flood risk for everyone, and especially hurting those who live across from them. ""When a new or larger levee is built there is often hew and cry, and if there isn't, there should be,"" says Nicholas Pinter, a geologist and the associate director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis. ""What you're doing in many cases is taking a flood plain out there — it can be 5 [or] 6 miles wide — and you're forcing the water that would otherwise spread across that area to go through a narrow passageway."" As the passageway gets narrower, the water flows faster and higher, The resulting floods are more severe than they would have been without the levees, which then drives people to build more levees, driving a ""hydrologic spiral"" of flooding, levees, more flooding and higher levees. Levee hazards are not a new idea. In 1852 an engineer named Charles Ellet Jr. wrote a report for the federal government in which he warned that confining the Mississippi River to a narrow channel caused the water to ""rise higher and flow faster."" But despite 19th century warnings, levees quickly became the go-to solution for controlling the river. After the great flood of 1927, Congress required the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a massive system of levees and dams on the Lower Mississippi. A study published earlier this year attempted to quantify the effect of that infrastructure on flooding. The authors examined river-adjacent sediment and tree rings going back 500 years, and found that floods have become significantly more severe and frequent in the last 150 years. Increased precipitation from climate change, combined with the effects of levees and dams, have ""elevated the current flood hazard to levels that are unprecedented within the past five centuries,"" the authors write. But the hydrologic spiral is a powerful thing. Doubling down on levees Faced with major floods every other year along some stretches of the Upper Mississippi, which has historically had fewer levees than the lower part of the river, many floodplain managers have built up levees and flood walls, even though doing so will only make the problem worse in the long-term. An investigation by ProPublica and The Alton Telegraph found drainage districts in Missouri and Illinois are lobbying to reduce federal flood regulation, paving the way for more and higher levees in communities that want them. A model released earlier this year by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers showed that a handful of drainage districts north of St. Louis aren't waiting for permission; they have already raised their levees above the level authorized by the Corps. The largest of them, the Sny Island Levee Drainage District in Illinois, raised its levees in response to a flood in 2008, which was the second largest flood ever recorded on the Upper Mississippi. ""In a flood fight, you raise your levees at least two feet higher than the forecast crest, and we did that,"" explains the drainage district superintendent, Mike Reed. Crews push extra sand onto Mississippi River levees in the Sny drainage district in Illinois during a flood in June 2008. M. Spencer Green/AP After the water receded, the district decided to leave the extra sand where it was to protect against the next flood, even though that violated federal height regulations. In 2015, the Army Corps announced it would withhold future federal funds for maintaining the overbuilt levees. Reed says the drainage district assesses about $2 million each year from local land owners to pay for the levee system, and that the investment has paid off. ""We have calculated that since 2001, almost $1 billion in damages has been prevented by our levee system, just in the Sny,"" says Reed. ""So, it works. It's difficult, it's hard work, it's tough, and it's 24/7. But that's what you have to do."" But multiple studies show overbuilt levees are increasing flood risk for people on both sides of the river. An analysis released earlier this year found the Sny levees have increased the height of the river during floods, pushing water into towns and farms across the river, as Eli Chen of St. Louis Public Radio has reported. 'They're sending the water our way' ""They're sending the water our way, and there's nothing we can do about it,"" says Al Murry, the emergency manager for Pike County, Mo. The county has been hit with multiple so-called 100-year floods in the last decade, destroying crops on Murry's side of the river while the other side stayed dry. ""You know, every year you just spend enormous amounts of money. It makes a mess out of a lot of property. A lot of crops are going wasted,"" he says. Murry, who is a former fire fighter, says he thinks the Sny levees are indicative of short-term thinking and poor risk assessment. ""People are greedy. That's a lot of what's going on on this river right now. It's not good for anyone."" Indeed, people who study the river say levees can also increase long-term flood risk for the farmers who pay to be protected by them. ""Just because you live behind a great, big, strong levee does not mean that there's no chance of getting flooded,"" explains Pinter. ""There are two types of levees: those that have failed and those that will fail."" When tall levees fail, the people who live and work behind them are less likely to be carrying adequate flood insurance. That's because when levees are high enough to protect against floods with a one percent chance of occurring in any given year, the federal government no longer requires homeowners living behind them to carry flood insurance. A sign in a field near Winfield, Mo., during a Mississippi River flood in 2008. The area suffered a similarly serious flood in 1993. The frequency of severity of flooding up and down the river have increased due to climate change and river control structures such as levees. Tom Gannam/AP Risk is similarly obscured in the crop insurance market. Farmers behind the Sny levees are paying half as much to insure fields along the Mississippi River as their neighbors across the river are, explains crop insurance salesman Matt Jones. ""It's based on flood risk, and the area behind the levee is considered lower risk,"" he says. Since crop insurance is a federally subsidized program, if the levee-protected fields are ever inundated, much of the cost would be born by taxpayers. ""When they do have a catastrophic flood, it's going to be a big loss,"" says Murry. ""It's going to be huge. It's going to affect the cost of living. And everybody's going to pay for it."" Reed insists the Sny's risk assessment is sound. ""In an excess of 100 years we've had one levee breach,"" he says. He doesn't agree with data that shows levees increase flood risk. ""A model is a theory. What actually is happening, to me, is more important that what a theory says."" Reed say people feel safe behind his district's levees, at least relatively so. But he admits, ""Mother Nature is a tough thing to predict.""","For more than 150 years, scientists have known that levees increase flood risk on the Mississippi River. That hasn't stopped local officials from building up levees in response to more severe floods.",2018-05-21T15:15:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Levees Make Mississippi River Floods Worse, But We Keep Building Them",https://www.npr.org/2018/05/21/610945127/levees-make-mississippi-river-floods-worse-but-we-keep-building-them,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/17/ap_930714069_wide-2cc80a62f899692b73232a33b514d4224850a591.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,River floods,1

Clive Thompson,"There are tons of houses worldwide in coastal areas, and as climate change proceeds, they'll see more and more flooding. Those owners can't all afford to move. So the Buoyant Foundation Project is developing an ingenious adaptation concept: Instal floaty material to underside of the house, so when floods arrive the house rides up above the waves -- settling back down when the water recedes. It's super clever resilience engineering, retrofits existing buildings (instead of requiring new construction), and is relatively cheap to boot. The New Yorker 's web site reports : A typical New Orleans shotgun house sits slightly above the ground, resting atop short piers; the researchers could, they thought, fasten a steel frame to the underside of a house and affix a set of foam buoyancy blocks. Then they could sink posts into the ground and attach them to the corners of the frame, allowing the house to rise up off the piers without floating down the street. English and her students built a full-scale prototype of the system, and in the summer of 2007 they put it to the test. They borrowed some corral panels from the College of Agriculture and built a temporary flood tank around their model amphibious home, pumping in water straight from the Mississippi River. The tank filled with two, three, four feet of water, and the house began to rise. By the time they stopped pumping, it was hovering about a foot above the piers. “It was a religious experience when it lifted off,” English recalled. The system was simple and cheap; it could be installed by two reasonably handy people without heavy equipment for between ten and forty dollars a square foot. It left a building’s appearance and structure almost unchanged, and it was more resilient than permanent elevation, which can cost two or three times as much and make a building more susceptible to wind damage. “This is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” English said, noting that the system would not provide adequate protection against high-speed waves. “But it’s an excellent solution for some circumstances.","There are tons of houses worldwide in coastal areas, and as climate change proceeds, they'll see more and more flooding.

Dan Vergano,"Hurricane history has a dire warning for Hurricane Florence, now a Category 4 storm with sustained winds around 140 miles-per-hour, aimed right at North Carolina and South Carolina. Upgraded in strength on Monday, and threatening to become a Category 5 storm, the major hurricane has prompted evacuations from coastal counties in both Carolinas and Virginia. Current projections place North Carolina in the storm’s bullseye. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, you need to get ready for this storm now and you need to evacuate if asked to,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement. He cited storm surges along the coast, flooding from rains inland, and high winds statewide as reasons for concern about life-threatening dangers of the hurricane. Cooper has good reason to worry, based on past major hurricanes that have hit his state and those nearby hard, all doing damage in different, severe ways that took lives and cost billions of dollars in damages. Experts such as Nick Petro of the National Weather Service are pointing, in particular, to storms such as Hurricane Hugo in 1989 (the last major hurricane to hit South Carolina), Hurricane Fran in 1996 (the most recent major hurricane to strike North Carolina), and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as models for the mayhem threatened by the coming storm. Hurricane Florence threatens to pack the combined wallop of all three storms, with projected 20 foot storm surges along the coast, 145 mph high winds of a Category 4 (or higher) major storm, and more than 10 inches of heavy rainfall possible, dumping rainwater on the already sodden Eastern Seaboard. A high pressure weather system developing north of the storm threatens to slow its progress after landfall, raising the specter of it parking in place like Hurricane Harvey last year over Houston, dropping tremendous amounts of rainfall, perhaps 20 inches, on North Carolina and Virginia. “The bottom line is that there is high confidence that Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane, regardless of its exact intensity,” according to a National Hurricane Center advisory about Hurricane Florence. Hurricane Hugo landed just north of Charleston, South Carolina, on September 22, 1989, as a Category 4 storm with maximum winds of 140 mph, the most intense storm to hit the East Coast above Florida in the last century. At one time a Category 5 storm, Hugo followed a curling upper-cut path that reached eastern Puerto Rico before steaming northward. When it reached the US mainland, it delivered a storm surge just above 20 feet high, enough to flood the cafeteria of a school in McClellanville, South Carolina, where people had taken refuge from the storm and had to climb to the rafters or stand atop tables to escape the rising water. “The enormity of the situation was staggering,” according to one survivor’s account. Sixty people died from the storm, 35 of them in South Carolina. Additionally, thousands of people were left homeless. Hugo was a fast traveller, however, which limited flooding from rainfall. It also meant it arrived over North Carolina’s Outer Banks still a Category 1 hurricane, with gusts as high as 87 mph. Tracing a path similar to the one tracked by Florence, Hurricane Fran picked up steam crossing the Atlantic, and roared past the Bahamas to become a Category 3 storm. Fran arrived ashore at Cape Fear, North Carolina, on the evening of September 5, 1996, with 115 mph winds and up to 12 feet of storm surge. The storm delivered 79 mph wind gusts in the state capital Raleigh, toppling trees and power lines more than 200 miles inland, and dumping rain that led to dozens of dam failures. According to the Charlotte News &amp; Observer, “the storm was a meteorological wake-up call for millions of North Carolina residents,” who had forgotten about the power of hurricanes to reach inland. Some 26 deaths resulted from the storm, and it caused about $4.1 billion in damages. The storm was so devastating that the name “Fran” was taken off the list of future storm names. A Category 5 bruiser that never quite hit the US mainland as a major storm, Matthew still dealt tremendous damage through flooding, in a 36-hour trek offshore that ended with its landfall as a Category 1 storm on October 8, 2016, near unlucky McClellanville, South Carolina. Overall, the storm killed more than 600 people as it travelled from the Caribbean — the site of most deaths — to the US, and caused $15 billion in damages. The storm knocked out power and triggered evacuations from Florida to South Carolina as it powered up the coast. Its torrential rains caused widespread flooding in North Carolina and Virginia, with river heights cresting at record levels, feet above marks set by Hurricanes Hugo and Fran. Roughly 100,000 homes and other buildings were damaged in North Carolina alone. In an analysis released on Monday, coastal geologist Robert Young of Western Carolina University compared possible flooding from Florence to the “ flood of the century ” left behind by another deadly storm. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd created a “500-year flood” that left whole towns underwater, their residents clinging to rooftops. Caskets floated from graves, and lagoons filled with hog farm waste overflowed, leading rescue workers to smear their noses with menthol ointment to kill the stench. Of 87 people killed by the storm, 52 died in the flooding in North Carolina. Ten years on, a burst of construction and increased population in the state makes inland flooding from Florence even more dangerous. Villanova University’s Stephen Strader noted more than 11 million homes are now in the cone of the storm’s projected landing zone inland. “Everybody’s focused on the cone, which does not imply anything in the ways of impacts,” Steve Pfaff, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said about Florence projections. “This is a huge system. It’s a big engine. And its impacts are going to be so far outside of the center tracks — there’s a potential for millions of people to be impacted by this.”","Following in the footsteps of Hurricanes Matthew, Fran, and Hugo, Hurricane Florence promises rain, floods, and power outages in the Carolinas.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","The view from Stoney River Lodge, just off U.S. 34 between Loveland and Estes Park, Colo., is what owner Linda Napier calls a slice of heaven carved from ancient rock. The steep ledge of Palisade Mountain rises just across the highway, while the sound of water crashing over boulders in Big Thompson River often fills the piney mountain air. But today Napier and her guests look out upon a closed road, dust clouds and a river muddied with silt. “I had some guests last week, but nobody is coming on their own yet,” Napier said in a recent telephone interview. “They say we were allowed to open for business on May 1, but people still have to be guided in here by the state. It’s a hassle, but hopefully, we’re getting something good for it.” Such is the short-term cost of climate adaptation in the Front Range, where the Colorado Department of Transportation is rebuilding a primary conduit to Rocky Mountain National Park to withstand a future of climate instability. State officials say their efforts will pay off in the form of heightened readiness for extreme weather events like wildfires and canyon floods that destroy roads, utility lines, motor vehicles, homes and businesses—and sometimes take lives. Memories are still sharp from the last flood in Big Thompson Canyon, in 2013, when a September cold front stalled over the east side of the Rockies, colliding with warm, moist southerly air to produce more than 15 inches of rain over a six-day span. It was the worst flood in state history, resulting in 10 deaths—including two drownings in Big Thompson Canyon—and nearly $4 billion in property damage, including hundreds of miles of crumbled roads and collapsed bridges. The last time the canyon had sustained that degree of damage was in 1976, when a similarly rare rainstorm and flash flood overwhelmed the Big Thompson River, killing 144 people. The 2013 flood also gave birth to the Colorado Resiliency &amp; Recovery Office, a state agency whose mission, Director Iain Hyde said, “is to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself” in places like Big Thompson. Repairing the roads has cost the state more than $745 million, including more than $300 million to re-engineer roughly 17 miles of canyon highway along U.S. 34 and nearby U.S. 36, two of the most popular routes into Rocky Mountain National Park. Nowhere have the challenges been steeper than Big Thompson Canyon, where floodwaters scoured away not only pavements and guardrails but roadbeds and subsurface geology, effectively leaving sections of highway unsound and unsafe. But with challenge comes opportunity. Under orders from Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), who had begun aligning Colorado’s environmental policies with climate mitigation and adaptation goals, CDOT embarked on a new, more resilience-oriented approach to highway reconstruction. The 15-mile stretch of U.S. 34 near Stoney River Lodge would be a major test of those principles. “We were given a mandate by the governor to not just build it back, but to build it back better than it was before,” said CDOT spokesman Jared Fiel. “He wanted to make sure the second-largest airlift of people in U.S. history was not going to be revisited.” Adaptation required smoothing out the road’s famous Horseshoe Curve, near mile marker 78 just east of Napier’s lodge. The curve, one of the deepest bends in the Big Thompson River, has long been a tension point between river and canyon, as several million years of scouring from spring snowmelts and periodic floods have eaten into the canyon’s north wall, requiring road builders to periodically back the highway away from the river. Not anymore. With the rebuild, set to be completed later this year, CDOT abandoned the old right of way, which aligned the road to the river, and instead chose to cross the canyon with a bridge that cost tens of millions of dollars more but makes the road more safe, secure and resilient in the face of future floods. “In the case of Horseshoe Curve, we said, ’Let’s let the river have it. She’s taken it twice before, so let’s pull back and let her have it for good,” Fiel said. “You’re also reclaiming some of the natural beauty of the canyon, too, since the trip is the destination for a lot of people.” For her part, Napier is hoping the new road translates into more stopovers at her lodge, which boasts “blue ribbon trout fishing, secluded hiking trails, plenty of space for picnics and a variety of outdoor games.” She doesn’t know whether the new highway will be more resilient than the one it replaced. “This canyon has been flooding for hundreds of years, long before any of us came in here,” she said. “My view is it’s going to continue to happen. I just hope I’m not here the next time it does.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

Meanwhile, an atmospheric river — aka the Pineapple Express — will pay a visit to the West Coast this weekend, bringing the threat of heavy rain, flooding and potentially record warm temperatures. Record cold is possible this weekend all the way from Montana to Wisconsin and as far south as Oklahoma, with temperatures more typical of late January than early April. Weather Channel meteorologist Michael Palmer called it a ""ridiculous late season arctic outbreak,"" warning that a hard freeze is possible all the way into the Deep South. The National Weather Service said high temperatures in the northern and central Plains along with the Upper Mississippi Valley will be nearly 30 degrees below normal Friday. The colder air will flow into areas from New England to the southern Plains by Saturday — with high temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees below normal. Below-zero wind chills will add to the weather misery. While unpleasant for humans, the intense cold is risky for baby animals. In Montana, the weather service issued a ""cold advisory for newborn livestock,"" (livestock that are less than 24 hours old) because ""these animals are least able to regulate their body temperature and therefore most susceptible to the cold.""

On Friday, snow will fly across the northern Rockies, northern Plains and Midwest. On Saturday, a swath of heavy snow is likely to spread from the mountains of West Virginia, western Maryland and northwestern Virginia to the upper mid-Atlantic coast and southern New England, AccuWeather said. If an inch of snow falls in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, that would be the biggest April snowfall there in almost 100 years. Airline delays and flight cancellations related to deicing operations and poor visibility are likely at the major hubs from Cincinnati and Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, AccuWeather said. Yet another snowstorm will wallop the northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Sunday. In Minneapolis, where 8-10 inches is possible, the Twins baseball game Sunday will likely be snowed out. Pineapple Express heads for California The West will endure weather misery of a different kind: Heavy rain that could lead to floods. In portions of northern California, ""flooding is a concern from Friday through Sunday,"" the weather service warned. In areas burned by recent wildfires, mudslides and debris flows will be a concern, AccuWeather said. There is an upside to the rain. ""Despite the threat for flash flooding and mudslides, this rain will help to further fill area reservoirs prior to the dry season this summer,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Rathbun said. Temperatures will also be rather mild, with some record warm nights possible, meteorologist Ryan Maue of weather.us said.

"Adam Aton, Daniel Cusick, E&E News","A few inches separate turgid floodwater from everything Mona Houser owns. Some rooms in her trailer already dip below the water, and her family’s scared to flush the toilet for fear of what might come back up. She has no insurance and feels like nobody’s coming to help. “Us poor people, we’re screwed,” she said. The severity of Hurricane Florence’s destruction caught some residents here by surprise, and they said local officials are overwhelmed, too. The storm’s devastating flooding is a sign that coastal states should prepare for future hurricanes to hit harder—and differently—than they have in the past, according to experts who study climate change. For now, few cities or counties have begun adapting to storms that promise to be wetter, from rain and higher seas, because it’s hard to believe such extreme conditions could be common enough to plan for, said Sarah Watson of the Carolinas Integrated Science &amp; Assessments and the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium. Florence’s rainfall hit especially hard because the region was already saturated by an unusually wet summer. North and South Carolina broke their annual rainfall records, joining Texas and Hawaii to make four new state records in the past year, according to The Washington Post. “Our challenge is trying to manage the everyday [weather] that suddenly seems completely out of character,” Watson said. “The afternoon thunderstorm that sits over a localized area and drops 6 inches of rain in two hours—you can’t adapt to that. You can’t build infrastructure to manage that. Even if you could, you couldn’t afford it.” ‘Not really our fault’ The Cape Fear River rose yesterday to 63 feet. That’s enough to discharge 33 times its average amount of water, according to preliminary measurements by the U.S. Geological Survey at Lillington, N.C. More than 72 hours after landfall, people hit by Florence are still desperate for help. The storm has killed at least 32 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Tens of thousands of residents remained separated from their homes, especially in inland flood zones. Many of the areas underwater also flooded in 2016 during Hurricane Matthew. Some residents wondered why the region wasn’t better prepared for this one. The Cape Fear River has swelled to almost twice the height of its flood stage. Adapting to more frequent conditions like that will be slow, hard work, said Kirstin Dow, a University of South Carolina geographer who researches climate change decisionmaking. “I know people have been talking about this,” she said, “but it takes a very long time to make that kind of large-scale shift in thinking.” Cash-strapped rural communities sometimes need years to address problems. And in North Carolina, much of the state’s adaptation dollars have gone to wealthier cities like Raleigh and Charlotte, said Jessica Whitehead, a hazards adaptation specialist at North Carolina Sea Grant. “It’s been a luxury for communities that have the ability to think beyond the next year or five years,” Whitehead said. But for much of the rest of the state, she said, “the focus is on right now, today, maybe tomorrow.” ‘We have no choice’ Still, some residents didn’t have to think very hard about what adaptation would look like. They just pointed at what Florence broke. Laura Davis was angry that buildings constructed in the last decade fared so poorly in the storm. Her future sister-in-law’s new house lost its roof, and it felt like they’d been swindled, she said. “Every home in North Carolina should be covered for hurricanes. And we shouldn’t have to pay for it, because it’s not really our fault,” she said over the sound of a pump sucking out floodwater covering her backyard. Davis’ family moved to the Carolina coast from Virginia’s Tangier Island, one of the most vulnerable places in the country to climate change. Unlike that spot in the Chesapeake Bay, she sees plenty of opportunities to harden her town: drainage areas, more resilient cell towers, buried power lines. The problem is how to pay for those things in rural communities where the tax base is narrow and local government’s footprint is small. “A lot of people are still asking themselves, ‘What does this even look like in a small town in North Carolina?’” said Whitehead, whose program is headquartered at North Carolina State University. The damage from Florence adds up to a bigger problem for Davis’ family: “Our biggest concern is we’re not going to work this week. We’re not going to have money,” she said. Back in Houser’s trailer park, the water pooling around her home didn’t strike her as a mystery. The 53-year-old waved a Newport cigarette as she talked about how melting ice caps are affecting the weather. “I’m just a poor country girl, and I know about the environment,” she said, mentioning that nobody could miss how the beach waters had stayed so warm or how many summer days had cracked 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Even if Florence is a glimpse of the new damage that climate change could cause here, that doesn’t mean people will leave. Many of them don’t have the money to move. “We have to stay here,” Houser said. “We have no choice.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","It's deja vu for the small Maryland community in Ellicott City where devastating flash flooding has struck again, just two years after raging floods decimated the town and killed two people. USA TODAY Residents gather by a bridge to look at cars left crumpled in one of the tributaries of the Patapsco River that burst its banks as it channeled through historic Main Street in Ellicott City, Md., Monday, May 28, 2018. (Photo: David McFadden, AP) Blame it on the rain. And the topography. But global warming? Maybe not so much. Residents and business owners in historic Ellicott City were picking up the pieces Monday after the second ""1-in-1,000-year"" rain event in two years walloped the Maryland town on the banks of the Patapsco River. More than eight inches Sunday triggered flash flooding that sent a wall of water down Main Street, reaching the second floor of some buildings and sweeping cars into culverts. Two years ago, 6.5 inches of rain fell on Ellicott City in about 3 hours, with 5.5 inches falling in just 90 minutes, the National Weather Service said. That was dubbed a 1-in-1,000-year rain event. AccuWeather Meteorologist Brian Lada stood by the statistics. The odds reflect the chance of the heavy rains, not necessarily flooding, he added. ""It's a really rare event that just so happened to occur two years apart,"" Lada told USA TODAY. ""That 1-in-1,000 doesn't take into account the topography of the area.""

Four creeks converge on the town enroute to the Patapsco. There was no place for the water to go. ""The worst flooding was Main Street, which is all concrete, so it flowed right through,"" Lada said. ""There were heavy, drenching thunderstorms training over the area with several inches of rain per hour. An incredible rate."" Lada said the storms were fed by extensive moisture in the air being experienced around the region. Many areas were blasted by storms, but Ellicott City just happened to be hit over and over again. The river level spiked almost 18 feet in two hours, reaching an all-time record high, he said. ""They got several inches of rain per hour,"" he said. ""The area only averages about four inches of rain for all of May. Ellicott City got two months of rain in two hours."" Lada was unwilling to link the vicious storms, two years apart, to global warming. ""It's such a localized, small-scale event that the big climate debate wouldn't really have an impact,"" he said.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice and John Bacon, USA TODAY","Officials say recent flooding in parts of Nebraska has caused nearly $1.4 billion in estimated losses and damage. (March 20)
 AP, AP
Flooding that has overwhelmed levees and swamped a wide swath of the Midwest since last week's bomb cyclone storm is creating a ""slow-moving natural disaster"" with damages that total at least $3 billion.
Friday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said the damage cost in her state is an estimated $1.6 billion, so far. Earlier this week, Nebraska's damage total was reported to be over $1.4 billion.
Damage costs from other flooded states, such as Missouri, Kansas, South Dakota, Minnesota and Illinois, have yet to be tabulated. 
At least 3 people have been killed due to the flooding. 
On Thursday, Iowa Gov. Reynolds sent a request to President Donald Trump seeking an expedited Presidential major disaster declaration for 57 counties severely impacted by floods along the Missouri River and across the state. Across the state, water has inundated homes and businesses, destroyed crops, and forced evacuations.
Nebraska's cleanup is also a mammoth task. Damage to roads, levees and other structures in the state has reached almost $450 million. Crop losses were at $440 million and cattle losses totaled $400 million.
""I don't think there's ever been a disaster this widespread in Nebraska,"" he said.

While rivers are receding for now across parts of Nebraska, Wisconsin and Iowa, water draining downstream is causing the Missouri River to rise across northeastern Kansas and Missouri, AccuWeather said. The river's water levels are forecast to challenge the crest record of 31.63 feet at Atchison, Kansas, by the weekend.
As of late Friday, at least 100 river gauges in the central U.S. were listed at ""major"" or ""moderate"" flood stage, the National Weather Service said. 
Then there is the Mississippi River to contend with. The river is forecast to reach major flood stage in St. Paul, Minnesota, by the end of March, AccuWeather says.
""It is possible that many parts of the Mississippi River will remain above flood stage ... into the first part of the summer in the slow-moving natural disaster,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.

The bomb cyclone hammered more than a dozen states with heavy snow and/or rain along with high winds. Much of the region was already saturated or the ground frozen, meaning the water could not be absorbed. The result: More than a dozen states have dealt with flooding, flood watches and flood warnings.
In Minnesota, 35 of the state's 87 counties are already battling flooding or ice jams, city emergency management officials said.
Last SlideNext Slide
""Significant winter snowpack, deep frost, increased soil moisture, late thaw, recent precipitation and above normal streamflows are all contributing to a higher risk of flooding throughout Minnesota,"" the agency warned.
More: The waters are rising, the floods are coming. What can we do?
While Missouri River levels are on a downward trend, they will start to rise again when snow in South Dakota begins to melt, warned David Pearson, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Omaha, Nebraska.  He expects to see that secondary rise of an additional 1 to 2 feet by April 1.
I think we should be vigilant to that for the next month, possibly more,"" he said.
In Wisconsin, rivers have been receding since early in the week. But the National Weather Service warned that the reprieve may not last long.
""There is still 10-25 inches of snow across northern WI,"" the officer tweeted. ""This will continue to melt over the next several days, and could cause rivers to start rising as it does.""
In Missouri, the town of Craig, 100 miles north of Kansas City, was underwater. A mandatory evacuation was ordered for the  250 residents.
""Darkness has settled over town, and all you can hear is the sound of rushing water and the damn railroad signals going off,"" the town tweeted. ""@BNSFRailway no trains coming but plenty of water on the tracks. Sleep tight River Rats tomorrow is a new day.""

"Shah, T., Ray, C., Lele, U.","For millennia, the Ganges River, holy to Hindus, has provided livelihoods, food, and water for Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. Last month, one of India's leading environmental activists died after a 111-day hunger strike, failing to evoke changes to save India's most revered river (known as Ganga). After years of unrelenting abuse, Ganga is now one of the world's worst polluted rivers. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed in 2014 to clean Ganga by 2019, but despite increased funding and much lip service, the river is more polluted than before. Mr. Modi needs a new strategy. Pressure on Ganga has been building for decades. With a tripling of human population since 1950 and rapid urbanization, 50 cities along Ganga daily release 6 billion liters of untreated sewage into the river, by far the largest source of pollution. Untreated industrial effluents compound the problem, together with run-off of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Unfettered disposal of human and animal corpses into Ganga makes it unfit even for ritual bathing. Barrages and hydroelectric projects on the main stem of Ganga and its tributaries divert 60% of their waters, leaving little mainstream flow, which further concentrates pollutants in the river. Women worship on polluted bank of the Ganges, in Allahabad, India. PHOTO: RITESH SHUKLA/NURPHOTO/GETTY IMAGES despite increased funding and much lip service, the river is more polluted than before. Earlier governments tried cleaning Ganga, investing some U.S.$14 billion, mostly in plants that treat sewage to an acceptable level of pollutants before discharge into waterways. Mr. Modi brought a new sense of urgency to the task, allocating U.S.$27 billion up to 2019. But money alone will not clean the river. Complex long-standing issues must be addressed, including increasing involvement of stakeholders, reducing corruption in pollution control agencies, increasing accountability and rule enforcement, and inciting behavioral change among citizens. This requires tackling three interrelated challenges, each involving different stakeholders. Municipalities must curtail discharge of untreated sewage and rapidly build sewerage infrastructures. Pollution control authorities must ensure treatment of municipal and industrial effluents to the needed standards. And water managers must enhance river flow so that secondary treated waste can be safely discharged into Ganga. Since 1855, a profusion of barrages and dams has diverted water from Ganga and its tributaries for hydropower and canal irrigation. But over the past five decades, farmers have increasingly turned away from canal irrigation to shallow tube wells. Herein lies a big opportunity for cleaning Ganga. During the 1970s, modelers recommended cranking up the Ganges water machine to relieve flooding in the eastern parts of the river basin by promoting intensive groundwater-based irrigation during winter and summer months. The strategy was to draw down basin water tables in the copious alluvial aquifers. Shallow aquifers would then absorb monsoon floods and snowmelt, and protect Bihar, North Bengal, and Bangladesh from annual floods. Monsoons would replenish aquifers that shallow tube wells could then tap into for irrigation. This concept did not catch on back then, but today, the water machine is alive and kicking thanks to easy access to credit and cheaper drilling technology. With over 6.5 million shallow tube wells in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, the Ganga basin is one of the most densely plumbed aquifer systems in the world. More than 80% of farmers depend on these wells. The water machine would be revved up even more but for the high cost of diesel that farmers must use to pump groundwater. But affordable electricity or solar pumps could wean farmers from canal irrigation, leaving more water to flow in Ganga and its tributaries, without adversely affecting hydropower. The quickest, cheapest, and most effective way for Mr. Modi to show a less polluted Ganga by 2019 would be operating dams and barrages in the Ganga basin with the sole objective of augmenting river flows. This would be a start to controlling discharge of untreated sewage and industrial waste, which will take a long time. * The views expressed in this editorial are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of their institutions.","For millennia, the Ganges River, holy to Hindus, has provided livelihoods, food, and water for Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.

It’s expected to speed up slightly through Tuesday night as it passes between Mexico and Cuba, before tacking northeast on Wednesday and Thursday. The following NOAA graphic shows the likely path of Hurricane Michael’s center (it does not show the estimated size of the storm): A hurricane watch is in effect along the Alabama-Florida border down to the Suwanee River. Hurricane conditions are expected within the next 12 hours, according to the NHC. Parts of the Florida panhandle near Pensacola down to Anna Maria Island, including Tampa Bay, are under storm surge watch. What’s expected to become Hurricane Michael is forecast to dump between 4 and 8 inches of rainfall on parts of the Panhandle and the Big Bend with isolated downpours of up to 12 inches, potentially causing life-threatening flash floods.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright A.Singh Image caption Drilling sediments in the Ghaggar-Hakra palaeo-channel Further light has been shed on the emergence and demise of one of the earliest urban civilisations. The Indus society came to prominence in what is now northwest India and Pakistan some 5,300 years ago thanks in large part to the sustenance of a long-lost Himalayan river. Or so it was thought. New evidence now indicates this great water course had actually changed its path and disappeared before the Indus people had even settled in the region. That they lacked the resource offered by a big, actively flowing river will come as a surprise to many; the other early urban societies of the time, in Egypt and Mesopotamia, certainly benefitted in this way. The new research was led from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and from Imperial College London. Image copyright NASA/USGS Image caption Infrared satellite imagery picks out the distinctive sediments of the ancient channel Image copyright S.Gupta Image caption Remnant of a street in the urban centre of Kalibangan The group's scientists do not disagree that the Bronze Age settlements would have needed a good water supply, but argue that this requirement could have been met instead by seasonal monsoon rains that still collected and ran through the valley abandoned by the old river. ""Our paper clearly demolishes the age-old river-culture hypothesis that assumed that the disappearance of the river triggered the demise of the Harappan civilisation,"" said IITK's Prof Rajiv Sinha. ""We have argued that while large rivers have important connections with ancient societies, it is their departure that controls their stabilisation rather than their arrival. ""This has clearly been demonstrated by the large difference in age data between the demise of the river (8,000-12,000 years ago) and the peak of mature civilisation (3,000-4,000 years ago),"" he told BBC News. Prof Sinha and colleagues report their findings in this week's Nature Communications journal. Image copyright A.Carter/Birkbeck, University of London Image caption A collection of mineral grains that helped trace the origin of the palaeo-river They have examined afresh the course of what is referred to as the Ghaggar-Hakra palaeo-channel, from satellite data and from field investigations. Much of the archaeology of Indus cities, such as Kalibangan and Banawali, is scattered along this old river course. The team shows the relict valley to be the former trace of today's big Sutlej River, which must have abruptly changed course - as many Himalayan rivers are prone to do. ""They tend to switch on 100-year timescales,"" explained Prof Sanjeev Gupta from Imperial College. ""But because the Sutlej became incised in its new course, it never switched back and that left the paleo-channel protected. That allowed, I believe, the Indus communities to flourish because they were saved from devastating floods. ""Some of their sites were actually built in the palaeo-channel itself and that makes no sense if there was a big raging Himalayan river there at the time because these people would have been wiped out."" Image copyright S.Gupta Image caption Broken pieces of Indus pottery exposed at the surface at Kalibangan Dating of the sediments in the palaeo-channel was done using a technique known as optically stimulated luminescence. It reveals that the initial abandonment of the valley by the Sutlej River commenced after about 15,000 years ago, with complete ""avulsion"" to its present course shortly after 8,000 years ago. Prof Gupta said the Indus people were competent engineers and so would have been able to manage their water needs, potentially even accessing underground supplies. But precisely how they operated in these circumstances of reduced water possibilities was now really a question for the archaeologists to answer, he added. ""What is clear though is that this culture had a diverse landscape and they were able to adapt to it,"" he told BBC News. Prof Rita Wright is an anthropologist at New York University and unconnected to the new research. She said it represented a ""major building block"" in our understanding but stressed also that it concerned just a part of the region occupied by Harappan society. ""It is focused primarily on a single area in northwest India, [but] enormously important. ""In contrast to the Indus Valley, it presents (and provides evidence for) a very different water ecology.

Umair Irfan,"Forecasters expect heavy rain, floods, and potential landslides. Another Pineapple Express is bringing massive April showers to California this week. And this one is so big it may set records. A Pineapple Express is an example of an atmospheric river, a channel in the atmosphere that moves vast amounts of moisture. This kind forms over Hawaii (hence “pineapple”) and directs moisture toward the West Coast. Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climate scientist, told Vox last month that it channels “more water than the Mississippi River.” The last Pineapple Express hit the West Coast in late March, bringing torrents of rain that caused flooding and mudslides and triggered evacuations in Southern California. Now, the National Weather Service is expecting upward of 8 inches of rain in parts of the San Francisco Bay Area from Thursday through Saturday.

Tassanee Vejpongsa,"The members of the Wild Boars are a team both on and off the soccer field, traveling to competitions, cycling mountain roads and swimming in waterfalls together. Now, 12 of the boys and their coach are lost, together, in a flooded cave in northern Thailand. The boys, ranging in age from 11 to 16 and hailing from schools across Chiang Rai province's northern reaches, have been missing since they entered the sprawling Tham Luang Nang Non cave on Saturday afternoon, after a morning intrasquad match on a nearby field. Leading the way as always was Ekapol ""Aek"" Chanthawong, their 25-year-old coach. ""Coach Aek is very dedicated to the team,"" said Noppadon Kanthawong, whose 13-year-old son plays on the Wild Boars but decided to skip Saturday's cave trip. ""He would be there at the field waiting for kids to show up after school. It is a great way to keep healthy, away from screens and have friends. I can tell that they are very close to each other."" Noppadon and his son were huddled Tuesday with other teammates and anguished relatives at the entrance to the cave awaiting any word from the navy SEAL divers and other rescuers working inside. Divers have been seeking a way forward through the cave complex's chambers, but flooding and low visibility has hindered their progress. Relatives performed a morning ritual in which they called out for the missing. They played drums and gongs and two relatives held fishing nets as a symbolic way to fish out lost spirits from the cave. The cave complex extends several miles and has wide chambers and narrow passageways with rocky outcrops and changes in elevation. Still, officials have said they are hopeful the boys are alive and have found a safe space away from the floods. The cave, cut into a mountainside near the border with Myanmar, can flood severely during the rainy season, which runs from June to October. Officials said that tourists trapped there by past floods have been rescued after the waters receded. Officials said it wasn't the first time some of the soccer players had been inside the cave. ""The kids have been in the cave before, but they didn't think that going in at this time would be that dangerous,"" said Chote Narin, an officer at Mae Sai district police station. Coach Ekapol's Facebook page is packed with photos and video of him and what appear to be members of his team practicing, cycling the area's mountain roads and inner tubing on a river. A post from December 2016 reads: ""Special training before the competition. Tham Luang Nang Non."" Attached are 10 photos from inside the cave of boys in soccer uniforms smiling and posing for photos, lit by the beam of a flashlight. The constant excursions, however, had become an issue for Thinnakorn Boonpiam, whose 13-year-old son, Mongkol, is among those missing. He said his son would regularly come home as late as 9 p.m., sometimes joining his coach and teammates on adventures that included swimming in waterfalls and riding their bicycles into Myanmar. ""I have asked my son to leave the team several times, but he wouldn't,"" Thinnakorn said. ""I suppose he enjoys these activities."" While he said he was sure the coach was ""a great person,"" he still felt his son was too young to be going on such trips with just one adult. Thinnakorn and the other parents have ignored incessant rain and stayed camped outside the cave in tents since the ordeal began. Nearby bicycles, backpacks and soccer cleats their children left behind remained at the entrance. At a prayer session Monday evening, some of the boys' relatives walked inside the cave entrance, their cries echoing off the walls. ""My son, come on out! I am waiting for you here!"" one woman cried. Another kneeled down near the bicycles and prayed, asking ""Where is my child?"" Rescuers have found some of the boys' belongings farther inside the cave, raising hopes that they may have fled still deeper inside to get away from the water. Even if they are found, though, officials have cautioned that getting them to safety could take time and even require the boys to learn the basics of scuba. Noppadon, the father of one of the team members who didn't go on the cave trip, said he brought his son to the cave Tuesday because he couldn't concentrate at school. ""We are all close friends,"" said the son, Songpol, his eyes filling with tears. ""I want to see my friends soon.""

Associated Press,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Floodwaters are receding across most of the hard-hit Midwest, but there could be new problems if the forecast for significant rain later this week holds up. Already the flooding along the Missouri River and its tributaries has caused at least $3 billion damage and forced thousands from their homes as floodwaters penetrated or flowed over several hundred miles of levees.
The flooding is blamed in three confirmed deaths, and two Nebraska men have been missing for more than a week.
Extensive damage
The flooding has taken a heavy toll on agriculture in the region, inundating tens of thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock. Thousands of people have been forced from their homes in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, and some have yet to return to assess the damage. Residents of Kansas City, Missouri, are being asked to conserve water while KC Water treats murky water caused by filtration issues. Flooding has closed about 140 roads in Missouri, even as water levels begin falling along much of the Missouri River.
Officials in those three states plan to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine if any changes need to be made to the system of levees that is supposed to protect towns and cities from swollen rivers.
Yet more flood damage is possible as spring rains arrive and more snow in northern states melts and flows into rivers.
“We’re not done yet and I think that’s the other thing that we want to make sure folks are watching very closely,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said.
Lingering problems
Flooding continues to cause problems along several major rivers in the eastern Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota.
The National Weather Service says there’s a 10 percent chance the Red River will approach the 2009 record of 41 feet (12.5 meters) in Fargo, North Dakota, and neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota.
Both cities have implemented significant flood-fighting measures in the last decade, including home buyouts and levees that could be tested this year. But both cities have still declared emergencies and are launching sandbag-filling efforts — 1 million sandbags in Fargo and 150,000 in Moorhead.
Spring flooding also is a concern in southern Minnesota. Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and U.S. Rep. Angie Craig were among the public officials who joined Hastings residents to fill thousands of sandbags over the weekend. The Mississippi River at Hastings is forecast to rise to major flood stage this week.
In eastern South Dakota, major flooding is expected along the James and the Big Sioux rivers in the next couple of weeks, though record crests are not anticipated, according to Mike Gillispie, National Weather Service hydrologist in Sioux Falls.
“Sioux Falls itself should be in pretty good shape,” he said. “Just upstream (on the Big Sioux), though, Baltic, Dell Rapids, Trent, some of those smaller communities up through that stretch of river, there are significant impacts up there. Roads in the cities are being flooded, maybe even houses.”
Forecast fears
The weather service predicts eastern Nebraska and western Iowa could receive 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of rain from Wednesday to Friday. That much rain would certainly send river levels higher, creating problems for homes behind levees that were weakened in the initial flooding.
The forecast may be revised as the storm gets closer. Meteorologist Bryon Miller said the good news is that the river crests following this week’s forecast storm will likely be lower than during recent floods.
“It doesn’t look like it will be anywhere near the crests we saw at the height of this,” said Miller, from the NWS office in Valley, Nebraska.
A combination of heavy rains and rapid snowmelt atop ground that was already saturated and in some places still frozen sent the Missouri River and other rivers over the top earlier this month.
Flood flow
This week’s storm system could also bring rain to the Mississippi River basin and exacerbate problems there.
But so far most of the flooding along the Mississippi hasn’t created major issues, National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Hladik said.
“The current levels are somewhat routine along the Mississippi,” Hladik said.
The Mississippi is expected to crest sometime in April, depending on the timing of spring rains and snowmelt. The river will be susceptible to flooding over the next month, Hladik said.
The Mississippi River is expected to keep rising in the Minnesota capital of St. Paul this week after reaching major flood stage Monday morning. About half a dozen roads in the city are closed, as well as several parks and boat launches. City leaders have started building a temporary levee in the Lowertown area of St. Paul.

Maya Rhodan,"As the rain pounded Fayetteville, cars pulled in and out of the parking lot at Campbellton Landing on Person Street. One-by-one, drivers and passengers hopped out of their vehicles to face the pounding rain, all to get a look at the rising Cape Fear River, which is expected to climb high enough to cover the train tracks near Karen Malloy’s house near Deep Creek Road. “When Matthew came, you could put your hand down between the railroad and touch the water. Another foot and it would have been on our road,” she said. “And they’re talking about it’ll be four feet over now.” Malloy’s home is one of nearly 2,800 in the Fayetteville area affected by a mandatory evacuation order issued by the city’s mayor. Those who didn’t heed his call, he warned, should notify their next of kin. And while she planned to make her way to her sister’s house on the other side of town by that afternoon. But Malloy’s two adult sons, who just happen to live next door to her, weren’t sure if they’d join her, despite how much she wanted them to. “When I see that river take over the train tracks, then I might get worried,” said Russell Malloy, one of her sons. He was using his fork to cut up bits of sausage in the bowl of white rice he was eating, watching ESPN on a flat screen TV in his front room. Theirs was a dilemma many have had to face over and over again since Hurricane Florence, now a tropical depression, landed ashore. Is it worth it to leave? Will it really be that bad? Evacuations are inconvenient. But, repeatedly over the past few days, Florence’s wrath has won out. The storm’s death toll had risen to 18 by Monday morning. Chunks of Interstate 95 were rendered impassable. Wilmington, along the coast, was effectively cut off from the rest of the state by water. At least half of central North Carolina was at risk of facing flash floods on Monday morning. Over 1,000 swift water rescues have been conducted in the state, not including the volunteer crews that have been conducting their own missions. Thousands of people have already evacuated. Around 15,000 are in North Carolina emergency shelters, and hundreds more in hotels, motels, and the homes of friends and family across the state. But as rivers crested, creeks rose, and roads flooded, many more were forced out out of their homes as the storm’s remnants lingered in the area. As Cedar Creek in flooded, the roads in Dennis Virts’ neighborhood turned into rivers. On Sunday afternoon, an armoured police rescue vehicle drove through the waters to help move people away from the area. “I didn’t wait around for them,” Virts said, smoking a cigarette in an empty car wash, out of the beating rain. “I just walked out.” In Lumberton, N.C., members of the National Guard reportedly traversed the town instructing people in areas prone to flooding to leave the area. On Water Street in Lumberton, the Lumber River had already begun to surround Dawn Davis’ house on Sunday afternoon. A makeshift obstruction — 5,000 bags of sand crews had dumped on the banks of the river with hopes that it would keep the town from flooding — had already failed. “I guess if it gets a little bit more higher, we’ll all end up leaving,” Davis said. “I’m just trying to put it off.” Her next door neighbor, Bennie Todd, and his family had already had water coming through the top of their house: during the hurricane, the shingles of their roof flew off and so his son, Ben, and son-in-law climbed on the roof and covered it with a bright blue tarp. But the Todd family had no plans to leave. “As long as it doesn’t come up from the bottom, we’ll be alright,” Benny said, swiping the air with an orange flyswatter as he swung from a white wooden bench on their screened-in porch. Rochelle Chatman took photos of the Lumber River, its swift waters flowing just inches from the bottom of the bridge he stood on. He says Chatman says water has already seeped into his house — the second time in as many years — so he and his nine-year-old son have been staying with a cousin in a different part of town. “They say [Matthew] was a 500-year flood,” he said. “Now it’s become a two-year flood.” J.J. Malloy quickly took issue with his brother’s timeline. “I don’t think we should wait until that long, bruh,” he said Sunday, standing in a doorway just off the front room. Russell backtracked: Perhaps they wouldn’t wait that long, but he sure as hell wasn’t in a rush to leave. “I’ve lived here a long time. All my life. I know this river like the back of my hand,” he said. “It could reach my backyard, but at the same time I don’t think it’s going to be inside my house.” “If it gets as bad as Matthew was and we still have rain left. It’s not really a question anymore,” J.J. said. “But I’m really not trying to leave. This is my home.” They soon may not have a choice. By Tuesday, the river is supposed to crest four-feet above the level it did during the 2016 storm. The North Carolina coast may have been in the eye of Hurricane Florence, now a tropical depression, but the state’s central cities have remained in its crosshairs.","As the rain pounded Fayetteville, cars pulled in and out of the parking lot at Campbellton Landing on Person Street.

David Riggs,"In 2017, when Tesla announced incredibly ambitious Model 3 production targets of 5,000 Model 3s per week and the beginning of “production hell,” analysts were wary. But Elon Musk insisted he could pull it off, citing hyper-automation — a robotic assembly line — as his secret weapon to increase manufacturing speed and drive down costs. Fast-forward a year and a half and Tesla delivered 91,000 vehicles in Q4 2018. But the ramp-up didn’t come without massive issues and a move away from Musk’s original vision of a highly automated assembly line.
What happened?
Asked why the push toward automation didn’t pan out, Elon’s answer revolved around one major issue: robotic vision, or the software that controls what the assembly line robots can “see” and then do based on that computer vision. Unfortunately, the assembly line robots just couldn’t deal with unexpected orientations of objects like nuts and bolts, or complicated maneuvering between the car frame. Every such issue would cause the assembly line to stop. In the end, it was far easier to substitute humans for robots in many assembly situations.
Today, computer vision (the umbrella term for robotic vision) is everywhere and represents the next frontier of AI technologies and groundbreaking applications across a variety of industries. The advances being made right now by researchers and companies in the space are impressive and represent the missing pieces needed to make Elon Musk’s vision of an automated car assembly line a reality. At its core, these advances will give computers and robots the ability to reliably deal with the vast array of unexpected corner cases — those errant nuts and bolts — that occur in the real world.
A watershed moment in computer vision
Computer vision experienced a watershed moment in 2012 with the application of convolutional neural networks. Since then, it has really picked up steam. Before 2012, computer vision was largely about hand-crafted solutions — basically, algorithms had manually defined rule sets and could mathematically describe features of an image relatively effectively. These were hand-selected and then combined by a computer vision researcher in order to identify a specific object in an image, like a bicycle, a storefront or a face.
The rise of machine learning and advances in artificial neural nets changed all of that, allowing us to develop algorithms using massive amounts of training data that can automatically decipher and learn image features. The net effect of this was twofold: (1) solutions became much more robust (e.g. a face could still be identified as a face, even if it were oriented slightly differently, or in shadow), and (2) the creation of good solutions became reliant upon large amounts of high-quality training data (models learn features based on the training data, so it is critical that the training data is accurate, sufficient in quantity and represents the full diversity of situations the algorithm may later see).
Now in the lab: GANs, unsupervised learning and synthetic data
Next, new approaches like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), unsupervised learning and synthetic ground truth offer the potential to substantially reduce both the amount of training data required to develop high-quality computer vision models, as well as the time and effort required to collect the data. With these approaches, networks can actually bootstrap their own learning and identify corner cases and outliers with higher fidelity, far faster. Humans can then evaluate the corner cases to refine solutions and get to a high-quality model much more quickly.
These new approaches are rapidly expanding the envelope of computer vision in terms of applications, robustness and reliability. Not only do they hold the promise to solve Mr. Musks manufacturing challenges, but they will also dramatically extend the boundaries in myriad critical applications, some of which are highlighted below:
Manufacturing Automation: Robots will increasingly have the capability to deal with objects at randomized orientations, like a car seat that is 20 degrees off-center or a screw that is an inch too far to the left. Even further, robots will be able to reliably identify soft, flexible, transparent objects (think about, for example, the plastic bag of socks you ordered on Amazon last week). New robotics providers like Berkshire Grey are at the cutting edge of this.
Facial Detection: Previously, facial detection was not robust in corner cases like side angles, partial shading or occlusion, or babies faces. Now, researchers are finding that computer vision can work to identify rare genetic disorders from a photo of a face, with 90 percent accuracy. Certain applications are being put in the hands of consumers, which is only possible because algorithms have become increasingly robust to diverse lighting conditions and other situations that arise as a result of less control over image capture.
Medical Imaging: Advances are now allowing for the automation of MRI evaluation, skin cancer detection, and a number of other important use cases.
Driver Assistance and Automation: Self-driving systems were failing when it was foggy, because they were unable to differentiate between heavy fog and a rock. Now, unsupervised learning and the ability to create synthetic data (led by the likes of Nvidia) are starting to be used to train the system on corner cases that even billions of recorded driving miles cannot uncover.
Agriculture: Companies like Blue River Technology (acquired by John Deere) are now reliably able to differentiate between weeds and crops, and selectively spray herbicide automatically, enabling a dramatic reduction in the quantity of toxic chemicals in use by commercial agriculture.
Real Estate and Property Information: Using computer vision on top of geospatial imagery could allow companies to automatically identify when floods, wildfires or hurricane-force winds may pose a danger to specific properties — allowing homeowners to take action faster, before disaster strikes.
When looking at these advances, one thing quickly becomes clear: Elon Musk wasn’t wrong. It’s just that his vision (robotic and otherwise) was a year or two away from reality.

Bill Chappell,"Ellicott City, Md.'s Main Street was turned into a raging river on Sunday, in a catastrophe that followed another flash flood in 2016. The water wrecked storefronts and left cars strewn amid debris on Monday. Katherine Frey/The Washington Post/Getty Images Fast-moving flood waters caused mayhem in Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, triggering an emergency declaration and urgent messages for residents to seek higher ground. One man remains missing, as crews work to clear the area. Howard County Police say Eddison Hermond, 39, of Severn, Md., is unaccounted for; they're asking the public to help find him. Washington-area radio news outlet WTOP describes Hermond as ""an Air Force veteran and a member of the National Guard."" A friend of Hermond's told WTOP that the veteran had been in a restaurant in downtown Ellicott City on Sunday; witnesses said he was swept away after trying to help people. Swiftwater rescue teams searched for Hermond last night, both on foot and in all-terrain vehicles – but the search was suspended and resumed on Monday, according to the Arbutus Volunteer Fire Department. Founded in 1772, Ellicott City's Main Street and downtown have been designated a historic district. The same area suffered massive flooding in 2016, when the city barely avoided having to tear down any buildings in a long and expensive rebuilding effort. In that catastrophe in July of 2016, two people died in what was called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" event. But in 2018, it has happened again, devastating an area that, due to its valley setting, had endured other floods in the past. ******* MISSING PERSON ALERT IN ELLICOTT CITY ******* this is eddison hermond. he was swept away in the ellicott city flooding yesterday around 5pm trying to help people and hasn't been seen or heard from since. if you have any news, please contact me #EllicottCityFlood pic.twitter.com/moxxJm1Sjj — Kenneth Josepha (@Kdogcony76) May 28, 2018 Rain storms have been seen growing more intense in recent years – but part of the difference, at least one expert says, also lies in how the area's land surface has changed. Discussing Ellicott City after the 2016 flash flood, Jeffrey B. Halverson, a geography professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, told member station WAMU : ""It's heavily paved, there's lots of narrow streets that act as very rapid conduits of water – so the flood was as much about the nature of the underlying land surface as it was the large amount of rain falling from the sky."" Intense flooding hit the town's Main Street in at least two waves on Sunday, shoving cars down the street and bursting through storefronts – including at several buildings where people found themselves suddenly trapped in stores and restaurants. Images and video from the scene are striking, showing fast-moving water rising nearly as high as the bottom edge of the streets' stop signs and obliterating anything in the torrent's path. One day after the flooding hit, people are reaching out to help. The Howard County government says anyone who wants to volunteer can register at its website – but that for now, the downtown area remains off-limits. The Visit Ellicott City organization says a local non-profit called the Ellicott City Partnership is taking donations to help the community recover from the flood, as it did in 2016. On Monday, conditions had dried out enough that salvage crews could begin towing vehicles that had been caught in the disaster.","Less than two years after what had been called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" flood in 2016, Ellicott City, Md., sees its historic downtown ravaged anew.

Katharine Schwab,"A controversial new development is slated to replace the Domino sugar factory, which has presided over the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, since the mid-1880s. One good that will come of it? A new public park designed to protect the area against climate change while becoming a monument to the area’s manufacturing history. [Photo: Daisy Korpics for Fast Company] Fast Company took an exclusive tour of the park recently. It’s designed by the New York-based landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations –the same designers behind the High Line–who started working on the Brooklyn park in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. As a result, the park’s design includes many classic resiliency strategies. The designers raised the park’s platform 12 feet higher in some places to guard against floods, and the heavily planted waterfront was designed to act like a sponge. Because the park lines the entire waterfront of the development, it acts as a buffer between the river and the high-rise residential buildings that will go up in the future. [Photo: Daisy Korpics for Fast Company] The park also attempts to preserve the site’s industrial past. You can meander between giant tanks that once held syrup and examine towering screw conveyors that moved the sugar along the stages of refinement. Each of the old industrial parts is left in its rusted patina, with scaffolding painted a surprising turquoise blue–a color that was everywhere in the original buildings. The tops of the park benches, still to be installed, will be made of reclaimed wood from the now-demolished raw sugar warehouse. The main attraction? What the designers call the “Artifact Walk,” a raised walkway built on top of old structural columns from the warehouse that offers an elevated platform from which to take in the view. The park will no doubt be a smash–with the dramatic views of the bridge, the close proximity to the river, and the breathtaking panoramic view of Manhattan. We have an exclusive first look in the slide show above.","The designers behind New York’s wildly popular High Line take on a new site at the old Domino sugar factory in Brooklyn.

According to NASA, a unique confluence of circumstances, including extreme winter cold that created a thick layer of ice on waterways, led to the flooding.
""When an intense storm brought downpours and unusually warm air to the region in March, it rapidly melted much of the snow and ice, producing enormous runoff in a short period,"" the space agency explained in a statement.

Claudia Koerner,"After days of torrential rainfall and devastating flooding in the central US, forecasters said Thursday that record-breaking floods will likely continue or worsen to potentially historic levels over the next several months in much of the US.
While torrential rans, snow melt, and ice jams have already caused historic flooding in the Plains, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said heavy rain this spring will make conditions even worse in most states. Major or moderate flooding is expected in 25 states through May which could mean the worst flood season the US has ever seen.
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of the NOAA National Water Center, told reporters.
Flooding has so far been worst in the upper Mississippi and Missouri river basins; the upper Mississippi basin received double the typical amount of rain and snow this year. At least three people were killed in Nebraska and Iowa last week as flooded rivers overwhelmed farmland, roads, and homes.
As water moves downstream, the threat of flood will become worse across a larger area, forecasters said.
The flooding this year could be worse than anything weve seen in recent years, even worse than the historic floods of 1993 and 2011, Mary Erickson, deputy director of the National Weather Service, said in a conference call with reporters, calling the current flooding a ""preview"" of whats to come this spring.
Flood risk is determined by looking at snowpack and drought conditions, soil moisture, and frost depth as well as rain. But heavy rainfall, a result of climate change, has been a particular trend in the Midwest, causing problems for farmers, damaging homes and buildings, and contaminating groundwater.
Minor flooding is also forecast for parts of California and Nevada, and forecasters added that spring storms could create problems even in areas with a low overall flood risk.
Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy administrator Daniel Kaniewski stressed the importance of flood insurance. FEMA and the National Flood Insurance Program statistics show that flooding typically causes the most damage of any weather-related event, valued on average at $8 billion a year.
""Severe weather and flooding can strike anywhere, whether or not you are in a high-risk area, he told reporters.","“This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.""

Emily Schwing,"Sex. It drives people to do crazy things. Animals too. They’ll make unsettling sounds, perform complex dances, or show off giant plumes of colorful feathers. And, famously, salmon will swim hundreds of kilometers upstream to get down to business. They also inadvertently rework the landscape. “Adult salmon spend most of their life out in the ocean and then they come in to freshwater to mate.” Washington State University ecologist Alex Fremier. “What the female salmon will do is, she digs a hole in the streambed.” That little hole is called a redd. That’s where the salmon lays her eggs. And Fremier says when she builds it, she basically “unpacks” the stream bed, making all those loose sands and gravels more mobile. High water and flooding events move that sediment, which in turn exposes bedrock to further erosion. “It’s quite impressive. We did not expect to have salmon, in some cases, changing the vertical position of a river channel up to 30 percent more than it would have without salmon in it.” Fremier hypothesized that salmon not only influence landscape evolution, but that the evolution of salmon as a species itself has a landscape-level impact. To test the idea, he and colleagues recreated salmon redds in an experimental flume. Then they compared findings from the flume with real field observations. They cross-referenced all that data with discoveries from a study that modelled river profile erosion over five million years. “We were stunned by the fact that it actually had a larger scale effect, given that we account for tectonic uplift, the big floods, like a lot of flood water moving downstream, different conditions of the gravel sizes on the river. I think we were all surprised by the fact that salmon could have such a large effect at that million-year scale.” The study is in the journal Geomorphology. [Alexander K. Fremier, Brian J.

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Mayor Rick Eberlin of Grafton, Ill., knows that by the end of this week he will probably be in another fight with the Mississippi River.
But sandbags and flood walls are not in his arsenal.
The city of 640 people just below the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers will allow floodwaters to sweep across its low-lying areas, enveloping roads, parks, docks and a strip of scruffy riverside lots where no one has lived since the Great Flood of 1993.
“We don’t use walls or sandbags. There’s nothing to protect,” Eberlin said Friday afternoon. “What we do is pray that it doesn’t get as high as the forecast. Then we cope with it.”
But don’t mistake Eberlin’s resignation as surrender.
Grafton has been through 18 high-water events since 1993, and Eberlin, a farmer, has learned a few things about negotiating with the Mississippi River. One is to let flood tides go where they want to go.
Eberlin is one of a growing number of Mississippi River mayors who are rethinking what it means to live next to a river whose floods seem less predictable than ever—when spring rains become bomb cyclones and six weeks of gradual winter snowmelt can be compressed into two weeks of sheet-flow flooding across frozen ground.
“What used to be a high-water event every two, three, five years, now it seems we’re getting it every year, sometimes twice a year,” Eberlin said. “I know we’ve got a different weather pattern, and the events are getting more fierce.”
Towns like Grafton have little choice but to take adaptation to the next level.
Rather than simply pulling back from the river’s edge, communities are looking at landscape-scale flood control measures that are also environmentally restorative. Towns are constructing—or rather, allowing nature to reconstruct—marsh and wetland areas that were once the targets of dredges.
When Grafton built a new riverside marina in 2006, it placed tons of dredge material into a river shallow to help establish what is now a functioning wetland that traps sediment; slows water; and provides habit for fish, waterfowl and small mammals.
It also helps reduce flood damage downriver, where communities south of St. Louis have witnessed some of the worst floods on record over the past decade. The events have fueled debate over the role that levees and flood walls have in worsening flood conditions for downstream neighbors (Climatewire, Aug. 8, 2018).
Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the St. Louis-based Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, said mayors along the entire 2,300-mile length of the river are beginning to see the picture.
“We’re more conscious of these things,” he said. “Our mayors are really beginning to focus on not just managing water in their town, but managing on a corridor scale. It’s not easy and it’s not cheap, but it makes a hell of a lot more sense, and it saves the taxpayer a lot of money.”
Davenport, Iowa, located a few hundred miles upriver from Grafton, has been an exemplar of landscape-level flood protection.
The city of 102,000 is home to the largest urban wetland on the Upper Mississippi River. Known as the Nahant Marsh, the 305-acre preserve was for decades a hunting and skeet-shooting club. When the club closed in 1995, the marsh was so polluted with spent lead that more waterfowl were dying of toxic exposure than gunshot.
EPA declared the Nahant Marsh a Superfund site in the late 1990s. After the removal and cleaning of about 60,000 cubic yards of toxic soil, the site was handed back to the city. It’s managed today as an education center, providing residents with rare access to seasonally wet bottomland forest, marshland and open water habitat.
But the Nahant Marsh’s greatest community benefit is its ability to act as a massive urban floodwater sponge, catching and filtering up to 2 billion gallons of water during peak flows on the Mississippi.
Brian Ritter, executive director of the nonprofit organization that manages the marsh, said the city of Davenport has long viewed flooding as part of its natural heritage and has adapted accordingly.
Like Grafton, Davenport has no levee or flood wall. Its roughly 9-mile riverfront, including its signature park, is designed to be submerged in floodwaters for weeks at a time.
Former Davenport Mayor Pat Gibbs, who was criticized in the mid-1990s for refusing to build a flood wall along the waterfront, told the Quad-City Times last June that he has no regrets about the decision, even as Davenport’s across-the-river neighbor, Rock Island, Ill., stands by its decision to build one in the 1970s.
“I still believe you give to the Mississippi what belongs to it,” Gibbs told the newspaper. “If the water wants to come in, it’ll come in no matter what you build.”
But as flood frequency and intensity has risen over the last 25 years, the Nahant Marsh has become a community asset in ways few people considered before the Great Flood of 1993.
“We’re flooding right now,” Ritter said last week. “The river went up last week, and the forecast says it will go up again in early April. Our soils are completely saturated, so the marsh is doing exactly what it’s supposed to do.”
Like Eberlin in Grafton, Ritter has kept tabs on high-water events in Davenport over the last two decades. He is convinced climate change is leading to more extreme precipitation and more floods.
“This is our 21st flood that we’re experiencing since the year 2000,” he said. “Historically on this stretch of the river, it was one or two floods per decade.”
“I mean, you know, climate change and land use—it’s the double whammy,” he added. “At one time we had this wonderful prairie sponge all through the Midwest that would soak up the rain and snowmelt. Now we have to build the sponge.”
Even the Army Corps of Engineers, which has invested billions of dollars to line the Mississippi River with levees and flood walls over the last century, has begun to see the benefits of reconnecting the river to its natural floodplain.
In 2017, the Army Corps worked with Iowa, county officials and the Green Island Levee District to buy out privately owned farm tracts along the Maquoketa River, a Mississippi River tributary south of Dubuque, that saw frequent severe flooding.
After high water breeched a 1940s-era levee on the Maquoketa in 2010, the Army Corps opted not to patch the holes but instead offer it to the state as an extension of the 4,000-acre Green Island Wildlife Management Area, one of the state’s most important flood backwaters and wildlife sanctuaries.
Calls to the Army Corps’ Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program, based in Rock Island, were not returned Friday.
Ross Baxter, land projects director for the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, said at the time that returning the affected areas to a natural state avoided future infrastructure expenses while better protecting other surrounding farmland from floods.
“Ultimately it made more financial sense to buy, protect and restore the land than fix the levee and continue to farm the flood-prone land,” Baxter said.
Nathan Woiwode, North America climate adaptation project manager for the Nature Conservancy, said the organization has observed a significant uptick in nature-based flood protection measures in the Mississippi River Basin, especially in states like Iowa, Illinois and Missouri.
“These states are taking very intentional looks at how they’ve done floodplain management in the past,” Woiwode said. “It’s not purely about flood protection. It’s also about protecting agricultural interests and creating community assets.”
Woiwode also pointed to the recently launched “Engineering With Nature,” an Army Corps initiative that aims to incorporate natural solutions to water management. The agency in January published an atlas detailing 56 projects that apply nature-based approaches to challenges around river management and flood control.
“It’s about understanding that the things we used to be able to rely upon, like how the water moves through a river system, it’s all changing,” he said. “It’s about recognizing that we need to start planning for a very different future.”

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - The collapse of a Brazilian tailings dam owned by Vale last week ranks among the worst mining disasters in decades. More than 300 people are feared dead after the dam failure near the town of Brumadinho released a torrent of mining waste into Vale’s facilities and a nearby community in Minas Gerais state. 
The IndustriALL union, which represents mining and energy, said the Brazilian dam disaster is already recognized as the most deadly labor accident in the history of Brazil. 
It follows on from the country’s worst environmental incident in November 2015 when the collapse of the Samarco dam, operated by Vale and BHP, resulted in the death of 19 people. 
Both the Samarco and the Brumadinho disasters involve the failure of upstream tailings dams. 
The following is a list of other major accidents that resulted in more than 50 fatalities at mines worldwide over the past 50 years.

Hillary Leung,"A major cyclone the equivalent of a strong Category 2 hurricane approached the coast of Mozambique late Thursday, prompting residents to brace for what weather authorities have called a likely “worst case scenario.”
Cyclone Idai was forecast to make landfall just south of Beira, the nation’s fourth-largest city with a population of half a million, late Thursday night. It is now carrying sustained 110 mph winds gusting to above 130 mph, according to the Washington Post.
Flooding from Idai’s path inland has already killed 122 people in Mozambique and Malawi, making it the deadliest weather disaster this year.
The landfall will pose further threat to the African country, with authorities saying it could bring a “life-threatening” storm surge of up to 13 feet along Mozambique’s coastline, and close to 20 feet at the mouth of the Pungwe river, which runs to Zimbabwe. The surge could submerge thousands of homes and businesses, and potentially displace more than 1,000 residents, the Post reports.
Mozambique ranks third among countries in Africa most susceptible to weather-related hazards, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. In 2015, Cyclone Chedza killed 140, and in 2000, Tropical Cyclone Eline left 350 dead and 650,000 homeless across southern Africa. Cyclone Idai is predicted to be the strongest to make landfall in Mozambique since Eline.
Mozambican authorities have issued a red alert regarding Tropical Cyclone Idai and humanitarian response is ongoing in Malawi and Mozambique. The government, with support from local and international partners, is providing assistance to people already displaced by floods, but access is being impeded by road damage, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Jessica Booth,"Up until 2012, scientists thought the Grand Canyon — which has rocks as old as 1.84 billion years — was 5 million to 6 million years old. But in December 2012, researchers published a study that said the canyon could have begun forming as far back as 70 million years ago. 
 A 2014 study concluded that different parts of the canyon are different ages: Researchers said some parts of the canyon near its middle are 15 million to 25 million years old and another part is 50 million to 70 million years old.

Alan Taylor,"At least three people are confirmed to have lost their lives so far amid record-setting floods affecting parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and other nearby states. Thousands of people have been asked to evacuate, and many have been away from their homes for days in hard-hit Nebraska, following last week’s “bomb cyclone” weather system that dropped huge amounts of precipitation—adding to existing troubles from heavy snow melt and ice-choked rivers. Dams and levees were overwhelmed, roads have been washed away, and some neighborhoods, farms, and military bases now sit in water up to 8 feet deep. As some of the rivers in eastern Nebraska are beginning to recede and others are expected to crest within 24 hours, worries are growing for areas downstream, along the Mississippi River Valley.","Snowmelt and last week’s “bomb cyclone” have overwhelmed rivers in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and neighboring states, causing widespread flooding that has broken dozens of records, and cost at least three lives.",2019-03-18T16:49:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Historic Flooding Across the Midwest,https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2019/03/midwest-flood-photos/585169/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2019/03/midwest-flooding/f01_AP19076776858624-1/facebook.jpg?1552924307,,Theatlantic.com,River floods,1
George Packer,"I first read V. S. Naipaul before knowing anything about him—I came under the spell of his prose before I knew not to like him. In the early eighties, when I was serving in the Peace Corps in West Africa, a copy of “ A Bend in the River,” published just a few years earlier, passed hand to hand among the volunteers. The novel was set in an unnamed African country—this vagueness seemed to free Naipaul’s imagination from the tyranny of current events—but it was clearly the Zaire of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu was a kleptocratic dictator whose governing ideology was “authenticity,” which turned the longing for precolonial sources of identity into a brutal cult of personality. During the seventies, “authenticity” won Mobutu a following among African and Western intellectuals who wanted to believe that de-Christianizing names and wearing leopard-skin hats could liberate independent Africa from its own damaging history. “When We Were Kings,” a documentary film about the 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman fight, in Kinshasa, known as the “Rumble in the Jungle,” features Norman Mailer and George Plimpton spouting astonishing nonsense about the exotic and primitive Africa that they found in Mobutu’s Zaire. Togo, where I lived, had its own “authenticity,” copied from Zaire by a Mobutu wannabe named Gnassingbé (formerly Étienne) Eyadéma—a ripoff of a fraud. I spent almost two years in a disorienting and stifling atmosphere of lies, of “traditional” songs invented by government flunkies to glorify the leader and indoctrinate the villagers who were forced to chant and dance to them. Reading “A Bend in the River” felt like a piece of incredible luck. Here was a world just like the one I found myself in, portrayed in the sharpest, most penetrating language imaginable, free of piety or wishfulness. The sentences ran through me with a physical sensation that felt like truth, which is exhilarating even when it terrifies. The narrator, Salim, from a family of Indian traders on Africa’s east coast, travels to the interior of the continent to take over a shop in a town on a great river. “The names of all the main streets had been changed. Rough boards carried the new, roughly lettered names. No one used the new names, because no one particularly cared about them. The wish had only been to get rid of the old, to wipe out the memory of the intruder. It was unnerving, the depth of that African rage, the wish to destroy, regardless of the consequences.” In the town, Salim tries to build a new life. He meets Asians, Africans, and Europeans—all of them uprooted, searching for identity and meaning in this tense outpost of the modern world, filled with impending violence. In one scene, Salim is invited to an elegant party, hosted by Europeans, where he feels outclassed and alien. Someone puts on a Joan Baez record, and her voice floods the narrator with emotion: “I felt the deepest part of myself awakening, the part that knew loss, homesickness, grief, and longed for love. And in that voice was the promise of a flowering for everyone who listened.” Then, as the singing continues, the narrator’s mood shifts: “It was make-believe—I never doubted that. You couldn’t listen to sweet songs about injustice unless you expected justice and received it much of the time. You couldn’t sing songs about the end of the world unless—like the other people in that room, so beautiful with such simple things: African mats on the floor and African hangings on the wall and spears and masks—you felt that the world was going on and you were safe in it.” That note of scorn touched with humiliation and yearning—it was Naipaul’s essential chord. He was born in Trinidad, the grandson of indentured field hands from India. He won a scholarship to Oxford and forged his profession in the bleak London of the fifties, where no one knew what to make of a brown-skinned novelist who wrote satirically about his homeland. He had the rage of a perpetual outsider who couldn’t afford make-believe, who felt anything but safe in the world. He was famous, and infamous, for being cruel, both in his books and, as depicted in Patrick French’s excellent biography, “ The World Is What It Is,” in his private life. He tormented his long-suffering wife, Pat, brutalized his Anglo-Argentine mistress, sucked up to British high society, supported the nasty politics of Hindu nationalism, and freely, even gleefully, expressed a raft of bigoted opinions. He became a hateful figure to the progressive left, and when he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 2001, Le Monde Diplomatique compared it to Henry Kissinger winning the Nobel Peace Prize. It’s hard for me to feel much of anything for Naipaul personally, now that he’s gone. But the rage that made his character monstrous purified his prose and clarified his vision, enabling him to see what a generation of other writers, safe in the centers of power, missed. In his novels and journalism, he dissected both the destructive attempts of post-colonial societies to remake themselves and the privileged Westerners who encouraged their fantasies. In this sense he was the writer in English of the second half of the twentieth century—the chronicler of upheaval and dispossession and migration. At the center of his writing there is no clear political ideology but individual human beings, such as the narrator of “A Bend in the River.” Naipaul was too close to his trapped and blighted characters for the comfort of sentimentality. His work is dark, but illuminated with the sudden flashes of empathy that give it greatness.","George Packer writes about reading the fiction of V. S.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Heavy rain, gusting winds and rising floodwaters from Hurricane Florence deluged the Carolinas on Thursday as the massive, slow-moving storm crept toward the coastline, threatening millions of people in its path with record rainfall and punishing surf. Florence, downgraded to a Category 2 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and moving west at only 5 miles per hour (8 kph), remained huge, unpredictable and potentially deadly ahead of its forecast landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, at mid-day on Friday. For graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs/2p5XM5i North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference that the “historic” hurricane would unleash rains and floods that would inundate almost the entire state in several feet of water. The sheer size of the storm meant it could batter the U.S. East Coast with hurricane-force winds for nearly a full day, according to weather forecasters. North Carolina will see the equivalent of up to eight months of rain in a two- to three-day period, National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said in a video briefing. North Carolinians made last-minute preparations and hunkered down to await Florence’s arrival. In downtown Wilmington, a few hearty locals gathered at Cape Fear Wine and Beer pub. “We lost power at home so we figured we should come to the bar,” said Carla Mahaffee, a 33-year-old actor from Wilmington, as she drank a cider. “We’ve prepared all our supplies at home and frankly, we were bored.” Holly Waters, a retired special education teacher from Wilmington, said she was happy to have a place to go to relax before the storm worsened. “It’s not the middle of a hurricane yet, so why not come for a beer?” said Waters, 54. Elsewhere in Wilmington, Linda Smith, a 67-year-old retired nonprofit director, was concerned as she watched wind gusts stir up frothy white caps on the Cape Fear River. “We’re a little worried about the storm surge so we came down to see what the river is doing now,” Smith said. “I am frightened about what’s coming. We just want prayers from everyone.” ROADS FLOODED, POWER OUT At least 88,000 people were without power in North Carolina with the brunt of the storm yet to come, according to the state’s emergency management agency. Millions of people were expected to lose power from the storm and restoration could take weeks. Roads and intersections on North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands were already inundated with water. Florence’s top winds were clocked on Thursday at 100 miles per hour (170 km per hour) as it churned in the Atlantic Ocean, down from a peak of 140 mph (224 kph) earlier this week when it was classified a Category 4 storm. The storm’s center was about 85 miles east-southeast of Wilmington at around 8 p.m. EST. About 10 million people could be affected by the storm and more than 1 million had been ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia, jamming westbound roads and highways for miles. At least 12,000 people had taken refuge in 126 emergency shelters, Cooper said, with more facilities being opened. The National Hurricane Center warned the threat of tornadoes was increasing as Florence neared shore and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the heavy rains could trigger landslides in the western part of his state. NHC Director Ken Graham said on Facebook the storm surges could push in as far as 2 miles (3 km). Heavy rains were forecast to extend into the Appalachian Mountains, affecting parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. Emergency declarations were in force in Georgia, South and North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Despite pleas from officials, some residents rejected calls to evacuate. Near the beach in Wilmington, a Waffle House restaurant, part of a chain with a reputation for staying open during disasters, had no plans to close, even if power is lost, and on Thursday evening there were lines to get in. Will Epperson, a 36-year-old golf course assistant superintendent, said he and his wife had planned to ride out the storm at their home in Hampstead, North Carolina, but then reconsidered. Instead, they drove 150 miles (240 km) inland to his mother’s house in Durham. “I’ve never been one to leave for a storm but this one kind of had me spooked,” Epperson said.

Hilary Brueck,"If it seems like the rain has been non-stop this spring, you're not imagining things. In Seattle, it's been 30-40% rainier than normal, and locations on the Eastern seaboard from Miami to Washington DC have been pummeled with more than 10 inches of rain in the past 30 days — roughly double the norm. Researchers have found that when the sky opens up these days, it is dumping more water on all of us. Peak rain rates, which arrive when the fierce core of a storm is overhead, have increased 30% over the past 60 years, according to project scientist Andreas Prein from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). Heavy, damaging storms are also becoming more frequent and more likely to flood people out of their homes — during those peak times, upwards of 4 inches of rain can fall per hour in some cases. ""The bigger the storm, the better for flooding,"" Prein said. A motorcyclist stops in front of a overflowing sewer grate after finding his path blocked by flooding in Taipei's city centre on September 17, 2001. REUTERS/Simon Kwong This phenomenon is directly linked to what humans are doing on the ground: burning fossil fuels, which funnels carbon dioxide into the air, leading Earth's average temperature to rise. ""Precipitation responds to global warming by increasing,"" Angeline Pendergrass, a project scientist at UCAR, said at a conference for journalists last week. As people create pollutants that throw off the atmosphere's delicate balance, those greenhouse gases trap more of the sun's heat, which raises the planet's temperature. Increased precipitation is a side effect of that process, kind of like a feverish sweat: the hotter the atmosphere gets, the easier it is for evaporation to occur on the surface of the Earth. More water evaporating and forming clouds leads to more precipitation. Warmer air can also hold more water, which prompts heavier rains and more summer floods. ""A future storm might cause a much, much bigger flood because it produces so much more water,"" Prein said. Scientists call this trend an intensification of the hydrologic cycle. The phenomenon has already made US storms between 10% and 70% wetter than they used to be, which is much higher than the roughly 7% atmospheric moisture increase that Prein's scientific models predicted. Mari Tye, who studies weather extremes at UCAR, estimates that the damage from more intense thunderstorms totaled to $145 billion dollars in the US last year, rivaling the $125 billion cost of Hurricane Harvey. Just two days of storms across the Midwest in November 2017 created a total of $275 million worth of damage, according to Aon Benfield analytics. Shayanne Gal/Business Insider As the globe's temperature continues to heat up, that intensification will likely continue. ""Over a city, this can be very devastating,"" Prein said. But while wet places get wetter, dry places will continue to get drier. And when rain does hit those spots, there's a higher risk of catastrophic flooding because the ground will be more dry and impermeable to water. The Earth's temperature is on track to rise several more degrees before 2100, so we can expect to get caught in more wet, damaging storms more frequently.","Thunderstorms are getting stronger and dumping more water on us as the atmosphere heats up.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Florence kept dumping rain on North Carolina on Sunday and officials warned residents that “the worst is yet to come” from a storm that has already killed at least eight people, as rivers inland were likely to flood. Florence, which crashed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, had weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday morning but was forecast to drop another 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) of rain in North Carolina, bringing rainfall totals in some inland areas to 15 to 20 inches, according to the National Hurricane Center. The most rain so far from Florence was 33.9 inches (86 cm) in Swansboro, North Carolina, a new record for a single hurricane in the state. The previous record was 24 inches (61 cm), set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with DTN Marine Weather, a private forecasting service. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people some 90 miles (145 km) inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference on Saturday. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. A total of about 761,000 homes and businesses were without power on Sunday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later fled her home near New Bern. As authorities rescued people by boat and even airlifted 50 stranded people in North Carolina, there were also reports of looting. Five people were arrested for breaking into a Dollar General Store, said the police department in Wilmington, which has imposed a nighttime curfew. A least seven people have died so far in the storm in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree and three people who drowned, state officials said. A woman died in South Carolina when her car hit a fallen tree. ‘CATASTROPHIC’ STORM “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “It has already dumped 20 to 30 inches of rain on parts of the Carolinas with more to come,” he said. “And many of the rivers will see prolonged flooding, some not cresting for a few days.” Many roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. The flooding could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. By Sunday morning the storm’s winds had dropped to about 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had picked up pace somewhat, moving west at 8 mph (13 kph), and its center was expected to move across the western Carolinas during Sunday and the Ohio Valley and Northeast United States on Monday and Tuesday. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region this week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who died. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing dozens of people in the Philippines.

The company went on to note the activation of its donation service, allowing customers to contribute to ongoing Mercy Corps efforts through a dedicated button in iTunes and the App Store. As usual, users can donate $5, $10, $25, $50, $100 or $200, with the full amount going directly to the humanitarian aid group. Flooding in the Indian state began in June with the onset of unusually heavy monsoon rains. The unrelenting downpours continued until this week, leaving some 400 people dead and more than a million displaced, according to the latest statistics reported by BBC News. The region remains in dire straits even as floodwaters subside, with residents returning from shelters to find deadly snakes, scorpions and other wildlife now inhabiting their homes. Apple regularly uses iTunes and the App Store to process donations for natural disasters, both in the U.S. and beyond. Most recently, the company activated the mechanism for California's wildfires this month. Apple has in the past made direct contributions to relief efforts including a $2 million donation for Hurricane Harvey relief and $1 million each for last year's Southern California wildfires and Mexico City earthquake.

Andrew Freedman,"You won't find many climate deniers in the Arctic. From Sitka, Alaska to Svalbard, Norway, people are living through a period of extraordinarily rapid changes that are altering their ways of life. Alaska just had its warmest December on record, with a staggering statewide average temperature anomaly of 15.7 degrees Fahrenheit above average for the month. “To have an entire state that is a quarter the size, almost, of the Lower 48 [states], 15 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for an entire month is extraordinary,” said Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: New York City is suing big oil for global warming He said a huge swath of the state, about equal to the size of California, Washington, and Oregon combined, was close to 20 degrees Fahrenheit above average in December, thanks in large part to a powerhouse area of high pressure that sat near the Frontier State throughout the month. Average temperature anomaly outlook for the next 7 days, showing unusually warm conditions across the Arctic, while Eurasia and the U.S. see colder than average conditions. Image: Karsten Haustein Alaska is set to experience yet another unusual warm-up in early to mid-February, as a gargantuan ridge of high pressure is projected to envelop the state from the North Pacific Ocean. The clockwise circulation around this high pressure area will cool off some parts of Alaska, but warm other areas – particularly in western Alaska – to well above average conditions. The details of exactly how this weather pattern sets up will determine how drastically the temperatures will depart from normal for this time of year, Brettschneider said. ""Little changes in ridge axes make all the difference,” he said, referring to the orientation and precise location of such a weather system. The lack of deep cold in a state whose people, natural systems, and economy depend on it has far-reaching consequences, experts say. For one thing, the buildup and maintenance of thick ice and snow cover is vital for establishing travel networks across a state that lacks roadways in most areas. “It’s just so hard for people to grasp that in 90 plus percent of the state there is no highway network,” Brettschneider said. When people in rural communities need to travel, they usually have to snowmobile across a river, which needs to be reliably frozen in order to safely cross. Norway. Svalbard Islands. Spitsbergen Island. Image: UIG via Getty Images Instead, ice has frozen over late, stayed thin, and been vulnerable to melting and refreezing due to a lack of snow cover. This has had tragic consequences, including travel-related deaths in the past two months. The climate of Alaska, where minus-30 degree Fahrenheit days are typical in midwinter, helps maintain a deep layer of permanently frozen soil, known as permafrost. Right now, the permafrost is melting, and as it does so, it's releasing sizable quantities of global warming gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. This further speeds up global warming in what is known as a ""positive feedback loop."" Bitterly cold days are key to permafrost maintenance and establishing what types of vegetation can be maintained in the state, Brettschneider said. As the state's average temperatures rise, different types of trees may start growing in some spots, as entire ecosystems shift northward with the intense cold. Sea ice extent has been flirting with record low levels this winter across the Arctic. Image: zack labe/nsidc Permafrost is the reason why, in Alaska, students do not get to stay home from school for ""snow days"" like they do in the Lower 48 states. Instead, it's unusually warm weather that causes schools to be canceled in Alaska, because snowmelt and rain will freeze instantly upon contact with the permafrost. Snow-covered roads turn into skating rinks. In Fairbanks, rainfall during the winter used to be nearly unheard of, but in the past several years, including 2018, such weather has occurred. One contributor to the extraordinary warmth of December and parts of January was record low sea ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, off the southwest and northern coasts of Alaska. “We had basically the latest ice over of the Chuckhi Sea in the satellite era,"" said Rick Thoman, a climatologist with the National Weather Service in Fairbanks, in an interview. It was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, in Alaska, in the middle of January. The absence of sea ice meant that air transported in from the southwest, west, and northwest, toward Alaska, was milder than it otherwise would have been, since sea ice cover tends to cool the air above it more than air above open ocean waters. In Utqiaġvik, formerly known as Barrow, Alaska, which juts up against the Chuckchi Sea in far northern Alaska, temperatures were above average for a record 87 straight days, from Oct. 26, 2017 to Jan. 21, 2018, Thoman said. With sea ice on a steep, long-term decline, this kind of climate feedback will happen more often. “The open water part of it shouldn’t be forgotten. What contribution did the open water play to the extraordinary warmth so far? It’s hard to say, but it’s not insignificant,” he said. The warmth has affected every part of the state at various times this winter. For example, on Jan. 14, longstanding temperature records were obliterated in southeastern Alaska, while the rest of the state also experienced above-average temperatures. Metlakatla, located in the Tongass National Forest of southeastern Alaska, the thermometer reached 65 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the warmest temperature ever recorded in the state during the month of January. Think about for a moment: It was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, in Alaska, in the middle of January. Not your grandparents' climate This winter, like many other recent weird winters in Alaska, is reinforcing the message to Alaskans that the climate that their elders grew up with is not what they're living with now. Many are playing a game of catchup with the rapidly shifting environment. “In rural Alaska, everyone knows what’s going on,” Thoman said. In urban Alaska, meaning places like Anchorage and Juneau, there's “more diversity of opinion,” Thoman said. This winter is not just an oddity in locations such as Utqiaġvik and other parts of Alaska, but elsewhere around the tightly knit Arctic region, which is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the globe. Surface air temperature for the Arctic averaged above 80°N. Individual years from 1958-2016 are shown by the sequential blue/purple to yellow lines. 2018 is indicated by the red line and 2017 in yellow. Image: zack labe In Svalbard, Norway, which juts out into the Atlantic side of the Arctic, temperatures have averaged an astonishing 9.3 degrees Celsius, or about 16 degrees Fahrenheit, above average for the past 30 days, according to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Svalbard's sea ice area has hit the second-lowest level on record recently, as well, posing a challenge to native polar bears and other wildlife that depend on the sea ice for hunting prey. Arctic sea ice extent across the vast Arctic Ocean is running at record low levels for this time of year, potentially headed for another record low annual peak. Studies have shown that the extent and speed of Arctic ice decline is unprecedented for at least the past 1,500 years, and that these trends are directly tied to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the air due to the burning of fossil fuels. On shorter timescales, sea ice is significantly influenced by natural weather variability, which can push the ice further toward territory or hold it back from a milestone. Weather patterns during the next several weeks may continue to hamper ice growth, perhaps keeping ice cover at record low levels, as unusually mild air repeatedly floods the Arctic from the Pacific side.","You won't find many climate deniers in the Arctic.

"jberke@businessinsider.com (Jeremy Berke), Jeremy Berke","As Hurricane Florence tore through North Carolina, Business Insider reporters Daniel Brown and Kevin Reilly spent four days reporting from Wilmington and Jacksonville — two of the hardest hit communities. They witnessed rescues while embedded with a Marine unit, escaped rising floodwaters, and saw how disasters can bring out the best aspects of the human spirit. After spending 10 hours embedded with the Marines on Saturday, driving through over five feet of flood water for hours and documenting high-water rescues, Brown and Reilly were dropped off at their rental Jeep in Jacksonville. That's when they quickly realized there was no way out. Jacksonville, a town of about 70,000 people on the banks of North Carolina's New River, had become an island — completely cut off from surrounding towns — as the downpour from Florence showed no signs of stopping. Scenes from the storm. Daniel Brown/Business Insider ""We're on two hours of sleep and we'd been out for like 22 hours, and by the time we got back out of the embed we got into our car and realized we couldn't leave and we had no place to stay,"" Brown said. ""We had no clothes. We hadn't showered in two days and we were just disgusting and grumpy, and we didn't have cell service."" Brown and Reilly attempted to drive back to Wilmington. ""We were driving 50 miles per hour through windy backroads in a downpour,"" Brown said. ""It was completely dark. There was a curfew going on — there was no one around."" They drove the rental Jeep through puddles that got deeper and deeper. There were submerged pickup trucks by the side of the road. ""It was this kind of weird, eerie feeling,"" Brown continued. ""It was scary."" After being turned back by police officers who were blocking the road, the two reporters found themselves at the last hotel in town. It was fully booked. Even the shelters, which were the only respite from the rapidly rising floods, were full. The community rallied together to help each other after the storm. Daniel Brown/Business Insider The hotel's owner took pity, and let Brown sleep on the lobby floor with a group of reporting crews from NBC, Fox News, and CNN. Reilly opted for the car. The hotel had power and hot water, but in the middle of the night, a window was shattered by the storm, Brown said. They made it back to Wilmington in the morning, though things there were far from normal. On Sunday a few shops in the flooded downtown area had opened, including a grocery store and a Waffle House. (FEMA actually uses a "" Waffle House Index "" to track dangerous storms, as the restaurant chain is famous for staying open 24/7 through natural disasters). The grocery store had no power, and all of the frozen items were damaged. ""It was kind of surreal,"" Brown said. ""I walked in and there were no lights on. There was just one guy behind the counter with a flashlight, and people were walking through the aisles with lights on their phones looking at dry goods and buying those in cash."" The roads out of Jacksonville were impassable. Daniel Brown/Business Insider Gas lines stretched for ""hundreds of yards"" as people lined up at the few stations that had any in reserve. But the hardest thing, according to Brown, was the rain. ""The rain never stopped and you were just constantly soaked no matter what you did,"" Brown said. ""You just kind of became a raisin after a while."" Brown and Reilly plan to file many more dispatches from the storm. ""It was a really brutal, grueling experience,"" Brown said.","Daniel Brown/Business Insider Business Insider sent two reporters to cover Hurricane Florence in North Carolina.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,River floods,1

Trucks filled with food, water and other basic supplies, helicopters equipped to provide aerial reconnaissance and shallow-water boats outfitted for search and rescue missions are in various staging areas around the Carolinas and Virginia waiting to kick off a recovery that could take weeks or longer.

Despite being downgraded again late Thursday night, this time to a Category 1 storm, Florence is projected to bring “hurricane-force winds and life-threatening storm surge” as it makes its way on a southwest trek along the Carolina coasts. The storm’s relentless rain had already resulted in serious flooding in low-lying areas and its gusting winds knocked out power for thousands of people in North Carolina. A tornado watch for the area is in effect until Friday night and some areas could see as much as 40 inches of rain. Hundreds of people are awaiting rescue from their homes in New Bern, N.C., as flood waters rise from Hurricane Florence. “We’re estimating we’ve rescued 150-200,” New Bern Police Lt. David Daniels said early Friday morning, who estimates an additional 150-200 are waiting to be rescued. 091418-Rainfall-forecast-hurricane-florence_Online (Photo: USA TODAY) During Friday morning's press briefing, representatives from several federal agencies and civic organizations provided updates on their recovery plans: - Health and Human Services has declared public health emergencies in North Carolina and South Carolina to ease treatment of patients. The declaration allows qualified medical staff from elsewhere who may not be certified in either state to treat victims, and allows patients from the storm area to get reimbursed for care they receive in case their medical insurance doesn't cover it. The agency is also coordinating with FEMA to activate a national contract that makes additional ambulances available to evacuate hospitals and nursing homes if needed. - The Pentagon has deployed 9,700 military and civilian workers to the area, some of whom are already helping in rescue missions. At Fort Bragg near Fayetteville, North Carolina, several hundred trailers filled with food, water and other supplies are ready to be dispatched to communities in need once the storm passes. - More than 40,000 crews from 17 states are staged outside the storm's footprint, ready to restore power as soon as it's safe to do so. The crews are in place thanks to ""mutual assistance"" agreements in place for disaster response. Power outages from Hurricane Florence have topped 500,000 customers, according to one analysis. Most of the outages are in North Carolina, though several thousand are without power in South Carolina.The Weather Channel estimated that up to 3 million customers might lose power due to Florence. - The U.S. Coast Guard has positioned 40 aircraft – about one fifth of its entire air fleet – immediately outside the storm's path to begin search and rescue operations once it's safe to do so. Also, the agency is poised to deploy teams and boats that can operate in shallow water to provide law enforcement, maritime security and response to chemical spills or other environmental dangers excess flooding can cause.

Gina Martinez and Alix Langone,"The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Florence – with winds of up to 140 mph – is expected to be “extremely dangerous” when it hits the East Coast early Friday. But, it’s the water, not the wind, that has the potential to make the storm so deadly, experts say. A storm as big as Hurricane Florence will hit with a “one-two punch” deluge of water, Erik Salna, the associate director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University, says. First comes the storm surge – a rise in sea levels caused by storm winds. Then come the torrents of rain. Hurricane Florence is currently a massive Category 4 hurricane. It’s gaining strength and could even be upgraded to Category 5 before it makes landfall early Friday, according to forecasts. Most of the deaths from hurricanes in recent years have come from people who stay put and get caught in the ensuing floods, retired Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Lennon tells TIME. Lennon, the chair of the Emergency Management and Homeland Security Department at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, says the biggest mistake during Hurricane Katrina – which claimed 1,833 lives – was that officials only ordered evacuations 24 hours before it hit New Orleans in 2005, and by then it was too late. “The bottom line if you wait, it’s too late,” he said. “If you have to make large scale evacuations, make the call early. The term mandatory evacuation rings hollow because there’s no good way to actually enforce it but if you call it something else people are not going to follow.” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced Monday that mandatory evacuations would begin at noon Tuesday for more than 1 million people on the South Carolina coast. The governors of North Carolina and Virginia have announced mandatory evacuations of hundreds of thousands more in their states. The National Hurricane Center says storm surge from Hurricane Florence could be up to 13 feet in some areas of North Carolina. Salna predicts it could rise as high as 15 feet. “It’s possible it could be even higher than that depending on how quickly the storm moves to the coast, but we’re kind of expecting it to slow down as it moves to the coast and would probably cut down the storm surge,” AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski says. “Nonetheless, there still would be a very life threatening storm surge of somewhere around 10 to 15 feet.” On Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center issues storm surge warnings for the areas around the Outer Banks in North Carolina and the South Santee River in South Carolina. Massive waves from the hurricane will make the rush of water even more dangerous and damaging, the National Hurricane Center warned. After the storm surge comes the deluge of rain. Up to three feet of rain could fall in some areas in a short period of time. Up to 15-25 inches is expected in many areas where Hurricane Florence hits. The National Hurricane Center says such massive rainfall could produce “catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding.” “Florence is going to drop tremendous amount of rain, not as much as [Hurricane] Harvey brought to Texas but there will almost definitely be flooding,” Salna says. The flooding will depend whether Florence slows down and lingers over coastal areas as it moves inland, Salna says. If this happens, the result will be heavy rains that cause serious damage.","“Florence is going to drop tremendous amount of rains, not as much as Harvey brought to Texas but there will almost definitely be flooding.” Salna said.",2018-09-11T22:26:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Why Hurricane Florence Is So Dangerous,http://time.com/5392883/why-hurricane-florence-so-dangerous/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/hurricane-florence-rainfall.gif,time,Time,River floods,1
"USA TODAY, Editors, USA TODAY","A Starbucks located in downtown Pittsburgh. (Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) Starbucks stores to close for racial-bias training Starbucks will close all of its company-owned coffee shops in the U.S. on Tuesday afternoon to conduct racial-bias training following the embarrassing arrest of two African-American men at a store last month. Nearly 175,000 employees will receive the training. The Seattle-based chain came under fire after staff at a Philadelphia store called the police on the two men when they didn't buy anything and asked to use the restrooms. The men were told restrooms were for paying customers only. They were arrested even though they explained they were waiting for a friend, who arrived later. Starbucks changed its policy earlier this month, telling employees in a letter that customers can use bathrooms ""regardless of whether they make a purchase."" The incident at a Philadelphia Starbucks where two black men were arrested while waiting for a white friend is novel in its coverage, but African Americans say this type of treatment isn't new.
