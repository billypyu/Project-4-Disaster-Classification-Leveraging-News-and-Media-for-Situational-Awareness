"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Dog plays in US snow A heavy storm has brought a record amount of snow to the US city of Erie on Christmas Day, forcing officials to declare a state of emergency. A total of 34in (86cm) of snow blanketed the city and surrounding areas in the Pennsylvania state. There was no respite on Boxing Day, with meteorologists registering a grand total of 60in over the two-day period. Police warned motorists that ""roads are dangerous and impassable"", with a number of closures reported. More snow is forecast on Wednesday. The officials say the heavy snowstorm is the result of lake-effect snow - when cold air combines with lake water. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Some residents had to shovel their way out The city lies on the shores of Lake Erie. So, what snow records were smashed? In fact, a number of them. The National Weather Center Cleveland on Christmas Day registered a new all-time high for any single day, beating the previous record set in 1956. The state's two-day snowfall record from 1944 was also shattered, as well as a storm total snowfall and a monthly snowfall. How are local residents affected? A number of cars and homes were buried in snow, with some residents having to shovel their way out. Shops and childcare centres were closed. Some flights to and from the Erie International airport were cancelled. Meanwhile, social media users have been publishing amazing pictures from the area.","A heavy storm brings a record amount of snow to the US city of Erie, burying homes and cars.",2017-12-27T05:23:15Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Snow emergency in US town after huge storm,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42490329,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05s3239.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Lake Storm,1
ART CULLEN,"The rest of us know that without them, Buena Vista County could fade away, losing population as 71 of Iowa’s 99 counties have over the last decade. Here, young immigrant families seed a positive birth-to-death ratio. Storm Lake is the rare blue oasis in Representative Steve King’s Fourth Congressional District that is growing organically — with brown babies. The crime rate here has been falling over the decade. Mr. King is the congressman who was for building a wall before Donald Trump knew we needed one. “For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” Mr. King said in 2013. He says that we should take care not to dilute our culture with immigrants, even though their culture was here before Columbus brought his. People around here voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. King, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. They like Mr. King because they think he is a straight-talker willing t be blunt, just like President Trump. But they don’t like making soybean prices nose-dive for no understandable reason. And they don’t want to run the Julio Barrosos off to Guadalajara when we need young workers in Iowa. A local banker, George Schaller, whose grandfather, also a George, lured meatpacking here in the 1920s, gave Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowan and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a talking-to a few weeks ago. “The short of it is that Storm Lake needs a solution to immigration, and we’ve needed one for decades,” he told the senator. We need help in Iowa, especially in Storm Lake. Tyson needs good maintenance technicians, and will pay them more than $20 per hour. But young white workers aren’t bidding for those jobs. They’ve moved off for engineering degrees and other greener pastures. “The jobs are there. Where are the skilled workers to fill those jobs?” the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, asked at the Peosta round table. Where? They are in the shadows in America. Or they are in Mexico. George Schaller and Kevin Cone don’t want to scare off the Latina attending Buena Vista University who dreams of teaching. Iowans are ashamed when refugee children are caged like criminals. We all want order at the border. And we wish that Julio could come home to Storm Lake someday. We need him and miss him.

ADAM NAGOURNEY and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) When state legislation designed to override local zoning laws and permit construction of apartment buildings in a half-mile swath around transit lines across California died earlier this year, opponents said the decision of where to build desperately needed housing should be left to local communities. That is about to be put to the test. A Los Angeles City Council committee is set to vote today for a measure to permit construction of up to 6,000 units of housing in apartment buildings along the new Expo train light-rail line, which goes from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica. This is not as ambitious as the plan put forward by Senator Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, with its threat of apartment buildings popping up on blocks of single-family homes. That plan produced a storm of opposition from critics who assailed it as a threat to neighborhoods and local control. The bill never made it out of committee. Mr. Wiener praised Los Angeles for moving to act, but said it did not go far enough. “This rezoning is clearly an improvement on what’s there today,” he said. “But it’s largely focused on the main thoroughfares. Once you get an inch off the main thoroughfare, it’s not rezoned at all.”","Tuesday: L.A. votes on whether to add units along a transit line, the Pawnee Fire rages in Lake County, and recalling when the Rockets left San Diego.",2018-06-26T12:59:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Who Gets to Decide Where to Build Housing?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/california-today-la-housing-vote.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/26/us/26californiatoday-01/26californiatoday-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Lake Storm,1

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","TOLEDO, OHIO The staff at Maumee Bay Brewing Company swear that the brewerys 150-year old building is haunted. A bartender is sure she saw a glass floating on its own. Another swears she saw a woman with a skeletal hand who vanished when she turned around. The janitor, at least, thinks the ghosts are friendly. Needless to say, the staff has grown familiar with the supernatural and may have even learned to embrace it. Just look at their latest seasonal beer. Its an ode to a monster environmentalists have tried to painstakingly eliminate for years. This beast doesnt hide in the bars dark basement after hours, though. It rears its head every summer on Lake Erie, the brewerys water source. Im talking about the lakes diabolical algae blooms or, now memorialized in a hoppy, sour ale, the Creature from the Alegae Bloom. Lake Eries algae blooms result from an overabundance of blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria. They emerge during the summer when the spring rains have funneled nitrogen and phosphorous from agriculture and storm runoff into the lake, said Nicholas Mandros, the northwest regional director for the Ohio Environmental Council, which collaborated with the brewery on the beer. During summer, theres plenty of sunlight and warmth to keep the algae healthy and thriving. And that spells trouble for the 11 million people who depend on the lake for their drinking water. At Lake Erie, algae blooms have been an issue for the last 20 years, but the situation has worsened over the last 10. It reached new heights in 2014 when levels of a toxic blue-green algae known as microcystin became so high in the water that it wasnt safe for drinking or brewing beer. In Toledo, residents were tough out of luck for three days. The brewery and its accompanying restaurants closed, too. [Microcystins] one of the most harmful substances out there, so it doesnt really take a whole lot of it in the water in order for you to feel its effects, Mandros told Earther. Potential health effects include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and pneumonia to name just a few. This recurring health hazard is what inspired the Maumee Bays new green fizzy beer. Brewer Chris Clarke started crafting a recipe for the sour double IPA last year. Eventually, he found the perfect balance of matcha, kiwi, and non-toxic algae that safe for consumption, which give it its green tint. The beer debuted in August, just in time for the lakes annual bloom. Its the perfect summer drink: strong enough to give you a buzz but with such a fruity refreshing taste to balance its heavy dose of hops. The beer plays to the idea of finding that balance between growing the crops we need to grow and maintaining our freshwater resources, Clarke told me after I tasted the beer myself. These are depressing times to love beer and the environment, not only because algae blooms are threatening the water supply breweries need, but because climate change could also threaten the barley needed to make the beer itself. Climate change is also fueling the growth of these algae by warming waters and pummeling higher volumes of rain onto the landscape, which helps more nutrients ultimately reach the lake. In short: The situation sucks. But it doesnt have to. Our actions can reduce the amount of nutrient runoff fueling algae blooms around the country, and we can also take steps to curb global warming. Thats why the fine folks at Maumee Bay Brewing concocted this drink in the first place: to increase awareness of the problem and encourage action. For the most part, customers have been into the beer, said Shannon Mohr, the companys sales and marketing manager. Other breweries have reached out to learn more about how Maumee Bay deals with the lakes blooms and to add the beer to their taps. Ultimately, the goal is to never have to brew the beer again, Mohr told me as we sat at the bar. Blooms hit the lake around summertime, which is the only time of year the beer is available. No bloom, no beer. The brewery carries the beer until their latest batch runs out, and they were running low when I dropped by earlier this month. This sour double IPA is tasty, and itd be missed, but losing one beer is better than losing them all. Its loss would be mean were one step closer to preserving Lake Erie. And thatd be something worth celebrating.","TOLEDO, OHIO—The staff at Maumee Bay Brewing Company swear that the brewery’s 150-year old building is haunted.

We received the indictment and anticipate that a not-guilty plea will soon be entered and are working with court and counsel for a self surrender and bond hearing, Mr. Hobbs said. The July 19 accident was one of the deadliest involving a duck boat modeled after the amphibious trucks used in World War II to move along land and water in United States history. When the duck boat entered the lake, the waters were calm, but there had been numerous warnings of an approaching storm. Wind speeds picked up suddenly, increasing to more than 70 miles an hour. Fierce waves buffeted the boat, which took on water. Within minutes, the vessel had sunk. Fourteen people survived, including Mr. McKee. The vehicles have had several fatal accidents on both water and land, including in May 1999, when 13 people were killed when a duck boat sank in Hot Springs, Ark. After that accident, a National Transportation Safety Board report made several nonbinding recommendations, asking operators to add flotation equipment and equip the vehicles with sufficient pumping power to keep them afloat when they begin to take on too much water.

Gael Fashingbauer Cooper,"This is the final wave that took out the south pier light tower... What a crazy experience! :( :) if you go through them...
Posted by Ann Barbeau on Monday, January 7, 2019
How do you know a storm is really serious? Maybe when it smashes a 20-foot structure into Lake Michigan.
Photographer Ann Barbeau of Manitowoc, Wisconsin told me she enjoys the shore of the Great Lake daily. On Monday, she was out near Manitowoc's South Pier Light Navigational Beacon just as the storm turned fierce.
""I was out this morning taking pictures of the waves,"" Barbeau said, noting that she was using sports mode on her camera to take multiple photos at once. ""This big wave came in, and as soon as it cleared, the light tower was gone.""
The series of 16 photos, which Barbeau posted on Facebook and allowed CNET to reproduce here, show a gigantic wave crashing into the 20-foot structure, then hiding it from view. When the waves clear -- like an evil magician's trick, the beacon is gone.
""I looked in the water, and it was floating for about five seconds, then sunk,"" she said. ""I looked around and cleared my eyes because I couldn't believe what I just witnessed.""
The stunning crash created multiple emotions for Barbeau, who says she felt, ""sad, bad, (and) super-excited at the same time.""
Some news reports said that a lighthouse was washed away, and the Manitowoc Breakwater Lighthouse does indeed stand at the end of the city's north pier. But that wasn't what fell into the water, Chief Eric Olson of the US Coast Guard confirmed to Green Bay's WFRV news. The lighthouse still stands.
Instead, it was the nearby beacon that Barbeau saw crash into the lake, a victim of the strong waves and wind that hit its 20-foot-tall fiberglass tower.
""It's an aid to navigation,"" Olson told WFRV, ""but certainly still an important beacon and we'll definitely look to address the fact that it's missing.""
The event took place around 8:30 a.m. CT Monday morning, and no one was injured. The Coast Guard did not immediately respond to a CNET request for comment.
Olson told the Manitowoc Herald Times Reporter that the Coast Guard will search for the beacon, and that it does need to be replaced. He also told the paper he's not aware of anything similar happening on the lake in the past.
""Rest In Peace, South Pier Lighthouse,"" wrote Manitowoc mayor Justin Nickels in a tweet. (He probably meant ""beacon,"" but the hyperbole is understandable.) ""We can now add this to our upcoming attractions in our Marine Sanctuary along with the shipwrecks. In all seriousness, the Coast Guard has been notified about this since it is their lighthouse. All will be well.""

 Mayor Justin Nickels (@mantymayor) January 7, 2019
Olson told WFRV that the beacon will be replaced in the spring, and said the strength of Monday's waves, aided by the direction in which they were crashing, caused the beacon to wash into the lake.
""The waves got very large and the direction was directly into the break wall,"" he told the station. ""It's not a common occurrence, but in the end Mother Nature sometimes wins.""
For Barbeau, it was a once-in-a-lifetime lake walk. 
""What a crazy experience!"" she wrote on Facebook.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Less than a month after facing down Florence, the U.S. faces another historic storm. Hurricane Michael is churning its way toward Floridas Panhandle as a Category 4 monster. As of 7 a.m. on Wednesday, the storms winds were roaring at a sustained 145 mph with gusts higher, according to data gathered by Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Michael was 90 miles offshore from Panama Beach and is expected to make landfall late morning or early afternoon. The threats will be manifold, but among the most dangerous will be up to 14 feet of storm surge for large parts of the coast. Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, but there has never been a storm like Michael to hit this part of the state. Atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach tweeted that Michaels 933 millibar central pressurea key meteorological measure of intensity where lower generally means strongeris the seventh lowest of any storm ever to reach Florida. The list of storms with lower pressures is an ignominious one, including last years Irma, Andrew in 1992, and the Lake Okeechobee and Great Miami hurricanes that decimated the state in the 1920s. This is not the type of company you want to keep. The National Weather Service Tallahassee office issued a stark graphic and warning late last night to underscore what the region is facing. The statement in part reads: We searched the historical database for category 4 hurricanes that have made landfall in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. The map says it allits BLANK this situation has NEVER happened before... If you have been told to evacuate, LEAVE. Do not stay and risk your life or that of your family. Tropical storm-force winds have already been recorded at Apalachicola Regional Airport and rain bands are spiraling ashore. Conditions will deteriorate quickly over the coming hours. Florida Governor Rick Scott has announced that for those who didnt or couldnt afford to evacuate, the window to get out of Michaels way has closed. If you are in a coastal area, do not leave your house, he said at his morning briefing. Scroll down to see our liveblog below.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Great Lakes region is sending the year out with a bang. Wave after wave of lake effect snow has pummeled the region, making for a record-setting white Christmas and a shoveling project that could take until New Year’s Eve to complete. Erie, PA, is under a snow emergency after 53 inches of snow fell in 30 hours—the state record for the snowiest two-day period. It’s also more than Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and a slew of other seemingly snow cities get over an average winter. The crazy snow totals don’t stop there. In Redfield, NY, more than 32 inches fell in 24 hours between Christmas Day and early Tuesday. The region is expecting up to an additional 36 inches of snow by tomorrow, making shoveling a futile task. If Erie picks up four inches, it will officially set the record for the snowiest December ever recorded in Pennsylvania. “Travel will be very difficult to impossible,” the National Weather Service wrote in its lake-effect snow warning, a polite way of saying “we hope you’re not sick of your family yet.” The region from Cleveland to far upstate New York is no stranger to massive snow totals. Its geography sets it up perfectly for these types of large snowstorms. And in a seemingly strange twist of fate, climate change could actually provide them with a boost. Lake effect snow requires a few things to fall into place. The first, as with all snowstorms, is cold. It’s gotta be below 32°F to snow. For the Great Lakes region, cold air dropping out of Canada provides that key ingredient. But what allows lake effect snowstorms to produce such huge amounts of snow is, well, the lakes. Specifically, it’s the difference between the air temperature and the water temperature of the Great Lakes. As cold air rushes over lakes, it sweeps up some of the heat (relatively speaking) and moisture from the lakes’ surface. The length of the Great Lakes allow these burgeoning storms to pick up a huge head of steam as they barrel toward land. By the time they reach the Great Lakes’ shores, the air has become so moist and unstable that it unleashes a massive amount of snow with rates that can approach three inches an hour. These storms tend to come in narrow bands that result in tight snowfall gradients and even sunny skies a few miles from to most intense parts of the storm. Angela Fritz at Capital Weather Gang explains this curious quirk : “When a band of lake effect snow really gets going, an interesting thing happens. Air rises in the snowy regions and then sinks on either side, which means the area right next to these snow bands can be completely clear, with blue sky and sun. It also means just a few miles can separate 53 inches from zero.” The shape of the lakes and direction winds usually travel means that within the region, there are lake effect snow hot spots. The areas around Buffalo and Syracuse can get particularly snowy because winds are able to travel over long expanses of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, respectively. Parts of Michigan are also prone to heavy lake effect snow, particularly areas along the south shore of Lake Superior. The snowiest ski resort in the Midwest, for example, is on the Keweenaw Peninsula, which juts out into the lake from the Upper Peninsula and acts as a lake effect snow magnet. Lake effect snow is most common in November and December when there’s a lot of open water on the Great Lakes. As winter wears on and the lakes freeze over, moisture for these storms disappear. Ice only covers 3 percent of the Great Lakes as of Saturday but a coming Arctic blast could cause them to rapidly freeze up in the coming weeks, shutting down lake effect snow season. That’s where climate change comes in, though. Peak Great Lakes ice cover has been declining since satellite measurements began in the 1970s. Less ice means more chances for lake effect snow. And turns out that that’s exactly what scientists have observed. A 2003 study looking back to the 1930s showed an increase in lake effect snow across the entire lake effect snow region. A 2009 study using slightly stricter quality controls found that areas downwind of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan have seen significant increases with slightly less significant increases near Lakes Ontario and Erie. But snow could become less bountiful if climate change continues to wreak havoc. Warmer weather means less ice on the lakes, but it also means fewer days with freezing weather. Without early season cold, early season lake effect snowstorms could become less common according to a 2015 study. Ditto for late season ones after the ice starts to break up. That’s bad news for snow lovers, but a small silver lining of climate change for future 20somethings stuck at home for the holidays (lol kidding, their lives will probably be hell ).","The Great Lakes region is sending the year out with a bang.

It’s called an atmospheric river, over a thousand miles of water and wind. This weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April. On the official scale, the storm will probably top out at “strong”—it might have enough water vapor transport to rate as “extreme,” but probably won’t reach “exceptional,” the real freak-out level of flood danger. That means several inches of rain. This is how California gets most of its disastrous floods, but also most of its drinking water. It’s a crazy way to do business, but understanding these atmospheric rivers might be the key to making sure the human race doesn’t die of thirst.

A few times a year one of them does what this weekend’s storm will do: shotguns over Hawaii and into Northern California. “It tails all the way back into the tropics, almost to the date line,” says Michael Anderson, the California State climatologist. “It’s going to come through pretty quick.” Onshore, the fast, wet air from one of these so-called Pineapple Expresses ricochets upward off the coastal mountain ranges like a tennis ball catching the top of the net. The air rises; the water falls. That’s called “orographic enhancement,” and it’s how you get massive bursts of rain and floods. Somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of California’s entire water supply comes from atmospheric river storms. And they are intense. In one study of six years of California rainfall, monitored hour-by-hour, just 1,460 hours qualified as atmospheric river storms. But that scant 2.8 percent of time accounted for over 50 percent of the rainfall the researchers measured. California hoards more than half of that rain as snowfall on the tops of the Sierras. The rest it tries to save in reservoirs—a dozen big ones and about 150 littler ones scattered up and down the state. In the rainy winter months, the reservoirs fill up—ideally—leaving space for the snowmelt to come in the summer. Ideally. During the winter, all the reservoirs stay empty enough to absorb flood waves from storms. “But on April 1, that reserve space starts being relaxed so they can capture snowmelt,” Anderson says. “With a storm this time of year, you still have that flood reserve space, so there’s room for the reservoirs to catch that water. The question will be, as that reserve space is being relaxed, can that water be kept for the conservation pool?” It’s a balance—hold onto water for a rain-free summer and possible drought, be ready to capture snowmelt, but leave enough room to store a flood wave during the storm season. Every reservoir has a rule curve that says how much water is too much. But atmospheric rivers can make it tough to know when to apply those rules. In November and December of 2012, the Lake Mendocino Reservoir absorbed water from two atmospheric river events, enough so that the water encroached into the “flood pool,” which is supposed to stay empty for emergencies. “So the reservoir operators released the water. It was the prudent thing to do,” says F. Martin Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “But nobody knew that there would be no more atmospheric rivers basically for the rest of the year, and that was the beginning of the drought. They never had a chance to refill the reservoir in the spring.” So Ralph, along with the Sonoma County Water Agency (which regulates the drinking water in Lake Mendocino), the US Army Corps of Engineers (which operates the flood prevention aspects of the reservoir), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which monitors the salmon fishery that’s part of the lake’s hydrology) are all working on a finer-grained system. “It’s possible that with modern weather prediction we can see with some certainty these atmospheric rivers coming a few days ahead, so hypothetically one could consider keeping some of that extra water temporarily, and every day looking at the forecast to see if there’s an atmospheric river,” Ralph says. “If there’s not, the chance of there being a flood problem is essentially zero.” The idea’s still in a planning stage; Ralph’s group is now trying these “forecast-informed reservoir operations” at Mendocino and Prado in southern California. (It's still status quo ante at other reservoirs, like Like Oroville—where the people in charge will be trying out their new spillway, rebuilt since the old one crumbled during last year's rains. But if the new approach works—and so far it seems like it may—reservoirs can keep the water for a not-rainy day. That day may be coming. Or it might not. Water in the American west was variable and unpredictable even before humans started pumping enough carbon into the atmosphere that it’d change the climate. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor. That by itself would strengthen atmospheric rivers. But a warmer atmosphere means warmer poles, which reduces the temperature difference between the middle of the planet and the ends. That means weaker winds and weaker ARs. “However, there’s a big asterisk on that. It’s inevitable that some storms will be just as strong in terms of wind as they are today, and they will have available to them more water vapor,” Ralph says. “There could be a class of atmospheric river storms that are a lot stronger than we’ve seen in the past.” Ralph’s ideas for managing reservoirs better might end up being a necessary adaptation to a changed climate —and not just in California. The northwestern US gets a quarter to a third of its annual rainfall from atmospheric rivers, and they cause floods there, too. Arizona’s and Idaho’s big winter floods are often due to atmospheric rivers; a few years ago one even caused major flooding in Nashville. They are the drivers of flood and drought around the world. So understanding those ocean-spanning tendrils on satellite maps may be the solution to what’s arguably going to be humanity’s most pressing problem: figuring out what to do when the rains come, and when they don’t.",An atmospheric river means this weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April.,2018-04-06T17:30:46Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",An Atmospheric River Will Hit California With a Month's Worth of Rain,https://www.wired.com/story/a-months-worth-of-rain-will-hit-california-this-weekend/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac6bb0b19970475a8fa4ab4/191:100/pass/sfrain_623351114208.jpg,wired,Wired,Lake Storm,1
Adam Rosenberg,"Parts of the Southeastern United States woke up to a most unusual sight on Wednesday morning: Snow and ice. The icy onslaught came from the incipient stages of a rapidly intensifying storm that threatens to set off a ""meteorological bomb"" as it creeps north through Wednesday night, but it's already making history in the South. Regions of the U.S. that aren't accustomed to seeing snowy weather are bracing for record-setting accumulation.

The 0.1 inches of accumulation might seem like nothing to a northerner, but it was more than enough in Tallahassee to prompt a warning from local police. The nearby Gulf Coast of Louisiana has also gotten a rare taste of snow and freezing rain, thanks to the unusual Arctic air mass in place ahead of the storm.

But the storm's historic impact will be well-established by then. The storm's unusually heavy impact on southern states is the product of a powerful and long-lasting Arctic blast that brought cold air much further south than is normal. We've already seen much heavier snowfall in the U.S. this winter, as recently as last weekend's lake-band effect-prompted inundation of Erie, Penn., but this storm's relatively light accumulation in the Southeast is no less history-making.

Mark Kaufman,"A mighty dust storm swirled around the Opportunity rover on June 10, 2018, forcing the robot to shut itself off and conserve power. The dust blocked out nearly all the sunlight, turning day to night. 
Opportunity would never awake. On Wednesday, NASA announced that they would no longer attempt to revive the 15-year-old machine, formally ending the legendary extraterrestrial mission. 
But on that dark June day, just before Opportunity went silent, the rover took one final picture:
Opportunity's final picture.
Image: nasa
The image captured a Martian world shrouded in darkness by the dust storm. 
""This was the last image we ever took,"" Bill Nelson, chief of the Opportunity mission's engineering team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in an interview just after NASA declared the mission over. 
""We are looking at an incredibly small amount of sunlight .002 percent of the normal sunlight that we would expect to see,"" said Nelson. ""If you were there, it would be late twilight. Your human eye would still be able to make out some features, but it would be very dark.""
But in this final image, no Martian features are visible.
In the picture, the white static amid the black is just image noise the camera picked up in the darkened setting (""It's kind of like the image you get on your phone in a very dark environment,"" said Nelson). The thick black bar at the bottom of the picture is data that never arrived back to Earth as if Opportunity's message was cut off mid-sentence.
SEE ALSO: A 12-mile, underground lake may have been found on Mars. What could live there?
If the rover had not been caught in such a dust storm, it would have taken a picture down a channel, about 20-feet across, as Opportunity peered down a valley, said Nelson.
So-called ""Perseverance Valley"" became Opportunity's final resting spot. 
Six days earlier, Opportunity captured the following picture of the wide, sloping environment.
Perseverance Valley, taken in early June 2018.
Image: nasa
Over the course of Opportunity's life, the rover shot well over 200,000 images and sent them back to Earth. 
One of Nelson's favorites came just 180 Martian days, or sols, into Opportunity's exploration of the red planet. With the sun shining behind the rover, Opportunity captured an image of its long shadow.

""It's very evocative of the status of that rover,"" said Nelson. ""Here we are, with one tiny rover on this foreign, alien planet all by itself.""
Now, the 400-pound robot will spend millennia getting shrouded in red dust, and NASA engineers like Nelson will move on to other extraterrestrial projects, as will his entire NASA exploration team.
""It's bittersweet,"" said Nelson, noting how proud he is to have worked with engineers and scientists that directed Opportunity for some 15 years. ""Now, our teams are going to sort of scatter to the winds.""","A mighty dust storm swirled around the Opportunity rover on June 10, 2018, forcing the robot to shut itself off and conserve power.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Where it happens, dangerous travel conditions and power outages are possible. Winter storm watches and advisories already are in place for more than 12 million people in portions of states from New Mexico to North Carolina. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: Friday morning through Saturday evening Precipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Snow, ice and f looding rain Snowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Nearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots. Oklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most Arkansans won't feel precipitation until later Friday, with winter weather beginning in the overnight hours and moving east Saturday morning toward Tennessee. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix Significant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a ""once-in-a-generation event."" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow. While most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon. Snow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" or ""the wedge"" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a ""warm nose"" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the ""'wedge,"" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah. Now, a new satellite image reveals the extent of unloaded rainfall in the nearby desert of Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert and (normally) one of the driest places on Earth. The image, taken by NASA’s Operational Land Imager three days after the storm brought heavy rains to the region—Salalah saw 11 inches of precipitation in just 24 hours, more than double its yearly average—captures the arid desert’s typical large swaths of sand with ripples sculpted by wind. But there’s one novel feature: water lakes in the flat lowlands between the sand dune tops. This water lake phenomenon has not been seen in the desert in almost two decades, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. The desert, also known as the Empty Quarter, receives about 1.2 inches of rain per year on average. Aside from being quite the sight, these bountiful rainwater deposits could be beneficial for local business. “The land will need 30 days to sprout their summer plants,” Ali Al- Hatish, a regular visitor desert visitor, told Al Arabiya.net. After that, camel owners expect this vegetation to feed their camels for the next two years. The paper also reports that the rare sight of lakes interspersed with dunes could send to tourists flocking to the area. Tropical Cyclone Mekunu spun up in the Arabian Sea in late May. Extremely warm waters (31-32 degrees Celsius or 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit) fed the storm until its winds equalled that of a Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Arabian Peninsula, according to The Weather Channel. This made Mekunu’s landfall historic; the Arabian Peninsula sees a tropical cyclone every year or every couple of years, but a tropical cyclone making landfall with hurricane-like wind speeds is a rarity in Oman and Yemen. As myriad media outlets reported, Oman and Yemen bore the brunt of the tropical cyclone with destructive winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding wreaking havoc in cities. These new satellite images are a reminder that powerful storms have the potential to dramatically reshaping natural landscapes, too.","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah.

"Judson Jones and Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)A winter storm will unload a messy mix of heavy snow, strong winds and frigid temperatures across parts of the Midwest and Northeast over the weekend. 
About 115 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. Snow will start Saturday evening in Boston and New York, which will then turn into a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. 
The National Weather Service in New York is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of sleet and snow plus possible ice. New York may warm up enough for rain Sunday morning, but freezing is expected by the evening when temperatures plummet. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state will begin Saturday at 3 p.m. ET. Amtrak will operate a modified service Saturday and Sunday due to the weather, it said. 
Thousands of flights canceled
Travel through Sunday will be affected, with nearly 2,000 flights involving domestic airports canceled, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, closed for several hours after a Southwest Airlines flight went off a runway while taxiing. The airliner slid onto a runway overrun area, Southwest Airlines said. 
None of the 150 passengers and six crew members was injured, the airline said. 
The storm system is associated with the same upper-level energy as one on the West Coast that dumped rain in Los Angeles and elsewhere as well as caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Blowing and drifting snow
The second storm will exit the Rockies and likely will begin to drop snow across Kansas over the weekend. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of a storm last week-- will get less accumulation this time. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could face through the weekend. Both cities may get more than half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, snow to the north and ice and snow across the states' centers. 
Icing is possible in New England
This second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up at least 6 to 12 inches deep, with some icing for added misery.
The Interstate 95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will form, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning Saturday at noon. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
Deep chill across the United States 
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough for rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. It's expected to happen so fast it would instantly freeze any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

Which airport was the biggest offender last year? For the second year in a row, LaGuardia ranked number one, canceling some 4.07% of departing flightswhich means one in 25 flights never got off the ground. LGA was followed closely by Norfolk International Airport in Virginia, which canceled four percent of flights, and Charleston International Airport in South Carolina that canceled 3.89 percent of flights.
Meanwhile, airports like Salt Lake City International and Boise Air Terminal canceled the least amount of flights in 2018 (canceling just .30 and .43 percent of flights, respectively)if youre planning a layover, stopping by Utah or Idaho wouldnt be such a bad idea.
According to InsureMyTrip, severe weather was mostly to blame for last years cancellations with Hurricane Florence and Winter Storm Grayson affecting East Coast flights. Still, 2019 isnt looking any better, given the grounding of Boeing Max 737 aircrafts and sudden cancellations across airlines (January 2019, the last recorded month, saw 16,726 cancellations alone).

Erie saw more snow pile up over a two day period than any other location in the state of Pennsylvania had seen previously during a 13-day period. It was a lot of snow.

Previous record was 52.8"" from 12/31/98-1/12/99. — NWS Cleveland (@NWSCLE) December 26, 2017 The high level of accumulation is a product of lake-effect snow. When frigid, dry Arctic air blows across the warmer and unfrozen Great Lakes, the resulting moisture in the air forms long, thin bands of intense snow. The resulting thick and powdery snow falls in downwind areas, and the storms that deliver it can be quite intense. Sometimes, they'll even produce lightning and thunder — resulting in the rare, wonderfully named weather event known as ""thundersnow."" As you might imagine, with so much snow falling in Erie, Pennsylvanians were out in force to document the historic event on social media.

"Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone, CNN","(CNN) After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend. At least 44 people have died since the hurricane slammed into the coast last week. While the rain subsided, some rivers are still rising, and North and South Carolina officials warn the flooding danger is far from over. ""The Cape Fear River will crest again this weekend, along with the Lumber River,"" the North Carolina Department of Transportation tweeted Friday, adding that the Neuse will rise Monday. ""Additionally, new areas are flooding with little warning. Due to this, travel isn't recommended south of US 64,"" it said. While some roads are not flooded, they may have damage and hazardous debris that makes it dangerous to drive or walk on them, state officials said. In South Carolina, emergency officials issued a stern warning on avoiding the roads: ""I know we sound redundant, but it bears repeating: Turn around, don't drown!"" the state's emergency management department tweeted. A week after Hurricane Florence made landfall, the trillions of gallons of water it dumped over the Carolinas are slowly moving toward the sea and leaving a path of destruction behind. Residential streets have turned into rivers and freeways have morphed into waterways. Storm recovery will cost $1.2 billion In North Carolina, flooded rivers have left thousands of evacuees living in shelters and hundreds of roads underwater. The water has receded in some places, but as it moves downstream, officials say, thousands of people could be in danger until next week. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Friday a number of rivers -- the Waccamaw, Lynches, Little Pee Dee and Big Pee Dee -- are forecast to crest east of Interstate 95 this weekend and early next week. Residents were warned the confluence of the Big Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee rivers -- where they merge -- could reach flood levels even greater than those seen during Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the state's resources and personnel have shifted to the Pee Dee region. Authorities have said 23 out of the 46 counties in South Carolina could potentially be impacted by flooding. Residents in those areas are still recovering from the 2015 catastrophic floods in the Carolinas as well as from the widespread damage of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 In Conway, South Carolina, authorities said residents could see damage in homes that have not flooded before. Officials are also worried about contamination and environmental hazards from the storm, including the potential effects of coal ash. Coal ash is an industrial waste created by coal-burning power plants, and can carry health risks. Flooding from the Cape Fear River caused breaches in a dam at a cooling lake at Duke Energy's LV Sutton Plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, prompting the company to shut down the natural gas plant Friday, Duke Energy said in a statement. ""Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches -- one large and several smaller -- on the southern end of the impoundment,"" the statement said. It noted there are two coal ash basins on the site, but said there was ""no visible ash in the cooling lake. A landfill containing disposed ash from the site has not been affected by the cooling lake, it said. An earlier statement from Duke Energy explained the LV Sutton coal power plant was retired in 2013, and today the plant operates as a natural gas plant. Most of the people died in North Carolina Of the 44 people killed, three have been in Virginia, 32 in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina, officials said. The deaths include two mental health patients killed in South Carolina's Horry County. The women, Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van when sheriff's deputies couldn't open the doors of the vehicle, authorities said.","After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend.",2018-09-22T09:59:04Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",44 dead as Florence-weary Carolinas face more flooding and rising rivers,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/us/florence-carolinas-flooding-saturday-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920235843-03-florence-flooding-0920-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Lake Storm,1
Laurel Wamsley,"More than 4 feet of snow fell on Erie, Pa., over a 30-hour period. Elissa Nadworny/NPR A white Christmas came to parts of the United States. But in northwest Pennsylvania, the skies packed a wallop. NPR education reporter Elissa Nadworny went home to Erie for the weekend and found herself in the middle of an epic snowstorm when the lake effect parked a band of snow over the city of 100,000. The storm dumped more than 4 feet of snow in 30 hours – and it's still going. ""I've shoveled about three times now trying to stay up on it,"" Tom Fitzpatrick, a 28-year-old back home from Philadelphia, told Elissa as he worked to clear his mother's driveway. ""I mean, it's scenic. But from a shoveling standpoint, it's a back-breaker."" ""It's one for the ages,"" he said. ""It might be the last time I wish for a white Christmas."" The storm started Christmas Eve and has since shattered state and local records. The National Weather Service has a lake-effect snow warning for the area until Wednesday afternoon. The forecast says there could be an additional 1 or 2 feet of snow, and travel will be difficult or impossible. ""I've never seen anything like this in my 40 years in Erie, Pennsylvania,"" said 69-year-old Leonard Grieco, who had some advice: ""You can never buy too big a snowblower. Don't go small."" Atmospheric scientist Angela Fritz explains in The Washington Post that very specific conditions are required to generate so much snow: ""To put it simply, lake effect snow occurs when cold air passes over relatively warm lake water, picks up some of that moisture from the lake and transports it to land, where it falls as snow. The biggest lake effect snow storms tend to happen in November and early December, when water temperatures are still pretty mild. A big cold snap can convert that warm moisture into a lot of snow — and fast."" Chicago got 2 inches of snow, while Minnesota had wind chills on Monday as cold as 35 degrees below zero, ABC affiliate KSTP reports. New England got snow on Christmas Day, too – and with freezing temperatures settling in for the next couple of days, it won't be going anywhere soon. ""It's going to be bitterly cold, there's no doubt about that,"" said the National Weather Service's Andrew Paul, who predicted that high temperatures in the area would be running nearly 30 degrees below normal. High temperatures in the mountains of New Hampshire and Maine might be 10 below zero, making for optimal snowmaking conditions at the area's ski resorts during this holiday week. More than a foot of snow fell in the mountains of Colorado, Montana and Wyoming, The Associated Press reports.

Andrew Freedman,"For the tens of millions who live in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Ohio Valley, and the East Coast, the first taste of true winter weather is just days away. Ushered in by a powerful cold front, the cold air, with high temperatures running 10 to 15 degrees below average, will come as a shock following one of the warmest fall seasons on record. Computer models are in agreement that the weather pattern across the Northern Hemisphere will become extremely amplified, which means that the jet stream — that high altitude superhighway of winds that steers weather systems and forms the boundaries between air masses — will carve out large dips, or troughs, as well as strong, practically immovable ""blocking"" ridges. Such weather patterns are ideal for creating extreme weather. SEE ALSO: La Niña is officially here to shape U.S. winter weather, along with global climate This configuration of the jet stream will lead to a bizarre but increasingly common situation in which the Arctic is unusually mild for this time of year (while still being cold, by lower latitude standards), as parts of North America, Europe, and Asia experience colder than average conditions. However, there are two big caveats to keep in mind about the cold air about to invade the East Coast, so don't panic quite yet. First, the cold air coming to the U.S. won't be coming straight out of the Arctic, but rather it will be oozing south from Alaska and Canada. It also won't traverse snow-covered ground, keeping the cold air warmer than it might otherwise be. Snow cover across the lower 48 states is unusually low, with virtually no snow on the ground south of the U.S. border with Canada from Michigan eastward. All that means that this will not be a historic cold snap, not even close. One should expect few, if any, cold temperature records to be set or tied during the coming two weeks, even though temperatures will run below average in the eastern half of the lower 48 states. Computer model projection showing a cold air mass in place across the Midwest and eastern U.S. as of Dec. 9, 2017. Image: weatherbell analytics Second, while the large-scale weather pattern will be primed for a big East Coast snowstorm, with a blocking high pressure area over Greenland, a negative phase of a cycle known as the Arctic Oscillation, and a deep dip in the jet stream from Canada southward to the Gulf of Mexico, it's unclear if any formidable storm will materialize. Winter storms require a spark or trigger in the form of atmospheric energy riding along the jet stream. As of Monday, computer model projections showed no indications of a significant storm in the near-term, 7-day period. We'll have to wait and see if one emerges after that. Long awaited hemispheric longwave amplification gets underway this week ending our warm, boring pattern. Winter's chill set to stay over eastern half of CONUS next 15+ days. Can we get a major storm? pic.twitter.com/p10mr3vQZB — Michael Palmer (@MPalmerTWC) December 3, 2017 For East Coast snow lovers, it would be a huge disappointment if the next 14 days or more turn out to be cold and dry, despite most of the pieces being in place for a big storm. There is one snow-making machine that will kick into gear with the arrival of the cold front: lake effect snow. As cold air blows across relatively mild, unfrozen waters, moisture will be dumped downwind in the form of heavy snow squalls. Feet of snow could pile up in parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, and New York State. This will at least increase the proportion of the U.S. with snow cover, which stood at a measly 15.5 percent as of Monday.","For the tens of millions who live in the Midwest, Mississippi River Valley, Ohio Valley, and the East Coast, the first taste of true winter weather is just days away.

"Amir Vera, CNN","(CNN) Four days after the duck boat tragedy that claimed 17 lives -- including nine members of one family -- here are the latest developments, what is known, and what remains unknown about the capsizing and sinking of the Ride the Ducks Branson amphibious vessel: The sunken boat was raised Monday The duck boat was raised to the surface of Table Rock Lake on Monday in an effort overseen by the Coast Guard. The boat was resting at the bottom of the lake, about 80 feet underwater. The Coast Guard plans to take the boat to a facility for further inspection. The process to lift the boat and tow it to shore involved several divers, a barge crane and water pumps. In addition to the salvage effort, investigators are looking into questions about the accident, including ones about the weather, life jackets, the boat and the actions of the crew, officials said. The amphibious vessel changed the route it took on Thursday, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley said Saturday. The boat capsized as a storm and high winds lashed the lake. Investigators want to know ""when did the driver and (captain) of this vessel know about this storm forecast? When did they decide to alter the route of the boat?"" he said. ""Because they did alter the route of the boat. When did they decide that? Why?"" The state is looking into the incident to see whether any criminal acts were committed, Hawley said. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating to determine the cause of the sinking. The NTSB investigation into the sinking could take up to a year to complete, boardmember Earl Weener said Friday. The attorney general said investigators from the Missouri State Highway Patrol will also look at the boat's canopy and how difficult it was for the passengers and crew to get off during the chaotic event. In August 2017, mechanical inspector Steven Paul saw a glaring problem when he examined the duck boat. ""One of the most prominent things I found was the exhaust being in front of the vessel, which -- according to Department of Transportation standards -- would not pass regulation,"" he told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""The exhaust has to come out past the passenger compartment."" When he saw footage of the boat sinking, Paul said ""with the exhaust coming out the front and going down below the water line, the waves are obviously pushing water up in that exhaust."" If water gets in the exhaust, he said, ""the engine is eventually going to stop."" After telling the operator of the duck boat about his findings last year, Paul said he pretty much got a ""Thank you for your report."" Paul said the regulation of duck boats need to be changed. Duck boats carry tourists on both water and land, so they're regulated by two separated agencies -- the Coast Guard for when the boat is on water, and the Department of Transportation when the vehicle is on land. ""There is a huge disconnect between the US Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation,"" Paul said. Severe thunderstorms hit Branson Branson is about 200 miles from Kansas City, and is considered a major family vacation destination. The town was under a severe thunderstorm warning issued about half an hour before the boat capsized. There were numerous reports of damage throughout the county, including trees down and structural damage, said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. The highest wind gust reported in the area was 63 mph. ""I believe it was caused by weather, yes,"" said Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader. Jim Pattison Jr., president of the company that owns the duck boat tours, Ripley Entertainment Inc., said the ferocious squall ""came out of nowhere."" ""Obviously, we shouldn't be out there in severe weather,"" he said. The victims ranged in age from 1 to 76 years, authorities said. The driver of the duck boat, Robert Williams, 73, died in the sinking, said his widow, Judy Williams. Other victims included Steve Smith, a retired teacher from Osceola, Arkansas, and his teenage son, Lance; William and Janice Bright, a married couple from Higginsville, Missouri; William Asher and his partner, Rosemarie Hamann from Missouri; and Leslie Dennison from Illinois, according to family friends, CNN affiliates and local media reports. One survivor lost 9 relatives Tia Coleman and 10 of her relatives were on a family vacation from Indiana, taking a tour Thursday of Table Rock Lake near the Missouri tourist hotspot of Branson. Her husband, her three children and five other members of her family died in the accident. Their names were: Angela, 45; Arya, 1; Belinda, 69; Ervin, 76; Evan, 7; Glenn, 40; Horace, 70; Maxwell, 2; and Reece, 9. They had been on a family vacation from Indiana. Only she and her nephew survived when the boat sank. Coleman said Monday night on ""Anderson Cooper Full Circle"" that her spouse tried to rescue their children. ""Somebody told me that when they found my husband, he had all three of my babies."" ""That right there will keep me fighting for my family forever,"" Coleman said. ""To know that he did (was) exactly what he always told me when we first met: 'I will always take care of you and our children.'"" Since the disaster, a GoFundMe campaign to help Coleman has raised more than half a million dollars in just two days. As of Tuesday morning, $619,106 has been raised. Elsewhere, Ride The Ducks Branson said it will pay all related medical bills and funeral expenses for victims. The company also said it will help with any travel or accommodation needs that will help victims' families. No one was wearing a life jacket The 17 people who died in the duck boat tragedy were not wearing life jackets when found, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Sunday. There were life jackets on the boat, but passengers weren't required to wear them, according to Rader, the Stone County sheriff. Coleman, one of the 14 survivors, said passengers were told there was a storm coming before the trip. The captain mentioned the life jackets before they went on the lake but said, ""you won't need them so we didn't grab them,"" Coleman said Saturday. ""The captain did say something about life jackets. He said, 'Above you are the life jackets, there are three sizes, but you won't need them,'"" Coleman said Saturday night. She told CNN affiliate KOLR: ""When that boat is found, all those life jackets are going to be on there because nobody pulled one off.""

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Two survivors have been discharged from a Missouri hospital after 17 people including nine members of one family drowned when a “duck boat” sank during a storm in one of the deadliest U.S. tourist tragedies for years, local media reported. Two adults and two children remained hospitalized in Branson, Missouri after an adult and a child were released late on Friday, NBC affiliate KY3 News reported, citing a hospital official. The four were listed in stable and fair condition. Representatives from the CoxHealth Branson hospital and local Stone County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Federal safety officials and the U.S. Coast Guard are investigating the incident, which began around 7 p.m. Thursday (0000 GMT) when a sudden “microburst” storm swept over Table Rock Lake near Branson, throwing up large white-capped waves. Two of the World War Two-style amphibious duck boat vehicles were out on the lake and headed back to shore, but only one made it. The other, which was carrying 31 passengers, was swamped by the waves. The dead were aged one to 70 and came from six U.S. states. Seven of the 14 survivors were injured and taken to the hospital, authorities said. Tia Coleman and her nephew were the only survivors from 11 members of their family who were on the boat. “I lost all my children, I lost my husband,” Coleman told Indianapolis television channel Fox 59 from her hospital bed in Branson. “I’m OK, but this is really hard, just really hard.” Coleman said the boat’s captain, who was among the survivors, told the passengers that they would not need to put on life jackets, an action she believed cost lives. More than three dozen people have died in incidents involving duck boats on land and water in the United States over the past two decades. Thursday’s disaster in Missouri came just four days after passengers aboard a regular tour boat off Hawaii’s Big Island were pelted with “lava bombs” that left several with third-degree burns and a woman’s leg broken.

The U.S. Coast Guard said on Sunday it will oversee the salvage operations for the amphibious vessel that was carrying 31 people when it went down on Thursday in a fierce and sudden storm on Table Rock Lake outside of the tourist destination of Branson. Seven of the 14 survivors were taken to a local hospital, and all but one had been discharged as of Sunday. That person is in good condition, a spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson hospital said. Two of the World War Two-style amphibious duck boat vehicles were out on the lake and headed back to shore when the storm struck, but only one made it. The dead were aged one to 70 and came from six U.S. states. Readings near Branson when the boat went down showed winds of up to 73 miles per hour (117 kph), two miles (3.2 km) shy of hurricane force, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Saturday. Tia Coleman, who lost nine family members including her husband and three children, told a news conference on Saturday from a Branson hospital that she does not know how she will recover from the loss. “Going home is going to be completely difficult. I don’t know how I am going to do it. Since I have had a home, it has always been filled with little feet and laughter,” she said, choking back tears. Coleman said the boat’s captain, who was among the survivors, pointed out the life jackets but told those aboard there was no need for them. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley was in Branson over the weekend talking with investigators. He has said the state is contemplating whether to bring criminal charges. Jim Pattison, president of Ripley Entertainment, which owns the Branson “Ride The Ducks” tour company, told CBS This Morning on Friday that the strength of the storm was unexpected and the duck boats should not have been on the lake. More than three dozen people have died in incidents involving duck boats on land and water in the United States over the past two decades.

Tanda Gmiter | tgmiter@mlive.com,"Winter Storm Watches were issued this morning for a big swath of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. They go into effect Sunday afternoon, ahead of a storm system that could bring several inches of heavy, wet snow to some parts of the state, while dousing other areas with rain. The big question right now is where that rain-snow line will fall across the state, the National Weather Service said, because that could create a real mess on the roads. ""Travel could be very difficult,"" the NWS said. ""The hazardous conditions could impact the Monday morning commute."" The Winter Storm Watches go into effect Sunday afternoon and evening, stretching diagonally across the state from Allegan County on the southwest side to up to Cheboygan County by the Mackinac Bridge. Affected cities include Grand Rapids, Holland, Muskegon, Ludington, Ionia, Manistee, Traverse City, Mount Pleasant, Big Rapids, Houghton Lake, Gaylord, Rogers City and Alpena. Up to 6 inches of snow is possible in Northern Lower Michigan, while it's expected to stay mostly rain in the southern part of the state. Winds will also increase on Sunday, with gusts of up to 35 mph forecast. In the northern part of the state where snow is expected, this could lead to blowing snow and poor visibility for drivers.","MLive.com Winter Storm Watch covers big chunk of Michigan, messy rain and snow mix forecast MLive.com Winter Storm Watches were issued this morning for a big swath of Michigan's Lower Peninsula.

Tom McKay,"Are these invasive cane toads waterlogged, or just really, really thirsty? The below photo, captured by one Andrew Mock of Kununurra in northern Australia, shows 10 cane toads riding out a storm that dumped nearly 70mm of rain by hitching themselves to the back of an approximately 3.5-meter python, the Guardian reported on Monday, though it seems as though their primary motivation may have been humping it.
The paper wrote that the bizarre scene was originally discovered by Andrew Mocks brother, Paul Mock, after which they quickly took a photo of the reptilian-amphibian Bang Bus:
Worried the dam and spillway might break its banks, Paul Mock ventured outside in the middle of the lightning and rain.
The lake was so full it had filled the cane toad burrows around the bank and they were all sitting on top of the grass thousands of them, he told Guardian Australia.
[The snake] was in the middle of the lawn, making for higher ground... He was literally moving across the grass at full speed with the frogs hanging on.
According to Jodi Rowley, the curator of Amphibian &amp; Reptile Conservation Biology at the Australian Museum, the cane toads in question may have been less interested in escaping the rainfall than desperately trying to bang the snake.
Cane toads are not native to Australia, and were introduced to the country in the 1930s in a misguided attempt to eliminate beetle infestations of sugar cane crops. That didnt work, but the toads breed quickly and are highly adaptable, and every stage of their life cycle from eggs to adulthood are brimming with a potent venom that can cause rapid heartbeat, excessive salivation, convulsions and paralysis and can result in death for many native animals, according to the Australian governments Department of the Environment and Energy. (The toxin even persists after death, meaning their corpses can poison carrion-eating animals or perhaps even ponds and puddles.)
Theres no way to know for sure, but per the BBC, the number of the toads across the country is estimated to have perhaps crossed into the billions:
They probably have moved about halfway through that tropical region of Western Australia, explained Rick Shine, a professor in biology at the University of Sydney. They are in very inaccessible country now in the Kimberley. It is very hard to get detailed information on exactly where the front is but it seems to be moving at 50 to 60km (31 to 37 miles) per annum.
The warty amphibians move only during the wet season. Although tracking studies have shown many hop less than 10 metres a day, those at the front line have grown bigger and faster.
Efforts to control the toads spread have included government-backed elimination campaigns (though funding was cut in 2014 as they outpaced the program) as well as air-dropping sausages of toad meat laced with a nauseating substance in an attempt to train predators not to eat the toxic toads. According to the Conversation, researchers recently sequenced the species genome, which could give conservation authorities better tools to finally crack down on their invasion of the continent.

JOHN ELIGON,"They immediately gravitated to the pool at the hotel because the children loved water, Ms. Coleman said. “I caught myself sneaking off to get in the hot tub, and here come those little bodies, coming in there with me,” Ms. Coleman said. “They’re like, ‘Oh this feels so good, this feels so good.’ I said, ‘Get back in the kiddie pool.’” They ate at the Golden Corral, where Ms. Coleman told her children they could eat as much as they wanted. She plied them with indulgent treats like cotton candy and rainbow sherbet. The Colemans decided to ride the duck boat because it seemed like just the type of thing Ms. Coleman’s oldest son, Reece, who was autistic, would enjoy. “We have to do stuff that’ll keep him, where he can jump up and be entertained or he likes to ride,” she said. “He loves water and he likes to ride. We were like, that’ll work out for everybody.” What Ms. Coleman and her family did not know was that duck boats have a history of safety issues, with the N.T.S.B. ordering operators, including the one here in Branson, to make safety improvements after 13 people were killed when one sank in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1999. Before leaving for the boat tour, Ms. Coleman said, someone at Ride the Ducks, the tour company, said that because of the storm warning, they would do the lake part of the tour before the road portion. The Colemans planned to go to dinner after the duck boat ride.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN)A series of storms moving across the country will bring significant snow and ice to the north and heavy rains to the south Friday and into the weekend. 
Roughly 100 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
The storm is already affecting travel with nearly 450 flights canceled as of Friday morning, according to FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers traveling in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Major metro areas on the East Coast likely will face light snow Friday ahead of and during the morning commute. The storm should move so quickly that accumulations are expected to remain low in New York and Boston.
The second storm is associated with the same upper-level energy as the West Coast storm that has dumped inches of rain in cities such as Los Angeles and caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Snow is likely in places like Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago
The second storm exits the Rockies and will begin to drop snow late Friday across Kansas. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of last week's storm -- will see less accumulation with this system. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will help enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could see through the weekend. Both could see over half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, inches of snow to the north and ice and snow across the central portions of the states. 
Significant icing event is possible along I-95 corridor through New England
The second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. It's unclear on the timing of what type of precipitation is expected for metro areas in the Northeast.
This situation is reminiscent of an event earlier in the season when forecast models were showing warmer air leading to little or no snow totals. The models all came true, except in New York, where the colder air spilled in and inches of snow caught many New Yorkers by surprise. 
CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm in November was more difficult to forecast because it was early in the season when the models are just beginning to run winter equations, and the actual air profile doesn't act like winter yet. 
""Now that we are in the middle of winter the models should do better with this storm."" 
The latest model forecast indicates places such as Boston and New York will see snow starting Saturday evening, which will then turn into more of a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. New York is likely to warm up enough to see rain Sunday morning. But even if some precipitation doesn't freeze on contact Sunday, it will freeze by Sunday evening when the temperatures plummet. 
Similar to the November storm, there is a steep gradient between rain, ice and snow. Meaning close to the coast people could see rain, a few miles inland freezing rain mix, a few more miles inland snow mix and then a few more miles away the snow starts piling up quickly. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up 6 to 12 inches deep (likely more) with some icing for added misery.
The I-95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will set up, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
A flash freeze is likely behind the storm
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough to see rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. That could happen so fast it would instantly freeze any remaining moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
The National Weather Service in Boston said it's expecting ""a roller coaster of temperatures through this portion of the forecast"" and ""a prolonged period of well below normal temperatures early next week."" 
Keep the hand warmers handy, because temperatures won't just be below average Sunday and Monday.
""For the most part, this winter the jet stream has traveled horizontally across the US. Sure, there have been some ups and downs, but nothing like what is to come,"" CNN's Myers said. 
""By next week the jet stream will flow from Fairbanks (Alaska) to Texas. So, for example, the following Saturday Anchorage will be 32 and Chicago will be 13."" 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

Mark Kaufman,"Last weekend, Ellicott City's quaint Main Street, with red, white, and blue decorations draped from storefronts, became a churning brown river. While several factors resulted in this Maryland town's second ""1,000-year storm"" occurring in just the last 22 months, one increasingly significant contribution to the flooding is the amount of water vapor accumulating in Earth's warming atmosphere. The flooding in Maryland fits within the broader context of how human-caused climate change is altering our atmosphere, making these extreme events more commonplace in the future. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year NASA scientists say that average global temperatures have been on a ""rapid warming trend"" in the last four decades. This warming means that the air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. Accordingly, this loads storm systems with more water. ""So when it rains, it really, really pours, in the future — and now,"" Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview. ""This is super basic physics and chemistry,"" said Marvel of increased temperatures allowing the air to absorb more water. Today, the consequences of this elementary science are pummeling the U.S. ""We’ve already observed an increase in heavy precipitation events,"" said Marvel. In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report showing extreme, single day downpours have been on the rise since the late 1970s. The United States' 2014 National Climate Assessment — guided by 13 federal agencies — found that ""Across most of the United States, the heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent."" ""Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions,"" the report added. Image: U.S. government/National climate assessment That said, Marvel emphasizes it's inaccurate to say that any extreme downpour was the direct or single result of more water vapor being held in the warmer air. Destructive weather will still happen — but now it has an added kick — human-induced global warming. ""Unlucky, bad things happen all the time,"" said Marvel. ""Weather happens, but we know what climate change is doing."" Tropical cyclones, for example, have ravaged U.S. coastlines throughout history, and will continue to do so. The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto — which is not a hurricane but is still carrying bounties of water — has now causing flooding so severe in North Carolina that the National Weather Service tweeted ""HEED ALL EVACUATION ORDERS IMMEDIATELY!"" in areas around the Lake Tahoma dam. NOAA/NWS Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center preliminary analysis indicates the 3-hourly max rainfall totals across Ellicott City MD area on Sunday have a 0.1% (1 in 1000) chance of occurring in a given year.

Marvel uses disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong, who admitted to doping, as an analogy. The talented Armstrong would still have probably won some races without enhancing his performance with prohibited drugs. But, ""we know that he was doping, and we know what doping does,"" Marvel said. Similarly, ""we know we’re doping the weather,"" said Marvel.

Andrew Freedman,"From late 1861 through early 1862, a megaflood of historic proportions put large parts of the state of California underwater. The state's Central Valley, which is now one of the most productive agricultural ares in the country, became a vast inland lake. The city of Sacramento, which sits at the intersection of the American and Sacramento rivers, flooded, and remained under water for months. According to one account, one-quarter of the state's 800,000 cattle drowned in the flooding, and one-third of the state's property was destroyed. SEE ALSO: Parade of storms threatens to prolong California dam crisis The "" Great Flood"" of 1861 to 1862 is becoming more likely to reoccur as the climate warms, a new study finds. A study published Monday in Nature Climate Change found that despite an overall small change in the state's average yearly precipitation throughout the 20th century and in projections for the future, there may be huge and highly consequential changes in precipitation extremes within seasons, some of which have already begun to buffet the state. ""In practical terms, this means that what is today considered to be the '200-year flood '—an event that would overwhelm the vast majority of California’s flood defenses and water infrastructure —will become the '40-50 year flood' in the coming decades,"" lead author Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles wrote in a blog post on Monday. Relative change (in percent) in extremely wet seasons (top), extremely dry seasons (middle), and year-to-year “whiplash” (bottom) by 2070-2100 in Southern California. Image: Swain et al. 2018. In an interview, Swain said he was surprised how sharply the risk of another ""Great Flood"" event increased just over the next 40 years, according to the numerous computer model simulations used in the study. The study found that between 2018 and 2060, California's major urban areas, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, ""are more likely than not"" to experience at least one extremely severe storm sequence that is similar in magnitude to the Great Flood. This is a three-fold increase in the risk of such a devastating event. Swain said this result “is pretty eyebrow-raising, certainly to me, it and may raise some eyebrows in the emergency planning community as well.” That flood was the result of an unrelenting series of storms that channeled a firehose of moisture off the Pacific Ocean, known as ""atmospheric river"" weather systems. The study makes for sobering reading, because it shows how sharply the risk of both extremely wet and dry seasons is increasing, along with what the authors term ""precipitation whiplash"" as the climate oscillates between these two extremes. Previous studies, Swain said, had focused on how annual average precipitation may change as the climate warms, but the relatively small amount of change at this timescale is effectively masking far more consequential trends at shorter timescales. “That seems to be masking very significant changes in the character of precipitation” and precipitation extremes, Swain said. The researchers utilized computer models to simulate precipitation trends in California during the remainder of the 21st century, studying results from simulations including the ""business as usual"" course of greenhouse gas emissions as well as control runs that did not include an increase in global warming pollutants. Increasing frequency of precipitation extremes in California. Image: Ucla/daniel swain. One of the more unique insights the study provides is the likelihood that there will be more frequent and drastic year-to-year precipitation shifts, much like the one that occurred between a record drought that lasted from about 2012 to 2016, and was followed by a record wet winter in parts of California during the winter of 2016 to 2017. The wet winter peaked with the failure of a spillway at the Oroville Dam in 2017, which forced about 250,000 people to evacuate. The study projects a 25 to 100 percent increase in such precipitation whiplash events during the coming years. As the study notes, California's water infrastructure is simply not prepared for such an escalation in extreme events. The study states: Few of the dams, levees and canals that currently protect millions living in California’s flood plains and facilitate the movement of water from Sierra Nevada watersheds to coastal cities have been tested by a deluge as severe as the extraordinary 1861–1862 storm sequence —a repeat of which would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damages approaching a trillion dollars. The study is consistent with other findings on how precipitation extremes are already changing as the climate warms, but it may actually underestimate the severity of these changes for California, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Trenberth was not involved in the new study. In general, a warmer world will provide storms with more moisture to work with, as the air's capacity to hold water vapor and the evaporation rates from the land and sea all increase. There's already observational evidence showing this is taking place. But this new study serves as a warning that coming decades will bring a wild ride from one extreme to the next, challenging even our sturdiest, most modern infrastructure.

Tim Hahn,"The record-setting snow has made December 2017 the snowiest month in Erie, by more than 30 inches, on National Weather Service records dating back to the late 1800s. Tim Hahn @ETNHahn Erie County authorities were taking steps on Tuesday to line up outside assistance to help lakeshore communities — including the City of Erie — dig out from a historic snowstorm that isn't expected to let up until late Wednesday. A storm that blew into northern Erie County on Christmas Eve had dumped 60 inches of snow by late Tuesday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service in Cleveland, slowing traffic on local interstates, plugging up residential streets and forcing numerous businesses to close, including the Millcreek Mall on what was expected to be a busy post-holiday shopping day. The record-setting snow has made December 2017 the snowiest month in Erie, by more than 30 inches, on National Weather Service records dating back to the late 1800s. It pushed the seasonal snowfall, through Tuesday afternoon, to less than 4 inches from reaching Erie's average snowfall total of 100.9 inches for a winter season. Erie International Airport recorded 24 inches of snow on Tuesday as of 5:12 p.m., pushing Erie's December snowfall total to 97 inches and the city's seasonal snowfall total to 97.5 inches, according to NWS data. Tuesday's snow followed a Christmas Day in which 34 inches of snow fell on Erie — an all-time, single-day snowfall record in city history. The lake-effect snow storm began Sunday evening, when 2 inches of snow fell at the airport. The snowfall total is expected to rise by the time a lake effect snow warning expires on Wednesday. Forecasters at NWS Cleveland were calling for up to 9 more inches on Tuesday night and 1 to 3 inches of snow on Wednesday. It was the threat of more snow that led Erie County Executive Kathy Dahlkemper early Tuesday afternoon to sign a declaration of disaster emergency, which authorizes county officials to act on meeting the needs of a snow emergency and directs the county's emergency management team to take steps to aid emergency response. Dale Robinson, the county's emergency management coordinator, said Tuesday afternoon that the declaration will allow officials to bring in some National Guard resources, ""really for precautionary measures for the additional amount of snow we think we're going to get."" ""When you're dealing with lake effect, it's like a crap shoot,"" Robinson said. Robinson said officials planned to bring in some Humvee ambulances in case the additional snow makes it impossible for standard ambulances to reach areas of Erie, Millcreek or other parts of the region that have been hit hard by heavy snows. Transportation will also be lined up to get employees to area hospitals, he said. ""We want to make sure we're prepared,"" Dahlkemper said. Bands of lake effect snow that deposited 34 inches on Erie and surrounding areas on Christmas Day set up along the Lake Erie shoreline during the latest storm, missing higher terrain areas of Erie County south of the city that traditionally get more snow during these events, said Zach Sefcovic, a meteorologist with NWS Cleveland. It was the city, Millcreek Township and other lakeshore communities that received ""these astronomical snow totals over the last 48 hours,"" Sefcovic said. Additional bands of snow that were hitting parts of Ohio early Tuesday afternoon appeared to be setting up south of Erie and the areas with the most snowfall, Sefcovic said. ""Of course, with lake effect, they can wobble back and forth,"" he said. Robinson said Tuesday afternoon that the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was bringing in extra resources to keep state routes plowed, while Erie and Millcreek Township had all of their available plow crews working to keep the main routes clear and to open up secondary roads. PennDOT placed restrictions on Interstate 86 and on Interstate 90 between the New York state line and Interstate 79 Tuesday, barring lightly-loaded or empty tractor-trailers, recreational vehicles and non-commercial vehicles towing trailers. Speed limits were reduced to 45 mph on the interstates in the county. PennDOT officials joined state and local police in urging residents to stay off the roadways if possible on Tuesday, to aid plow crews in clearing the snow. Dahlkemper credited people for doing ""the right thing"" and staying home in keeping down the number of calls to the Erie County 911 center on Tuesday. Erie and Millcreek Township both declared snow emergencies on Tuesday morning because of dangerous and unpassable roads. Township officials warned motorists that those caught driving on township roads without snow tires or chains may be subject to fines, and that vehicles parked along streets would be towed without notice as on-street parking is prohibited during snow emergencies. The City of Erie was prepared for an onslaught of snow that hit the city beginning Sunday night, but not the magnitude of snow ""that we haven't seen in many years in this town,"" Mayor Joe Sinnott said Tuesday morning. Sinnott said city plow crews were focusing Monday on the main routes of the city, to get those cleared before the plow drivers turned their attention to secondary roads. But the main runs ""were filling up as fast as they could plow it, and they never got off the main runs until today,"" he said. Erie police Deputy Chief Aaron Wassell said Tuesday morning that officers have encountered a number of vehicles that were abandoned in the middle of city roadways after they got stuck in the high snow. The city had 24 plow trucks out Tuesday morning and were starting to make some progress in getting roadways clear, said Chuck Zysk, the city's assistant director of Public Works. There would be 25 pieces of equipment working through Tuesday night and into Wednesday, he said. ""We're plowing some main streets still,"" he said. ""We have crews in the inner-city areas, the odd-even areas. From there we'll go into the residential areas."" ""I think our guys are doing a tremendous job. But we have work ahead of us,"" Zysk added. Many residents buried under back-breaking amounts of snow spent Tuesday clearing away what had fallen. Miles Cross had equipped his Polaris 400 ATV with a plow to clear out the snow from driveways and walks in the 1600 block of Chestnut Street. He had been outside for three hours around 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday and said he was far from done. ""It's crazy,"" said Lesley Calafato, who has lived in Erie for 44 years, as she walked along West 16th Street near Chestnut Street. ""It's been a long time since we have had so much snow all at one time and so quickly."" A man who identified himself only as Rick carried a shovel as he strolled down West 11th Street heading west from State Street Tuesday morning. He said he was trying to make a few dollars and to ""keep my muscles going"" by offering to shovel show to whoever needed his help. ""You know, I'm 63 years old, so I've got to keep busy,"" Rick said. He said he was also out Tuesday morning ministering to people. ""I'm a God-fearing man, that's basically it,"" he said. ""God is good. He gave us this snow. We always want a white Christmas. Well, we got one."" Staff writers Ed Palattella and Matt Rink contributed to this story.

,"At a Glance Tropical Storm Gordon has developed near South Florida. Soaking rainfall and gusty winds from Gordon are currently spreading across southern Florida. Tropical storm warnings are posted for south Florida and the northern Gulf Coast. Heavy rain, storm surge flooding and strong winds are likely impacts from Gordon on the Gulf Coast. A storm surge watch is in effect for a part of the northern Gulf Coast Tropical Storm Gordon has developed near southern Florida where it will continue to bring heavy rain and gusty winds on Monday before heading for a northern Gulf Coast landfall on Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued tropical storm warnings for south Florida, from Golden Beach on the southeast coast to Bonita Beach on the southwest coast as well as the Keys from Craig Key to Ocean Reef. Tropical storm warnings are also posted from the Alabama-Florida border westward to east of Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas. A tropical storm warning is typically issued when tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected in 36 hours or less. (A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours. A warning means those conditions are expected within 36 hours.) ( MORE : Hurricane Central ) Current Status and Forecast Gordon is currently centered near Key Largo, Florida, and is producing numerous showers and thunderstorms in southern Florida. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Localized flooding is possible and the National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for south Florida into Monday night. In addition, tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) are possible in the tropical storm warning area in southern Florida on Monday. A wind gust to 51 mph was reported at Miami's Opa-Locka airport on Monday morning. An isolated tornado threat cannot be ruled out in southern Florida, as well. Current Radar, Watches and Warnings (Watches and warnings are issued by the National Weather Service.) Conditions should begin to improve Monday night in south Florida. Steered by high pressure aloft parked over the eastern United States, Gordon will move through the eastern Gulf of Mexico Monday night through Tuesday. Gordon is forecast to be at tropical storm strength when it makes landfall on the northern Gulf Coast Tuesday night, most likely in southeast Louisiana or southern Mississippi. (The red-shaded area denotes the forecast path of the center of Gordon. Note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding) from Gordon may spread beyond its forecast path.) Regardless of how well organized Gordon becomes, there will still be impacts on the northern Gulf Coast. Northern Gulf Coast Impacts Here's a look at the current forecast impacts for Gordon but keep in mind changes are possible based on future adjustments to track and intensity. Rainfall Parts of the northern Gulf Coast could see 3 to 6 inches rainfall Tuesday-Wednesday, from southeast Louisiana into far southern Mississippi and far southern Alabama. Localized totals of 6 inches or more are possible in some areas. As a result, there could be flooding in this region, including the New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, metro areas. A flash flood watch has been posted by the National Weather Service for parts of southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Separate flash flood watches are in effect in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana due to heavy rain from another weather system affecting that region on Monday. (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall. Higher amounts may occur where bands or clusters of thunderstorms stall for over a period of a few hours.) Storm Surge, Rip Currents and High Surf A storm surge watch has been issued from the Mississippi-Alabama border westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Storm Surge Watches and Warnings The NHC said water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide: Destin, Florida, to the Mississippi-Alabama border: 1 to 2 feet Mississippi-Alabama border to the mouth of Mississippi River: 2 to 4 feet Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Louisiana-Texas border: 1 to 2 feet High tide this week on the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline is in the early morning hours. Tuesday morning through Thursday evening is the timing for potential coastal flooding in the storm surge watch area, according to the National Weather Service. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves, according to the NHC. An onshore wind flow will continue a risk of dangerous rip currents on the northern Gulf Coast into midweek, and swimmers are encouraged to stay out of the water. Seas are expected to build to 6 to 10 feet by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama. Wind Tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are possible in the tropical storm warning area in south Florida on Monday. By late Tuesday, tropical-storm-force winds could arrive on the northern Gulf Coast. Some downed trees and scattered power outages in the above-mentioned areas.

Tom McKay,"Historic flooding has followed in the wake of the bomb cyclone that rammed into the central U.S. this week, with USA Today reporting that Nebraska experienced what may be the worst floods in half a century.

ABC News,"A winter storm that roared through California left a snowboarder dead and sent an avalanche crashing down on five people Friday at a Sierra Nevada ski resort, but the danger of another deadly mudslide eased in a devastated coastal community. Dozens of rescuers and rescue dogs rushed to the scene after an avalanche hit the Squaw Valley Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe near the Nevada state line. One man was hospitalized with a serious lower body injury, another person was treated for injuries and released while three other people escaped injury, the resort said in a statement. Heather Turping was snowboarding with her boyfriend when she heard someone scream ""Avalanche!"" and saw ""a cloud of snow coming down."" ""It was massive,"" she said. ""It just happened to literally pass a foot in front of me."" A woman screamed that her husband was missing and someone spotted a snowboard poking out of the snow. ""That's what saved his life,"" Turping said. ""I took my gloves off and I helped dig him out,"" she said. ""When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, 'You were under for six minutes.'"" The man wasn't seriously hurt and was able to snowboard back down the mountain, she said. The skiers and snowboarders were within areas open to skiing at the time and the guests had been warned of the potential danger, resort spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn said. The resort used explosives and other tools to knock down snow to prevent avalanches throughout the day but the snowfall was heavy, she said. ""We had assessed the area to be safe to open to the public and unfortunately an avalanche did occur after that assessment was made,"" Hepburn said. The avalanche occurred hours after the body of a missing snowboarder was found at the same resort. Wenyu Zhang, 42, vanished Thursday as the region was hit by a blizzard packing winds gusting to nearly 150 mph (241 kph) over the ridge tops. It dumped 3 feet (1 meter) of snow in the mountains. A blizzard warning expired Friday but whiteout conditions were still possible around Lake Tahoe, where a winter storm warning remained in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said. About 300 miles (482 kilometers) south, rain fell in the coastal foothill communities of Santa Barbara County, where thousands of people had been told to flee out of concern that the approaching storm might send huge swathes of fire-scarred slopes rushing down on them. But the rain that moved through Southern California Thursday night and Friday spared Montecito, which saw hundreds of homes destroyed in January mudslides. Twenty-one people were killed then and two remain missing. Evacuation orders affecting up to 30,000 people on the south Santa Barbara County coast were lifted at midmorning. ""The worst of the storm has passed and we are cautiously optimistic that due to a significant amount of pre-storm preparation we have come through this with minimal impact,"" said Rob Lewin, director of the county Office of Emergency management. Some minor roadway flooding occurred, but the region's main highway, U.S. 101, remained open throughout the storm. Officials said 87 percent of those in the threatened areas complied with the evacuation order. ——— Associated Press writer John Antczak in Los Angeles and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada, contributed to this report.","ABC News California storm kills 1, avalanche injures 2 at ski resort ABC News A truck heads west through the snow on Interstate 80, Thursday, March 1, 2018, near Donner Summit, Calif.

Herb Scribner,"SALT LAKE CITY Flash floods are possible this week for much of the Southwestern United States, including Utah. Tropical Storm Rosa will likely cause flash floods and storm warnings along the California coast and across the Southwestern United States after it pummels northwest Mexico, according to the Associated Press. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Rosa should hit the Baja California Peninsula and Sonora state on Monday with flooding rains. Utah will be impacted, too. Whats happening: The National Weather Service already announced flash flood watches through Wednesday for southern Nevada, southeastern California, southwestern and central Utah and the western two-thirds of Arizona. Heavy rain, thunderstorms and flooding are all expected in the Beehive State from Monday through Wednesday morning. Southern and central Utah will likely see flooding in slot canyons and normally dry washes. Main stem rivers will likely see rises, according to NWS. There could be debris flows from burn scars and roadways could see flooding as well, according to the NWS.

Prepare yourself for the potential of flooding Monday through Wednesday! pic.twitter.com/OuhfSlCWLK WeatherNation (@WeatherNation) September 29, 2018 Arches National Park said in a tweet it has already seen rain, adding that park roads may become impassable. When does it start?: NWS Salt Lake City said thunderstorms would develop in northern Utah Monday afternoon. ""We are monitoring these thunderstorms as they are developing near several recent burn scars. There are no imminent threats for debris flows,"" NWS tweeted. Bigger picture: The NWS said this week that the Beehive State set records for the lack of rain. But this week, theres expected to be a bunch of rain. See the comparison below: History: Utah experienced a tropical system back in 1997, according to KSL-TV meteorologist Grant Weyman. Tropical Storm Nora brought rain and strong winds to Utah, following a similar path as Tropical Storm Rosa. Stay safe: The NWS suggested those in at-risk areas prepare for debris flow and to ""get your action plan together now."" Comment on this story ""Flash flood watch means: prepare. A flash flood warning means get to a safe location ASAP if in an area impacted at threat of debris flows,"" according to the NWS. The Bureau of EMS and Preparedness offered some tips for cleaning up floods, including wearing rubber boot and gloves, as well as goggles to avoid contact with floodwaters, which can be full of bacteria and other damaging material.

Hayley Miller,"Erie, Pennsylvania, is used to snowstorms, but this week’s is one for the books. The city nestled in the state’s northwest corner has been hit with over 63 inches of snow since Christmas Eve, shattering records and prompting Erie County officials to declare a disaster emergency. Some 34 inches fell on Christmas Day alone, breaking Erie’s all-time, single-day record by over a foot, according to the National Weather Service. The city’s previous record was 20 inches in November 1956. The storm also broke two-day snowfall records for the state, with 53 inches falling between Christmas Eve and Tuesday. The previous record was set in March 1958, when 44 inches fell on Morgantown, roughly 320 miles southeast of Erie, the NWS reported. This week’s massive snowfall made December 2017 the snowiest month in Erie’s recorded history by more than 30 inches, the NWS reported. As of Tuesday evening, over 97 inches had fallen in Erie this month; the previous record was 66.9 inches set in December 1989. The city, home to just under 100,000 people as of 2016, is situated on the east side of Lake Erie. The historic snowfall resulted from a lake-effect storm, which occurs when cold, dry air passes passes over a relatively warmer body of water and collects moisture. A lake-effect snow warning for the area remained in effect until 6 p.m. Wednesday, with an additional 3-to-6 inches expected to fall. Emily Forish, a 31-year-old marketing executive and Erie native, said of the storm: “It was just so much all at once.” “I’ve seen pretty bad snow, but nothing compares to the last three days,” she told HuffPost. “I just don’t want to risk going out,” she said. “My parents said their neighborhood is like a car graveyard.... There’s just cars on the side of the road abandoned.” But the snow, which has left Forish cooped up in her home for the last few days, isn’t inspiring her to move somewhere warmer. “No one ever expected we were going to see anything like this, but it doesn’t make me want to leave,” she said. “This is home. It’s going to take more than this to get us to leave.” People shared shots of the historic snowfall on social media:",The lake-effect storm made this month the snowiest on record for the city -- by more than 30 inches.,2017-12-27T16:06:50Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}","Record-Smashing Storm Dumps Over 63 Inches Of Snow In Erie, Pennsylvania",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snow-erie-pennsylvania_us_5a43944ee4b025f99e18eb6f,http://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.huffingtonpost.com%2Fasset%2F1200_630%2F5a43a6fd1d000027004d3765.jpeg%3Fcache%3DIPWdhij7uh&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=5fc5d6440a755206296d8058df405c019d045042,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,Lake Storm,1
Mark Kaufman,"A powerful nor'easter pounded New England last week, prompting coastal evacuations and causing flooding so extreme that water rushed into downtown Boston. In the storm's aftermath, a local, freelancing weather man, Peter Lovasco, who once contributed weather reports to The Gloucester Daily Times, tweeted a couple pictures of what appears to be some species of puffer fish or porcupine fish impaled on a Gloucester tree. But it's quite unlikely that the storm propelled a porcupine fish out of the water and into a coastal tree. ""It's probably fake,"" said Doug Adams, a research scientist at Cape Canaveral Scientific — an organization that performs ecological and environmental research along the Atlantic coast with government agencies and universities — in an interview. SEE ALSO: Hang onto your butts as another nor'easter cripples travel, triggers thundersnow Here's why: This kind of puffer fish doesn't live anywhere near New England ""That particular species of puffer fish wouldn't normally spend time in Massachusetts's waters,"" said Adams. A puffed up puffer fish. Image: wikimedia commons ""It’s a tropical species — that alone is an indicator that it could be a joke."" The New England Aquarium agrees: ""Three fish biologists at the Aquarium believe this to be a hoax, not necessarily by the person who took the picture,"" an Aquarium spokesperson told Mashable. That said, there are certainly ""puffers"" in New England waters — like the northern puffer — but they don't have spines. It's a novelty item, stuck in a tree If the fish happened to be launched out of the water by the storm and then impaled on the tree, it would be dead and no longer capable of maintaining its inflated shape. A puffer fish ornament. Image: Doug Adams It's likely a dried out, taxidermied dead fish that is sold in Florida stores, and online. These ornaments are coated with some sort of taxidermy resin to keep their puffed form, said Adams. ""It can be found in lots of shell shops in Florida,"" he said. ""It’s a taxidermy-like fish that’s common in novelty shops. People even make lamps out of them."" Still, Lovasco maintains that the fish is ""def[initely] real.""

In 2005, a waterspout sucked frogs from a lake in Siberia and caused them to rain down on a nearby village.

Mark Kaufman,"During the fall of the Maya civilization over 1,000 years ago, kings were killed in public, captives were taken hostage, and in one notably violent event in the city of Aguateca, Maya fled their homes during a surprise assault, without time to even grab their belongings. Though warfare can't be ignored, the toppling of the classic Maya civilization — renown for its massive stone temples and astronomical observatories — is believed to have another formidable culprit: crippling drought. And for the first time, scientists have deduced just how severe this centuries-long drought may have been. SEE ALSO: 2018 is only halfway over, but a troubling climate change trend is already apparent Rainfall was slashed in half over a vast swath of the low-lying Maya lands, researchers demonstrate in a study published in the journal Science on Thursday. Over this 200-year period, rainfall sometimes plummeted by 70 percent in the region, which encompasses much of today's Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Stone mask of the Maya rain God ‘Chaac’ in the Yucatán Peninsula. Image: MARK BRENNER ""If you imagine your local area, imagine if rainfall was reduced by half — but [for] over a hundred years,"" Nick Evans, a lead author of the study and paleoclimatologist at the University of Cambridge, said in an interview. Many lands would simply turn to desert, or doom once fertile agricultural areas. Take Los Angeles today, which historically gets 14 or 15 inches of rain a year. A decline by half, combined with the sun drying the land, would almost certainly transform it into an arid desert. And, unlike Californians today, the Maya didn't have the benefit of 21st Century aqueduct and reservoir systems. They lived on an expanse of flat land with little surface water. They needed rain dearly: Stone-carved masks of the Maya's rain god ""Chaac"" are prevalent throughout the ruins of the society. Hunting for ancient water To give the Maya drought a firmer number, Evans and his team gathered sediments from the bottom of Lake Chichancanab, a long, slender, salty lake in the heart of Maya country. They were in search of the mineral gypsum, which when forming, grabs water from the lake and traps the molecules. During times of evaporation, lakes become heavier in certain types of the water's oxygen and hydrogen, which gave researchers a confident idea of how fast the lake was disappearing. ""It's almost like measuring the lake water itself,"" said Evans. Modern day Lake Chichancanab Image: Mark Brenner Jason Briner, a paleoclimatologist at the University at Buffalo who had no involvement in the research, called the study ""very elegant,"" allowing the scientists to narrow in on just how much — or little — rain fell during the decline of the Maya. ""Bottom line: A series of droughts with 50 percent the average rainfall probably played a big role in a major shift in Maya civilization at that time,"" Briner said over email. A crippling drought may have further unsettled an already failing political structure, where elite royalty ruled society. Strained agricultural land may have also led to collapses in crop yields. And overpopulation — as estimates range that between 3 million and 11 million Maya inhabited the area — may have precipitated a scarcity of resources, further destabilizing the once infallible elites. ""If it all comes together, you may have a perfect storm,"" Daniela Triadan, an anthropologist at the University of Arizona who studies the Maya's mysterious past, said in an interview. The fall of the Maya The fall of the Maya, however, didn't completely extinguish their people. ""They didn’t quite disappear,"" Takeshi Inomata, also an anthropologist at the University of Arizona who had no involvement in the study, said in an interview. Ruins of the 31 meter-tall (100-foot) Pirámide de los Cinco Pisos. Image: Mark Brenner Maya descendants still live in the area today. Rather, the major Maya centers, built by elites, collapsed, said Inomata. These congested cities or population centers were already likely difficult places to live, even in the best of times. ""It was probably incredibly smelly and dirty, with people dumping garbage outside of their houses,"" said Triadan. ""It was sweaty, and hotter than hell."" And then, in some of these heavily populated places, the terrible drought came, and didn't lift for centuries. However, drought can't explain why everyone in Maya society abandoned their cities and villages. In the vast expanse of the southern lowlands, Inomata and Triadan said people deserted some flourishing population centers before the drought even hit. ""Why did the southern region seem to be doing well, and then why were they the first to leave and not come back?"" asked Triadan. ""I don’t think we can reduce it to climatic issues."" Ruins of the ancient Maya city of Calakmul. Image: Eduardo Fuster Salamero/imageBROKER/REX/Shutterstock The Maya civilization, then, declined in different ways in different areas, over a few centuries. ""The situation in each of these cities wasn’t the same,"" noted Triadan. The ancient drought is worth considering today, as climate change is driving precipitation extremes around the globe, like in California and parts of Africa. ""One might argue that we are more resilient to climate change than our predecessors — that we are able to better weather the types of drought conditions in California, or elsewhere across the West,"" said Briner. ""As much of the West is currently in flames, I’m not so convinced,"" he said, noting the large fires currently besieging California. ""And, as many drought-prone areas around the world become drier, climate change will stress the already stressed harder,"" he added. ""Yikes.""","During the fall of the Maya civilization over 1,000 years ago, kings were killed in public, captives were taken hostage, and in one notably violent event in the city of Aguateca, Maya fled their homes during a surprise assault, without time to even grab their…",2018-08-02T19:57:42Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The fall of the Maya civilization was bloody and worsened by a 200-year drought,https://mashable.com/2018/08/02/maya-civilization-drought-collapse-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/b-PVh0pA5_mgfeXMfbh7D6oZ0SI=/1200x630/2018%2F08%2F02%2Fdf%2F83839fb2c9c34660a101bdeab23f2a57.67b3b.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Lake Storm,1
Russell Lissau,"At least one fatality was reported in the suburbs from snow that fell steadily Thursday night and throughout Friday, but well short of projected totals. Keith Hartenberger, a spokesman for Edward Hospital in Naperville, said a man in his 60s died there after shoveling snow Friday morning. It was not immediately known what fire department brought the man to the hospital. DuPage County Coroner Richard Jorgensen could not be reached for comment. Schools, many libraries and some government offices and private businesses closed due to the snow. Hundreds of flights at O'Hare and Midway international airports were canceled or delayed, too, and some Metra trains ran late. But cars moved pretty well on the region's roads throughout the day, and suburban life -- for the most part -- continued as usual. The amount of snow that came down varied through the suburbs, but for the most part it was significantly less than the foot or so some meteorologists expected for parts of the region. The Aurora area may have gotten the worst of it, with 10 inches reported in a few spots there, according to the National Weather Service. O'Hare reported 7.3 inches, Buffalo Grove reported about 6 inches, and Carol Stream reported 6.5 inches. More snow was expected to fall Friday night into Saturday, perhaps up to an inch in the Chicago area, according to the weather service. A revised forecast shows new accumulation of less than one inch is possible Saturday night and a 50 percent chance of snow before noon Sunday. O'Hare International Airport reported 1,030 canceled flights with average delays that gradually declined from the 25-minute range to about 15 minutes Friday night. At Midway International Airport, arrivals and departures held steady at average delays of 15 minutes, and there were 319 cancellations. No significant delays were reported on the Metra rail system, though some trains were up to 20 minutes behind schedule Friday morning. Saturday trains are scheduled for the usual times, according to Metra spokeswoman Sylvia Ortiz-Cooper. Metra rider Steven Baldasti had an uneventful trip on the Union Pacific Northwest Line into Chicago from Palatine. ""The express (train) that blasts by about 6:39 a.m. was on time, and my usual (train), the 6:49 a.m., was on time,"" Baldasti said. Many suburban roadways were snow-covered for much of the day, but overall conditions weren't as bad as predicted. That was good news for drivers, many of whom experienced little congestion on their drives Friday. ""(It) definitely appears that people either stayed home or relied on public transportation,"" Illinois Department of Transporation spokesman Guy Tridgell said. Additionally, traffic volume generally is lighter when schools close because of poor weather, as was the case Friday, Tridgell said. The milder-than-expected storm was good news for snowplow drivers, too. Schaumburg's plow crews had been on the roads since 5 p.m. Thursday and were on their third shift by late Friday morning. The plows will stay ready for the slightest new snowfall through at least Monday morning, Engineering and Public Works Director Dave Lawry said. Lincolnshire's public works crews started plowing in 13 trucks at midnight Thursday and worked until about 8:30 a.m. Friday before taking a break, Village Manager Brad Burke said. They resumed midday and continued throughout the day. A substantially smaller crew is expected to be on the job Saturday morning, and another crew will be available Sunday if needed, Burke said. There were some storm-related disruptions. Many suburban libraries stayed closed, including facilities in Barrington, Elgin, Grayslake, Huntley, Lincolnshire, Naperville and Schaumburg. And, some opted to open later than usual, such as the Arlington Heights Memorial Library and the Ela Area Public Library in Lake Zurich. The DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry County courthouses were open for business. But Cook County courts were closed, as were the federal courthouses in Chicago and Rockford. Some suburban businesses also were affected, including the Lovin Oven Cakery in Libertyville. ""We had a bunch of people call yesterday and reschedule their orders for later in the weekend,"" manager Shelby Hoss said. Wauconda's Bulldogs Grill didn't have many lunch customers. ""(We had) a lot of to-go orders,"" General Manager Tony Vazquez said. ""(It's) just a slow day."" The popular White Fence Farm restaurant in Romeoville stayed closed Friday, as did its carryout locations in Downers Grove, Riverside, Romeoville, Joliet and Plainfield. • Daily Herald staff writers Eric Peterson, Bob Susnjara, Christopher Placek, Marni Pyke, Susan Sarkauskas, Marie Wilson and Mick Zawislak contributed to this report.","Chicago Daily Herald Storm update: Warning continues until 6 pm for some areas Chicago Daily Herald The winter storm has been extended again for the suburbs.

James Kindall,"James Kindall is a writer on Long Island, New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) When I was a boy, my father built a cabin on Table Rock Lake in the Ozark Mountains. We stayed there during the summers. Usually once a week, we would venture into Branson, Missouri, for a sightseeing outing or entertainment. The one thing that always caught my attention were the duck boats. Massive amphibious vehicles usually painted bright yellow, the duck boats frequently could be seen chugging through town streets on the way to visitor sights in what would soon become a tourist mecca. The visitors I saw riding in them always looked happy and maybe a little giddy. Happy because the vehicles made them the center of attention wherever they went, and giddy because they knew the vehicle soon would be carrying them smoothly into the water, just like the GIs who invaded the shores of Normandy in World War II. News of the appalling accident that left 17 people dead Thursday was, unfortunately, not a surprise to me, or probably anyone else in the area. Even as goofy and cheerful as they looked (the slogan -- ""Ride the Ducks"" -- was fodder for a series of lame jokes between my brother and me), I never begged my dad to go on the ride. Fun was fun, but even as a young boy it simply looked unlikely to me that the trundling machines could actually float, despite their war record. I also was familiar by then with the storms that sometimes materialized quickly over the lakes in the summer. They were nothing to laugh at -- even if you were riding in what looked like a giant clown car. There have been similar accidents to Thursday's Table Rock Lake disaster in the past. Nineteen years ago, 13 people were killed when a duck boat sank on an Arkansas lake, although the weather was not a factor at that time. I'm sure the owners of the Table Rock fleet were convinced that their boats were safe. After all, the ""ducks"" (short for DUKW, a manufacturing shorthand indicating their design and all-wheel drive capabilities) had survived a lot worse. And, of course, touring people around on them was a way of making a living in an area where just getting by financially was a challenge. Indeed, Table Rock Lake, a dam-created reservoir built a half century ago, was an economic miracle for the region, drawing millions of vacationers from around the country. It helped turn the area into something of a country-themed Disneyland, packed with arena-sized theaters featuring singing stars ranging from Kenny Rogers to Andy Williams, and spawned the entertainment park ""Silver Dollar City,"" built on an old silver-mine ghost town. The locals responded to the surprising influx of visitors by selling them everything from pieces of aqua-colored ""Arkansas Diamonds,"" a cheap, glass by-product; to homemade popguns carved from hollowed-out elder branches, to signs that say things like, ""Never mind the dog. Beware of owner."" I'm sure converting a vintage Army vehicle into a visitor attraction -- the way tour companies in cities across the country have done, too -- seemed like nothing more than a good time, as well as an easy way to pluck the out-of-state chickens. It was that, for a long time. Now, all that may have changed with the dramatic footage of this tragedy. We won't know until the investigation is completed the real reasons for this awful accident and how it could be prevented from ever happening again. It may be as much a question of why the boat was on the lake during a fierce storm as it is anything to do with the boat's design. There are plenty of other ways to have water adventures in the Ozarks, although people may think twice now before choosing this one -- a bit of history on wheels that trails an unspeakable tragedy. To me, they will remain a symbol of a more innocent time tempered by the realization that disaster can strike anywhere. Even in an area devoted to helping people forget their troubles.",Touring people around on amphibious vehicles of the kind used in WWII has long been a way of making a living in an area where a new lake turned a financially challenged region into a family destination.

TRIP GABRIEL,"The previous year, Mr. Trump had visited to endorse Mr. Kings re-election. As the congressman warned of scenarios like Islamic State terrorists or even Africans with ebola illegally entering the country, Mr. Trump listened and nodded. When he stepped to the microphone, he echoed Mr. King.
Well, border security is a very big issue, he said. People are just flooding across.
Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman who once held the most conservative views in official Washington on immigration, calling for a moratorium on even legal immigrants, said he handed the baton to Steve King when he left the House in 2008.
David Johnson, a former Republican state senator from Mr. Kings district, said he heard in the presidents rhetoric a direct echo of Mr. King. They belong to the same subset of white nationalists who are afraid of how the country is changing, he said.
Mr. King was born in Storm Lake, Iowa, and attended high school in nearby Denison, then a nearly all-white rural farming region, where his father managed a state police radio station.
After founding an earth-moving company, Mr. King ran successfully for the State Senate in 1996. His most notable legacy from six years in the Legislature was a law making English the official state language. It was a time when packinghouses and other agricultural employers had dropped wages, and Latino migrants increasingly were taking jobs that no longer attracted native-born Iowans.
Elected to Congress in 2002, Mr. King attracted the attention of hate-watch groups like the Anti-Defamation League as he spoke increasingly about preserving Western culture or Western civilization. The groups consider those buzzwords that signal support to white nationalists, along with an obsession with birthrates and abortion rates among different ethnic groups.
He uses the concepts of either culture or civilization to obfuscate that hes talking about whiteness and race, said Lawrence Rosenthal, chairman of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies.","The Iowa congressman, who has used racist language and been denounced as a white supremacist, wrote the playbook on white identity politics and many of the issues that are ascendant in the G.O.P.",2019-01-10T13:01:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Before Trump, Steve King Set the Agenda for the Wall and Anti-Immigrant Politics",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/steve-king-trump-immigration-wall.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/20/us/politics/00steveking1/00steveking1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Lake Storm,1

Southern California Public Radio,"A powerful winter storm sweeping into Southern California that prompted evacuation orders brought periods of intense rain and reports of minor debris flows Friday, but officials said it was so far not a repeat of the January storm that brought deadly mudslides. As many as 30,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders overnight in the foothill communities of Santa Barbara County, including areas devastated by the deadly mud flows in January. Compliance among residents ordered to leave was as high as 87 percent, according to Amber Anderson with the Santa Barbara City Fire Department. But as of 9 a.m., the worst of the storm was over, those evacuation orders had been lifted and only minor damages had been reported, according to county officials. ""Together we made it through the first winter storm since the 1/9 Debris Flow,"" Sheriff Bill Brown said in a statement. ""On behalf of all public safety and emergency officials, we want to thank you for staying informed, being prepared and following the evacuation orders issued yesterday. We know that being evacuated is a tremendous hardship and we did not make this decision lightly. Because of your cooperation we were able to get through this together."" As of 6:30 a.m., San Marcos Pass in the Santa Barbara Mountains had seen the heaviest amount of rain, with 3.35 inches over 24 hours. Officials had closely watched rainfall totals in anticipation of possible mudslides. Rainfall of more than.5 inches per hour could result in debris flows when coupled with steep and recently scorched terrain, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Bob Ludwick, a longtime Montecito resident who had to evacuate Thursday night, said he was glad authorities were being cautious after the January mudslides and didn't mind having to leave his home. He said most residents were quick to follow the evacuation order when it was issued. ""We have been on tender hooks for weeks and weeks. It's kind of PTSD, and it didn't take much for the population to say, 'OK, we're leaving,'"" Ludwick told Take Two. Some Montecito residents still hadn't returned to their homes after the initial January evacuation, Ludwick said, and those who had returned were still facing a long road ahead. ""Even if your home suffered no damage and your streets are fine there is a really palpable pall that hangs over the entire community today,"" Ludwick said. As president of the Coast Village Association that represents local businesses, Ludwick had also heard concerns from local shop owners who are continuing to lose revenues. ""Even today they're calling me asking, 'When can we get in? What should we tell our employees? Do they come to work? Do they not?' There's no playbook for this,"" Ludwick said. The storm system was the result of an atmospheric river — a giant conveyor of rain pushed forward by strong winds — making its way down the California coast. Concern now turns to Los Angeles County, as the storm bears down on to the Creek and La Tuna burn areas. A flood watch has been issued until 3 p.m. in L.A. County. Tweet To the north, a blizzard warning was in effect for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where more than a foot of snow fell Thursday, shutting down major roads. Authorities warned of high avalanche danger for the backcountry around Lake Tahoe. According to the California Highway Patrol, State Route 33 above Ojai was closed. Tweet Highway 192 at East Valley Road in Santa Barbara County saw some small debris flows, which officials said they were working to clear. Tweet Highway 101 remained open.

Ryan Truchelut,"WeatherTiger's Ryan Truchelut gives you all the information you need to stay warm and dry. Mixed and/or Frozen Precipitation Chances (Photo: National Weather Service) North Florida, this is happening. It’s been four years since the last significant frozen precipitation in the Big Bend and nearly three decades since the last measurable snowfall in Tallahassee in December 1989. But I can say with confidence that a messy mix of ice, sleet and snow will likely be outside your door Wednesday morning. Some are even calling this winter storm the Snolepocalypse. You may now rush to Publix to purchase your emergency French toast supplies of bread, milk and eggs. Looking at the meteorological set-up, the key pieces needed to square the circle of Florida snow have fallen into place in the last few days. First, a powerful Arctic high pressure system over the mid-South has brought in rare sub-freezing temperatures at the surface. Next, a tropical air mass remains lurking over the southern Gulf and Bahamas to provide moisture. Finally, a pair of upper-level disturbances, the matches for low-pressure development, are diving south out of the Plains. Minus the presence of the Val ""Iceman"" Kilmer himself, the pattern could not be more favorable. WINTER STORM WARNING: As uncertainty regarding these ingredients has decreased, both global and mesoscale weather models have converged on a solution in which Tallahassee is on the western edge of a zone of frozen precipitation that will extend west to between Lake City and Jacksonville. In Tallahassee, a wintry mix is likely to start after 3 a.m. and end before 11 a.m., and is likely to be formidable enough for a time to make driving dangerous. For this reason, the National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for Leon County and east effective through noon Wednesday. There are two major uncertainties to discuss. The first is precipitation amount. Model ensembles have trended higher over the last few days and are now in good agreement that Tallahassee will receive more than just a trace of frozen precipitation. While the most likely liquid-equivalent amount total is around 0.1"" (50 percent chance), Tallahassee sits on a sharp gradient in expected totals between very little precipitation to our west and 0.5"" or more toward Lake City. More: WeatherTiger: Biggest winter event since 2014 ice storm may be taking shape More: FAMU basketball doubleheader canceled with winter storm threatening Buy Photo Freezing temperatures rolled through Tallahassee the first night of 2018 leaving icy evidence around town. (Photo: Hali Tauxe/Democrat) It is plausible but not likely that a small shift east would bring these heavier amounts into Tallahassee, dramatically upping our impacts (20 percent chance). Also possible — though not expected — is the scenario in which accumulating wintry precipitation stays just to our south and east (30 percent chance), and Tallahassee sees just a few stray flakes or sleet pings. The second uncertainty is precipitation type, which is notoriously difficult to forecast until a winter storm is under way. That's because a powerful storm like this one turns the atmosphere into a complex layer cake of above and below freezing levels, into which snowflakes aloft fall, melt, and potentially refreeze. Freezing rain occurs when a relatively thinner layer at the surface is below a melting band, while ice pellets occur when the surface cold layer is thicker. Based on current trends and short-range ensembles, I believe the most likely outcome in Tallahassee is for sleet to be dominant in the first half of the storm, with a change-over to some light snow in the latter half. A good rule of thumb in these kind of marginal winter events is that 0.1 inch of rain is the equivalent of around 0.75 inches of snow, so as indicated by the NWS, there is potential for up to 1 inch of snow accumulations should it be the dominant precipitation type. More likely, however, is a thin coating on grassy surfaces. Further east towards Lake City, freezing rain is likely to be more prominent in the wintry mix. Glaze is very destructive to trees and power lines, especially our sprawling oaks, so any trend further west with the track of the low is Tallahassee’s worst-case scenario. This would mean not only heavier overall accumulations, but a higher chance of ice damage and power outages. Overall, while precipitation type is the least confident part of the forecast, I do not see a trend towards heavier icing afoot. A final risk to keep in mind is that whatever ice or snow we see during the day is going to melt in the afternoon, with highs topping out around 40. Any ponding on roads will refreeze overnight as temperatures are expected to be below 32 for at least 10 hours, which means a possibility of black ice and unsafe travel conditions continuing into Thursday morning as well. All in all, let’s stay off the roads as much as humanly possible and just enjoy a nice cup of hot cocoa until the Snolepocalypse is over. It should go great with that French toast you made.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"Credit Claire O'Neill/The New York Times In the middle of a nor’easter that disrupted travel in the Northeast and inundated areas already drenched from last week’s storm, some New Yorkers and others on the East Coast made a resounding discovery: “thundersnow.” The curious phenomenon, when thunder and lighting are heard and seen during a snowstorm, has been documented since at least the year 1099. But its rarity — a 2009 analysis found that only 0.07 percent of snowfalls are accompanied by thunder — means that it never ceases to excite. The captivating nature of thundersnow was documented in an article in The New York Times on Sept. 24, 1884 : “I don’t believe there has been a thunderstorm that I have witnessed for the past 30 years,” said a gentleman of this city, “which has not given me occasion to ask scores of people if they had ever seen a thunder and lightning snowstorm, and I never met but one yet, besides myself who ever had.” (That gentleman’s stories about thundersnow must have never gotten old.) There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, according to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&amp;M University. The first, which is most common to the central United States, mirrors the way regular thunderstorms are formed: Warmer, moist air close to the ground rises and mixes with colder, denser air higher up in the atmosphere. As the hot air moves up and the cold air moves down, the atmospheric instability can trigger lightning and the thunder that comes with it. In the case of a thundersnow event, air closer to the ground is just warm enough to rise and create atmospheric mixing, but it’s still cold enough that falling snow can stay frozen. This often happens in the Rockies, when the mountains trap pockets of warm air. “The air is cold enough down low that as the frozen precipitation falls out of it, it never encounters a warm enough layer of air to melt,” said Dr. Nielsen-Gammon. So instead of rain and lightning, there’s snow and lightning. The second scenario tends to happen around the Great Lakes in early winter. A thunderstorm develops even though temperatures are very cold, thanks to the relatively warm moist air that comes from the lakes. It’s intertwined with the same conditions that bring the region its lake effect snow. In the third scenario the low pressure of a powerful winter storm creates strong upward motions in the air, generating the atmospheric instability that in a typical thunderstorm would be driven by temperature changes. This is likely what led to New York City’s thundersnow. Even when the conditions are right, you won’t always notice the thunder. Snow is more likely to absorb the light of lightning and the sound of thunder than rain. But thundersnow tends to be accompanied by heavier snowfall, which you may indeed notice when your commute is snarled.","There are three ways thundersnow can develop in the United States, but it always brings the element of surprise.",2018-03-08T00:25:50Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How Thundersnow Happens: With Considerable Difficulty,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/climate/thundersnow.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/07/climate/cli-thundersnow/cli-thundersnow-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Lake Storm,1
Chico Enterprise-Record Staff Reports,"Start your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond. Sign up for our new Morning Report weekday newsletter. Oroville – The state Department of Water Resources says that using the Oroville Dam spillway this week or next is still a possibility, as outflows from the Hyatt Powerplant into the Feather River hold steady. The lake is down about one foot since Wednesday. Releases from the powerplant were increased on Thursday from about 9,500 cubic-feet per second to 11,500 cfs at noon, and cranked up to 13,000 cfs at 1 p.m. They hovered around 12,700 cfs at noon on Thursday. Inflows were recorded coming in about 8,000 cfs, with the lake at 793 feet elevation at noon. At the same time on Wednesday, inflows were measured at 9,000 cubic-feet per second, with the lake at an elevation of 794 feet. DWR’s winter operations plan developed after the Oroville Dam crisis of February 2017 calls for use of the spillway if the lake reaches 830 feet above sea level in April. The maximum outflow from Hyatt Powerplant with five out of six turbines operational is 14,500 cfs. The river valves underneath the dam can release another 2,000 cfs. Current weather forecasts show the potential for the lake to rise to 830 feet by the middle of next week. The bottom of the main spillway gates are at 813.6 feet. The lip of the emergency spillway weir is 901 feet. DWR has stated there could be damage to the structure if water does indeed run down the spillway. There could be wear and a “more turbulent” flow down the middle chute because the surface finish of the roller-compacted concrete section is not as smooth as the sections made of structural concrete, according to a press release the department issued on Tuesday. Wear of the roller-compacted concrete sections should not spread into the structural concrete portions because there are cutoff walls in place, the release stated. Phase two of spillway reconstruction is set to start around May 1. Plans include covering those roller-compacted concrete sections with structural concrete. As it stands, the spillway should be able to pass flows of 100,000 cfs. You can find hourly inflow and outflow data at cdec.water.ca.gov/dynamicapp/QueryF?s=ORO.

Clay Masters,"Storm Lake Times editor Art Cullen is moderating a forum on Saturday in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidates.
Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio
At first glance, Storm Lake, Iowa, doesn't seem like the sort of place that would attract Democratic presidential candidates. 
The town of 10,600 sits in the highly conservative northwest corner of the state. In 2016, Donald Trump collected 4,903 votes in surrounding Buena Vista County, compared with Hillary Clinton's 2,856 votes. 
But on Saturday, at least four of the major Democratic candidates will gather in Storm Lake for a candidate forum. While the event is billed as a way for Democrats to reconnect with rural voters after the trouncing they suffered in 2016, part of the appeal is also to share a stage with Art Cullen, the town's Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper editor. Two HuffPost journalists will also moderate the forum. 
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as well as former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., will be there. Also attending is Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who's considering a presidential bid. Warren and Castro have already made campaign stops in Storm Lake. 
""It kind of tells me who really cares about rural Iowa, frankly,"" Cullen says. ""And if you ain't there, you're square.""
Until now, Cullen says he has never received attention during a presidential campaign. But in 2017, Cullen won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorials challenging corporate agribusiness, a potential message that the right Democrat might be able to use to woo some disaffected Trump voters. 
""What I'm talking about is realistic, sustainable practices that can be encouraged by Congress to make farmers and the environment whole and we know how to do it,"" Cullen says. ""It's just that the chemical companies have bought the process. They've bought the judicial process, and they've bought the political process.""
Storm Lake is a perfect microcosm of rural America's challenges, says former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who served as President Barack Obama's secretary of agriculture. 
It has a growing immigrant population (many work at the Tyson meatpacking plant). It's home to Buena Vista University, a small private college that's trying to attract and retain students while keeping costs affordable. The area's farmers have seen difficult times amid slumping commodity prices and tariffs brought on by the Trump administration's trade policies.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar talks with a group of Iowans at Peace Tree Brewing in Knoxville in February during her first trip to the state as an official presidential candidate.
Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio
""If you're not in a position to point out how government works and how government can work well for rural places, then the argument of less government, less taxes, less regulation is basically a winning argument,"" Vilsack says. 
The event comes as many Democratic candidates are trying to hone their pitch to rural America. 
This week, Warren proposed appointing regulators to review and reverse some mergers among agribusiness companies and also looking to see whether some of those firms should be broken up on antitrust grounds. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won't be attending the Storm Lake event, just published an op-ed in The Des Moines Register saying he'll fight for farmers against powerful agribusiness if elected. 
Klobuchar's first campaign trip in Iowa went through small towns like Knoxville, where she pitched renewable energy and programs to combat climate change.
""There's real gains for rural America if you do this right,"" Klobuchar says. ""I just don't see this separate environment from economic gain.""
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke drives between campaign stops in Mount Vernon, Iowa, and Cedar Rapids earlier this month.
Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio
In a recent interview with Iowa Public Radio, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who won't be attending Saturday's forum, says rural America is not just about the food and fiber it grows.
""But in addition to that, it's the military service that distinguishes this country and is found disproportionately in rural communities,"" O'Rourke said. 
""Beto? Where's he at? Is he out in Taos or is he dancing with Oprah?"" Cullen wondered aloud. ""Joe Biden? He's trying to make up his mind. Well, why doesn't he come and make up his mind with a bunch of Farmers Union members in Storm Lake? They'll help him make up his mind real good.""
Cullen says candidates who show up in rural Iowa have historically done much better in the caucuses, which means Cullen may be hosting more presidential wannabes between now and February 2020.","A least four of the major Democratic candidates will gather for an event billed as a way for the party to reconnect with rural voters.

Mark Kaufman,"While three hurricanes swirled in the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans on September 6, 2017, the sun blasted off a powerful flare of energy, which soon smacked into Earth and severed radio communications across half the planet for hours. Just four days later, another solar flare — an intense burst of radiation from the sun — hit Earth and again disrupted communications, as major storms continued to churn toward land. This confluence of tempestuous weather both on Earth and in space was recently described by scientists in the journal Space Weather, the research led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) researchers. SEE ALSO: A 12-mile, underground lake may have been found on Mars. What could live there? ""Space weather and Earth weather aligned to heighten an already tense situation in the Caribbean,” said NOAA's Rob Redmon in a statement. Fortunately, many governments no longer rely strictly on radio to communicate over long distances, though aviation and marine emergency services still employ high-frequency radio, which bounces radio waves across Earth's high atmosphere, allowing contact over long distances. “You can hear a solar flare on the air as it's taking place. It’s like hearing bacon fry in a pan, it just all of a sudden gets real staticky and then it’s like someone just turns the light completely off, you don't hear anything,"" Bobby Graves, a radio operator for Hurricane Watch Net which uses radio during hurricanes,"" said in a statement. When the radiation from strong solar flares smacks the Earth, it hits an energetic layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere, causing it to absorb — and thus impair — long distance radio waves. ""And that's what happened this last year on two occasions,” noted Graves. “We had to wait ‘til the power of those solar flares weakened so that our signals could actually bounce back off the atmosphere. It was a helpless situation."" The sun released a powerful solar flare on November 4, 2003. Image: nasa The first of the two flares, on September 6, arrived during a remarkably bad time, as Hurricane Irma — a highest rated Category 5 storm — was in the process of leveling the island of Barbuda. The massive storm would later make landfall in Florida. NASA is still intensively studying the sun, to improve the space agency's understanding of when unpredictable events, like solar flares, might pose a harm to Earth. Worse yet are Corneal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, which are explosions of billions of tons of solar matter hurled into space. Events like these pose serious threats to our modern telecommunication and electrical grids — consequences far worse than temporary radio blackouts. In 1859, a CME collided with Earth, and set telegraph equipment on fire. To improve humanity's understanding of our fickle star, in early August NASA will send the heavily-fortified Parker Solar Probe into the sun's scorching outer atmosphere, to better learn how the sun works — and when it might blast powerful surges of energy into space.","While three hurricanes swirled in the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans on September 6, 2017, the sun blasted off a powerful flare of energy, which soon smacked into Earth and severed radio communications across half the planet for hours.

Jay Reeves / AP,"(BIRMINGHAM, Ala.) — Mudslides triggered by the soggy remnants of Alberto forced evacuations below a dam and closed an interstate highway in the western mountains of North Carolina on Wednesday. Forecasters warned that the leftovers of the Atlantic hurricane season’s first named storm are still capable of causing treacherous flooding as heavy precipitation spreads deeper into the nation’s midsection. Flash flood watches were in effect for parts of several states from Alabama through Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, the Carolinas and Virginia and West Virginia. About 2,000 people were evacuated after emergency managers said the Lake Tahoma dam in western North Carolina was in danger of “imminent failure.” Heavy rain triggered landslides at the dam, and the National Weather Service said “evacuees are being asked to flee.” Just before dawn Wednesday, McDowell County Emergency Management deputy director Adrienne Jones told The Associated Press that the dam had not failed, but an engineer who had inspected the scene was concerned enough to order the evacuation until the dam could be examined in daylight. Jones said about 200 residents of the evacuees were in three shelters, set up in Marion, Old Fort and Glenwood. She said five minor injuries have been reported during water rescues as creeks and streams overflowed their banks and rock slides closed roads. The big, messy storm caused more than 25,000 power outages in Alabama on Tuesday, a day after making landfall on the Florida Panhandle. Many of the outages were caused by trees rooted in soggy soil falling across utility lines. “We’ve had a lot of rain, but we got lucky. It was a constant rain but not a heavy rain,” said Regina Myers, emergency management director in Walker County northwest of Birmingham. Subtropical storm Alberto rolled ashore Monday afternoon in the Florida Panhandle before quickly weakening to a depression. By Tuesday morning, beachcombers had returned to the white sands of the Northern Gulf. In Cuba, flooding damaged an oil refinery and caused crude oil to spill into Cienfuegos Bay as the remnants of Alberto continued to drench the island in heavy rain. State-owned TV showed authorities using barriers Tuesday to try to contain the spill from the Cienfuegos refinery in central Cuba about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southeast of Havana. In North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed Monday while covering the weather, when a tree became uprooted from rain-soaked ground and toppled onto their SUV, authorities said. WYFF-TV of Greenville, South Carolina, said news anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer were killed. “Two journalists working to keep the public informed about this storm have tragically lost their lives, and we mourn with their families, friends and colleagues,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement. Alberto was more of a rainstorm than a wind threat, but the National Weather Service said at least one tornado had been confirmed. The weather service said its meteorologists confirmed a weak tornado with maximum winds of 85 mph (147 kph) hit an area around Cameron, South Carolina, on Monday afternoon. No one was hurt. ____ Associated Press writers Jennifer Kay in Miami Beach, Florida, Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Jeffrey S.

Tom Davis,"Look out for round two: A second potentially destructive nor'easter is expected to hit New Jersey this week, and the National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for 10 counties. The storm could dump as many as 4 to 12 inches of snow beginning Tuesday evening and lasting until late Wednesday night. Rain and strong winds are expected, too, just as 60,000 people remain without power following the destructive Friday nor'easter. The storm could cause school districts to close, delay openings or dismiss early. Some districts also could close on Tuesday, before the storm hits, because they're still dealing with the lingering effects of the Friday nor'easter. Read more: New Jersey School Closings/Delays List This Week The NWS issued the winter storm watch for Sussex, Passaic, Bergen, Hudson, Essex, Somerset, Morris, Union, Hunterdon and Warren counties. A hazardous weather outlook has been issued for the rest of the state, and a coastal flood advisory remains for the Jersey Shore. The National Weather Service says heavy snow is possible, so drivers should plan on difficult travel conditions because of covered roads and reduced visibility. Heavy wet snow may bring down tree limbs and utility wires, resulting in more power outages. The nor'easter will impact the entire state, and it's considered a coastal storm that will bring a wintry mix of precipitation for Central and South Jersey and the Jersey Shore. Wind gusts in excess of 30 mph are possible. The wind along with accumulating wet snow may bring down tree limbs and utility wires, resulting in power outages, according to the NWS. The National Weather Service has issued some preliminary estimates for the snow: Here is the forecast: Monday: Partly sunny, with a high near 45. North wind 11 to 14 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Monday night: Partly cloudy, with a low around 27. North wind 3 to 7 mph. Tuesday: Mostly sunny, with a high near 45. Light and variable wind. Tuesday night: Rain likely before 10pm, then rain and snow likely between 10pm and midnight, then snow likely after midnight. Cloudy, with a low around 32. East wind 5 to 8 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70 percent. New snow accumulation of less than one inch possible. Wednesday: Snow. High near 36. East wind 13 to 16 mph. Chance of precipitation is 90 percent. New snow accumulation of 3 to 5 inches possible. Wednesday night: Snow likely, mainly before midnight. Cloudy, with a low around 30. Chance of precipitation is 60 percent. Thursday: A chance of snow showers before 7am. Partly sunny, with a high near 42. Chance of precipitation is 30 percent Downed trees and power outages, meanwhile, continue to plague New Jersey following the Friday nor'easter. Flooding continues to be a problem in Manasquan, Ocean City and other areas of the Jersey Shore (see information below). Much of New Jersey was still struggling to recover Monday. A massive tree fell on a woman in Ridgewood while she was walking her dog. The woman was hospitalized. Read more: Massive Tree Falls On Woman While Walking Dog In Ridgewood.

Joe Charlevoix,"The frigid weather will continue for at least the next week with temperatures remaining in the single digits/teens for daytime highs along with periodic lake effect snow. A couple spots dipped to around -20F early Thursday with -23F noted at Rudyard in Chippewa County to start the day. WINTER STORM WARNINGS are hoisted for Mason/Oceana counties where additional lake effect snow will target these spots later Thursday evening into Friday morning. For most spots, a little bit of a break in the lake effect snow Thursday as winds turn more southeasterly ahead of the next area of low pressure. That will (for a time) push lake effect snow offshore and away from the area. High temperatures Thursday only in the 4-18F range across our 26 counties. There will be a few peeks of sunshine mixed in although it will not help to warm things up. While an isolated area, we expect lake effect snow to get pulled back onshore Thursday night into Friday morning with potential heavy snow in parts of Mason/Oceana counties. Right now, the heaviest of the snow may remain just offshore (where 10-12"") may fall out over the lake but it's certainly close enough to keep a close on around the Ludington/Pentwater areas where at least 5-8"" of snow is looking likely. A couple other spots where the snow may be on the heavier side Thursday night/Friday morning will be far western Mackinac County, Beaver Island, and areas near Lake Huron between Cheboygan and Rogers City along US-23 where several inches of snow are possible. Other areas near Lake Michigan will also see snow Thursday night/Friday but the amounts will be a lot lighter. Beyond that, there are no signs of any thaw on the horizon. Temperatures will continue to sit in the single digits/teens for daytime highs leading to periodic bouts of lake effect snow. Due to the cold, ice will continue to develop/thicken on the Great Lakes. In fact, ice cover on the Great Lakes as a whole was less than 1% two weeks ago and is now close to 10%. That number will continue to grow. Eventually, increasing ice cover will begin to limit to some degree lake effect snow if temperatures continue to remain frigid.",UpNorthLive.com No thaw in sight with lake effect snow to target areas around Ludington Thursday night/Fri UpNorthLive.com Ice will continue to build on the Great Lakes over the next week or two as temperatures remain well below normal along with occasional l…,2017-12-28T13:18:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Upnorthlive.com'}",No thaw in sight with lake effect snow to target areas around Ludington Thursday night/Fri - UpNorthLive.com,http://upnorthlive.com/news/local/no-thaw-in-sight-with-lake-effect-snow-to-target-areas-around-ludington-thursday-nightfri,http://static-21.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/1e01bded-859c-4114-a9a0-8cbd6f0e0ce6-large16x9_story3.jpg?1514461085376,,Upnorthlive.com,Lake Storm,1

Russians are marvelling at rare ice walls - in places 5m (16ft) high - towering on the shores of the Gulf of Finland near St Petersburg. 
They were created by storms lashing the region in recent days. 
Such phenomena are more characteristic of Russia's Arctic far east. 
The walls are formed when a storm exerts sideways pressure on thick ice covering a sea, river or lake. The ice is bad news for seals, though, as it can cut them off from the sea.
A conservation group - the Baltic Seal Foundation - is urging Russians to alert it to any stranded seals found in the region. Some have been spotted from helicopters.
Image copyrightBalticseal.orgImage caption
 This baby weighs just 13.5kg (30 pounds) but needs to reach 40kg to survive independently
One baby grey seal, just a few days old, was rescued last week and is doing well now, the group reports, with a video on vKontakte, the Russian version of Facebook. 
The seal, swaddled in blankets, is fed five times a day with a pipette. It got stranded in Gakkovo, a coastal village near Estonia.
Image copyrightbalticseal.orgImage caption
 A gloved hand shows how vulnerable the baby still is
The most dramatic ice wall pictures so far have come from Zelenogorsk, on the northern shore of the Gulf of Finland, just outside St Petersburg. 
Alexander Bravo posted images of the wall on the local website Terijoki.spb.ru. He calls it ""the Zelenogorsk Alps"".

Johnny Lieu,"""Steve"" may be ordinary as it comes with aurora names, but one called exactly that certainly has an extraordinary story. The streaks of purple light which appeared in the sky over Regina, Canada, were the source of curiosity for locals who hadn't seen anything quite like it before. SEE ALSO: Don't believe the hype about the coming solar storm That wonder over ""Steve"" led to a project called Aurorasaurus, where locals, or should we say citizen scientists, shared their findings on the mysterious lights. Between 2015 to 2016, there were 30 reports submitted to the project, overlooked by scientists from NASA and the University of Calgary. Those sightings became the subject of a peer-reviewed paper, published this week in the journal Scientific Advances. It was indeed, unlike any other aurora. It is, in fact, a new kind of aurora, appearing like a line with a beginning and end, as opposed to a typically oval shape like the others. Steve is also purple, with green features resembling a picket fence, unlike those signature greens, blues and reds of a regular aurora. Like other auroras, Steve is created by charged particles from the sun, colliding with the magnetic fields around our Earth to generate a stunning light display. As noted by NASA, the difference with Steve is in the details. It travels along different magnetic field lines, and appears at lower latitudes closer to the equator. Steve is also associated with something called the ""subauroral ion drift,"" a stream of fast moving, extremely hot particles which scientists have been studying since the 1970s, but didn't know that it came with accompanying visual effect. While Steve was just a name, it now stands for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. Scientists hope to learn more about it in future, but the phenomena only lasts up to an hour in an area. At least there are photos. Picture of Steve taken at Lake Minnewanka.

http://www.facebook.com/ktla5,"Five people were swept up in an avalanche at a Lake Tahoe-area ski resort, hours after the body of a missing snowboard had been discovered there, as a powerful winter storm pounded much of the state on Friday. More than 100 search and rescue officials and several rescue dogs responded to Squaw Valley Ski Resort after the avalanche roared down a mountain near the Olympic Lady chairlift around 1:40 p.m., according to a statement from the resort. Two women and three men were eventually rescued from beneath the snow. One person suffered a ""serious lower body injury"" and was hospitalized, while another was treated for injuries at a medical facility near the resort and later released, Squaw Valley staff said. Placer County sheriff's officials said none of the injuries were life-threatening, and the other three people were able to leave the scene unharmed. Heather Turping told the Associated Press she was snowboarding when a scream of “Avalanche!” rang out and she saw “a cloud of snow coming down.” “It was massive,” she said. “It just happened to literally pass a foot in front of me.” Turping said she helped a woman dig her husband out after they spotted his snowboard protruding from beneath the blanket of snow. “When he got uncovered, a ski patroller said, ‘You were under for six minutes,’” she said. All missing people have since been accounted for, the resort said. It's unknown what triggered the avalanche, and the incident is under investigation. Guests at the resort had been warned of the potential danger, and explosives and other preventative measures were used on Friday, but the snowfall was heavy, Squaw Valley spokeswoman Liesl Hepburn told the AP. Following the avalanche, the resort was closed for the remainder of the day. All skiing and riding operations had been suspended earlier in the day after a snowboarder, missing since the previous afternoon, was found dead. Rocklin resident Wenyu Zhang, 42, was found by Squaw Valley Ski Patrol, according to the Placer County Sheriff's Office. He had gone missing amid a blizzard that dropped nearly 3 feet of snow with gusts up to 150 mph. A location-tracking device Zhang was wearing assisted rescuers in finding his body, authorities said. A blizzard warning issued by the National Weather Service expired Friday, but a storm warning remains in effect until 10 a.m. Saturday. A series of evacuation orders and flood watches had also been issued across Southern California in connection with the weather event. California wasn't the only state getting hammered by severe weather on Friday. At least five people were killed by falling trees across the Northeast U.S. as a ""bomb cyclone"" once again battered the region, CNN reported. And in Europe, 21 people were dead amid a week of frigid temperatures and heavy snow, the network reported.","KTLA 2 Injured in Avalanche, Missing Snowboarder Found Dead at NorCal Ski Resort as Winter Storm Slams State KTLA Five people were swept up in an avalanche at a Lake Tahoe-area ski resort, hours after the body of a missing snowboard had been discovered there,…",2018-03-03T06:06:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ktla.com'}","2 Injured in Avalanche, Missing Snowboarder Found Dead at NorCal Ski Resort as Winter Storm Slams State - KTLA",http://ktla.com/2018/03/02/2-injured-in-avalanche-missing-snowboarder-found-dead-at-norcal-ski-resort-as-winter-storm-slams-state/,https://tribktla.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-02-at-10-21-05-pm.png?w=1200,,Ktla.com,Lake Storm,1
Daniel Manzo,"At least 7 inches of lake-effect snow had been reported in western New York as of early Thursday morning, with squalls coming off the Great Lakes and occasionally pushing snowfall rates to 1 to 2 inches per hour in northwest Pennsylvania and upstate New York.
Interested in Weather?
Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News.
Additionally, wind gusts nearing 40 mph are causing near whiteout conditions on roadways affected by the snow squalls. This comes after a quick-moving storm dumped 7 to 8 inches of snow on Vermont and New Hampshire on Wednesday.
Radar images this morning show the storm heading head.
Parts of New York may see a foot of snow.
In parts of New York state on Thursday, snow accumulations could exceed 1 foot. As the winter storm pulls away farther into Southeast Canada, lake-effect snow squalls should end later Thursday.
Meanwhile, gusty winds are still an issue along the Appalachian Mountains and are extending into parts of the Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia metro areas. Wind gusts approaching 50 mph were reported on the New Jersey shore on Wednesday and others near 60 mph were reported in western North Carolina.
New winter storm watches have been issued Thursday for parts of the Midwest as a new storm is forecast to develop on Friday.
Many of this morning's wind chills are frigid.
This storm already is pulling down an Arctic blast into parts of the Midwest Thursday morning, with single-digit wind chills greeting whose waking up from Minneapolis to Chicago. This Arctic air will make its way into the Northeast on Friday, with wind chills across the entire region in the single digits and teens.
The wind chill in New York City will be about 13 degrees Friday morning.
A new winter storm is set to develop on Friday.
There's increasing confidence that a new winter storm will develop on Friday morning in the southern high Plains, bringing snow to parts of Colorado and northern New Mexico.
Winter Storm
Friday and into Saturday, this storm will organize a bit more, boosted by a separate system from the north, potentially adding to snowfalls in the central Plains and along the Interstate 70 corridor from Kansas City to Indianapolis. Snow may just reach Chicago, with heavier snow seen in central Illinois and northern Missouri. The storm should slide into the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys on Saturday night.
Parts of the upper Midwest will see significant snowfall through Saturday.
Forecasters have more confidence in what the storm does this weekend on the East Coast, however some aspects of this weather event remain unclear. On Sunday and Monday, the storm likely will become a little more energized and organized again as it moves towards the coast line near Virginia and North Carolina.
Winter Storm
However, a high pressure sitting in southern Canada should suppress the storm from making too much northern movement. The result of this is a snow shield wrapping around the cold side of the storm that likely brings impacts to parts of the mid Atlantic.
There's increasing potential for accumulating snowfall in the mid-Atlantic for the second half of weekend and into early Monday. However, there's still potential for the heaviest snow bands to slide a little north or be suppressed a little south. So it's still too early to pinpoint where the heaviest snowfall will set up. Additionally, it seems the snow wouldn't be particularly intense.
It's still too early to tell. There's no sufficient evidence, despite reports on social media, to suggest a blockbuster winter weather event is in the offing.",Parts of New York state could see more than a foot of snow.,2019-01-10T14:37:23Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Lake-effect snow, Arctic air blast Midwest, Northeast",https://abcnews.go.com/US/lake-effect-snow-arctic-air-blast-midwest-northeast/story?id=60281196,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/weather-WIVB-190110_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Lake Storm,1
TRIBUNE STAFF AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Wind-driven sleet, freezing rain and snow alternated to keep roads slick Saturday as the Coulee Region waited to see how much snow would ultimately accumulate during a mid-April storm that blasted much of the nation’s heartland. The National Weather Service predicted 6 to 12 inches of snow along and north of Interstate 90, 2 to 6 inches south of the I-90 corridor, and a winter weather warning was in effect till 7 p.m. Sunday. The weather system stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, forcing flight cancellations and creating treacherous road conditions. Three people were killed in weather-related incidents, including a sleeping 2-year-old Louisiana girl. In the Upper Midwest, the early spring storm brought snow to a region pining for sunshine and warmth. More than 200 flights were canceled Saturday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and blizzard conditions forced the airport in South Dakota’s biggest city, Sioux Falls, to remain closed for a second straight day. Some flights at the La Crosse Regional Airport were delayed or canceled. The Minnesota Twins home game against the Chicago White Sox at Target Field was also snowed out, marking the first back-to-back postponements of baseball games in the stadium’s nine seasons. Authorities closed several highways in southwestern Minnesota, where no travel was advised, and driving conditions were difficult across the entire southern half of the state, well into western Wisconsin. “It’s a cool experience for me, the best Minneapolis experience,” said Niko Heiligman of Aachen, Germany, who braved the snow to take a walk along the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis. “I’m only here for the weekend, so I guess that’s how it goes. There’s snow and it’s cold. So it’s good.” The storm is expected to persist through today in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan before moving into New York state and New England. A band of 6 to 18 inches of snow had fallen by Saturday morning across central and northeastern Wisconsin, with another round on the way. A blizzard warning was issued for the northern half of Wisconsin, which was expected to get another 14 inches by Sunday evening. Winds of up to 55 mph caused blowing and drifting snow, along with ice shoves in Green Bay. In Chicago, Lake Michigan waves were expected to reach as high as 18 feet, prompting a flood warning until today along the lakefront. Huron, an eastern South Dakota city of about 13,000 people, received 18 inches of snow. One of the three storm-related deaths occurred Friday on snow-covered Interstate 80 near Chappell in western Nebraska, where the State Patrol said an Idaho truck driver lost control of his semitrailer and slammed into a semi that had become stranded. Rollo Ward, 61, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, died at the scene. Another death happened early Saturday in northwestern Louisiana when a storm toppled a tree onto a mobile home in Haughton, killing a sleeping 2-year-old girl inside. A woman died in a spinout on a slippery highway in central Wisconsin on Saturday morning.

,"At a Glance Winter Storm Benji dumped inches of snow on parts of the South, making travel more difficult. Schools were canceled Friday and residents were urged to stay home. Nearly 300,000 homes and businesses lost power in the path of the winter storm. Residents from South Texas eastward across the Deep South enjoyed the presence of rare December snow on Friday, while officials were hopeful that warm road temperatures would counter the snowfall and minimize the impacts of Winter Storm Benji. Early Friday morning, thundersnow was reported in some parts of southern Texas and even in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as the system brought bursts of snow that were heavy at times. Farther east, heavy snow fell in cities like Jackson, Mississippi, Birmingham, Alabama, and the northern suburbs of Atlanta. (MORE: The Latest Forecast for Winter Storm Benji ) The snow also had an impact on power – nearly 300,000 homes and businesses lost electricity in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia combined Friday, according to PowerOutage.us. Texas Accumulating snow was reported as far south as Brownsville Friday morning as southeastern Texas enjoyed a rare snowfall from Benji. In the Houston area, several school districts delayed opening because of road conditions, according to the Houston Chronicle. ""We're experiencing delays with bus transportation due to weather, traffic, and staffing,"" Houston ISD said in a release sent Friday morning. ""School leaders most impacted have been contacted, but this will be a district-wide problem. We also urge parents whose student rides the bus to make sure they're bundled up and to be patient as we work to get every bus rider to school safely. The safety of our students is our top priority, especially in unusual conditions such as those around the city today."" (MORE: Once-in-a-Decade Snow Falls in South Texas ) Nearly 50,000 customers were without power in the Lone Star State Friday morning. Louisiana Multiple school districts in southeastern Louisiana canceled classes Friday, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, as Benji's snow became problematic for travelers across the region. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Friday morning, with most of those outages grouped in the south-central part of the state. A stretch of U.S. 90 was closed in both directions from Amelia to Gray late Friday morning because of ice on the roadway, the Times-Picayune also said. The closure impacted a stretch of the highway about 20 miles long in southern Louisiana. Snow flurries fell in New Orleans during the afternoon hours, providing a rare wintry scene for the Big Easy. On the 24-mile causeway bridge that spans Lake Pontchartrain, police aided drivers via slow-moving convoys on the slick roadway, according to the Associated Press. ""Hopefully, the only people on the roads are the ones who have to be out today,"" Dexter Accardo of the St. Tammany Parish government told the Times-Picayune. ""We're advising everyone to stay off the roads if they can."" Mississippi Roads became troublesome in areas and more than 80,000 homes and businesses lost power in southern parts of the state as Benji dumped several inches of snow Friday morning. Parts of southern Mississippi received up to a half-foot of snow, making Benji one of the biggest snowstorms to hit the area since records began, according to the National Weather Service. (PHOTOS: Winter Storm Benji, in Pictures ) In Jackson, several schools were canceled Friday; WAPT.com has a complete list. Despite the headaches, many Mississippians were grateful that it wasn't a different kind of wintry precipitation for once. ""My whole life it was always ice storms, rarely snow,"" Jackson resident Jason Tuten told the AP. ""I guess the conditions were perfect."" Alabama Residents were urged to stay home in northern Alabama as Benji turned roads dangerous. AL.com reported numerous crashes on Interstate 65 Friday morning, and meteorologists said street conditions were worsening as the morning went on. Reports from the NWS mid-morning Friday said all city roads were closed in Talladega, and some streets in Anniston were becoming impassable, with multiple wrecks reported. Georgia More than 650 flights were canceled into and out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport – making up virtually all of the domestic cancellations – as Benji made travel treacherous in North Georgia on Friday. Although many roads in the Atlanta area were pretreated with a brine solution, the slushy roads were packed midday with drivers looking to get home and beat the rush. Schools in the metro Atlanta area dismissed students early and thousands of residents hit the streets at the same time, creating another gridlock situation. ""We're surprised that this little snowfall would cause this much disruption to the entire city,"" Lucas Rachow told the AP while trying to get a ride to the airport. North Carolina With some of the South's biggest snow totals expected to fall in western and northern North Carolina, officials were taking no chances with travel – not even the state's leader. Gov. Roy Cooper postponed two events because of Benji, one in Waynesville and one in Asheville, where he was scheduled to appear, according to the AP.

Bill Bostock,"Senator Elizabeth Warren has made her first moves on her 2020 campaign trail, by announcing a four-city visit to the crucial state of Iowa. 
 Warren announced on Tuesday she will visit the cities of Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Storm Lake, and Sioux City. 
 They will be her first public appearances since announcing on Monday that she had set up an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign. 
 They consist of three ""organizing events"" held at a large bar, a theatre, and a community centre. One additional ""rountable"" discussion will happen in Storm Lake alongside the main event. 
 The existence of the committee does not mean she is definitely running in 2020, but it is the first step toward staking a claim to be the Democrats' leading candidate. 
 Another popular Democrat Senator, Beto O'Rourke, met with Barack Obama in his Washington offices in November, suggesting he too may have ambitions in 2020. 
Elizabeth Warren is the highest-profile Democrat name so far to pursue a formal presidential run.
 AP/Charles Krupa 
Iowa is significant for presidential wannabes as it changes its party allegiance all the time, and is widely known as a pivotal swing state in tight election races. 
 It voted for Republicans Donald Trump and George W. Bush in 2016 and 2004, but in-between, voted for Obama and the Democrats (in 2008 and 2012.) 
 Iowa hosts the first presidential primary election on February 3, 2020. In the final presidential vote, Iowa has been on the side of the winning candidate in 2016, 2012, 2008, and 2004.

 Warren, the highest-profile Democrat so far to hint at running in 2020, made the first step towards declaring her formal candidacy by sharing a video on Twitter and launching a website that went live on Monday morning. 
 In the video she described her vision of defending the middle class, which characterised as being ""under attack."" 
 Here's the full video: 
 President Trump responded to Warren's video on Fox News' ""All-American New Year"" special on Monday. 
 When asked whether Warren had a shot, he said: ""Well, that I don't know. You'd have to ask her psychiatrist."" 
 The presidential exploratory committee means Warren can start receiving donations, travel around the country whipping up support, and test the waters, before deciding whether to officially declare her intention to run.

Camila Domonoske,"Nearly a hundred people have been evacuated from their homes in Lynchburg, Va., after an intense storm amid concerns that an aging dam might fail and unleash dangerous floodwaters. Video posted by the city overnight showed water flowing over the dam and into Blackwater Creek. LuAnn Hunt, a city spokeswoman, tells NPR that 94 people took shelter at a local high school that's serving as an evacuation center. They will remain there ""until our weather event has passed and our dam is stabilized,"" she says. Engineers have been assessing the situation at College Lake Dam. ""Currently, they have found no seepage at the dam so it is considered stable,"" Jes Gearing, public information officer for Lynchburg Water Resources, said in a statement emailed to NPR. ""We are developing a plan to stabilize the dam which may include opening the sluice gate at the dam to reduce the water levels."" Last night, the National Weather Service warned that the worst-case scenario — a complete dam collapse — could send 17 feet of water into the central Virginia city in just seven minutes. By Friday, the threat was less severe, NWS forecaster Nick Fillo tells NPR. ""The conditions have improved,"" he says. ""After the heavy rain that fell yesterday evening, we just had some light to moderate rain, which hasn't really added to the problem."" Authorities were still being cautious. On Friday, the National Weather Service told residents that ""the threat for dam failure continues"" and the flash flood warning remains in effect. Lynchburg, with a population of around 80,000, is home to a number of colleges and universities, including the University of Lynchburg ( previously Lynchburg College ), which owns the lake the dam is located on. Liberty University, the Christian university founded by Jerry Falwell, is also located in Lynchburg. The dam was built in the early '30s and, like many dams in the U.S., doesn't meet current safety standards. In 2011, Virginia's Department of Conservation and Recreation identified the College Lake Dam as one of the state's ""high-hazard"" dams. Since 2014, the City Council has been considering options for repairing or replacing the dam. Turner Perrow, a member of the Lynchburg City Council who is also a civil engineer, tells NPR that the dam presents ""a complicated problem."" A major road for the city crosses over top of the dam, which is located right next to the University of Lynchburg. The lake behind it is filled with silt, which complicates potential solutions — if they removed the dam, for instance, they would need to ensure that the silt didn't cause other problems downstream. And every proposed fix would cost millions of dollars. It's a problem with fresh urgency. The city knew the dam couldn't handle 2 feet of rain, the maximum it was supposed to be able to cope with, Perrow says. But the crew monitoring the dam last night raised concerns about structural integrity after just about six inches of rain. ""This dam is in worse shape than we thought it was,"" Perrow says. At the same time, he notes that ""one of the opportunities coming out of this averted disaster is we may be able to tap federal funds for emergency preparedness to really fix the dam once and for all."" Given the condition of the dam and the state of the lake, Perrow says, the most likely ""fix"" isn't actually a repair — he says the city is likely to tear the dam down completely and replace it with a bridge.","The College Lake Dam has been strained by heavy rainfall.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp ( DUK.N ) said on Friday breaches in the cooling lake dam of its 625-megawatt natural gas L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina due to flooding conditions in the Cape Fear river forced the utility to shut down the unit. Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches, one large and several smaller, on the southern end of the impoundment, the company said. Site personnel are supplementing on-site supplies with large stones and other materials, and engineering experts are moving to the site. The company’s shares were down 1.4 percent at $79.55 in afternoon trading. The Associated Press had earlier reported on the dam breach. Floodwaters had overtopped a steel retaining wall containing one of three large coal ash dumps lining the lakeshore, the company told the AP, adding that it cannot rule out that ash might be escaping and flowing into the Cape Fear river. Duke reported two coal ash leaks from a retired plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence. One came from its shuttered Sutton Power Plant on Saturday and a second on Sunday, according to federal officials. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy had agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing. In 2015, the company was fined more than $100 million after a 2014 spill that at the time was the third-worst coal ash spill in U.S. history.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - An Indiana woman who lost 9 members of her family, including her children and husband, when a “duck boat” capsized and sank in Missouri said on television that the captain of the vessel told passengers not to put on life jackets. Tia Coleman told an Indianapolis television station that she and her nephew were the only survivors from 11 members of their family who were on the amphibious vehicle when it capsized and sank in a storm near Branson, Missouri on Thursday, killing 17 of its 31 passengers. ""I lost all my children, I lost my husband, I lost my mother in law, I lost my father in law, I lost my uncle, I lost my sister in law - she was my sister - and I lost my nephew, I'm ok, but this is really hard,"" Coleman told Fox 59 from her hospital bed in Branson. bit.ly/2LB7QwJ Coleman said her husband would “want the world to know” that when they were in the water, the captain of the vehicle told them not to put their life jackets on, an action she believed had cost lives. “The captain told us ‘don’t worry about grabbing the life jackets, you won’t need them,’ so nobody grabbed them because we listened to the captain and he told us to stay seated,” Coleman said. “However in doing that, when it was time to grab them it was too late. I believe that a lot of people could have been spared.” The captain of the vehicle was among 14 survivors, seven of whom were injured, one of them severely. Coleman said the boat crew were told to first do the water section of the 70-minute land/water tour, which involves going in Table Rock Lake near Branson, so as to avoid an expected storm while they were sailing. “There was a warning, the warning people said ‘take them out to the water first before the storm hits,’” Coleman said, adding that she did not know whether they went through the land or the water section of the tour first. “The water didn’t look ominous at the very first, it looked like normal water, and then it started looking really choppy.” A bystander took a more than four minute video of the duck boat slowly being swamped by waves as it tried to make it to shore, before it finally capsized and sank.

Sean Collins Walsh,"Built in 1969 and designed to withstand a 50-year storm, the two-lane causeway in Kingsland that succumbed to a raging Llano River was the third Central Texas bridge to be destroyed by floodwaters in recent years. Experts say it likely won't be the last as climate change and construction exacerbate the natural factors that led meteorologists to name the Hill Country ""flash flood alley."" With more than 53,000 bridges, Texas has more than any other state, and many were built in the mid-20th century based on federal weather data from the 1950s. Intense rain events are now more common, and rapid exurban development has created more impervious cover, leading to more runoff. ""It's inevitable that we will see more major bridge damage in the future, likely sooner rather than later,"" said Bruce Melton, an Austin-based civil engineer and founder of the nonprofit Climate Change Now Initiative. ""The 100-year storm is now the 25-year storm in Austin. PHOTOS: Major flooding throughout Central Texas on Tuesday"" The river crested at 39.9 feet Tuesday in the city of Llano, the closest flood gauge upstream from Kingsland, according to the National Weather Service. That was the highest flood level recorded in Llano since the record-setting 1935 mark of 41.5 feet. Most bridges on Texas Department of Transportation-constructed roads are built to withstand 25- or 50-year storms, while interstate highways are designed to withstand 100-year storms, said Travis Attanasio, a civil engineer in the Fort Worth area and an officer with the American Society of Civil Engineers. Some large Texas cities in recent years have started requiring bridges to be designed to withstand 100-year floods. A 100-year storm is a rain event that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year based on federal weather data. Those data, however, are being re-evaluated to reflect higher rainfall totals in recent years. Texas, for instance, has seen 500-year floods in each of the last three years. TxDOT spokesman Chris Bishop said the RM 2900 bridge was built with the assumption that the water levels in the Kingsland area, where the Colorado and Llano rivers meet at the top of Lake LBJ, are expected to stay stable. ""That section is considered to be for the most part a constant-level lake, so it’s not expected to do this. It normally would handle that, and it has for 50 years,"" Bishop said. TxDOT will not be able to estimate the reconstruction cost until after its inspectors evaluate the damage, Bishop said. Replacing a bridge of that type and size typically costs about $20 million, Attanasio said. In 2015, the deadly Memorial Day weekend flooding along the Blanco River destroyed two bridges between Blanco and Wimberley. As the state took a year to rebuild them, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a temporary span for the Fischer Store Road Bridge upstream from Wimberley. Austin bridges The city of Austin maintains six bridges over Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake, including the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and the Pleasant Valley Road bridge at Longhorn Dam. Most of those bridges are at or near the 100-year flood plain, said Pirouz Moin, interim city engineer. Redbud Trail downstream from Tom Miller Dam at Lake Austin is one of the bridges in the 100-year plain, but it is slated to be replaced if voters approve a $160 million transportation bond on Nov. 6. The city also is updating its flood plain maps, which could place several city bridges under the specification. Moin said new bridges are built to withstand 100-year floods. However, it is impossible for many of Austin’s roughly 1,700 bridges to be built at that height because they are in low-lying areas and could not serve roads that feed into them or provide access to surrounding properties. Requiem for a causeway The opening of the RM 2900 bridge came during a golden age for Kingsland, as the tiny town saw a population boom and a series of major construction and transportation projects. Local merchants bought a newspaper ad encouraging residents from nearby Sunrise Beach, Sandy Harbor and Blue Lake Estates to ""cross the bridge and save in Kingsland,” according to Highland Lakes Weekly. The unincorporated city now has about 6,000 residents and is home to the Antlers Hotel, where 1973's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was filmed. The bridge has become a vital connection between the town and smaller communities on the other side of the Llano River. Each day about 5,600 drivers use that stretch of RM 2900, according to TxDOT traffic estimates. Although video of the bridge breaking apart seems to show that the flood's wall of water simply overpowered it on Tuesday, Attanasio said the bridge likely met its end because of debris that accumulated underneath it.

Barbara Goldberg,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Plunging temperatures after a wet winter storm dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of the U.S. Northeast were expected to flash freeze much of the region on Sunday and make travel dicey during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday. 
“Any water that remains on the road will freeze into a sheet of ice and make conditions quite hazardous,” said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS). 
Sub-zero temperatures tied to gusting winds prompted the NWS to issue wind chill advisories and warnings for more than 10 states, from North Dakota and other parts of the central United States to East Coast metropolitan centers including Washington, New York and Boston. 
It will be a roller-coaster ride for temperatures, with Sunday’s warm start melting overnight snow and threatening flooding in areas including southeastern Massachusetts. By evening, temperatures were expected to dive into a dangerous flash freeze. 
High temperatures for Monday are forecast at 17 Fahrenheit (minus 8 Celsius) for New York City, and 12 F (minus 11 C) for Boston. 
“Behind this winter storm is a lot of cold air that has been dropping south from Canada,” said Otto by telephone from College Park, Maryland. “You combine that with winds gusting between 20 and 30 miles an hour and you have pretty dangerous windchills of 10 to 30 below zero.” 
The storm has already dropped heavy snow in Pennsylvania, although the deepest amount reported was 16 inches (41 cm) in the northern New York town of Lake Desolation, he said. It was headed for Maine, where it was expected to lay a white carpet up to 2 feet deep. 
While the mercury will dive in the Northeast, forecasters say it is unlikely to fall below the storm’s current low of minus 46 Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) recorded in Cotton, Minnesota. 
The wintry weather has contributed to travel disruption across the United States during a busy holiday weekend, with 1,458 flight cancellations and 989 flight delays by mid-morning on Sunday, according to FlightAware.com. 
Amtrak canceled or modified its Sunday train service from Boston to Washington and between Chicago and the East Coast.

Associated Press,"LAKEPORT, Calif. – The Latest on fires in California (all times local): 4:35 p.m. Hundreds of people have been forced from their homes as a fire caused by a lightning storm burns near Grants Pass, Oregon. The 39-square mile (101-square kilometer) blaze is moving toward the Rogue River. The fire in southwest Oregon has caused people to evacuate in the Merlin and Grants Pass areas, but no structures or homes have been lost. 4 p.m. Northern California fire officials have added residents of two towns near Clear Lake to the list of those ordered to evacuate. The notice was issued Monday for the towns of Kelseyville and Finley and brought the number of people affected by the Mendocino fires to about 18,000. The fire's push to the east and north forced evacuees from a shelter that had been set up at Kelseyville High School. Sixty-three-year-old Michelle Mata says she is already tired and drained and now has to evacuate a second time. Cal Fire Division Chief Charlie Blankenheim said he expected significant growth as the fire pushed into the Mendocino National Forest. ___ 12:10 p.m. Derick Hughes II remained at his property in Nice (nees), California, despite mandatory evacuation orders prompted by a wildfire threatening the area. Hughes said Monday that he is using sprinklers to wet his roof and removing yard plants that could catch fire. The 32-year-old Marine Corps veteran says he sent his wife and two daughters to safety Sunday along with three carloads of belongings. Hughes says he and about five of his neighbors chose to protect their homes against fire and looters, despite an evacuation text alert they got Sunday evening. Lake County officials said Monday about 14,000 people are under evacuation orders. Another 1,000 have been displaced in neighboring Mendocino County. Two blazes are encroaching on several towns that surround Clear Lake. __ 11:15 a.m. An official says at least 14,000 people are under evacuation orders in an area of Northern California that has been hit by deadly wildfires in the past four years. Another 1,000 people have been displaced in neighboring Mendocino County. Lake County sheriff's Lt. Corey Paulich said Monday that two blazes are encroaching on Lakeport, Upper Lake and Nice but have not yet reached heavily populated areas. Paulich says residents have been heeding evacuation orders because they have seen the destruction caused by past fires. The impoverished county about 110 miles (180 kilometers) northwest of Sacramento has been hit by several wildfires since 2015 that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least four people. ___ 9:20 a.m. Some evacuations orders have been lifted around a Northern California wildfire area near the city of Redding. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said people can return to several neighborhoods in western Redding as of Monday morning. The huge blaze near Redding has displaced 38,000 from their homes and killed six people. Fire officials say the deadly blaze has slowed its growth after days of rapid expansion. The blaze burning for more than a week has scorched 155 square miles (400 square kilometers) and destroyed 723 homes. It has killed two firefighters and four civilians. ___ 8:30 a.m. Police say five people have been arrested on suspicion of entering areas of Northern California evacuated due to an explosive wildfire, including a man dressed in camouflage and carrying a loaded handgun. The Record Searchlight reports Monday that police arrested Mitchell Stuebgen late Saturday in an evacuated zone of Redding, California, where a massive wildfire has displaced 38,000 from their homes and killed six people. Police say Stuebgen was dressed in camouflage and was carrying a loaded handgun, a billy club, nunchucks and a concealed dagger. Authorities on Sunday arrested 44-year-old Brian Cordoza and 37-year-old Frank Webber, both of Redding for being in an evacuated zone. The Sacramento Bee reports that 25-year-old Jade Ball and 19-year-old Jack Fannin, of Redding, were also arrested Sunday after police found what they said was evidence tying them to several burglaries. ___ 8 a.m. A man whose wife and two great-grandchildren were killed by the huge wildfire in Redding, California, says he did not receive any type of warning to evacuate. Ed Bledsoe tells CBS News he did not know his home was in danger when he left his wife, Melody, and the 4- and 5-year-old children to run an errand on Thursday. Bledsoe says he received a phone call from his wife 15 minutes later saying he needed to get home because the fire was approaching. He says one of the children told him the fire was at the back door. Bledsoe says he tried to return but the road was blocked with cars and flames prevented him from returning on foot. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko tells the network there's an investigation into whether the Bledsoe home received a warning call or a knock on the home's door. The sheriff says there is evidence that door-to-door notifications were made in the area. ___ 7:15 a.m. More than 10,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders as two blazes rage 30 miles (50 kilometers) apart in Northern California. Mendocino County Undersheriff Matthew Kendall says 1,000 people were order to evacuate in his county. The rest are in Lake County, where residents of the town of Lakeport with a population of 5,000 were ordered to leave Sunday night. The blazes that started Friday are about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Redding, where California's largest wildfire is burning and has killed six people. Officials said Monday that 723 homes have been destroyed by that fire, up from a previous count of 657 homes lost. California fire officials say that blaze grew overnight to 153 square miles (395 square kilometers). ___ 11 p.m. Authorities have arrested two people on suspicion of looting homes that had been evacuated due to an explosive wildfire. The Sacramento Bee reports that 25-year-old Jade Ball and 19-year-old Jack Fannin, of Redding, were found with what police said was evidence tying them to several burglaries. The Carr Fire prompted mandatory evacuations for tens of thousands of people in Redding, a city hundreds of miles north of San Francisco. It has destroyed over 650 houses. Authorities say a homeowner who stayed behind flagged down an officer after he noticed evidence that people had been in his house. Officers found a nearby home with evidence of a broken-in door and discovered electronic items stacked by the front door. Police say they do not believe the homeowners placed the items like that before evacuating. ___ 10:45 p.m. Thousands more are fleeing their homes after wildfires surged near a small lake town in Northern California while farther north firefighters made progress in a battle against a deadly blaze. Crews stretched to their limits across the state are fighting flames that have claimed the lives of two firefighters and six civilians. Residents of the waterfront town Lakeport fled Sunday after a major flare-up of two fires that combined across Mendocino and Lake counties destroyed at least four homes. Lakeport, home to about 5,000, is around 120 miles north of San Francisco. To the northeast, a massive fire near Redding slowed for the first time since days of explosive growth. Meanwhile officials said a second firefighter died fighting a huge blaze to the south near Yosemite National Park.","Fox News The Latest: Oregon wildfire causes evacuations Fox News LAKEPORT, Calif. – The Latest on fires in California (all times local):. 4:35 p.m..

,"At a Glance Four people were injured when a likely tornado hit Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base Sunday afternoon. The same storm system slammed the town of Taylorville, Illinois, on Saturday, injuring 25 people. Tornadoes also caused major damage in parts of Oklahoma. One person was killed when an EF1 tornado struck near Auroro, Missouri. A storm system that tore across the Plains Friday into Saturday morning brought severe thunderstorms and a likely tornado to southeast Georgia on Sunday. Tornado warnings were issued for Camden County, which includes Kingsland, St. Marys and Cumberland Island, Georgia. Tornado warnings also were issued for Nassau County in northeast Florida. Action News Jax said injuries were reported at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base near Kingsland, about 4 p.m Sunday. Reporter Ryan Nelson said he spoke with the mother of one of the injured people. Nelson said she told him her son had been fishing when the storm hit and that he had been taken to a hospital. Scott Bassett, a public information officer at the base, told weather.com that no submarines were damaged in the storm. He said there was wind damage to a pier facility in the southeast part of the base where smaller Coast Guard vessels dock. One of those boats flipped in the storm, Bassett said. He also said the storm knocked down utility poles and flipped vehicles. Later Sunday, another public information officer, Chris Tucker, told First Coast News that four people had been injured in the storm. Tucker said their injuries were not severe, but they were taken to a local medical facility where they were treated and released. The same system had spawned a tornado Saturday that left more than 100 homes damaged and 25 people injured in Taylorville, Illinois. The tornado struck the town of about 11,200 residents just after 5 p.m. Saturday. (MORE: Destructive Tornado Strikes Taylorville, Illinois; 25 People Hurt, Over 100 Buildings Damaged ) The storm system also was responsible for at least four tornadoes that caused extensive damage in Oklahoma and killed one person in a southwestern Missouri. Fire Chief Robert Ward told KYTV that one person inside an Aurora, Missouri, motel was killed as a storm passed through. The National Weather Service confirmed an EF1 tornado in the area. An EF0 was confirmed to have hit Monett, Missouri. Authorities have not released the person's name or details of how the death occurred. A tornado was reported near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, around 9:30 p.m. CST. Widespread damage was reported around the Lake Tenkiller area as the storm tracked on towards Arkansas. The storm was accompanied by a strong tornado debris signature, indicating that significant damage may have occurred for some time. As daylight arrived Saturday, extensive damage could be seen from social media posts, including damage to the Snake Creek Marina at Lake Tenkiller. ""There's nothing left. No marina. Nothing. My boat's gone and everything is gone,"" Michael Martin told KOTV. ""This is devastating right here. I mean few of the docks have been torn up, but these are destroyed. There aint nothing left down there."" Law enforcement reported several homes damaged in the town of Tenkiller, according to ABC 4029 News. Sequoyah County Sheriff Larry Lane told the news station a family trapped in a storm cellar by a downed tree was rescued. In Gore, Oklahoma, three homes were damaged, one severely, and in Aurora, a car dealership sustained heavy damage. (MORE: Severe Thunderstorm Threat: Timing Locations ) Several homes were damaged in Van Buren, Arkansas. In Missouri, a wind gust to 83 mph was recorded near Republic, and in Ridgedale, the top two Floors of D'Monaco Resort sustained significant damage, the National Weather Service reported. No injuries have been reported. On Sunday, the National Weather Service confirmed that two tornadoes had hit Oklahoma on Friday. Webber Falls saw an EF-1 tornado that traveled about 7 miles. The tornado that hit near Lake Tenkiller was an EF-2 that traveled about 25 miles and had top winds of 125 mph. An area of low pressure moved into the southern Plains Friday night and intensified, said weather.com meteorologist Linda Lam. This system combined with mild and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to produce strong to severe thunderstorms Friday night from northern Texas into southern Missouri. This system will continue tracking eastward and will bring the risk of severe storms, with damaging winds, hail and isolated tornadoes, to parts of the South and Midwest, possibly as far north as central Illinois and central Indiana on Saturday, Lam said.","Sacramento Bee Georgia Naval Base Struck by Likely Tornado; Illinois Town Takes Direct Hit, One Dead in Missouri The Weather Channel A storm system that tore across the Plains Friday into Saturday morning brought severe thunderstorms and a likely tornado to s…",2018-12-02T22:28:24Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Georgia Naval Base Struck by Likely Tornado; Illinois Town Takes Direct Hit, One Dead in Missouri - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/news/news/2018-12-02-storms-tornadoes-kings-bay-georgia-plains-oklahoma-missouri-arkansas,https://s.w-x.co/gatornado.jpg,,Weather.com,Lake Storm,1

John Haltiwanger,"When President Donald Trump arrived in North Carolina on Wednesday to survey the damage from Hurricane Florence, he seemed to be particularly interested in the conditions near one of his golf courses. During a briefing at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, Trump asked Lynn Good, chairman and CEO of Duke Energy, how things were near Lake Norman. Good told Trump things were ""good,"" adding, ""but still 10 or 12 inches of rain."" ""I love that area. I can't tell you why, but I love that area,"" Trump said in response. There is a Trump National Golf Club on the shores of Lake Norman, which might explain the president's affinity for the area. Since entering the White House, Trump has spent at least 199 days at his properties, including 154 days at golf properties, according to an analysis from NBC News. The president was often critical of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, for playing golf. During Wednesday's briefing, Trump thanked federal and local officials for their efforts to prepare for and address Hurricane Florence, and expressed his sympathies to those who lost loved ones. ""To the families who have lost loved ones, America grieves with you, and our hearts break for you,"" Trump said. ""And to all those impacted by this terrible storm, our entire American family is with you and ready to help. And you will recover."" During his visit to North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump at one point also told a storm victim to ""have a good time"" as he handed him a packaged meal. The president made similar comments last year while addressing victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, a storm over which Trump continues to face criticism in terms of his response. At another point on Wednesday, a child asked the president for a hug, and he obliged. Florence has led to at least 37 deaths, 27 of which occurred in North Carolina. Thousands of people remain in shelters and hundreds of thousands remain without power. Flooding from the monster storm wreaked havoc across the Carolinas and the damage is extensive. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper on Wednesday said, ""We are a state that is hurting.""","When President Donald Trump arrived in North Carolina on Wednesday to survey the damage from Hurricane Florence, he seemed to be particularly interested in the conditions near one of his golf courses.

Brian McCready,"NEW FAIRFIELD, CT — The severe storms, and possibly tornadoes, that rampaged through parts of Connecticut Tuesday afternoon resulted in the death of two people, including a woman who was killed when a tree fell on her vehicle while her 3-year-old passenger was inside. Somehow, miraculously, the child wasn't injured. The woman, 41, was killed when the tree fell on her vehicle on Brush Hill Road in New Fairfield around 5 p.m. The victim's name hasn't been released at this time. Another person was killed after a tree fell on his truck in the Candlewood Lake section of Danbury during Tuesday's powerful storm, Fox 61 reports. The Hartford Courant adds that the man was working outside as the storm approached and took shelter in his truck. The man's name also hasn't been released. A young man was seriously injured after the roof of a baseball dugout at Henry Abbott Technical High School blew off and struck him, according to reports.

The number of outages has dipped to around 80,000 as of Wednesday afternoon. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said ""Those who are still without electricity should plan for long-term outages."" Eversource says, "" Customers in the hardest hit areas near Danbury and Newtown may be without power for multiple days. Town-by-town restoration estimates are now available here. We expect to have statewide projections for remaining towns later this evening."" ( Click here to see when your power is expected to return, if you are an Eversource customer.) Malloy also announced that the Connecticut Insurance Department has activated its emergency adjuster program that allows insurance companies to quickly register their out-of-state adjusters and bring them into the state to help with claims of property and auto damage. Malloy said activating this protocol will help expedite the many anticipated claims resulting from the severe storms. ""We want to make sure that homeowners get help as quickly as possible from their insurance companies,"" Insurance Commissioner Katharine Wade said. ""By activating this program, insurance companies are able to quickly get more help on the ground where it's most needed."" Insurance companies seeking to register their adjusters can access the emergency program online at this link. Residents and business who have insurance questions and concerns related to property damage can contact the Connecticut Insurance Department at insurance@ct.gov. The department also has an FAQ on storm damage available on their website. National Weather Service Visits Several CT Towns To Assess Storm Damage Meteorologists Tuesday night said a tornado did touch down in the Oxford and Southbury area as numerous trees and power lines were knocked down. The National Weather Service sent a team to Connecticut to investigate and not just Oxford and Southbury. They are checking these towns: ""The second team will be assessing the damage in Connecticut, particularly the towns of Brookfield, Danbury, New Milford, Newtown, Oxford, Ridgefield, Southbury, Winstead, Bethany, Hamden, Cheshire and Durham."" (See storm photos from throughout Connecticut here. ) We'll know later on if in fact there was an official tornado or tornadoes that occurred in Connecticut. A Tornado Warning was issued for parts of Hartford, Litchfield, New Haven, Fairfield, and Middlesex counties on Tuesday afternoon. The Carnage Left Behind The town of Brookfield declared a disaster and Malloy visited the town on Wednesday to survey the damage firsthand. First Selectman Steve Dunn has cautioned, ""Every single street has trees down. Most of our roads are impassable. We have dozens of downed power lines that have to get cleared up."" The ""Brookfield Tornado"" shot in the CostCo parking lot there, credit Carolyn Russo. Southbury and Oxford officials say they are in recovery mode and trying to get downed trees and power lines removed. Southbury declared a local state of emergency Wednesday afternoon as 98 percent of the town is in the dark. Several trees were knocked down in Greenwich Tuesday, including one near Town Hall that led to the government building losing power for a spell Tuesday on Field Point Road. The road was temporarily closed but has since been reopened, and power was restored to Town Hall in time for it to open on schedule on Wednesday. In West Granby, weather icon Brad Field reported that the back window of his son's car was smashed by a barrage of hail. In Somers, what authorities were describing as a ""possible microburst"" uprooted a large tree. Tolland county fire officials sent an engine to Brookfield to assist with the cleanup efforts in that end of the state. The north-central region of Hartford County was mainly spared from considerable damage. Some large hail fell in higher elevation areas such as Granby, but generally the area was limited in damage compared to the rest of the state. Residents in northern Hamden can't travel in certain areas because so many trees are down. Officials say trees have fallen on five houses. Two trees have fallen on Hill Street homes. The other damaged homes are on Shepard Avenue, Sunwood Circle and Westminster Street. There are several disabled motor vehicles scattered throughout the town, due to fallen trees. Ridgefield Police are encouraging residents to exercise extreme caution when traveling, as numerous roads remain closed in town due to trees and wires blocking them. Danbury Police set up a storm shelter. Guilford Police also say the northern section of town got hit very hard by this storm. Severe storm damage was also reported in Wallingford with numerous tress knocked down there as well. In Northford a tree fell on the house of Laura and Michael Burns and nearly struck Michael, who was sitting in a chair, WTNH News 8 reports. A 50-foot oak tree fell through their home and Michael told News 8 that ""I was lying on the ground and crawling across the living room floor on my hands and knees."" Wow. Look at this tree through this #Northford home. One of the owners was hit in the back by debris. @WTNH pic.twitter.com/eV6986LxsI — Stephanie Simoni (@StephanieSimoni) May 16, 2018 Tuesday's powerful storm managed to destroy a barn, greenhouses and more at Clover Nook Farm on Fairwood Road in Bethany. According to a post on their Facebook page, the Bethany farm ""got a direct hit"" by the tornado, which resulted in a greenhouse being thrown into a second one. The farm's old store/storage barn was also ""completely destroyed"" by the winds, as well as tractors and equipment. ""We are blessed to all be alive,"" the post said. ""Mom, Dad and I were locking down the greenhouse when it hit, the second greenhouse took off and landed on top of the greenhouse we were in."" The state has shut down these seven parks due to the storm damage: Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden, Chatfield Hollow State Park in Killingworth, Kettletown State Park in Southbury, Southford Falls State Park in Oxford, Squantz Pond State Park in New Fairfield, Putnam Memorial State Park in Redding, and Wharton Brook State Park in Wallingford. A widely anticipated food truck festival scheduled for this weekend at Hubbard Park in Meriden has been canceled.

Thursday, December 20, 2018, 2:30 PM -BC Ferries has cancelled several sailings on a number of its major routes from the mainland to Vancouver Island this morning as the South Coast is battered by another windy rainstorm.
Sailings between Vancouver and Victoria and Vancouver and Nanaimo have been called down until at least 2 p.m. PT.
In all, the following routes are seeing cancellations as of 10:30 a.m. PT:
Tsawwassen-Swartz Bay 
Tsawwassen-Duke Point
Tsawwassen-Southern Gulf Islands
Horseshoe Bay-Departure Bay
Comox-Powell River
Cortes Island-Quadra Island
Texada Island-Powell River
Hornby Island-Denman Island East

BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said more sailings will be cancelled if the weather doesn't improve.
She said the ferry service has already clocked winds of nearly 75 km/h Thursday morning, which is enough to spark safety concerns.
Wind warnings are in effect for the entire South Coast and all of Vancouver Island, save the northern tip. Environment Canada said those areas can expect winds between 70 and 90 km/h Thursday morning, picking up to 100 km/h in exposed coastal areas around noon.
SkyTrain service between Columbia and Lougheed stations has also been stopped because the wind has blown several branches onto the guideway. Service is operating between Waterfront and King George on the Expo Line, and between VCC-Clark and Lafarge Lake-Douglas on the Millennium Line.
WINTER STORM CONTINUES TO HIT COQUIHALLA
Travelling doesn't look any better for those heading to and from the Interior on Thursday. Weather warnings for the region include heavy rain, wind and snow throughout the day.
Environment Canada said snow will begin over the Coquihalla Highway on Thursday morning and intensify by evening, with another 30 centimetres of fresh snow by Friday.

The storm knocked out power in the Great Bear Snowshed tunnel, just north of Box Canyon, late Thursday. Emergency generators have kept the lights on but drivers have been asked to slow down and use extra caution.
Highway 3 and Highway 1 between Eagle Pass and Rogers Pass are also in for another round of torrential rain and gusting wind through the evening.
As much as 15 centimetres of snow is forecast for the Peace River and surrounding areas of northeastern B.C., while special weather statements for the Cariboo, 100 Mile, Thompson and Okanagan regions warn those areas should see potentially damaging winds later in the day.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp ( DUK.N ) said it shut down a North Carolina natural gas plant due to flooding as the deluge of water continued in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people. Duke also said it cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash from another plant is flowing into nearby waters. Water breached the cooling lake dam at Duke’s 625-megawatt natural gas L.V. Sutton plant, causing the company to shut the plant. Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches, one large and several smaller, the company said in a statement. Site personnel are supplementing on-site supplies with large stones and other materials, and engineering experts are on their way to the site, Duke said. Hurricane Florence brought several feet of rain to parts of North Carolina over a period of days, and the historic level of storm flooding is not expected to subside until next week. Separately, company spokesman Paige Sheehan told the Associated Press they cannot rule out that ash might be escaping and flowing into the Cape Fear river from another plant. Reuters has not independently verified this information. Duke reported two coal ash leaks from a retired plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence. One came from its shuttered Sutton Power Plant on Saturday and a second on Sunday, according to federal officials. Officials had worried the water would overwhelm several pits where coal ash had been stored, potentially contaminating rivers. Duke said there is no visible ash in the river. Coal ash collects at the bottom of basins, making it difficult to determine when ash escapes from a site. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy had agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing. In 2015, Duke was fined more than $100 million after a 2014 spill that at the time was the third-worst coal ash spill in U.S. history. The company’s shares were down 0.9 percent at $79.87 in early afternoon trading.

MARGARET STAFFORD / AP,"(KANSAS CITY, Mo.) — Charges have been filed against the captain of a tourist boat that sank and killed 17 people, including nine people from an Indiana family, in a southwest Missouri lake over the summer, federal prosecutors said Thursday. A federal indictment shows 51-year-old Kenneth Scott McKee is facing 17 counts of misconduct, negligence or inattention to duty by a ship’s officer resulting in death. The July accident occurred when an amphibious vessel known as a duck boat sank when a sudden and severe storm rolled into the area. McKee is accused of not properly assessing the weather before or after the boat went into Table Rock Lake near the tourist town of Branson, U.S. Attorney Tim Garrison said during a news conference in Springfield. Ripley Entertainment, the company that operated the boats, suspended operations following the accident. The boats were originally designed for military use in World War II but had been refurbished as a tourist attraction. The U.S. Coast Guard had found probable cause that the accident resulted from McKee’s “misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties,” according to an August court filing. The U.S. attorney’s office added that the captain of a second duck boat that safely made it to shore during the storm acted in a “grossly negligent manner,” though the court filing didn’t elaborate on those findings. The sinking killed nine members of Tia Coleman’s family, including her three young children and husband, who were vacationing from Indiana. The other people killed included two couples from Missouri, an Illinois woman who died while saving her granddaughter’s life, an Arkansas father and son, and a retired pastor who was the boat’s operator on land. Several lawsuits have been filed on behalf of victims and their survivors. A spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment has repeatedly declined to comment on the investigation but has said the company has cooperated with authorities. The vessels first take tourists on a trip through Branson, a Midwestern destination for country music shows and entertainment venues about 170 miles (274 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The amphibious vehicles then travel to Table Rock Lake for a short excursion on water. Weather was calm when the vessel known as a Stretch Duck 7 began its trip on July 19, but investigators have contended that operators had ample warning that a strong storm was approaching. The vessel’s certificate of inspection issued by the Coast Guard in 2017 established rules and limitations on when it could be on the water. It states the boat “shall not be operated waterborne” when winds exceed 35 mph and/or wave heights exceed 2 feet. Video and audio from the boat, recovered by divers, showed that the lake was calm when the boat entered the water. But the weather suddenly turned violent and, within minutes, the boat sank. The wind speed at the time of the accident was more than 70 mph, just short of hurricane force, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Weather forecasts had warned of an impending storm with winds possibly exceeding 60 mph. The wave height wasn’t known, but cellphone video shot by passengers on a nearby excursion boat showed waves that appeared to be far greater than 2 feet (0.61 meters) high. In addition to the weather, the Coast Guard has said it was looking into regulatory compliance of the boat and crew member duties and qualifications. Branson is among several places around the country where the amphibious vehicles offer excursions. Since 1999, 42 deaths have been associated with duck boat accidents. On May 1, 1999, 13 people died when the Miss Majestic duck boat sank on Lake Hamilton near Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 2015, five college students died and more than 70 people were hurt when a duck boat veered into a charter bus on a bridge in Seattle. Two Hungarian tourists died in 2010 when a stalled duck boat was struck by a tugboat-guided barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.

KUT Staff,"The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for all of South Central Texas, calling for a mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow on Tuesday – with freezing temperatures extending into Wednesday. A cold front moved through early this morning and temperatures are below freezing across most areas. Up to a 10th of an inch of ice is expected, creating dangerous conditions on the roads. Icy roads were already being reported as of 6 a.m., and the Austin Police Department is advising drivers to stay off the roads unless it is an emergency. The 5700 block of SH45 is completely iced over. Ice is reported and there is one crash at 71 EB at the 130 Toll Road Stay off the roads! #atxwx #ATXTraffic — Austin Police Dept (@Austin_Police) January 16, 2018 The Texas Department of Transportation said crews were out Sunday putting a de-icing solution on bridges, overpasses and the main lanes of major highways. TxDOT spokesman Chris Bishop said the goal is to keep at least one lane open for emergency vehicles and that early treatment helps because it will be reactivated by any moisture that hits it. “It’s kind of a preemptive strike,"" he said, ""trying to get ahead of any ice that would form beforehand, so that once things start happening with freezing rain or sleet or whatever’s going to come down, it buys time for us to get crews out to start the continuous treatment on the roads.” Still a handful of flyovers or overpasses – including the Ben White flyover at I-35, the Highway 290 eastbound flyover at I-35 and a section of State Highway 45 near Escarpment Drive – are closed or iced over, according to APD. The National Weather Service advises drivers to avoid flyovers and overpasses, as ice, sleet and possible snow accumulations could top a quarter-inch. Yvette Benavides, a meteorologist at the local office of the National Weather Service, said the area will probably see Tuesday's high temperature early in the morning. “And once we drop below freezing, it will stay below freezing until about Wednesday afternoon,"" she said, ""so any ice that does accumulate on the roads or anywhere else is likely to stay until Wednesday morning.” Closures, Delays And Cancellations In anticipation of the ice, the following school districts are closed Tuesday: Austin Bastrop Del Valle Dripping Springs Eanes Elgin Georgetown Hays Hutto Jarrell Lago Vista Lake Travis Leander Lockhart Manor Pflugerville Round Rock San Marcos Wimberley UT-Austin, Austin Community College, St. Edwards, Huston-Tillotson, Concordia, Southwestern and Texas State University's Round Rock and San Marcos campuses are also closed. Here's Everything You Need To Prepare For The Frigid Front Heading Our Way Capital Metro said local bus routes will operate on a Sunday schedule Tuesday. There will be no MetroRail or MetroExpress service. Pickup services at Round Rock and Georgetown will not operate today. Meals on Wheels said it was forced to cancel deliveries Tuesday. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport says airlines had begun canceling arrivals after 8 p.m. Monday; that could affect departures. Travelers should check flight statuses on the ABIA website under ""Real Time Arrivals and Departures."" So far, 77 flights were canceled as of 8:30 Tuesday morning. Austin Resource Recovery says curbside pickup in Austin is suspended today, with pickup shifting to tomorrow. Service in Round Rock is also suspended. City offices in Austin, Round Rock, Taylor and Pflugerville are closed. Travis, Williamson, Bastrop and Hays counties are also closed today. Austin Energy is already handling outages across its service area, with roughly 45 customers experiencing outages. Austin Energy spokesperson Jennifer Herber told KUT residents can conserve energy for shortages and outages by opening shades to bring in heat during daylight hours, setting the thermostat to about 68 degrees if leaving the house for long periods of time, and washing clothes in cold water. Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative is reporting six customers without power Tuesday morning, and asks customers experiencing outages to call 800-949-4414. Pedernales Electric Cooperative says 65 of its customers are without power. To report outage call 888-883-3379 Brett Williams, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services' Austin/San Antonio office, says South Central Texas should see periods of freezing rain, sleet and snow throughout the rest of Tuesday morning, with precipitation dying down this afternoon. Still, he says, freezing temperatures are expected to continue until noon on Wednesday. ""We’re not going to get above freezing today so whatever ends up accumulating on the roadways will most likely remain there,"" he said. ""So icy conditions may persist throughout the afternoon, evening hours.” Yesterday, Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the State Operations Center to elevate its readiness in anticipation of the severe weather. Texas has increased readiness of the State Operations Center ahead of severe winter weather conditions across the state.

ABC News,"Northern California is bracing for a major spring storm that is expected to dump several inches of rain on burn-scarred areas of wine country and could present the first test of the partially repaired spillway at the nation's tallest dam. The National Weather Service issued several flood warnings throughout Northern California ahead of Friday's expected atmospheric river, stretching to the Truckee River near Lake Tahoe. In Sonoma County, which was devastated by wildfires in October, the weather service predicted 4 to 6 inches (10-15 centimeters) of rainfall through Sunday. Even if the rain doesn't pan out, ""it's better to be prepared than not,"" said county Supervisor David Rabbitt. For officials in Santa Rosa, which was also hit hard by last year's fires, it's not the amount of total rainfall that worries them, it's the rate at which the rain falls. Workers have been monitoring hundreds of storm drain inlets, especially the ones protecting the neighborhoods destroyed by the fires, said fire department spokesman Paul Lowenthal. ""When we start talking about half an inch of rain or more an hour, that's where we're more susceptible to mudslides and debris flow in and around our burn zones,"" Lowenthal said. Friday's storm may be the first real test of the city's flood protection system as previous storms forecast to be strong have fizzled out or shifted elsewhere, he said. Some areas of the Santa Cruz mountains could see up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) over a three-day period, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding, mud and rock slides. Yosemite National Park officials canceled camping reservations for this weekend because the warm Pacific storm is expected to have a significant effect on the park and surrounding areas starting Friday. Roadways, campgrounds and other facilities could be affected. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch for the Yosemite area from 11 p.m. Friday through 11 a.m. Sunday. To the north, California Department of Water Resources officials warned this week that they may have to use the partially rebuilt spillway at Oroville Dam for the first time since repairs began on the badly damaged structure last summer. Lake Oroville has been slowly filling up all winter but as of Thursday morning, more water was being released through smaller outlets than was flowing in. The water level was at 793 feet (242 meters) and dropping. Water managers say they'll open the gates to the main, partially repaired spillway if the lake level reaches about 830 feet (253 meters). In February 2017, a massive crater opened up in the main spillway, a 3,000-foot (914-meter) concrete chute that releases water from Lake Oroville, which is California's second-largest reservoir. Crews shut down the spillway for inspections just as a major storm dumped a torrent of rain in the Feather River basin. With water releases stopped, the lake quickly filled to capacity and water began flowing over a concrete weir that serves as an emergency spillway. It had never been used. The water eroded the barren hillside beneath the concrete, leading to fears the weir would collapse and release a 40-foot (12-meter) wall of water that would swamp communities and destroy levies for miles downstream. Authorities ordered nearly 200,000 people downstream to flee. California officials say they hope to avoid using the main spillway but are confident it can safely function if needed. ""It's a big storm, it's a warm storm,"" said Erin Mellon, a spokeswoman for the Department of Water Resources. ""Obviously we have plenty of flood capacity within the lake considering it's still 110 feet (34 meters) below the top of the reservoir."" Construction crews last year fully rebuilt about a third of the spillway with rebar-reinforced structural concrete that's anchored into bedrock. The other two thirds were left with temporary concrete until construction resumes.",Northern California is bracing for a major spring storm that is expected to dump several inches of rain on burn-scarred areas of wine country and could present the first test of the partially repaired spillway at the nation's tallest dam.

Reuters Editorial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most of the U.S. Northeast and Midwest grappled with a post-Christmas deep freeze on Thursday, with temperatures expected to plunge as low as minus 20 degrees F (minus 29 C) in North Dakota as forecasters warned that the harsh winter weather could usher in the New Year. Tioga, about 200 miles (322 km) north of Bismarck, took honors as the coldest spot in the continental United States, according to National Weather Service (NWS) spokesman Bob Oravec. The mercury dived to minus 15 F early on Thursday afternoon. “By tomorrow morning, low temperatures will probably be 15 to 20 degrees below zero in the northern and northwestern areas of North Dakota, maybe even in north Minnesota,” Oravec said. On Wednesday, International Falls, Minnesota, about 300 miles north of Minneapolis, lived up to its reputation as the “Icebox of the Nation.” The low temperature there dropped to 37 degrees F below zero, breaking the old record for the day of 32 degrees below, set in 1924. Temperatures moderated to minus 2 F on Thursday. Mayor Bob Anderson told Reuters that a local paper mill had to reduce operations because of the cold. But he said mail was still being delivered, and the town’s roughly 6,000 weather-hardened residents were taking the cold in stride. For most of the region encompassing New England, northern Pennsylvania and New York, the NWS issued wind chill advisories or warnings. Temperatures in the region ranged from highs in the teens and 20s F to lows in the single digits or below zero. For upstate New York, east of Lake Ontario, the NWS warned of “dangerously” cold wind chills of minus 5 F to minus 30 F through Friday. In northern Vermont, conditions are even more brutal, with wind chills threatening to bottom out at minus 40 F. On Twitter, the hashtag #ItsSoCold was the No. 1 trending topic in the United States on Thursday as social media users expressed their frustration with Old Man Winter. “When your landlord doesn’t have the heat on during the workweek so the cat sitting in your lap isn’t just cute, but also practical. #ItsSoCold,” wrote user Walton Clark on Twitter. Erie, a city of about 100,000 on the shores of Lake Erie in northwest Pennsylvania, was expecting a fresh round of winter storms that could bring as much as an additional 10 inches (25 cm) of “lake effect” snow, forecasters said. The area is already buried under more than 65 inches from a record-breaking storm earlier this week. The accumulations, heavy even by the standards of the Great Lakes’ eastern shores, resulted from a wave of Arctic air moving across the relatively mild waters of the lake, forecasters said. Light and heavy snow was also expected to fall this weekend in many other parts of the United States, from Montana to Maine, forecasters said.

Rachel Reeves,"The first week of March will roar in with travel-disrupting snow, strong winds and blizzard conditions across the north-central United States. After spreading accumulating snow over the northern and central Rockies this weekend, snow and wind will ramp up across the northern Plains Sunday night into Monday. The winds combining with the snow will lead to local whiteout and blizzard conditions, according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun. The worst of the blizzard is expected across the Dakotas, from Minot and Bismarck, North Dakota, to Pierre, South Dakota.

There is the potential for many communities to pick up 6 inches or more of snow with this storm across the north-central U.S. “Bismarck has only received around 18 inches of snow so far this season and could receive around a foot or more from this event alone,” Rathbun said. Precipitation will start with rain and/or a bit of ice across the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin prior to colder air wrapping into the storm. Snow may struggle to stick to roads and sidewalks initially in these areas. However, as the temperature plummets and the ground cools, motorists and pedestrians will need to be wary of slick travel.

The band of snow will continue to sweep eastward and create slippery travel for a time over Michigan and surrounding areas on Monday night and Tuesday. This snow will graze Chicago and Detroit.

America's golden state is renowned for its hot, dry, sunny climate - and recently for drought and wildfires - so the BBC's Dan Johnson was at least expecting a break from typical British weather when he was posted to Los Angeles at the start of the year. That's not quite how it worked out.
Three months in Los Angeles. It sounded like a wonderful way to spend the winter. I had visions of weekends at the beach and afternoons by the pool. But I arrived to find it was raining. A storm passing through, I was assured. It would be gone in a few days and then the sun would shine. And it did. 
But then another storm came in - and another, and another. I kept tuning in for the local TV weather forecast presented by a man called, I kid you not, Dallas Raines. There wasn't a hint of gloom about his own sunny outlook and bright shiny smile but his map told a very different tale. Downtown Los Angeles saw more rain in January and February than during the whole of last year. It was welcomed by the locals. Refreshing, they said, and much needed to replenish reservoirs and ward off wildfires.

Parts of California have experienced drought since 2011. But after 376 consecutive weeks the state has at last been declared drought-free. The LA River, normally just a trickle at the bottom of a concrete canyon storm drain, has been a gushing torrent, trillions of gallons of water funnelled but then flushed straight out into the Pacific Ocean. There was flooding in the north of the state. Mudslides buried homes on hillsides still cracked and scorched from last year's wildfires. Roads are splitting open and the city's soaring freeways are afflicted by potholes. Drivers panic because they don't know how to deal with the wet conditions.

 A mudslide toppled this palm
People here are used to the weather being a constant, pleasant, mostly dry 20 to 25C, a reliable steady backdrop to LA life. Suddenly, though, it's become a topic of conversation. People talk about the weather. Then they talk about how much they're talking about the weather. Then finally they agree not to talk about the weather. Roofs are leaking after being pounded so heavily. Doors have swelled and filled their frames, drains have overflowed. Rainbows have become regular sights, hailstones a new threat.

During one storm more than 1,000 lightning strikes were recorded. Trees came down. A plane was hit and had to turn back. The airport suffered a power cut. Snow was forecast even as low as the Hollywood sign. In the mountains ski resorts have boomed as long as the roads have been passable and the whole place is green, so green.
Image copyrightGetty Images
The hillsides around LA are lush and the views are stunning. Forget ""smog city"" clouded with pollution, in between the showers the air's been clear and fresh. I've had more time on the ski slope than the beach but I've also been out walking the hills and trekking the canyons taking in the beautiful transformation.

Los Angeles is rarely recognised as a pretty city but when the rain stops and the clouds part it really has looked its best. And on the hills that rise from Lake Elsinore, about an hour away, Walker Canyon has been smothered with a blanket of bright orange poppies. They call this the super bloom. It happens most years, but few can remember it being so colourful, so vibrant and so widespread.

There were queues right down the freeway to take a look. The police had to block roads and divert drivers into a shopping centre car park where they were put on shuttle buses back to the canyon. I met a couple who travelled more than 400 miles (650 km from Utah. The crowds rivalled Disneyland, one reporter exclaimed. The portaloos overflowed and the fleet of ice cream vans was selling out fast as finally the sun shone and things began to warm up.
The orange coated hillsides were quickly covered in people desperate to capture this curious event, posing for pictures of themselves rolling amongst the poppies. Eventually the authorities had to restrict access as the crowds grew unmanageable and the flowers were getting damaged. And the tourists weren't the only ones flocking. Millions of butterflies have been migrating through the state.

Numbers of the Painted Lady butterflies hit an all-time low last year but now they're back, fluttering streams of brown and orange, skipping on the breeze over the hills and through the suburbs of LA.
Image copyrightGetty Images
Like the poppies, the butterflies might feel like a sign the dry times are over. But no-one's under any illusions here. This state still faces massive issues with water conservation, the drought risk and the threat of more deadly wildfires. 
And as I write this it's started raining again. The rumble of thunder has been a familiar sound here so far this year. It may not be what I'd hoped for but it has done something to redress nature's delicate balance.

Three months ago, eight people disappeared on a flight deep in the Amazon. Small planes are often the only way to get around - but because most landing strips are unofficial, pilots have to lie about where they are flying. And this means that when planes go missing, it can be unclear where to look for them.

Rachel Reeves,"A major storm will track close enough to the East Coast of the United States to bring snow to some areas and windy conditions to much of the Atlantic Seaboard later this week. The storm will have both direct and indirect impacts from Florida to Maine and Atlantic Canada. Arctic air will remain in place and will spread southward into Florida as the storm brews a few hundred miles offshore over the Atlantic Ocean and races northward on Wednesday and Thursday. During this period, the storm may undergo rapid strengthening, sometimes referred to as bombogenesis. At this time AccuWeather meteorologists believe the heaviest snow from the storm will fall on Maine and New Brunswick, Canada, where a blizzard is forecast to unfold.

REUTERS/Brandon Wade A blizzard is a storm that produces snow or blowing snow with winds in excess of 35 mph and a visibility of one-quarter of a mile or less for at least three consecutive hours. There is the potential for not only a foot (30 cm) or more of snow to fall, in Maine and New Brunswick, but also the risk of hurricane-force winds and frigid air at the same time. Tremendous blowing and drifting snow is likely and some communities may be isolated for several days in the wake of the storm. Some of these same communities may be without power. The storm is likely to track close enough to the coast to throw some moisture over land in the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast states. That moisture will be in the form of snow to some areas of the Atlantic coast from the northeastern corner of Florida to the coastal areas of the Carolinas and Massachusetts. Whether a few flakes or several inches of snow fall will depend on the exact track of the storm and how quickly moisture is thrown westward as the storm strengthens. There is a chance of enough snow to make roads slippery in Wilmington, North Carolina; Atlantic City, New Jersey; New York City and Boston. A significant amount of wind-driven snow may fall on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Even if the heaviest snow slides to the east, the combination of wind and lesser snowfall is likely to bring blizzard conditions at times to central New England. If the storm tracks within 100 miles of the coast, a blizzard and major travel disruptions may occur over the Interstate 95 corridor of the mid-Atlantic.

Rick Callahan / AP,"(INDIANAPOLIS) — Fifty-three members of an Indiana family who lost nine relatives when a duck boat sank in Missouri described their pain and unfathomable loss Tuesday while calling for a ban on the amphibious tourist boats that their attorney likened to “coffins and death traps.” Each member of the extended Coleman family, including in-laws, introduced themselves and described who they had lost during a tear-filled news conference hours after their attorneys filed a second federal lawsuit against the owners and operators of the duck boat that capsized and sank during a storm July 19. The disaster on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri, killed 17 people, including nine of 11 Coleman family members who boarded the boat during a vacation trip. The other people killed were from Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri. The second suit was filed on behalf of the estates of Angela Coleman, 45, and Belinda Coleman, 69. The complaint, which seeks unspecified damages, echoes arguments made in a lawsuit filed Sunday seeking $100 million on behalf of the estates of 76-year-old Ervin Coleman and 2-year-old Maxwell Ly. Belinda Coleman’s sister, Lisa D. Berry, tearfully recalled each of the lost members of her family, saying that “everyone who lost their lives, they do have a face.” She said the family is united in their belief that duck boats are dangerous and that they should be banned so that no other family endures the grief she and her relatives now face. “The duck boat industry doesn’t seem to consider that lives are at stake, and it’s more than a ticket,” she said. “It’s people’s children, their moms, their dads, their grandparents and we just want them to be held accountable.” Both lawsuits name Ripley Entertainment Inc., Ride the Ducks International, Ride the Ducks of Branson, the Herschend Family Entertainment Corp., and Amphibious Vehicle Manufacturing. They allege that the owners and operators of the Ride the Ducks boat put profits over people’s safety when they decided to put the boat on a lake despite severe weather warnings and design problems. Ripley spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala-Potts said Tuesday that the company remains “deeply saddened” by the accident. She said the company would not comment further because a National Transportation Safety Board investigation is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney for the Indianapolis-area family, said additional lawsuits are expected on behalf of other members of the Coleman and Rose families who died. He said duck boats’ canopies trap people when the boats sink and the duck boat industry was warned about that hazard more than a decade and a half ago. “They are coffins and death traps and rather than doing anything about it they continued to just sell more tickets,” Mongeluzzi said. “And this family has paid for that ticket with precious life and blood, and enough is enough.” Mongeluzzi said that despite their call for a ban, the family supports legislation introduced Tuesday by Missouri U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill that would require that duck boats be better equipped to stay afloat or that canopies are removed to allow passengers to escape. McCaskill’s legislation would enshrine recommendations made by federal regulators after another duck boat sank in Arkansas in 1999, killing 13 people. The Indiana family’s suits allege that the companies ignored warnings from the National Transportation Safety Board in 2000 that the vehicles, which are designed to operate on land and water, should be upgraded to ensure they remain upright and floating in bad weather. The federal agency’s recommendation was issued after an Arkansas duck boat sank in 1999, killing 13 people. The two federal suits say that 42 deaths have been associated with duck boats since 1999. Kyrie Rose, a 41-year-old Coleman cousin, described during Tuesday’s news conference the fear, uncertainty and ultimate horror after she received a telephone call alerting her that the duck boat her relatives were on sank during a storm. “There’s nothing like getting a call that you wouldn’t expect to hear that there’s been an accident, and hoping and praying all day that somebody, anybody’s going to be OK,” she said.","The disaster on Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri, killed 17 people",2018-08-01T02:30:39Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘Coffins and Death Traps.’ Relatives of Duck Boat Tragedy Victims Call for a Ban,http://time.com/5354727/duck-boat-family-lawsuit/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/800-15.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Lake Storm,1
Max Golembo,"A new storm system is about to slam California with heavy rain and heavy snow. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Numerous flash flood watches have been posted for burn scar areas in the northern part of the state all the way to just outside of Los Angeles and San Diego. A winter storm warning has been issued for the Sierra Nevada mountain range for multiple feet of snow. A high wind warning has also been issued for coastal California, including the San Francisco Bay area. Flash flood watches are in place in Northern California due to heavy rain on the way Wednesday. The heaviest rain will arrive in San Francisco down to Santa Barbara on Wednesday night around midnight local time. Flash flooding and mudslides, especially in those areas scorched by wildfires, are the biggest threat. Rain will stretch from San Francisco to Santa Barbara late Wednesday into Thursday. Heavy rain will continue in the coastal mountains of Southern California into Thursday evening. Flash flooding is expected there, especially in the recent burn scar areas resulting from the Woolsey Fire. Heavy snow will spread into the Rockies on Thursday afternoon with rain possible in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada. Over the next 48 hours, some areas in southern and central California could see 2 to 4 inches of rain. More than 30 inches of snow is possible in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Rain totals over 3 inches are possible along the central California coast, while more than 2 feet of snow is possible in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Lake effect snow Numerous winter weather advisories and a winter storm warning continue for the Northeast as a storm system pulls out and lake effect snow continues behind it. Up to 20 inches of snow fell in Vermont on Tuesday, with New Hampshire seeing as much as 16.5 inches and northern New York receiving 16 inches. Snow will fall in northern New England and western and northern New York on Wednesday. As the slow-moving storm system moves out of the Northeast, gusty winds over the Great Lakes will produce more lake effect snow from Pennsylvania to New York. An additional half a foot of snow is possible locally in western New York and into northern New England.

(Photo: John T. Greilick / Detroit News) After a cold system dumped snow across southeast Michigan to start the work week, Metro Detroit residents can expect another round Wednesday that could dump up to 7 inches and complicate commutes. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch from 10 a.m. Wednesday through 1 a.m. Thursday for Midland, Saginaw, Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, St. Clair, Livingston, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, Wayne, Lenawee and Monroe counties. The heaviest snow is expected between 3-7 p.m., and visibilities could be low, the weather service predicts. Accumulations of 4-7 inches are possible, mainly between Interstates 69 and 94. “A narrow band of snowfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour may affect a portion of the area during the Wednesday evening commute,” weather service meteorologists said in a statement. The new snowfall come less than 48 hours after the region witnessed some of the heaviest so far this season. Between late Monday and early Tuesday, totals reported to the weather service included 5.8 inches in Ann Arbor; 4.9 in Berkley; 4.7 in Farmington Hills; 4.5 in Milford and Eastpointe; 4.4 in Garden City; 4 in Romulus, Brighton and Dearborn; and 3.1 in Roseville. The conditions are believed to have contributed to at least one death. A 49-year-old Royal Oak man with a history of health issues died early Tuesday after reportedly clearing snow from his driveway, police said in a statement. “Residents are reminded that snow removal is considered a strenuous activity and those with health concerns should be mindful when shoveling snow or seek assistance,” the release read. In Ferndale, leaders have declared a snow emergency starting early Wednesday. After dropping in the low teens with wind chills near zero, the weather service forecasts temperatures topping out in the 20s on Wednesday, about 10 degrees below normal, records show. Similar conditions are expected through Friday, resulting from “an extended period of north winds bringing the air mass straight out of the Arctic into the Great Lakes,” said Cory Behnke, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service station in White Lake Township. “This is typical winter weather that we see in December across southeast Michigan.” Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2nSMVO9","The Detroit News Snow promises tough commute in SE Mich. on Wednesday The Detroit News After a cold system dumped snow across southeast Michigan to start the work week, Metro Detroit residents can expect another round Wednesday that could dump up to 7 inches …",2017-12-13T01:13:29Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Detroitnews.com'}",Snow promises tough commute in SE Mich. on Wednesday - The Detroit News,http://www.detroitnews.com/story/weather/2017/12/12/winter-storm-watch/108553182/,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41fe6ae09d21e093032327224add51a841a440cc/c=0-219-4256-2613&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2017/12/12/DetroitNews/B99608569Z.1_20171212205351_000_G6T1PFFKS.1-0.jpg,,Detroitnews.com,Lake Storm,1
Diane Pathieu,"Snow blanketed the Chicago area Monday, making roads a mess for the morning commute. The light snow began falling Sunday night across the Chicago area. At about 9 a.m., snow became less widespread, but snow will continue to fall on and off through the afternoon. Areas near Lake Michigan and in northwest Indiana could see lake effect snow Monday night and Tuesday morning. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for the Chicago area until noon, with southeast Wisconsin under a Winter Storm Warning, which expires at noon on Tuesday. CLICK HERE FOR WEATHER ALERTS By early Monday, many areas of the Chicago area have already seen several inches of snow. As of 7 a.m., 1.8 inches of snow had fallen at O'Hare and 1.9 inches of snow at Midway. Aurora had received 5 inches of snow, Elgin had 4.5 inches of snow,, Downers Grove received 4.6 inches of snow, Plainfield had 4 inches of snow and Oak Lawn 2.5 inches of snow. CLICK HERE FOR REAL TIME VIEW OF CHICAGO""S SNOW FLEET The Illinois Department of Transportation has its full plow operation with 400 trucks working during the morning rush. By 11 a.m. The f Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation said it had transitioned its fleet of snow plows to begin clearing residential streets after clearing the main arterial streets. The ABC7 Stormtracker checked condition on I-55 near Bolingbrook, where cars were traveling well below the speed limit and slippery conditions causing several cars do end up in a ditch. The snow caused several crashes, including one where a car hit a wall on the Dan Ryan Expressway at 47th Street that police say was speed related. The expressways got a lot of attention from snow plows Monday morning, but some of the side streets could use a little love. Yvette McGee had to get creative Monday morning clearing off her car. ""I'm 4'11'' so I have to stretch. I live by myself and I'm a female,"" she said. She spent the extra effort cleaning every last inch of her car and found that her trusty broom did the trick. ""I don't want no one driving behind me and that snow blowing on their cars and it might hit someone,"" she said. McGee's side street in University Village hasn't seen a plow yet. ""We're going to keep going 'til it's done,"" said Chris Curran, snow plow driver with Jif Paving. Curran said they will get there eventually. He has been driving since 10 p.m. Sunday and expects to work well into the afternoon. ""The conditions were dismal and getting worse, but I went out and I've continued to plug along,"" Curran said. Residents also found themselves searching for the heavy duty shovels. Randy Napier was shoveling in front of his company's storefront. ""When you shovel the heavy stuff off, throw some salt down, it's done,"" he said. And Diana Dumitru didn't mind clearing off a path in front of her house in University Village. ""It's not too bad. I have a small stretch so, it's okay,"" Dumitru said. Down the block, dogs Chewy and Luke enjoyed themselves, too. ""Sometimes they find a hole and then they get totally covered which is funny,"" said Chris Phillips. But their mom is watching out for the first sign of shivers. ""We've been out for ten minutes, that's plenty,"" Chris said. At the city's airports as of 9:08 a.m., O'Hare has had 85 flight cancellations and average delays of 18 minutes, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation.

Associated Press,"(MINNEAPOLIS) — Post-holiday travelers were finding driving difficult as a winter storm dumped heavy snow and whipped up gusty winds across parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota on Thursday.
Up to 11 inches (28 centimeters) of snow had fallen in the Moorhead-Alexandria area of western Minnesota by mid-afternoon Thursday, and it was still snowing, said meteorologist Tyler Hasenstein of the Twin Cities National Weather Service.
The line of snow ended just northwest of the Twin Cities around Elk River, Hasenstein said. The snowfall peaked around 3 inches (8 centimeters) at the Minneapolis airport, then rain starting early Thursday melted the snowpack.
Officials in North Dakota issued a no-travel advisory for the eastern part of the state due to icy roads and reduced visibility. Blustery winds were causing blizzard conditions in Jamestown, North Dakota, and in northern South Dakota, where transportation officials reported visibility was down to a quarter-mile along a stretch of Highway 10.
Bus service for Fargo, North Dakota, and neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, was suspended Thursday afternoon because of worsening road conditions. Service is expected to resume Friday with a normal schedule.
The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for central South Dakota, eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota. The storm was expected to drop more than a foot of snow in the region before ending Friday.
The Minnesota State Patrol tweeted that road conditions are poor across much of western Minnesota. Transportation officials said road conditions across much of the central and northern areas of the state are completely covered with ice and snow, with windy conditions causing even more travel issues. The Minnesota Department of Transportation said it might be better to wait for conditions to improve if travel isn’t necessary.
The weather service said an estimated 18 inches of snow had fallen by early Thursday afternoon near Finland on Minnesota’s North Shore.
The North Dakota Highway Patrol issued a travel alert for parts of North Dakota including Bismarck and Devils Lake due to whiteout conditions. Eastern North Dakota was expected to deal with winds gusting up to 50 mph, creating blizzard conditions mainly in the Red River Valley.
University campuses, courthouses and municipal buildings across North Dakota are among the places closed on Thursday, including the University of North Dakota campus in Grand Forks.

MARC TRACY,"The interesting question about perhaps the greatest college football coach ever is why he keeps subjecting himself to all this. He has nothing left to prove. He did not before Monday night, and he certainly does not after. No. 4 Alabama sneaked into this College Football Playoff, beat defending champion Clemson — avenging last year’s title game loss — and then, against Georgia, endured a first-half shutout before engineering a magnificent comeback that will be remembered for a single master stroke. In the third quarter, Saban boldly benched starting quarterback Jalen Hurts for a true freshman back-up, Tua Tagovailoa. If the reason he stays is adherence to to his famous Process, which emphasizes doing things the right way over results. Winning games and championships cannot serve as a salve. As Saban said a few years ago, “We don’t try to focus as much on the outcomes as we do on being all that you can be.” At its worst, this philosophy is nihilism. It once reportedly led Saban to complain that a national championship game had “cost me a week of recruiting” — as though the point of recruiting was not to win national championships. At its best, the philosophy coexists uneasily with gratifying results. “It’s not just about winning the championship,” he said after Monday’s game, his voice firmly returned to the monotone. “”There’s more to it than that.” Associate Head Coach Burton Burns, an assistant during Saban’s entire Alabama tenure, had a subtler, more persuasive parsing of the Process. Photo Saban at the start of the third quarter on Monday night. Credit Streeter Lecka/Getty Images Defining Saban as “a competitor” rather than a winner, Burns said, “If you compete, the other thing is going to happen.” Still, Monday night seemed like the worst of competition, competition as a form of addiction, which can be a form of agony. It was more agonizing for Georgia and its fans, of course, but they had no choice; Saban does. The Crimson Tide had 94 yards and zero first downs in the first half. Saban replaced Hurts with Tagovailoa, inviting armchair coaches over for some sweet tea Tuesday morning. Then Alabama improbably came back somehow in a hostile stadium teeming with Georgians, outscoring the Bulldogs by 20-7 in the second half. But it was hardly preordained or without its agonizing moments. A Tagovailoa interception resulted from the rookie trying to pass when the play-call had been to rush. (Teenagers!!!) Poor clock management nearly scuttled an attempt at a game-winning field goal. Then, at the entrance to the Holy Gates, with a kick to win the game with three seconds left in regulation, Alabama kicker Andy Pappanastos somehow missed a 36-yard chip shot. The penultimate play was a 16-yard sack so frustratingly needless that Saban threw a tantrum. Then came the payoff — the virtuosic 41-yard bomb to win the championship. Is Saban in as much pain as he appears? “Well, it is hard,” he acknowledged afterward. Saban lost last year’s national title game to a much younger protégé, Clemson’s Dabo Swinney. Monday night he faced the prospect of losing this one to a much younger protégé, Georgia’s Kirby Smart, Saban’s former defensive coordinator. Next year he faces the prospect of losing future games to a much younger protégé, defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, who, as Tennessee’s head coach, will helm a potential power that Alabama plays every season. Yet this dude abides. Saban said it is to keep teaching his players. “The message to the team tonight after this game was, I hope you take something from this game and the resiliency that you showed in this game and it helps you be more successful in life,” he said. Hurts will have to find another lesson in the experience, but that’s a separate matter. This philosophy — of football, of life — can seem like a low-fat version of Buddhism. It also recalls Existentialism in a more hopeful variant. The French Existentialist philosopher Albert Camus wrote of Sisyphus, the figure of Greek myth condemned to roll a boulder up a mountain only to have it roll back down, at which point Sisyphus renews the endeavor, forever, that there is absurdity in the task but also, maybe, joy: “The absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be unceasing,” Camus wrote, noting, “The rock is still rolling.” (Camus would doubtlessly have said the same of the Tide.) Sisyphus has a task. He does it, with unimaginable “resiliency.” Camus concluded: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” One must also imagine Saban happy, without even counting the six times he has rolled the boulder up the mountain and it has stayed put. (Not to mention the multimillion-dollar salary and the sweet Georgia lake house.) He focuses his energies monomaniacally on doing the thing at which he is the best in the world. If the downside is that he does not get to do it forever or that it has its brutally frustrating moments filled with heartache, well, life is absurd that way. “The eye of the storm is the calmest place,” said Karl Dunbar, who was on his first Saban staff nearly 20 years ago and is Alabama’s defensive line coach. “You don’t listen to the periphery. You just stay in there and do your job.” “We’re in the eye of the storm right now,” Dunbar added. “I hope it lasts for another five years.” Continue reading the main story","Nick Saban may scowl, even through another national championship, but he’s got it made.",2018-01-09T12:47:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On College Football: Why Nick Saban Is the Ultimate Masochist,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/sports/alabama-nick-saban.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/sports/10sabanWEB1/10sabanWEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Lake Storm,1
James Rogers,"A shipwreck discovered in Lake Erie in 2015 may be the oldest found in the famous lake, experts say. The wreck was first spotted on a sonar screen by Tom Kowalczk, a member of the Cleveland Underwater Explorers. Subsequent dives to the ship, which sank in Ohio waters, have provided intriguing new details about the vessel. Researchers have also been trawling through historical records to gain fresh insight into the schooner. Shipwreck hunters spent eight days this summer unearthing and examining the remains of the ship. Experts now believe that the ship is the Lake Serpent, which sank nearly two centuries ago. MYSTERIOUS SHIPWRECK DISCOVERED IN GREAT LAKES BELIEVED TO BE NEARLY 200 YEARS OLD Built in Cleveland in 1821, the Lake Serpent carried cargo for 8 years until its sinking in late September or early October 1829. It's not clear what caused the ship to sink, though some experts believe it may have been the result of a bad storm. This Tuesday, Sept. 4, 2018, photo provided by Cleveland Underwater Explorers Inc. shows the remains of a shipwreck believed to be the Lake Serpent. (David M VanZandt/Cleveland Underwater Explorers Inc. via AP) That would make the wreckage the oldest ever found in the shallowest of the Great Lakes. Newspaper reports from the time have provided vital clues. On Oct. 8, 1829, the Cleveland Weekly Herald reported that the Lake Serpent had left four weeks earlier to get stone from Put-In-Bay on Lake Erie’s South Bass Island. “The newspaper was able to confirm that the Lake Serpent had loaded the stone at Put-In-Bay, but hadn’t been seen since,” noted the Cleveland Underwater Explorers on their website. EXPLORERS FIND 2ND-OLDEST CONFIRMED SHIPWRECK IN GREAT LAKES There is, however, some debate among the marine archaeologists and shipwreck hunters who are trying to identify the wreck about how confident they are it is indeed the Lake Serpent. Nonetheless, the National Museum of the Great Lakes recently released the results of its research into the shipwreck. There are several signs to suggest that it is the missing schooner, they say. Divers determined the wreck's size and stone cargo point to it being Lake Serpent, and they uncovered what appears to be a carving at the ship's bow, the museum said. Historical records show the Lake Serpent had a serpent's head carved near the front — an unusual feature for a vessel of that era. The site also seems to be near where the Lake Serpent was thought to go down near Kelleys Island off the Ohio shoreline. EXPLORERS FIND 119-YEAR-OLD SHIPWRECK AT THE BOTTOM OF LAKE ERIE Kowalczk said he's pretty confident the wreck is the Lake Serpent because there are enough findings that line up. ""We haven't found anything that says it's something different,"" he said. It was reported that the bodies of the Lake Serpent’s captain and his brother, Ezra and Robert Wright, washed ashore in Lorain County, Ohio in the first week of October 1829. Lake Erie is a graveyard for hundreds of vessels taken down by violent storms that can whip up in a hurry. Many have been found in recent years by a small, dedicated band from the museum and the Cleveland Underwater Explorers club. WRECK OF WWII SHIP DISCOVERED 74 YEARS AFTER IT DISAPPEARED DURING A RESCUE MISSION The Great Lakes continue to reveal their shipwreck secrets. Earlier this year, for example, experts announced the discovery of the 119-year-old shipwreck Margaret Olwill at the bottom of Lake Erie. The wooden steam barge sank during an 1899 nor’easter. In May 2008, two explorers discovered the British warship HMS Ontario, which was lost in Lake Ontario in 1780. The Ontario is the oldest shipwreck ever found in the Great Lakes and the only British warship of this period still in existence in the world. Later that year, the explorers - Jim Kennard and Dan Scoville, also discovered a rare 19th-century schooner sitting upright 500 feet under the waves of Lake Ontario. In 2016, Kennard was also part of a team of underwater explorers that discovered the second-oldest confirmed shipwreck in the Great Lakes. The Washington, an American-built, Canadian-owned sloop sank in Lake Ontario during a fierce storm in 1803. Fox News' Robert Gearty and The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Lucy Yang,"A winter storm that has been sweeping across the midwestern US since Saturday will continue to bring blizzard conditions and strong winds across the upper Midwest on Sunday, according to meteorologists at The Weather Channel. 
 The storm is expected to spread to parts of northern New England on Monday, bringing snow and freezing rain as gusty winds develop in the eastern Great Lakes, meteorologists said. 
 Sunday afternoon, wind gusts of up to 70 miles per hour were reported in northern Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. Strong wind gusts upwards of 40 miles per hour have also been forecasted for parts of the Midwest and Northeast until Monday night. 
 At the time of writing, hundreds of thousands of people are without power in parts of the Midwest and along the East Coast, with over 150,800 of those reported outages in Ohio alone, according to PowerOutage.US. 
 As of Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings for northeastern North and South Dakota, northwestern and southern Minnesota, northern and central Iowa, northern Michigan, and northern Wisconsin.

 Blizzard warnings have also been issued for parts of upstate New York east of Lake Ontario, including the cities, Oswego, Watertown, Lowville, Rome, Utica, and Boonville. 
 Travel is strongly discouraged in all of these areas, according to the National Weather Service. 
 According to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski, severe weather conditions caused by the storm can result in tree damage, power outages, flight delays due to strong crosswinds, difficulty driving, and more. 
 On Saturday night, for example, strong wind gusts toppled over trees and caused tens of thousands of power outages in St. Louis, Missouri, Sosnowski reported. Sunday morning, similarly strong winds blew over a semi-truck along Interstate 69 near Indianapolis, Indiana. 
 Senator Kamala Harris, who is visiting Iowa this weekend as part of her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, also canceled a meet-and-greet and worship event at Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church in Waterloo, Iowa, on Sunday morning due to weather conditions, KWWL reported. 
 On Twitter, many people have shared photos and videos of the heavy snowfall and winds in areas affected by the storm.","Summary A winter storm that has been sweeping across the midwestern US since Saturday will continue to bring blizzard conditions and strong winds across the upper Midwest on Sunday, according to meteorologists at The Weather Channel.

Daniel Manzo,"A storm brought heavy rain and some snow to parts of the Northeast on Friday. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Meanwhile, colder air is bringing some snow to parts of the interior Northeast with snowfall reports of 3 to 4 inches in some of the elevated areas north and west of Albany, New York. As the storm departs Saturday morning, winds will strengthen behind it and move toward the Northeast. Winds could be particular gusty in parts of New York and New England, up to 50 mph in northern New York and Massachusetts, including Boston and Cape Cod. As much as half a foot of snow could fall along northeast Lake Erie due to lake effect snow over the weekend. The strong winds moving over the relatively warm Great Lakes are bringing lake effect snow to parts of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Saturday morning. Most accumulation should remain rather light. However, the heaviest snow bands are expected in northwest Pennsylvania and extreme southwest New York. Locally, 6 inches or more could fall in a region from Erie, Pennsylvania, to the southern suburbs of Buffalo, New York. Ongoing lake effect snow squalls could cause drastic drops in visibility, with gusty winds of 30 to 40 mph. Behind these storms is a blast of cold air. It will feel like winter across the central U.S., and into parts of the Northeast. Wind chills will be in the single digits for parts of the upper Midwest Saturday morning, including Chicago, with a wind chill of 9 degrees. Wind chill readings are in the single digits and teens across much of the central U.S. on Saturday morning. Some of this cold air expands into the Northeast on Sunday morning with wind chills in the 20s for the major I-95 cities, and in the teens for the interior Northeast. And another cold blast looks to be in the forecast in the upcoming week. The cold blast will move into the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday morning.",It will be a chilly weekend in the Northeast.,2018-11-10T13:30:24Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Lake effect snow, cold blast moves in Midwest, Northeast",https://abcnews.go.com/US/lake-effect-snow-cold-blast-moves-midwest-northeast/story?id=59102831,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/chicago-snow-wls-mo-20181110_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Lake Storm,1
"By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press","NEW YORK (AP) — About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place. Jaw-clenching temperatures to start the weekend throughout the Northeast hit Burlington, Vermont, at minus 1 and a wind chill of minus 30. Both Philadelphia and New York were shivering at 8 degrees. And in Hartford, Connecticut, a brutal cold of 10 degrees yielded a wind chill of minus 20. On Saturday, winds of more than 90 mph swirled Mount Washington, the Northeast's highest peak, at a temperature of minus 37 degrees and a wind chill of minus 93. It tied for second place with Armstrong, Ontario, as the coldest spot in the world. Boston, at a relatively balmy 11 degrees, was wrangling with a different kind of challenge: a shortage of plumbers as the weather wreaked havoc on pipes that froze and cracked, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh reported. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-10', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 10', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-15', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 15', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-20', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 20', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-25', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 25', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-30', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 30', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-35', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 35', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-40', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 40', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-45', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 45', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-50', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 50', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-55', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 55', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-60', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 60', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-64', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 64', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); George, who is homeless, pauses in a church alcove, on the streets of Boston as snow falls from a massive winter storm on January 4, 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Residents of Boston and its suburbs were cleaning up Saturday after the tide that came in Thursday, flooding streets and forcing some residents to be evacuate as the water started to freeze. In New Jersey, many people stayed home instead of dealing with single-digit temperatures. Others were cleaning up from the storm that dropped more than a foot of snow in some spots earlier in the week. ""My car felt like an icebox this morning, even though I had the heat on full blast,"" Julie Williams said as she sipped coffee inside a Jackson Township convenience store. She was headed to work at a local supermarket, and was expecting it to be packed. ""People think it's nuts before a storm happens, with everyone getting milk, bread, etc."" she said, adding with a laugh, ""but it's even worse in the days afterward, because they do the same thing but they're a little crazy from cabin fever."" The operators of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were struggling to recoup from Thursday's storm. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said it was working with airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to limit flights into Kennedy on Saturday ""until there are adequate gates available to handle the backlog of flights due to recovery of flight schedules in the wake of Thursday's storm."" In Rhode Island, hospitals were treating dozens of storm-related injuries as the region grits through a deep freeze that followed a powerful blizzard. In Providence and Newport, at least 40 people were treated for various weather-related conditions, from heart attacks, snowblower or shoveling injuries, frostbite and more, according to The Providence Journal. The storm dropped more than 14 inches of snow on Providence. Monday is expected to be the first day above freezing since last month. In New York City, temperatures should reach 40 degrees next week. Even more southern locations didn't escape the cold; the mercury dipped into the single digits in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., during the weekend, about 20 degrees below normal for this time of year. The high winds and frigid temperatures prompted several ski resorts to close some of their lifts. Bolton Valley in Vermont said there was a general ""lack of demand and enthusiasm from skiers and riders."" With a temperature of minus 14 at the summit and minus 11 at the base, the resort cancelled evening skiing due to a frostbite warning. In Vermont's capital city of Montpelier, with the temperature at minus 5 Saturday, business was slow at La Brioche Bakery but soups were a big seller, said bakery clerk Caroline Cunningham. ""Nobody wants to be outside,"" she said. The key strategy for most East Coast residents was to wear layered clothing. Brooklyn resident Zelani Miah, who was walking home from running errands Saturday morning, said he wore lots of them. ""Right now, the only thing I put on was just some gloves, a couple sweaters of course, like five or six of them, and two pants basically and boots,"" Miah said. ""Keep warm, make sure you wear hats.""","NEW YORK (AP) - About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place.

"By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press","NEW YORK (AP) — About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place. Jaw-clenching temperatures to start the weekend throughout the Northeast hit Burlington, Vermont, at minus 1 and a wind chill of minus 30. Both Philadelphia and New York were shivering at 8 degrees. And in Hartford, Connecticut, a brutal cold of 10 degrees yielded a wind chill of minus 20. On Saturday, winds of more than 90 mph swirled Mount Washington, the Northeast's highest peak, at a temperature of minus 37 degrees and a wind chill of minus 93. It tied for second place with Armstrong, Ontario, as the coldest spot in the world. Boston, at a relatively balmy 11 degrees, was wrangling with a different kind of challenge: a shortage of plumbers as the weather wreaked havoc on pipes that froze and cracked, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh reported. A 3-foot tidal surge brought on by the nor'easter along the Massachusetts coast was the highest recorded in nearly a century. Residents of Boston and its suburbs were cleaning up Saturday after the tide that came in Thursday, flooding streets and forcing some residents to be evacuate as the water started to freeze. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-10', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 10', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-15', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 15', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-20', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 20', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-25', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 25', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-30', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 30', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-35', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 35', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-40', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 40', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-45', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 45', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-50', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 50', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-55', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 55', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-60', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 60', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-64', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 64', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); George, who is homeless, pauses in a church alcove, on the streets of Boston as snow falls from a massive winter storm on January 4, 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Others were cleaning up from the storm that dropped more than a foot of snow in some spots earlier in the week. ""My car felt like an icebox this morning, even though I had the heat on full blast,"" Julie Williams said as she sipped coffee inside a Jackson Township convenience store. She was headed to work at a local supermarket, and was expecting it to be packed. ""People think it's nuts before a storm happens, with everyone getting milk, bread, etc."" she said, adding with a laugh, ""but it's even worse in the days afterward, because they do the same thing but they're a little crazy from cabin fever."" The operators of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were struggling to recoup from Thursday's storm. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said it was working with airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to limit flights into Kennedy on Saturday ""until there are adequate gates available to handle the backlog of flights due to recovery of flight schedules in the wake of Thursday's storm."" In Rhode Island, hospitals were treating dozens of storm-related injuries as the region grits through a deep freeze that followed a powerful blizzard. In Providence and Newport, at least 40 people were treated for various weather-related conditions, from heart attacks, snowblower or shoveling injuries, frostbite and more, according to The Providence Journal. The storm dropped more than 14 inches of snow on Providence. Monday is expected to be the first day above freezing since last month. In New York City, temperatures should reach 40 degrees next week. Even more southern locations didn't escape the cold; the mercury dipped into the single digits in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., during the weekend, about 20 degrees below normal for this time of year. The high winds and frigid temperatures prompted several ski resorts to close some of their lifts. Bolton Valley in Vermont said there was a general ""lack of demand and enthusiasm from skiers and riders."" With a temperature of minus 14 at the summit and minus 11 at the base, the resort cancelled evening skiing due to a frostbite warning. In Vermont's capital city of Montpelier, with the temperature at minus 5 Saturday, business was slow at La Brioche Bakery but soups were a big seller, said bakery clerk Caroline Cunningham. ""Nobody wants to be outside,"" she said. The key strategy for most East Coast residents was to wear layered clothing. Brooklyn resident Zelani Miah, who was walking home from running errands Saturday morning, said he wore lots of them. ""Right now, the only thing I put on was just some gloves, a couple sweaters of course, like five or six of them, and two pants basically and boots,"" Miah said. ""Keep warm, make sure you wear hats.""","NEW YORK (AP) - About 100 million people faced a new challenge after the whopping East Coast snowstorm: a gusty deep freeze, topped Saturday by a wind chill close to minus 100 on New Hampshire's Mount Washington that vied for world's coldest place.

Camila Domonoske,"Record cold temperatures are gripping much of the U.S., including sub-zero temperatures in Chicago on Tuesday. Scott Olson/Getty Images Cold enough for ya? From the Midwest to the East Coast, the chilly wintertime temperatures are a hot topic of conversation. Yes, it's cold. And it's going to be getting colder — a winter storm is moving from Florida up toward Maine, bringing freezing precipitation and even chillier temperatures. Meanwhile, have we mentioned that it's cold? Yes, it's winter. But no, people are not going to stop talking about how cold it is. If you're tired of comparing your glove effectiveness to that of your coworkers — or you live in a balmy climate and want to feel superior — try these facts on for size: It's colder in South Dakota than it is at the South Pole. Granted, it is summertime in Antarctica. Still, this morning it was minus 3 Fahrenheit at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole weather station. At Lake City, S.D., it's about minus 7. It was snowing in Tallahassee this morning. It's colder in Jacksonville, Fla., than it is in Juneau, Alaska. Juneau has a relatively mild climate for Alaska — the average high temperature is just a pinch north of freezing, even in January. Right now, it's a cozy 40 degrees. Jacksonville, meanwhile, is 34 degrees and raining. It was cold enough in Mississippi yesterday for boiling water to instantly evaporate. How cold is it outside this morning in Jackson? Well, it was cold enough for us to toss boiling water into the air and observe most of it evaporate instantaneous creating a cloud. The temperature was 14 degrees with a dew point of 4 degrees. pic.twitter.com/W8jTR7H0Gn — NWS Jackson MS (@NWSJacksonMS) January 2, 2018 It's colder in Angel's Landing, Utah, than in Hell, Norway. The weather at Angel's Landing in Zion Park isn't actually heavenly at all — in the winter, the trail is iced over, and in the summer it can get toasty, more than 100 degrees. Anyway, on one point on Wednesday it was 27 degrees at the Utah trail, and 28 degrees and sunny in Hell. Chicago might be about to tie a record — not for the chilliest weather, but for the longest cold snap. It's been colder in Chicago before. In January 1985, thanks to a polar vortex, the city measured 27 degrees below zero. But it's not just the cold that's getting residents down — it's the relentlessness of it. Since Christmas Day, The Chicago Tribune reports, Chicago hasn't seen a single day warmer than 20 degrees: ""If temperatures don't go above 20 degrees by Saturday — and forecasters don't expect that they will — Chicago will tie a record for 12 consecutive days below 20 degrees. The only other times that has happened were in 1936 and 1895."" Oklahoma City is nowhere near setting a record like that. For some reason, the National Weather Service just wants to make sure you know that. In Florida, citrus and strawberry farmers are covering their plants in ice — to keep them warm. It's standard practice when temperatures start to hover around freezing, according to The Associated Press and The Ledger. As long as the fruit stays at least 28 degrees, it can escape cold weather without harm — and water freezes at 32 degrees. As it freezes, it releases heat that helps protect the plants as well. You can learn more about this strategy from Cornell University. Last year was actually one of the warmest on record. Cast your mind way, way, way back to, oh, about four weeks ago. Remember 2017? Like, before December? NASA found that the 12 months from December 2016 to November 2017 were the second-warmest on record — second only to the 12 months before that, which had a boost from El Niño. On a more serious note — unusually cold weather can have dangerous or deadly consequences. Roads have iced over, making driving perilous in regions from Texas to Georgia, the AP reports, and the storm traveling up the East Coast is expected to make conditions far worse. Victoria Hansen of South Carolina Public Radio tells our newscast unit that bridges and roads are shutting down. ""A transportation official was giving interviews from home, saying he too would rather stay off the roads,"" she reports. ""In other parts of the U.S., dangerously cold temperatures have been blamed for at least a dozen deaths as well as freezing a water tower in Iowa and halting ferry service in New York,"" the AP writes. ""Forecasters warned of frost bite and hypothermia in Chicago, where wind chills of minus 35 degrees...were predicted. Atlanta hospitals reported a surge in emergency room visits for hypothermia and other ailments as temperatures plunge well below freezing."" Cold weather shelters have been opened across the South and local officials and organizations are trying to get as many homeless people safely indoors as possible.","As the East Coast braces for a winter storm, yes, it's rather chilly. It's colder in South Dakota than it is at the South Pole. It's colder in Jacksonville, Fla., than in Juneau, Alaska.",2018-01-03T17:29:16Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Here Are Your Cold Weather Conversation Starters For Today,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/03/575291371/here-are-your-cold-weather-conversation-starters-for-today,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/03/gettyimages-900529862_wide-46e4751b28724ad34656878e7c8045bb835b2387.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Lake Storm,1

Developing now, Monday, March 26, 2018 In an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" porn star Stormy Daniels said she agreed to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Trump after she was threatened in a parking lot The turnout for Saturday's ""March for Our Lives"" protest in Washington, D.C. was much lower than organizers claimed, an imaging company says Incoming national security adviser John Bolton defends himself over questions about a 2013 speech he gave to a Russian pro-gun rights group with ties to Putin Gun maker Remington files for bankruptcy is the wake of faltering sales and lawsuits from the Sandy Hook school shooting Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg took out full-page ads over the weekend apologizing for the Cambridge Analytica scandal THE LEAD STORY - STORM CLOUDS: Adult film star Stormy Daniels claimed she agreed to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Trump after she received a threat in a parking lot and worried that her infant daughter would be harmed, according to a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday... Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she was threatened by a man who approached her in Las Vegas after she sold her story about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump during the American Celebrity Golf Tournament in Lake Tahoe. ""I was in a parking lot going to a fitness class with my infant daughter and a guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,’” she said. “And he leaned round and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It would be a shame if something happened to her mom.’” Trump has strongly denied Daniels's claims of an affair. InTouch magazine initially bought her story for $15,000 but opted to kill it after Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened to sue the publication. BLOATED MARCH NUMBERS?: Organizers of the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. claimed Sunday that some 850,000 people attended the pro-gun control event, but an imaging company said the turnout was much less... Virginia-based Digital Design &amp; Imaging Service Inc., which uses aerial photos to calculate crowd sizes, reported the event’s peak crowd size was at 202,796 people around 1 p.m., CBS News reported. The firm said the number's margin of error is 15 percent. The January 2017 Women's March turnout in Washington, for comparison, was estimated at 440,000 people. RUSSIA OBSESSION ENSNARES BOLTON: Incoming national security adviser John Bolton defended himself Sunday after Hillary Clinton's former vice presidential running mate questioned whether he would be able to obtain the necessary security clearance over a video speech given to a Russian pro-gun rights group in 2013... On Saturday, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., tweeted out a National Public Radio report about the group Bolton spoke to, known as The Right To Bear Arms. The NPR report described one of the group's founders, Alexander Torshin, as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than 10 years. On Sunday, a spokesman for Bolton responded: ""The Ambassador [Bolton] was asked by former [National Rifle Association] president Dave Keene to record a video for presentation to the upper house of the Russian parliament, the Federation Council. The Ambassador has never heard of The Right to Bear Arms until recent news coverage of the group."" REMINGTON OUT OF AMMUNITION?: Firearms manufacturer Remington Outdoor Company has filed for bankruptcy protection in the face of falling sales and lawsuits stemming from the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday night... According to the Journal, Remington announced that it would file for Chapter 11 last month but the actual filing was delayed after the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. that killed 17 people. The paper reported that Remington officials plan to hand over the reins to its creditors in exchange for writing off most of the company's debt. Cerberus Capital Management LP bought Remington for $118 million in 2007, assuming $252 million in debt in the process. FACEBOOK CO-FOUNDER TRIES TO MAKE-UP WITH FRIENDS: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg took out full-page advertisements in major U.S. and British newspapers to apologize for a ""breach of trust"" after it was discovered Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested user data... The ads, which were taken out in papers including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and the U.K.'s The Observer, The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph, featured a signed apology from Zuckerberg and an explanation of what the social media giant was doing to fix the situation. Facebook's privacy practices came under fire after accusations emerged that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm affiliated with President Trump's 2016 campaign, inappropriately obtained data. _____________________________________________________________________________ Consider yourself an Influencer?

Associated Press and Kelly McLaughlin,"A Ride the Ducks boat capsized in Table Rock Lake in Branson, Missouri, on Thursday. Facebook/KOLR More than half of the 17 people killed when a tourist boat sank on a Branson, Missouri, lake were members of the same Indiana family, and they likely wouldn't have been on the ill-fated trip but for a ticket mix-up. One of two survivors of the family, Tia Coleman, told KOLR that she and 10 members of her family had bought tickets for a duck boat tour, but went to the wrong location when it was time to board. Coleman was able to switch the tickets for the 6:30 p.m. ride with Ride The Ducks, and an hour later, she and her 13-year-old nephew were the only family members to survive the capsize in Table Rock Lake. Ahead of Thursday's ride, Colman said that she was told that despite most duck boat tours starting on land, her family's would start in the water due to an incoming storm. She told KOLR: ""Big huge waves, choppy — everybody started getting like hey, this is getting a little bit too much, and then it got really choppy and big swells of water started coming in to the boat. ""Then a really huge wave swept over and when that wave swept over, the last thing I heard my sister-in-law say was 'grab the baby'."" The waves soon took over the boat, and the watercraft started sinking. ""My head pushed up to the top of the water and I lost control, I didn't have anybody with me,"" Coleman said, ""I couldn't see anybody. And I know it wasn't but I felt like I struggled for at least an hour, but it was probably like 10 minutes. And I just remembered I kept sinking, I kept sinking."" Coleman told WXIN that the captain of the boat told the 29 passengers on the duck boat that they wouldn't need life jackets. By the time of the accident, ""it was too late."" Coleman lost her husband, three children, aged 9, 7, and 1, her mother-in-law, father-in-law, her uncle, her sister-in-law, and her sister-in-law's soon-to-be three-year-old in the capsize. Her 13-year-old nephew was the only other survivor in the family. The grief-stricken community in Branson, Missouri, known for its country shows and entertainment, hosted two vigils Friday night. About 300 people gathered in the parking lot of Ride the Ducks of Branson and others mourned at a church, singing ""Amazing Grace"" at both locations. At the rally at the duck boat business, the Rev. Zachary Klein said he had no words of comfort to offer the families of victims ""because there simply are no words to comfort them."" Divers found the final four bodies Friday in Table Rock Lake near Branson after the deadliest accident of its kind in nearly two decades. State and federal investigators were trying to determine what went sent the vessel known as a duck boat to its demise. An initial assessment blamed thunderstorms and winds that approached hurricane strength, but it wasn't clear why the amphibious vehicle even ventured out into the water. Mayor Karen Best said Branson is typically a city ""full of smiles... But today we are grieving and crying."" Officials haven't released names of the victims, but the sad details emerged throughout the day. Among them: A popular duck boat driver, a father and son visiting from Arkansas, and the nine Indiana relatives, many of them children. The risk of heavy weather was apparent hours before the boat left shore. The National Weather Service in Springfield, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Branson, issued a severe thunderstorm watch for its immediate area Thursday, saying conditions were ripe for winds of 70 mph. It followed up at 6:32 p.m. with a severe thunderstorm warning for three counties that included Branson and the lake. The warning mentioned both locations. The boat went down about 40 minutes later, shortly after 7 p.m. ""When we issue a warning, it means take action,"" meteorologist Kelsey Angle said. A full investigation was underway, with help from the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader urged anyone with video or photos of the accident to contact authorities. The agencies were briefing Missouri's two senators on the accident. Democrat Claire McCaskill said she would look into possible ""legislative solutions,"" while Republican Roy Blunt called it a ""tragedy that never should have happened."" Suzanne Smagala with Ripley Entertainment, which owns Ride the Ducks in Branson, said the company was assisting authorities. She said this was the company's only accident in more than 40 years of operation. Twenty-nine passengers and two crew members were aboard for a pleasure cruise. Seven of the 14 survivors were hurt when the vessel went down. At least two children and two adults were still hospitalized Friday afternoon. The captain survived, authorities said. Among the injured was 14-year-old Loren Smith of Osceola, Arkansas. Her father, 53-year-old retired math teacher Steve, Smith, and her 15-year-old brother, Lance, died in the accident. Loren suffered a concussion but survived. ""It's a hard thing,"" Steve Smith's father, Carroll Smith, said of losing his only child and his only grandson. ""It's a very difficult day."" Brayden Malaske, of Harrah, Oklahoma, boarded a replica 19th-century paddle-wheeler known as the Branson Belle on the same lake just before the storm hit. At the time, he said, the water seemed calm, and no one was worried about the weather. ""But it suddenly got very dark,"" he recalled. In a short video taken by Malaske from the deck of the Belle, the duck boat can be seen wallowing through the choppy, wind-whipped lake, with water only inches from its windows. Dark, rolling waves crash over its front end. The footage ends before the boat capsizes. Later, people on Malaske's boat saw a duck boat passenger ""hanging on for dear life"" to the paddle wheel of the Belle, he said. The mayor identified the crew member operating the boat as Bob Williams, known informally as ""Captain Bob."" ""He was a great ambassador for Branson,"" Best said. ""He was at every event. He knew everyone. He was always promoting Branson."" A survivor from the family who lost nine relatives said the captain told passengers not to bother grabbing life jackets. An email message seeking comment from Ripley Entertainment about Coleman's comments was not immediately returned to Associated Press. Named for their ability to travel on land and in water, duck boats have been involved in other serious accidents in the past, including the deaths of more than 40 people since 1999. Five college students were killed in 2015 in Seattle when a duck boat collided with a bus. Thirteen people died in 1999 when a boat sank near Hot Springs, Arkansas. ""Duck boats are death traps,"" said Andrew Duffy, an attorney whose Philadelphia law firm handled litigation related to two fatal duck boat accidents there. ""They're not fit for water or land because they are half car and half boat."" Safety advocates have sought improvements and complained that too many agencies regulate the boats with varying safety requirements. The boats were originally designed for the military, specifically to transport troops and supplies in World War II. They were later modified for use as sightseeing vehicles. The sheriff said Thursday that two duck boats were on the water at the time of the storm. Both were headed back to land. One returned safely. The other did not. Divers quickly located the sunken vessel, which came to rest on its wheels on the lakebed. Authorities planned to recover it at some point in the next few days. The boat sank in 40 feet (12 meters) of water and then rolled on its wheels into a deeper area with 80 feet (25 meters) of water. The Ride the Ducks tour begins in downtown Branson, where the vehicles take passengers on a tour while the captain cracks jokes and points out landmarks. Eventually, the boats pull up to the lake and slowly enter the water with a small splash. After a few minutes on the water, the vehicles return to land and to their home base, which features a store selling candy and souvenirs. Table Rock Lake, east of Branson, was created in the late 1950s when the Corps of Army Engineers built a dam across the White River to provide hydroelectric power to the Ozarks.",Ride the Ducks capsize survivor Tia Coleman said she and 10 family members had bought tickets for another duck boat tour but had their tickets swapped for Thursday's ride.

Carla Sinclair,"A passenger train crashed into a FedEx truck, smashing it right in half during a snow storm last Saturday in North Salt Lake, Utah. With such dramatic dashcam footage, it's a wonder nobody was hurt. In a statement to CNN affiliate WJW, the transit authority said the crossing gates weren't working properly because of the weather conditions. Nor were the flashing lights and bells that warn of an approaching train. Onlookers said the crossing arms didn't come down until after the train was coming through. ""In the event of a power outage or lack of signal, crossing gates are programmed to default to the 'down and active'position as a safety precaution."" the statement said. ""Preliminary information indicates the gates were affected by the severe ice and snow conditions at the time and were in the default 'down and active' position, as they are programmed...""

If you're an adrenaline addict, you can tour the US to find the world's tallest steel coaster, the steepest wooden coaster, and tallest steel-on-wood hybrid ride. To find out which parks offer the biggest thrills, MONEY partnered with Yelp to identify the country's best amusement parks, as well as the best rides at each attraction. Whether these parks are driving distance or require planning, we guarantee they are worth a trip. Here are the 10 best amusement parks in the country: 1. Disneyland Park Anaheim, California Hottest ride: Hyperspace Mountain The happiest place on Earth doesn't disappoint visitors, earning the top spot among all other amusement parks. Walt Disney came up with the idea for the park himself, helping with the original design and layout. The park is now home to classic rides like the Pirates of the Caribbean boat cruise and the dizzying Matterhorn Bobsleds. The most popular ride is the indoor, space-themed roller-coaster Hyperspace Mountain, which features Star Wars-themed clips and simulators. If you've still got an appetite, you can grab Mickey Mouse beignets at the park's New Orleans Square, or seafood at Ariel's Grotto, named after the character in The Little Mermaid. Those who want the full Disney experience night and day can stay at its resort hotels, the Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa and the Disneyland Hotel. Ticket prices vary depending on the day. Regular prices rose earlier this year to $117 ; peak prices are een higher. According to the Disneyland's website, two-day passes start at $105 per day for ages 10 and older. 2. Magic Kingdom Park at Disney World Lake Buena Vista, Florida Hottest ride: Space Mountain Disneyland's sister park in Lake Buena Vista takes the No. 2 spot, ensuring Mickey Mouse's dominance. Magic Kingdom Park is one of four themed parks inside Disney World, and is recognizable by its majestic Cinderella castle. You'll find characters from Disney classic movies like Aladdin, Mickey Mouse and Peter Pan roaming the streets, and kid-friendly rides, like the giant spinning tea cups at Mad Tea Party. Be sure to check out Space Mountain, the park's most popular ride. You'll zip through the ""galaxy"" on an indoor roller-coaster, inside a dark room illuminated by ""stars."" Another popular ride to try is Splash Mountain, which delivers a slow cruise up a mountain before taking a 50-foot drop into a pool of water. Tickets to Disney World don't come cheap. Two-day tickets, which also give you a day in one other Disney World park, cost $209 per person ages 10 and up. If you want to max out your visit, Travel + Leisure suggests visiting on a Friday when Magic Kingdom is open extra hours. 3. Cedar Point Sandusky, Ohio Hottest ride: Millennium Force Sometimes dubbed ""America's Roller Coast,"" Cedar Point is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the US The Midwestern park features 71 rides over 364 acres of space. This year, the park opened the Steel Vengeance, the tallest and fastest hybrid (wood-plus-steel) roller-coaster in the world ; it's 205 feet tall, runs at 74 mph, and goes upside down four times, in and out of loops. The park's most popular ride, however, is the Millennium Force, a steel coaster that opened in 2000 and was briefly the tallest and fastest coaster in the world. The 310-foot-tall, two-minute ride reaches speeds of 93 mph. Riders must be at least 48 inches tall.

Or try the park's most popular ride, Griffon, if you want to drop 90 degrees straight down from 205 ft in the sky — while going 75 mph. The park also offers a selection of fare from around the world: try German classics (including sausages and hot red cabbage) and different types of craft beer at the Brauhaus; fill up on stew and corned beef sandwiches at the Irish O'Tators ; or feast on cannolis at the Italian-style Marco Polo's Marketplace. One-day tickets vary in price, but average $70 for rides alone, or $95 for rides and all-day dining and drinks. 5. Hersheypark Hershey, Pennsylvania Hottest ride: Storm Runner Founded by Milton S.

The most popular ride, however, is the wooden coaster Outlaw Run — the only wood coaster that twists upside down three times, and reaches speeds up to 68 miles per hour. When the rides wear you out, try the signature succotash skillet dishes, made up of sauteed chicken, corn, yellow squash, peppers and okra. The skillets can be found in various locations throughout the park. For dessert, grab a handful of fudges, brittles and candy made right before your eyes at Brown's candy factory. One-day general admission tickets cost $65 for adults 12-61, $54 for children 4-11, and $63 for seniors aged 62 years old or over. 9. Canobie Lake Park Salem, New Hampshire Hottest ride: Untamed Canobie Lake Park started as a trolley park — a recreational area at the end of the streetcar lines. The park featured a botanical garden, an arcade and an area for canoeing. The thrills have accelerated a bit since those days. Hop on a grizzly bear-style cart on Untamed, the park's most popular ride, to be dropped ""beyond vertically"" — at 97 degrees — from 72 feet in the air. Other rides include the Yankee Cannonball, a wooden roller-coaster that lasts 60 seconds, and the spinning Ice Jet. To cool off on a warm day, get soaked on the Boston Tea Party ride, which drops riders from 50 feet into nearly 250,000 gallons of water. Elsewhere in the park, try St. Louis style barbecue ribs and pulled pork at Smokin' BBQ, or see if you can use critical problem-solving skills to escape the Puzzle Rooms. General admission tickets cost $39 at the gate and online. 10. Castles N' Coasters Phoenix, Arizona Hottest ride: Desert Storm Castles N' Coasters features four outdoor mini-golf courses, several rides, a go-kart track and an indoor video game arcade. The Desert Storm Roller Coaster, the park's most popular ride, features loops, twists and vertical drops. You could also hop on Skywire, a popular zip-line attraction that lets guests soar across the park, or take young kids to the Junior Dixie Wheel — children can ride this one even without an adult. When you're hungry, try to get chicken and waffles and ice cream in waffle cones at Waffles~n~Stuff, or build your own tacos for just $2.50 each at Tacos~n~Stuff. The bronze pass, which gets you unlimited rides all day, costs $29.99 per person ; tickets that include mini golf and arcade games are more expensive.","Steven Diaz/Walt Disney World Resort via Getty Images With roller coasters and water slides, amusement parks are an essential part of summer in America.

Christopher Weber / AP,"(LOS ANGELES) — The second storm in a week brought record-breaking rainfall to parched Los Angeles on Thursday, jamming traffic on Southern California highways and prompting evacuations in wildfire-scarred areas. A mudslide shut down Pacific Coast Highway and surrounding roads in and around Malibu neighborhoods charred by last month’s massive fire that destroyed hundreds of homes. Kirby Kotler and his neighbors spent days before the storm stacking 18,000 sandbags behind their homes along the highway. But when heavy rains arrived, mud, water and rocks blasted through the bags and across their properties. Kotler, who wielded water hoses to beat back the flames in November, used a tractor to keep the debris from entering his home. “Saving my house once again,” said Kotler, 57, a lifelong Malibu resident. “I’m more than a little concerned. If we get another blast of heavy rain there’ll be no stopping the hill from coming down.” Malibu officials reported no injuries and no major property damage. At Hollywood Burbank Airport, about 15 miles (33 kilometers) north of downtown Los Angeles, nobody was hurt when a Southwest Airlines plane from Oakland skidded off a wet runway as it landed. The plane came to a stop in a graded area designed to slow aircraft that overshoot the runway, the Federal Aviation Administration said. “As we landed, you could feel the brakes,” passenger Grant Palmer told KABC-TV. “Then I started noticing the plane going sideways.” Palmer said he was prepared to tuck into an emergency posture while his unflappable co-worker continued writing emails during the rough landing. Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California sorely need rainfall. Virtually the entire region is experiencing drought conditions, with portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties and areas along the Mexican border in extreme drought. The storm provided a big boost in and around Los Angeles. The downtown area set a new rainfall record for the day with 1.9 inches (4.8 centimeters) of rain, nearly double the previous record set in 1997, the National Weather Service reported. Normal monthly rainfall for December is only a bit more — 2.33 inches. While rain caused numerous accidents and backups on LA-area freeways, heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley. The hours-long shutdown along the key north-south route caused backups for miles. Motorists were urged to use caution on mountain passes, where up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) of snow was predicted at higher elevations. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for hundreds of homes in Trabuco Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains south of Los Angeles and Lake Elsinore neighborhoods in Riverside County. Both were burned in another massive wildfire earlier this year. Video showed a churning, muddy torrent full of tree trunks smashing down a bridge guardrail. In Orange County, flooding closed several schools. Floodwaters also submerged several cars in Costa Mesa and rain partially collapsed the roof of a commercial building in Irvine but no injuries were reported. A portion of southbound State Route 170 in Los Angeles was shut down after mud flowed onto the roadway. Firefighters rescued motorists from cars stuck in a flooded intersection in the city’s North Hollywood area. East of Los Angeles, a 13-car crash snarled the morning commute for several hours on a rainy freeway near Moreno Valley but caused only one minor injury, authorities said. Firefighters also rescued a man from the flood-swollen Los Angeles River in suburban La Habra. Storm waters in the concrete flood-control channel have swept away people in previous years.

Heavy snow is expected for parts of the upper Plains. Heavy snow is forecast for parts of the Midwest. As the low pressure system tracks towards Minnesota and Wisconsin late Sunday and Monday, bands of heavier snow will dump locally 6 to 12 inches across parts of eastern Minnesota and Northwest Wisconsin. A large swath of 6 to 12 inches of snow from Denver to Duluth is currently, with locally higher amounts in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Heavy rain is headed for the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, another disturbance is heading for the Pacific Northwest on Saturday night. Heavy rain, strong winds and mountain snow will all be likely. Winds will peak during Sunday morning across parts of Washington and Oregon with gusts locally to 45 mph. Landslides will be possible. Above average temperatures are forecasted for much of the eastern U.S. Temperatures in much of this region are forecasted to be 10 to 20 degrees above average. Above-average temperatures are forecast for the Eastern U.S. Above-average temperatures are expected in the Eastern U.S. on Sunday. With temperatures forecasted to be near 50 Saturday in New York, it will be nearly 25 degrees warmer Saturday in New York than it was this past Sunday. Chicago is expected to be near the low 50s. Washington will be in the mid-50s. This is pretty comfortable weather for the middle of winter. Like last weekend, with the milder temperatures, the threat for localized ice jams, and thin ice remain a concern across parts of the Northeast. For those who enjoy this milder winter weather, there is good news: The chances for above-average temperatures will remain likely through the next several weeks for much of the eastern U.S.","The Southwest is getting walloped with winter conditions this weekend.

Associated Press,"(LOS ANGELES) — A powerful winter storm unleashed mudslides in Southern California wildfire burn areas and trapped motorists on a major highway, and the northern part of the state braced for more wet weather Sunday.
Saturday’s deluge loosened hillsides where a major blaze burned last year in and around Malibu, clogging the Pacific Coast Highway with mud and debris.
A stretch of the scenic route northwest of Los Angeles was expected to remain closed in both directions until Monday while crews tow away stuck vehicles and clear lanes. No injuries were reported.
The rapper Soulja Boy was among those whose cars were mired in the muck that was up to 4 ft. (1.2 meters) deep in some areas.
The 28-year-old retweeted a photo of the mudslide and posted: “My car got stuck too almost went into the ocean,” along with a prayer emoji.
An automated rain gauge in the western Santa Monica Mountains showed nearly three-quarters of an inch (nearly 2 cm) of rainfall in one hour, said the National Weather Service.
“These are heavy rates,” the weather service tweeted.
Up to 1 ½ in. (3.8 cm) of rain fell in coastal and valley areas, while mountain communities got heavy snow.
Flash-flood watches and warnings were eventually lifted for areas burned by the fires that scorched more than 155 sq. mi. (404 sq. km.) of brush and timber acres in November, destroyed about 1,600 structures and claimed three lives.
The sun emerged in Los Angeles on Sunday and the red carpet for the evenings Golden Globe awards were expected to remain dry. Scattered showers were possible later in the night.
To the north, wind and rain forced delays or cancelations of flights out of San Francisco International Airport for a second day. A wind advisory was in place until 10 p.m. Sunday.
The San Francisco Bay Area could get up to 1 ½ in. (3.8 cm) of rain, with the heaviest downpours coming after sunset.
Strong winds and downed trees knocked out electricity for at least 20,000 customers across the Sacramento region Sunday night. The National Weather Service said Sunday that winds gusted up to 49 mph (79 km/h).
Saturday’s storm brought about a foot (30 cm) of snow to the Sierra Nevada and twice that amount was expected Sunday. A winter storm warning was in effect until 4 a.m. Monday.
Avalanche warnings were posted in parts of California, Nevada and Utah. The Sierra Avalanche Center issued a backcountry avalanche warning for the Lake Tahoe area stretching south into the Sierra along the California-Nevada line from noon Sunday until 7 a.m. Monday.
The National Weather Service says blizzard conditions with gale-force winds could trigger widespread avalanche activity.
Two feet (61 centimeters) of snow was reported at Mammoth Mountain 150 miles (241.39 km) south of Tahoe. More than a foot (30 cm) fell in the upper elevations around Tahoe, including 19 in. (48 cm) at Squaw Valley.
Windstorms that pummeled parts of Washington state and Oregon over the weekend left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity.
A strong system brought winds that registered gusts of about 60 mph (96 km/h) at Sea-Tac Airport in Washington, the National Weather Service in Seattle said. Dozens of flights in the region were canceled or delayed.

Gene Cherry,"(Reuters) - Nearly all rivers and waterways in North and South Carolina will crest Sunday, but most will remain at dangerous flood levels for days to come, the U.S. National Weather Service warned, more than a week after the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people. Swaths of rivers near the Atlantic coast will not crest for days to come, such as the lower Cape Fear River near Wilmington, N.C., one of the hardest hit communities, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “This isn’t over,” Oravec said early Sunday. “Large sections of rivers near the coast won’t start cresting until at least early in the week, maybe later.” “All that water is going to take a good while to recede,” he said. “Damage can still be done. It’ll be a slow drop.” Meanwhile, remnants of the once mighty storm, brought heavy rains northwest up the Ohio Valley, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. Officials in towns and cities in both North and South Carolina were filling sandbags and finalizing evacuation plans, eyeing some rivers that are swollen by heavy rainfall on Saturday. In Conway, South Carolina, where President Donald Trump visited this week, images posted by the city on Saturday showed water lapping at homes in an area where residents were being evacuated. In Lee’s Landing in Horry County, some residents used boats to get to safety as the Waccamaw River spilled into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported. “If you can get out, get out,” Joseph Tanner, the county’s fire rescue chief, said in an interview with WBTW News 13. More than two dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, the NWS said. At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm, with most of those in North Carolina. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters. Nearly 550 roads remained closed, the state’s department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence. Duke Energy Corp said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. The company is testing the water for possible contamination, Duke officials said in a release Saturday. “The company is bringing in additional construction material from across the state to repair the breach as soon as the flood waters recede,” the release said. The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to state officials. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

"USA TODAY, Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY","Hundreds of community members gathered for a vigil in Branson, Missouri for the 17 people, 9 of them from one family, who died suddenly when a duck boat capsized. USA TODAY A man looks at an idled duck boat in the parking lot of Ride the Ducks in Branson, Mo. (Photo: Charlie Riedel, AP) A private safety inspector says he warned the Branson, Missouri, duck boat company nearly a year ago that a design flaw in some of the vehicles’ exhaust could cause them to sink in choppy water. The safety expert is one of many who have flagged potential dangers posed by duck boats in their dual role as both buses and boats. Seventeen people died Thursday when one of the boats sank in a storm with 5-foot waves on Table Rock Lake in Branson. Duck boats, based on World War II military landing craft, are popular with tourists because they permit sightseeing on both land and water. Steve Paul, owner of the Test Drive Technologies inspection service in the St. Louis area, said he issued a written report for the company in August 2017 warning that some of the vehicles’ engines and their bilge pumps might fail in bad weather, the Associated Press reported. “If you watch that video, that water is definitely being slammed up into that exhaust without a doubt,” Paul said of the disaster. Paul said he inspected several dozen of the vehicles for Ripley Entertainment in August 2017 and warned of the design flaw. He said the boats had also been modified from their original design to allow them to carry more passengers. Paul said the design flaw would have allowed water to run into the exhaust pipe and then into the engine, stalling it and halting the pumps that empty out any water leaking in. The U.S. Coast Guard said the boat that sank was built in 1944 and has passed an inspection in February, the Kansas City Star reported. The company operating the Branson duck boats has halted service. Federal officials have warned tourists for nearly 20 years about the dangers posed by amphibious tour boats, which have spotty and sometimes contradictory safety regulations because they are neither entirely boat nor bus. Operators have lengthened some of the boats from their original designs and sometimes have added canopies and see-through vinyl ""walls,"" allowing them to operate in bad weather. More: Would wearing life jackets have made the deadly Branson duck boat accident even worse? A witness’s video of the duck boat just before it capsized suggests that its flexible plastic windows might have been closed and could have trapped passengers as the hybrid boat-truck went down. It does not show passengers jumping clear. “The biggest problem with a duck when it sinks is that canopy,” Paul told the AP. “That canopy becomes what I’ll call a people catcher, and people can’t get out from under that canopy.” A spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment, the company operating the duck boats in Branson, did not respond Saturday to telephone and email messages seeking comment, the AP reported. Spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala has noted that Thursday’s accident was the only one in more than 40 years of operation. The duck boat company's website now carries a statement of sorrow, along with the image of a black ribbon: ""The safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority. Ride the Ducks will be closed for business while we support the investigation, and to allow time to grieve for the families and the community. Thank you for your support, and we ask that your thoughts and prayers be with the families during this time."" Because the boats travel on land and in water, they are regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Coast Guard. The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Branson accident, has complained in the past about a lack of oversight and sometimes conflicting regulations over the vehicles. More: 'Death traps': Federal officials have warned about dangers from duck boats for two decades One issue with the boats is their canopies. The Coast Guard requires life jackets on boats but leaves it to the vessel's master to tell passengers when to wear the jackets during hazardous situations. The NTSB recommended passengers not wear life jackets on boats that have canopies because when the vehicles sink, the life jackets can float passengers into the canopy, preventing escape. The NTSB, which makes non-binding safety recommendations, has urged the removal of canopies from the vehicles to reduce the risk of drowning. The agency has also recommended the highway administration regulate the vehicles for over-the-road travel with requirements for passenger seat belts, while saying that passengers shouldn't wear seat belts while the vehicle is in the water. Multiple agencies are now investigating the Branson duck boat disaster. More: Before accident in Branson, Missouri, duck boats had history of fatalities Duck boats have been involved in a series of fatal incidents in civilian use as tourist vehicles: • 13 people died when the Miss Majestic operated by Land and Lakes Tours sank May 1, 1999, on Lake Hamilton in Hot Springs, Ark. The rubber boot that provided a watertight barrier where the axle penetrated the hull failed, and the vessel sank in 7 minutes in water about 60 feet deep, the NTSB found. Seven passengers and the operator survived. • Four people drowned when the Lady Duck sank June 23, 2002, in Canada in the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Quebec. The vehicle wasn’t watertight and sank in water about 25 feet deep near the Hull Marina, according to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Six passengers, the driver and tour guide escaped. • Two people died and 26 were injured when a Ride the Ducks of Philadelphia tour vehicle sank July 7, 2010, in the Delaware River in Philadelphia. The vehicle sank in water 55 deep after colliding with a 250-foot sludge barge called The Resource towed by a 79-foot tugboat called Caribbean Sea, according to the NTSB. The accident was caused by the tugboat mate failing to keep a proper lookout while distracted by his cellphone and laptop, according to the NTSB. But the board also found that the duck-boat master contributed to the accident by failing to take appropriate actions while anchoring in an active navigation channel. • Five bus passengers died and 71 other people were injured Sept. 24, 2015, after a collision with a Duck 6 amphibious vehicle on the Aurora bridge in Seattle. One of the Duck 6’s axles failed and led to a loss of steering and braking, the NTSB found. Ride the Ducks International modified its axle housings, drive train and other equipment but wasn’t registered as a vehicle manufacturer, the board found. • One woman on a scooter was killed and a passenger injured April 30, 2016, in a collision with the Penelope Pru amphibious vehicle operated by Boston Duck Tours. The amphibious vehicle overtook the scooter as both accelerated out of a stop light, the NTSB found.

Rachel Reeves,"As frigid air plunges into and builds over the central United States, a stormy pattern with snow, ice and rain may unfold from Texas to Maine for Christmas holiday travelers. During a typical winter, this weather pattern can bring a storm and travel concerns once every five to seven days. However, with the pattern anticipated from Dec. 21 to Dec. 26, there is the potential for two storms that may be disruptive to travel in areas from the Rockies and southern Plains to the Midwest and Northeast states. ""The key to which areas stand the best chance of snow and/or ice will depend on how far to the south and east frigid air pushes out from the North Central states,"" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Mike Doll. The first storm and its snow will primarily be a concern from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest later this week.

REUTERS/Brandon Wade In the wake of this storm, colder air may settle from parts of the southern Plains to part of the Ohio Valley on Saturday, Dec. 23. Meanwhile, most areas along the Atlantic Seaboard can expect above-normal temperatures for late in the week. Since cold air will not be established in time for the arrival of precipitation in the East, most travelers in the Northeast will likely have to deal with delays associated with rain, fog and a low cloud ceiling around Saturday, Dec. 23. Some pockets of ice and snow are possible over parts of the northern Appalachians. ""We have concerns for a second storm to spring up in the south between Dec. 24 and Christmas Day,"" Doll said. How quickly the cold and the next storm move eastward will determine which areas might get snow and ice. One scenario brings the cold air eastward with the storm riding along the Northeast coast on Christmas Day. This would keep it generally dry across the Upper Midwest with areas of lake-effect snow. Snow and ice may be a concern for the Northeast. The second scenario has the storm and cold air moving eastward even more quickly. Should this be the case, the Midwest and Northeast would trend drier and colder, aside from traditional bands of lake-effect snow. In this scenario, some snow and ice may make another visit to parts of the Deep South on Christmas Eve as the storm quickly passes through.

Barnini Chakraborty,"BRANSON, Mo. – Mechanical inspector Steven Paul said Sunday he warned the company operating the now-capsized duck boat in Missouri about massive design flaws and dangerous safety issues almost a year before Thursday's tragic accident that killed 17 people and injured seven others. ""My first thought was I was thankful that me and my family weren't on the ducks,"" he told Fox News in a telephone interview. ""My second thought was, 'Oh man, I probably inspected that boat.'"" Paul, who served in the U.S. Army for 6 years as a diesel mechanic before opening Test Drive Technologies in 2009, told Fox he was hired by Ripley Entertainment last year to inspect 24 duck boats. The Florida-based company had been interested in buying the businesses and wanted an assessment. ""My inspection was so they had the opportunity to know what they were buying before the sale was final,"" Paul said. Paul said he sent the company a ""2-to-3-page fleet inspection report"" as well as 24 checklist reports and ""as many as 20 photos for each duck"" he inspected in August 2017. In the report, he cautioned that the boats' engines -and pumps that remove water from their hulls- might fail in bad weather. In rough conditions, water could get into the exhaust system, and then into the motor, cutting it off. With the motor off, its pump for removing water from the hull would not operate. In Paul's interview with Fox, he added that the boats' canopies can turn into ""death traps"" because when the boat sinks, people cannot get out from underneath the canopy. After filing his report last year, Paul said he came home and told his wife that the family ""would not be riding the ducks"" anymore. A source with knowledge of the report but not authorized to speak publicly about it strongly pushed back on Paul's claims he warned the company that the boats were unsafe. ""There is no documentation and there were no warnings,"" the source said. Ripleys Entertainment purchased Ride the Ducks in December. Jim Pattison Jr., president of the company, said last week the boat ""shouldn't have been in the water."" Steven Paul received this invoice and payment receipt for the inspection of the duck boats in Branson, Mo. (Steven Paul) Fox News has heard a voicemail sent by a maintenance director to Paul acknowledging the report. Fox has also seen an invoice and payment receipt for the inspection of the duck boats last year. Paul claims he sent the company emails of his correspondence with the Missouri Department of Transportation regarding specific regulations of where the boats do not pass DOT standards. The National Transportation Safety Board told Fox News on Sunday they do not comment on ongoing investigations. The duck boat that capsized near the tourist town of Branson, Mo., on Thursday had 31 people on board when it sank in 40-foot waters. The amphibious vessel overturned during a fast-moving summer storm that produced near-hurricane gusts which turned ripples into massive waves. Cellphone video from a witness showed the duck boat taking on water and struggling to move before sinking, making it one of the deadliest duck boat accidents in U.S. history. The U.S. Coast Guard said the boat that sank was built in 1944 and had passed an inspection in February. But Paul said the boat would have been heavily modified to make it longer so that only part of it dates to World War II. He said it would still have the design flaw he identified in his report. The accident Thursday evening on Table Rock Lake also is raising questions about whether storm warnings in the area went unheeded and whether any agency can keep boaters off the water when inclement weather approaches. Witnesses have said the weather appeared calm before a storm suddenly whipped up strong waves and spray. But nearly eight hours earlier, the National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the western and central Missouri counties. A severe thunderstorm warning that went out at 6:32 p.m. specifically mentioned Table Rock Lake. The first emergency calls over the accident occurred just after 7 p.m. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa of KOLR-TV in Springfield said in a phone interview Saturday that her station was forecasting the threat of severe weather all morning. ""This storm didn't come out of nowhere,"" she said. ""That is what pains me. I feel like we did everything, at least we tried to do everything, by the book as meteorologists and we still had this horrible tragedy on our hands.” Paul says he's perplexed by the decision to take people out in inclement weather. ""There has got to be a disconnect somewhere,"" he said. ""They should have erred on the side of caution."" Speaking from her hospital bed, survivor Tia Coleman told reporters that the boat's captain told riders they would not need life jackets. When the vessel began to take on water, Coleman said ""it was too late."" ""I believe that a lot of people could have been spared,"" said Coleman, who lost 9 members of her family on the duck boat. ""I lost all of my children. I lost my husband. I lost my mother-in-law and my father-in-law. I lost my uncle. I lost my sister-in-law... And I love my nephew."" Late Sunday, the Coast Guard announced that salvage operations to retrieve the sunken boat would begin Monday morning. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Fox News Branson duck boat operator was warned in 2017 of dangers, inspector says Fox News Inspector says he tried to ward duck boat company about design flaws before 17 people were killed in Missouri.

https://www.facebook.com/kristineaguerra,"BRANSON, Mo. — The Coleman family had initially thought of going on a vacation to Florida for their annual trip, but the drive was too long for some elderly relatives. They settled on going to Branson, a southwestern Missouri town about seven hours away from their hometown of Indianapolis. They rented a van and on Tuesday, the family of 11 from three generations of Colemans headed out for what would be their last vacation together. The trip to this small resort town turned fatal just two days later, after they got on one of the amphibious vehicles for what should’ve been a 70-minute guided tour around the Ozarks. The boat struggled against the turbulent waves on Table Rock Lake, a normally placid body of water churned by a violent thunderstorm. The vehicle took on water, capsized and sank, settling at the bottom, taking 17 lives with it. Of those 17 victims, nine were members of the Coleman family, the youngest a 1-year-old girl. Only two of the Coleman group on the boat survived, Tia Coleman and her 13-year-old nephew, Donovan. Tia Coleman’s husband and all of her three children died. “You don’t know how many times I wished they would’ve went to Florida,” said Carolyn Coleman, whose husband, Gary, lost two brothers, nieces and nephews in the accident. On Friday night, Carolyn, who lives in Georgia, said she called Tia while she was recovering at a hospital in Branson. Tia’s voice was calm on the phone, and Carolyn assumed she was probably still in shock, as if the weight of her loss had yet to take its toll. “I asked her what was their last words … She said all she could hear and say was, ‘Grab the babies!’ And that was it. They got one group of waves and then they got a second one, and that’s when the boat started to sink,” Carolyn Coleman said. In total, 14 people survived — fewer than half the boat’s passengers and crew — on Thursday evening. The tragedy was a sudden departure from what had been, for many, a beautiful summer day in the Midwestern retreat. Dark clouds, whipping winds and heavy rains had abruptly turned a routine tour into a disaster for 29 passengers and two crew members. “When tourists come to Branson, they’re our family, and we want to take care of our family. Branson is a city of smiles,” city spokeswoman Melody Pettit said Friday afternoon as she left Branson City Hall, where staffers were cleaning up leftover food and water donations for the victims. “Right now, we’re hurting and we’re not smiling.” Santino Tomasetti arrived at the Showboat Branson Belle, a riverboat restaurant not far from where the boat sank, just as first responders were pulling people out of the water. Those who made it to shore were shivering, in shock, drained — and Tomasetti scurried to get dry clothing and chairs so paramedics could examine them. It was then, he said, that reality started to hit them. “There were a lot of people who just, the second they had a minute to calm down, they were crying. They were starting to panic,” Tomasetti said, noting that he wanted to help in any way possible. On Friday night, hundreds of community members and tourists lit candles, prayed and sang for the victims and their families, gathering outside the office of Ride the Ducks Branson, the company that owned and operated the boat. Tomasetti stood in the front of the crowd in the embrace of his loved ones, all in tears. Outside the office were the cars that the victims had left before they boarded the boat. Josh Daniel, who lives nearby, placed one flower on each car earlier that day. “It broke us all,” he said. The cars later were covered with flowers, teddy bears, balloons and handwritten signs. Daniel Scott took a knee as he placed one hand against the passenger-side door of a white SUV and prayed for the family that lost nine of its members, including a 1-year-old girl. Soon, the crowd broke into song amid sniffles and sobs: “Amazing Grace,” “How Great Thou Art” and “It is Well With My Soul.” At Rock Lane Resort and Marina, a rowdy crowd and a live band that had been playing country music at a tiki bar suddenly went quiet as people began to gather at a hasty memorial that included candles, roses and teddy bears. Two young men sat in front, lighting tiny red candles. Neither of them knew the victims, but they said they felt compelled to join, both to say prayers and show gratitude. “If it wasn’t for them people, we wouldn’t have a town,” said Stephen Lyons, who is in construction and often works on vacation homes in Branson. Lyons said he owes his livelihood to people like those who were on the duck boat on Thursday — millions of tourists who come to Branson every year and fuel the town’s economy. “They could’ve gone anywhere else in the world, but they came here,” said the other young man, Stephen Noe. Branson, near the Arkansas border with a population of 10,500, sees about 8 million tourists annually and is a destination for country music, amusement parks and outdoor activities. Among its popular attractions are the duck boats; Ride the Ducks has been in Branson for more than four decades. Questions still remain about why the boat was in the water, despite forecasts and a warning of a potentially violent storm. Jim Pattison Jr., president of Ripley Entertainment, parent company of Ride the Ducks, said the storm came on suddenly and took the crew by surprise. But the National Weather Service before noon had predicted the possibility of serious storms and high winds by late Thursday afternoon; the boat sank at about 7 p.m. [ The violent storm behind the duck boat tragedy was well-predicted, not ‘out of nowhere’ ] “Why did that boat even go out? When you’re on vacation and you’re touring, you expect whoever’s running these facilities to be alert on weather and anything else in the surroundings that could bring harm to anyone,” Carolyn Coleman said. The driver, Branson resident Robert “Bob” Williams, 73, is among the dead. The passengers who died came from four states. William Asher, 69; Rosemarie Hamann, 68; Janice Bright, 63; and William Bright, 65, were from Missouri. Two — Steve Smith, 53; and Lance Smith, 15 — were from Arkansas. One, Leslie Dennison, 64, was from Illinois. Nine were from Indiana, all from the Coleman family: Angela 45; Belinda, 69; Ervin, 76; Glenn, 40; Horace, 70; Reece, 9; Eva, 7; Maxwell, 2; and Arya, 1. Gripping footage from the lake showed the boat seesawing and lurching in unrelenting waves, as 65-mph gusts of wind hit it with spray. Before long, the small flat-bottomed half-boat half-bus sank, plunging 80 feet to the bottom of the lake. One other duck boat was on the lake Thursday and made it to shore. David Plummer, associate pastor at Noble Hill Baptist Church, said that as he watched that footage online, he believed that the driver continued steering the boat even as the water swallowed it. “Lord help him,” Plummer remembered thinking. “He didn’t have a chance. I watched him. That man gave his life.” Carolyn Coleman said she and her husband are planning to make a trip to Indiana for the funeral after the bodies are released. “He’s trying to hang in there,” she said of her husband. “I’m just trying to stand by my husband and support him with what we’re having to endure. This is a lot.” Mark Berman and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux in Washington contributed to this report.","Washington Post 'Grab the babies!': Duck boat tragedy kills nine members of the same family Washington Post BRANSON, Mo. — The Coleman family had initially thought of going on a vacation to Florida for their annual trip, but the drive was too long for some el…",2018-07-21T16:48:03Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",'Grab the babies!': Duck boat tragedy kills nine members of the same family - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/07/21/grab-the-babies-duck-boat-tragedy-kills-nine-members-of-the-same-family/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/76pWyBnlkhbHaO6C8BKyCB0nDM0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/USOWJKI5BEZ6FBPCSIQOHWZVUQ.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,Lake Storm,1
Christopher Weber & Olga R. Rodriguez / AP,"(LOS ANGELES) — A major winter storm swept south through California on Thursday, bringing heavy snow and strong winds to mountains and steady rain elsewhere, while prompting mandatory evacuations for coastal areas to the south that were devastated by deadly mudslides in January. As many as 30,000 people were ordered to leave an area of Santa Barbara County before the storm arrived early Friday. Sheriff Bill Brown said forecasters weren’t certain how intense the storm would be when it arrives in Southern California. However, modeling indicates “there is a risk for dangerous flash flooding, mud and debris flows,” he warned. “I’m not going anywhere,” Montecito resident Harriet Mosson said. The 76-year-old said the three-story condo building where she lives was not damaged in January because it’s on the ocean side of U.S. 101, which helped divert the mudslides that came down the mountains. “Can it happen again? Yeah, I guess it can. Will it, now? I doubt it,” she said. “And if something terrible happens I’ll be able to get out of here.” People cannot be forced to leave their homes under a mandatory evacuation order, but authorities said they should not be expected to be rescued while the storm event is occurring. To the north, a blizzard warning was issued for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where winds could gust up to 125 mph (200 kph) on ridges and 60 mph (95 kph) in some valleys, the National Weather Service said. The cold front is expected to bring snow to foothill areas as low as 3,500 feet (1,066 meters), and officials warned people to stay off mountain roads. The California Department of Transportation said 90-miles stretch of Interstate 80 was closed between Colfax, California, and the Nevada state line due to whiteout conditions. Chains or snow tires were needed on stretches of Interstate 80, U.S. 50 and U.S. 395. Dozens of collisions were reported on San Francisco Bay Area highways. Northern mountains were expected to receive as much as 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow and reach 7 feet (2.1 meters) in some areas. The snow will help the Sierra snowpack, which is vital to the state’s water supply and is only about a quarter of its normal depth for this time of winter. Stephanie Myers, a spokeswoman for Heavenly Mountain Resort and Kirkwood Mountain Resort in Lake Tahoe, estimated snow was falling at about 2 inches an hour. “We’re thrilled about this storm,” Myers said. “Once the storm moves out of the area, we’ll have a beautiful bluebird powder day.” Predictions of widespread showers raised concern about flash flooding when the storm reaches Southern California. Santa Barbara County ordered the immediate evacuations for residents of areas burned by three major wildfires over the past 18 months. The order encompasses Montecito, where a Jan. 9 storm triggered flash floods that destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes. Twenty-one people were killed and two remain missing. Other areas impacted by the order are Goleta, Santa Barbara, Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria. The county is following a rigorous new system of alerts that emphasizes evacuations well in advance of storms rather than suggesting residents can use their discretion. “We want everyone to be out of the area, and out of harm’s way, by nightfall,” Brown said, adding that evacuations in areas stripped bare by wildfires will be part of “the new normal” following the devastation in Montecito.",Coastal areas to the south were devastated by deadly mudslides in January,2018-03-02T02:08:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","30,000 Ordered to Evacuate as Southern California Storm Brings Threat of Mudslides",http://time.com/5182249/santa-barbara-evacuated-mudslides/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/california-storms_katz.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Lake Storm,1

Keller was home in Texas, but her 15-year-old daughter, Gillian, was among the 31 people aboard a Ride the Ducks amphibious tour vessel that capsized Thursday night on Table Rock Lake. Officials say 17 people died. Gillian survived without serious injuries. ""I feel fortunate,"" Keller said. ""God spared my child and she is coming home alive and not in a body bag."" Keller said Gillian was visiting Branson with her father and his family. Now, everyone is ready to go home. Keller said her daughter and ex-husband reported the vessel began to sink in the stormy conditions Thursday night, and the occupants were briefly trapped under the boat's canopy. Eventually, one of the duck boat operators was able to release the canopy and people swam toward the surface, according to the account Keller received.

SAN FRANCISCO A winter storm rolling east from California may vex holiday travelers later this week. 
The low pressure system, currently dropping rain in the Bay Area and snow in the neighboring Sierra Nevada mountains, will make its way across the USA over the coming days packing the potential to snarl traffic and delay flights.
The powerful Pacific storm prompted the National Weather Service to issue an advisory Monday warning of heavy rains and snow throughout the West that will roar across the central plains by midweek.
""This (storm) will likely bring widespread travel impacts after Christmas with heavy rain, snow, ice, strong thunderstorms and strong winds,"" the advisory reads. The system ""will bring potential travel trouble over the central U.S. beginning Wednesday.""
If the downside to the wintry weather is potential travel headaches, the upside is a white Christmas in many pockets of the country.
The mountains outside of Los Angeles and Palm Springs will get wind-driven snow in the coming days, while residents of Northern Arizona could get up to 3 inches of the white stuff. 
In the Midwest, lake-effect snow will be particularly heavy south of Lake Ontario before melting in above-freezing temperatures later in the week. Northern New York and most of New England will experience post-Christmas temperatures in the 40s and 50s, bringing rain instead of snow.
If you're looking for a cold getaway, head to Chicago. It's 2018's best winter holiday vacation destination for cold-weather lovers, according to a WalletHub study. Experts compared 130 of the most populated U.S. metropolitan areas against six different factors to determine the ranking: travel costs and hassles, cost in destinations, attractions, weather, safety and activities. One of the Chicago activities is skating at the free McCormick Tribune Ice Rink. Check out the rest of the top 32 winter vacation destinations.

Who'll get the most snow this Christmas? The Weather Channel says ""at least 6 inches of snow is likely from parts of the central and northern Plains into the upper Midwest and northern Great Lakes,"" with more than a foot possible in areas getting the heaviest precipitation.
For those traveling throughout this holiday week, stay connected to the latest travel advisories through individual airlines and state highway patrol websites.

Dina Spector,"A woman who survived a deadly duck boat accident in Missouri on Thursday told a Fox-affiliated TV station in Indianapolis that the boat's captain told passengers ""not to worry about grabbing life jackets."" Seventeen people were killed after a duck boat with 31 people on board capsized and sank to the bottom of Table Rock Lake in Branson, located in southern Missouri, during a severe thunderstorm. Nine of those who died were members of the same family from Indianapolis. Two other family members who were aboard the duck boat that capsized survived, including Tia Coleman, who spoke to Fox59. ""My heart is very heavy. Out of 11 of us, only two of us surviving - that's me and my nephew,"" Coleman told Fox59. Coleman said none of the passengers put on life jackets because the captain said they were not necessary. ""When it was time to grab them it was too late,"" she told the TV station. ""I believe that a lot of people could have been spared,"" Coleman said. A relative who was not aboard the duck boat shared a photo with Atlanta's WSB-TV that includes several of the family members who died. Life Vest Regulations Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said life jackets were stored on the boat but he could not say if passengers were wearing them when the boat capsized, according to Fox News. Jim Pattison Jr., the president of the company that owns the Ride The Ducks tour operation, told CBS This Morning that the boats had life vests, but that people were not required to wear them. ""The Coast Guard requires life jackets to be available for each passenger on a boat, including duck boats, but allows the crew to decide when to instruct passengers to put them on,"" according to The New York Times. Children under the age of the seven are required to wear a life jacket whenever they are on a boat ""unless they are in the cabin area of a houseboat or cruiser,"" according to boating laws on the Missouri government website. Footage and Thunderstorm Warnings Winds in Branson reached more than 60 mph when the duck boat overturned. The National Weather Service had issued a severe-thunderstorm warning in the area roughly 30 minutes before officials were alerted to the sinking boat, according to The New York Times. Pattison told CBS This Morning on Friday that the storm ""came out of basically nowhere"" and that the lake is typically calm. When asked why the tour continued in such conditions, Pattison responded: ""I don't have all the details, but to answer your question, no, it shouldn't have been in the water if, if what happened, happened."" Footage recorded at Table Rock Lake showed small duck boats, which can traverse both water and land, struggling against large waves and heavy winds around the time of the disaster. Previous Duck Boat Accidents The incident marks the first time in more than 40 years that a Ride The Ducks boat in Branson was involved in an accident, a company representative said. ""Very sad to hear about this horrible accident - prayers for all those involved and the first responders who are assisting,"" Gov. Mike Parson of Missouri said on Twitter. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. Duck boats were originally used by the military during World War II. Several fatal accidents have occurred since they were repurposed as tourist vehicles, including one in 2015 in which five students were killed when one collided with a bus in Seattle. A duck boat that sank in Arkansas in 1999 killed 13 people.","Seventeen people are dead after a tourist ""duck boat"" capsized during storms at Table Rock Lake in southern Missouri.

Aria Bendix,"For years, scientists have warned of the ""next big one,"" an earthquake so powerful that it could topple buildings, slash power, and take lives across California. As far as natural disasters go, the quake represented the worst-case-scenario for cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, which are both located along the San Andreas Fault. 
 Now government experts claim there's an even bigger threat to California residents: a potential mega-storm that could inundate cities and cause up to $725 billion in damage. 
Read more: Natural disasters set records around the world in 2018. These were some of the worst.
 That's more than double the damage that could hail from the ""next big one,"" according to the latest estimates from data analytics firm CoreLogic. 
 In 2011, a team of scientists and other experts at the US Geological Survey (USGS) likened the mega-storm to the California winter storms of 1861 and 1862, which killed thousands and left a 300-mile-long lake in the center of the state.

The future doomsday scenario — known ""Atmospheric River 1,000,"" or ARkstorm for short — could surpass levels of precipitation that are only seen every 500 to 1,000 years. 
 If ARkstorm does hit, its effects could be exacerbated by the failure of a single piece of infrastructure: the Whittier Narrows Dam in Los Angeles County. 
 A recent report from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) found that ARkstorm could breach the dam, causing water to spill over the top or triggering the premature release of the dam's spillway. The resulting floods and landslides pose an ""unacceptable"" risk to human lives, the report said.

Already, California's flood-protection systems have showed signs of malfunction in places like the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2017, the near-failure of the Oroville Dam outside Sacramento prompted the evacuation of more than 180,000 people. 
 The USACE points to the Whittier Narrows Dam as ""one of the highest risk dams"" in their portfolio. If their models are borne out, around 1.5 million people could be forced to evacuate due to catastrophic flooding, with some areas witnessing floods of up to 20 feet. As weather conditions worsen due to climate change, these predictions could become even graver. 
 Though scientists can't pinpoint when ARkstorm or the next big earthquake will occur, both disasters are considered likely, if not inevitable. 
 But the USGS has found that preparations for the ""next big one"" could help combat a storm as well. 
 By setting up shelters, testing aid agreements, and piloting early warning apps, the state can ready itself for whichever disaster comes first.","Scientists predict that California could be struck by a rare mega-storm that threatens lives and yields $725 billion worth of damage.

The Washington Post,"Even as skies began to clear over North Carolina on Tuesday, concern about environmental damage mounted after days of pounding rain left two dozen hog farms seeping waste, 1.7 million dead chickens, widespread mandates to boil drinking water, and workers trying to prevent coal ash waste from leaking out of a landfill. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, D, said Tuesday that the state had confirmed 26 deaths linked to the storm, pushing the toll to 33 lives lost in the Carolinas and Virginia. Florence had effectively washed out normal contours of life across North Carolina, with Cooper saying that more than 1,100 roads were closed Tuesday and more than 340,000 people lacked power. And, Cooper warned, ""we will see more flooding."" The state's vast hog farms and their waste lagoons - which one environmentalist called ""cesspools the size of football fields"" - pose one of the greatest perils. As of noon Tuesday, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality said it had received reports of floodwaters inundating or overtopping lagoons at 22 locations, leaving trails of floating excrement. Four other lagoons suffered structural damage from floodwaters, the agency said. Fifty-five were at or near their capacity. The North Carolina Pork Council says that lagoons holding hog feces and urine are supposed to safely absorb at least 19 inches of rain and that ahead of the storm, many were prepared for more than 25 inches. But Florence dumped that much or close in some areas. ""While there are more than 3,000 active lagoons in the state that have been unaffected by the storm, we remain concerned about the potential impact of these record-shattering floods,"" said Andy Curliss, chief executive of the North Carolina Pork Council. The group added that given the widespread flooding across the eastern part of the state, ""significant efforts continue in order to provide feed and care for animals and to ensure safety for farm families and employees."" It wasn't merely the hog industry that was struggling to assess damage in the wake of Hurricane Florence. The EPA has said that once conditions allow, it plans to deploy ""reconnaissance teams"" to inspect Superfund hazardous-waste sites in the Carolinas and Georgia that may have been affected by the storm. Meanwhile, Sanderson Farms, one of the nation's largest poultry producers, estimated that about 1.7 million of its young chickens had died as a result of flooding. An additional 30 farms housing roughly more than 6 million chickens near Lumberton, North Carolina, ""are isolated by flood waters and the company is unable to reach those farms with feed trucks. Losses of live inventory could escalate if the company does not regain access to those farms."" Utilities that serve more than 600,000 customers issued warnings to boil water before drinking it, according to state regulators in North Carolina. The Environmental Protection Agency has said that seven publicly owned treatment works were not operating. Rachel Noble, a professor of marine sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said aging pipes in eastern North Carolina are hard-pressed to handle heavy rains, let alone a historic deluge. Noble said floodwaters can contaminate drinking water by entering cracks in pipes built during World War II or earlier. ""Drinking water, brushing teeth, baby bottles,"" she said. ""You want to boil your water before you consume it."" Florence also did damage to the state's coal ash disposal sites, including pits, ponds and landfills all owned by Duke Energy. Florence poured so much rain that the wall of the landfill near Duke's L.V. Sutton power plant and Sutton Lake failed in several places, and the special black membrane installed to contain the waste was torn open in at least two spots, according to photographs. By Saturday, Duke Energy estimated, the storm had washed away more than 2,000 cubic yards of coal waste - enough to fill more than 150 dump trucks. Coal ash is what's left over after being burned in a power plant, and it contains a variety of heavy metals, including arsenic, lead, mercury and chromium. Duke Energy said it doesn't think the landfill poses a risk to public health or the environment, spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said. But it also dispatched dozens of workers and contractors with heavy equipment to construct an earthen berm that would divert the mix of water and coal ash away from the lake. Duke Energy owns all 31 coal ash disposal basins - pits and ponds - across North Carolina, even though half of the company's 14 coal-fired power plants have been shut down and Sutton has been converted to a natural-gas-fired plant. The disposal sites had many flaws. Initially, the company dumped coal ash in unlined, open-air pits. Wastewater was used in coal ash ponds. ""The coal ash basins at the sites were built in accordance with the required standards at the time,"" Duke spokesman Bill Norton said in an email, adding that they were ""highly engineered structures."" Yet environmentalists said the past four disposal basins at Sutton leached metals into the lake, and from there, into the Cape Fear River. In one case, Duke paid $2.25 million and built new pipes to bring clean drinking water to a small community. Environmentalists say the company long fought to fend off state regulation of the coal ash sites, although the company says it worked ""constructively"" with state regulators. But in February 2014, a Duke Energy coal ash basin flooded when a stormwater pipe cracked open, dumping 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River. The company later pleaded guilty to criminal negligence. Since then, Duke has been moving coal ash out of ponds and into landfills, but it has been slow going. Two of the coal ash pits are closed, but the rest remain. Duke says it will close all of them. At the HF Lee power plant in Goldsboro, where more than 20 inches of rain fell, the Neuse River has flooded three coal ash disposal sites, a Duke spokeswoman said. Like many other older coal ash sites, these have been overgrown with trees. Duke plans to excavate the coal ash in the coming years. Duke said that based on its experience, it thinks the flooded tree-covered pits would have ""no measurable environmental effects,"" said Sheehan, the spokeswoman. Frank Holleman, a senior lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said his group and others remain concerned about flooding at the Lee site, at another near Lumberton, and yet another farther upstream on the Cape Fear River, near Sanford. ""My main immediate concern is that one of Duke Energy's unlined coal ash pits will breach, spilling large quantities of coal ash into one of North Carolina's rivers,"" Holleman said in an email. ""My main concern overall is that we will get through this storm, and Duke Energy and the state of North Carolina will learn nothing from it and go back to business as usual - leaving our rivers and communities at risk when the next flood or hurricane occurs."" --- Authors Information: Steven Mufson covers energy and other financial matters.

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Residents of Erie, Pennsylvania -- where more than 60 inches of snow has fallen in the last couple days -- can expect to see even more lake effect snow Wednesday. Snow warnings and advisories extend all the way from North Carolina to Baltimore and up to New York and Michigan on Wednesday. In addition to the ongoing lake effect snow event, a weak storm system will move through the southern states bringing mixed precipitation to the Carolinas and some snow to the Mid-Atlantic this morning. Winter storm and lake effect snow warnings are in effect for the northern U.S. on Wednesday. The biggest totals of additional snow will be near the Great Lakes, where an additional 1 foot of snow is possible in Michigan and another 4 to 8 inches of snow is possible in western Pennsylvania and New York. The new snowfall could bring totals to as much as 6 feet. Western New York and Pennsylvania will see more heavy snow on Wednesday. The heavy lake effect snow is produced by cold arctic air moving over relatively mild water temperatures in the Great Lakes. Over the next several days, the continental U.S. will continue to receive bouts of arctic air. Wind chill readings Wednesday morning are below zero in Boston, around 12 degrees below zero in Chicago and 30 below zero in northern Minnesota. Wind chill readings in the Midwest on Wednesday are well below zero in many spots. More cold air is coming for the rest of the week. A reinforcing shot of arctic air will spill into the Great Lakes and the Northeast on Thursday. Wind chills are forecast to be below zero in New York City, well below zero in Boston and single digits in Washington, D.C. New England will see wind chills 20 to 30 degrees below zero. The Northeast will see increasingly cold air on Thursday morning.

Tuesday, January 29, 2019, 6:08 AM -Blowing and drifting snow will continue to be the story as strong winds in the wake of Monday's Alberta Clipper whip up much of the heavy snow that fell across the region. Dangerous snow squall conditions are also likely with the passage of the clipper with very cold air quickly spreading through the day on Tuesday. Drivers are being warned to brace for whiteout conditions as well as extreme wind chills into the -30s. More on the timing, below, plus a look at the frigid arctic air that locks in behind this system. 
Keep on top of active weather by visiting the ALERTS page
WEATHER HIGHLIGHTS:
Difficult travel continues through Tuesday as strong winds make for extensive blowing and drifting snow
Heavy snow shifts into eastern Ontario with 10-15 cm possible through the day Tuesday
Dangerous snow squall conditions through Tuesday with serious threat for whiteout conditions
High likelihood record-breaking cold as frigid temperatures persist throughout the week
WATCH BELOW: SNOW TIMING
A robust clipper system out of the Prairies began its track into southern Ontario on Monday will drop up to 25 cm across the region. 
The Peel District School Board and Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board made the preemptive call to cancel most of their school bus routes ahead of the storm. University of Toronto, Humber College, and George Brown College, and Seneca College ended classes early as of Monday evening, and many school officials are urging to stay up-to-date on the changing conditions and possible impacts for Tuesday morning. 
The significant snowfall forecast impacted public transportation options, as the TTC closed part of the subway (Line 3) and is offering shuttle buses instead. 
Airports have been particularly impacted by the heavy snowfall, and approximately one in four flights, leaving or arriving at Pearson International Airport have been cancelled, and dozens of flights are cancelled or delayed at Billy Bishop Airport downtown Toronto. By the evening hours Pearson International Airport had already received 17 cm of snow, which broke their previous daily snowfall record of 13.4 cm in 2009. 
WATCH BELOW: BITTERLY COLD BY LAKE ONTARIO
There is some potential for a rain/snow mix for portions of southwestern Ontario, particularly along the northern shores of Lake Erie, reaching into Niagara through Monday evening. This could prove more problematic as well, since temperatures will rapidly decline behind the low, potentially encasing the freshly fallen snow in ice, making it that much more difficult to clear.
DANGEROUS TRAVEL IN BLOWING SNOW
While it's unlikely there will be widespread closures and cancellations across the GTA, double check Tuesday morning and be prepared for a longer than normal commute.
""Snow will be done soon enough Monday night in the GTA that road crews should have most major highways in decent shape for the morning drive,"" the forecast centre says. ""Side streets, especially in Toronto, will be a different story however, since it usually takes a day for crews to get to every street.""  
""Prepare for quickly changing and deteriorating travel conditions,"" warns Environment Canada. ""Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.""
GTA COMMUTE QUICK FACTS: 
Widespread blowing snow throughout the evening
Lingering snow east of the GTA towards Cobourg for Tuesday morning
In general, this storm will be much worse for Toronto than it will be for most other parts of the GTA thanks to this initial lake-effect streamer which hit Monday afternoon
WATCH BELOW: WIND GUST TIMING
Wind gusts between 40-60 km/h are also expected to persist into Tuesday with stronger gusts over 60 km/h along the shoreline of the lakes. That means that snow from the back end of the system will be whipping around and causing some reduced visibility during the Tuesday morning commute. 
By Tuesday morning, the low will be departing through eastern Ontario and continuing east into Quebec.
COLDEST AIR OF THE WINTER, LINGERING SNOW SQUALLS
As the snow winds down and conditions gradually improve through Tuesday, arctic air will make for some brutal clean-up efforts as temperatures continually fall through the day.
""The coldest air of the winter will arrive for Wednesday and Thursday and this will be accompanied by gusty winds and dangerous wind chills in the -30s,"" says Gillham. ""Bands of lake-effect snow squalls in the traditional snowbelt regions, along with widespread blowing and drifting snow will cause dangerous travel conditions to the east and southeast of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron through Thursday.""
At times these squalls will extend into parts of the Golden Horseshoe, much like what the region experienced over the weekend.
""The cold pattern will break down between February 4-10, with a period of milder weather and the potential for some rain, but we expect that by mid-February, we will return to a colder than normal pattern, which will dominate the rest of February and at least the first two weeks of March,"" Gillham says.

Max Golembo,"Heavy rain and snow are expected this morning in the Northeast, after the East Coast already saw 1 to 2 inches of rain on Monday and parts of southern Vermont got a foot of snow. Winter storm warnings and advisories as well as coastal flooding alerts have been issued throughout the Northeast. Significant lake-effect snow trailing behind the storm has been reported in Ohio and Pennsylvania, each of which has seen a number of weather-related traffic accidents. Advisories and warnings have already been issued throughout the Northeast this morning. Heavy rain is expected today in coastal Maine because of a double low-pressure system. Later today, as the storms merge into a single low-pressure system, it'll move very slowly north into Maine, delivering more precipitation and with more lake-effect snow in its rear-view mirror. Some areas could see 6 to 12 inches of snow -- parts of northern New England may see 18 inches. A massive winter storm is targeting the Northeast this morning. Much of the far Northeast could see at least a foot of snow over the next 48 hours. Out West, warnings and watches for high winds, floods and storms have been issued up and down the coast in anticipation of a series of storms. Winds of 80 mph have already swept through the Pacific Northwest, with some regions seeing 4 to 6 inches of rain. More rain is heading for the Bay Area and snow is likely in the Sierra Nevadas.

"Reno Gazette Journal, Benjamin Spillman, Reno Gazette Journal","It's possible to find wintertime solitude at Lake Tahoe. You just have to know where to look.
 Benjamin Spillman
Lots of people see snow flying in the Sierra as a signal to put away their hiking gear for a few months.
Those people are missing out on some of the best hiking opportunities Northern Nevada and California have to offer. And it doesnt take much in the way of special skills or fancy gear to take advantage. All you really need is a nice pair of snowshoes and a list of places to go.
Thats where Mike White comes in.
The longtime Reno author has published three guides to snowshoeing in the Sierra in the past 20 years. The most recent is titled 50 of the Best Snowshoe Trails Around Lake Tahoe, and is published by University of Nevada Press.
White, who has several published hiking and backpacking guides, holds a special place in his heart for snowshoeing.

Thats because the snow tends to bring a sense of calm and quiet to the forests and mountains. Roads and trails that are bustling with activity in summer are beneath a layer of snow. And if you head out shortly after a storm, snow piled on trees makes the forest seem even more peaceful and quiet.
You get that hush, the sound is absorbed by the snow, White said. You feel like you are more away from it all.
Whites latest guide is different from his first, which Wilderness Press published in 1999.
The new book is aimed at beginners and intermediate recreationists. And there are more high-elevation trails featured. White says he focused on higher ground because global warming is making the low-elevation snowpack less reliable.

Snow levels werent nearly as much of a concern as they are now because of global warming, White said of his first snowshoe guide that published nearly 20 years ago.
Although the changing climate makes low-elevation snowshoeing less reliable, there is still plenty of terrain in the Tahoe area thats typically covered with plenty of snow during the depths of winter.
In addition to trails, the book features places where people can stop for warm meals and hot beverages once theyre off the snow.
He also identified five of his favorite snowshoe hikes. Here's a small sample of whats included in the book.
1. Chickadee Ridge 
Located at the west end of Tahoe Meadows, this hike is a short trip to get great views of Lake Tahoe. Winter snowshoe hikers here also get to enjoy flocks of chickadees that fly down and land on peoples hands.
2. Tahoe Meadows
This bustling area along Mount Rose Highway looks chaotic, especially on weekends. But people who are willing to hike farther from the road can enjoy plenty of solitude without having to climb any hillsides or navigate wooded terrain. Its a great place to introduce kids to winter recreation.
3. Peter Grubb Hut and Round Valley
This scenic area near Donner Pass is a great getaway with views of mountain peaks. Stick to the valley floor if youre not up for climbing and enjoy watching backcountry skiers who frequent the nearby slopes.
4. Spooner and Marlette lakes
These backcountry lakes are accessible from the Spooner Backcountry parking area of Lake Tahoe Nevada State Parks. Spooner is a short walk from the parking area. And people who want more adventure can snowshoe up North Canyon Road for a view of beautiful Marlette Lake.
5. Little Round Top
This snowshoe hike is accessible from the Carson Pass Sno-park. It provides incredible views of the peaks in the Carson Pass area. Its iconic Carson Range terrain, be sure to bring a camera.
The run-up to the new year is the perfect time to place more focus on the priceless gift of good health.

Kelly McLaughlin and Associated Press,"The owners and operators of a tourist boat that sank earlier this month in Missouri, killing 17 people, put profits over people's safety when they decided to put the Ride the Ducks boat on a lake despite design problems and warnings of severe weather, a lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit filed Sunday in US District Court in Kansas City seeks $100 million in damages on behalf of two of nine members of an Indiana family who died when the tourist boat sank July 19 at Table Rock Lake near Branson. Others killed were from Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri. ""This tragedy was the predictable and predicted result of decades of unacceptable, greed-driven, and willful ignorance of safety by the Duck Boat industry in the face of specific and repeated warnings that their Duck Boats are death traps for passengers and pose grave danger to the public on water and on land,"" the lawsuit alleges. Ripley Entertainment Inc., Ride the Ducks International, Ride the Ducks of Branson, the Herschend Family Entertainment Corp., and Amphibious Vehicle Manufacturing are named in the lawsuit, which was filed by a team led by a Philadelphia-based legal firm that has litigated previous lawsuits involving duck boats. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the estates of Ervin Coleman, 76, and Maxwell Ly, 2. Maxwell was identified by authorities as Maxwell Coleman after the boat sank. Court documents accuse Ripley Entertainment and the other defendants of negligence, product liability, outrageous conduct, wrongful death, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and violating the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. Prosecuting lawyer Robert J. Mongeluzzi said at a news conference on Monday that the lawsuit will ""search for answers and justice for the victims"" in the duck boat capsize. ""The quest for justice includes doing everything within our power to ban duck boats once and for all,"" he said. ""As we have done in other duck boat wrongful death cases, we will demonstrate at trial why duck boats are death traps and why they should once and for all be banned from operating on water and on land."" Ripley Entertainment is accused of wrongful death and emotional distress A Ripley spokeswoman said in a statement Monday that the company remains ""deeply saddened"" by the accident and supportive of the affected families. She said the company would not comment further because a National Transportation Safety Board is still underway and no conclusions have been reached. The lawsuit says the boat operators violated the company's own policies by putting the boat into the water despite the weather warnings. It also says the captain violated protocol by not telling passengers to put on life jackets when the water got rough and instead lowering plastic side curtains, ""thus further entrapping passengers in the soon-to-sink vessel."" The lawsuit cites an August 2017 report from private inspector Steve Paul, who looked at two dozen of the duck boats. The report warned Ripley Entertainment that the vessels' engines — and pumps that remove water from their hulls — were susceptible to failing in bad weather. Lawsuit claims boats were not upgraded Members of the Coleman family comfort each other at a casket during the showing for Horace Coleman, Belinda Coleman, Irvin Coleman, Angela Coleman and Maxwell Coleman Ly, Saturday, July 28, 2018, in Indianapolis. Nine members of the Coleman family were killed in a duck boat accident at Table Rock Lake near Branson, Mo. AP Photo/Darron Cummings It also accuses the defendants of ignoring warnings the NTSB issued in 2000 that the vehicles, which are designed to operate on land and water, should be upgraded to ensure the boats remain upright and floating in bad weather. The 2000 recommendation from the NTSB was issued after a duck boat sank May 1, 1999, in Arkansas, killing 13 people. When Robert McDowell, then-president of Ride the Ducks Branson, responded that upgrades would require significant costs, NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said the recommendations were made because the agency believed ""immediate action was necessary to avoid additional loss of life."" The lawsuit says the defendants ignored the warnings. It also alleges McDowell designed and developed the stretch duck boats, including the Stretch Duck O7 that sank, despite having no engineering training. The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the area including Table Rock Lake about 30 minutes before the boat went onto the lake with 31 people on board. Severe weather played a part in capsize The NTSB said Friday that a preliminary review of video and audio recordings from the boat showed that the lake changed from calm to dangerous in a matter of minutes. The agency emphasized it had not drawn any conclusions on what caused the boat to sink. The captain, who operated the boat on the water, survived and has acknowledged he was aware of the weather warnings before the trip, according to the NTSB. Another crew member who operated the boat on land was among those who died. Duck boats were originally designed for the military, specifically to transport troops and supplies in World War II. They were later modified for use as sightseeing vehicles. The attorney for the Coleman family, Mongeluzzi, said that his clients ""strongly urged us to do everything possible to ban the duck boats so no other family has to endure the unimaginable tragedy and grief that has devastated them,"" PR News Wire reported. Attorney Andrew R. Duffy, SMBB legal team member argued at the press conference that defendants ""absolutely knew for decades that fatal design flaws, particularly the continuous, rigid canopy and inadequate bilge pumps, in the World War II-era boats made them more susceptible to sinking and that they were unfit for use even on a clear, calm day. ""Despite their knowledge, Ride the Ducks violated its own safety protocols by failing to even issue life jackets to passengers as the storm approached.""",The owners and operators of the tourist duck boat that capsized in Missouri earlier this month have been sued by the estates of two of the nine members of a family who died in the incident.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Riley MacLeod to Kotaku","Firestorm. Storm surge. EF-5 tornado. If you pay attention to the weather, these are undoubtably terms youve heard, along with dire warnings from meteorologists to heed any and all evacuation warnings. But the Weather Channel has upped the ante by creating what it calls mixed reality segments that drive home the risks in a way looking at maps just cant. While the effort launched in 2015, these videos have exploded from weather Twitter into the general populace in recent months. A storm surge video on Hurricane Florence garnered widespread media coverage and netted more than 2.3 million viewers on YouTube. The videos arent just a potent demonstration of the threat natural disasters pose. By weaving in climate change messaging, they drive home the risks of a warming world. The Weather Channels latest foray into mixed reality looks at wildfires. On-air meteorologist Stephanie Abrams stands amid a forest scene, describing how climate change has made fire conditions more explosive in the U.S. After laying out the weather conditions and sighting an errant ember, the forest lights up around her. The camera zooms out to capture the flames racing up the hillside and into a town on the other side. Along the way, facts appear like VH1's Pop Up Video. Abrams closes it out under a glowing red sky by noting that climate change means scenes like this could become a frightening new reality. In era of social media, images of burnt out homes and forests and neighborhoods washed away by storm surge abound. But they inevitably lack context and amid the cacophony of daily life, their warnings can slip from memory. As someone who has worked in the climate and weather for a decade, the videos take concepts I understand academically and make them feel incredibly visceral. I imagine the impact is even more powerful for people havent spent a ton of time thinking about weather or climate. It brings home the the risk of life and property more than anything I can think of, Greg Postel, an on-air meteorologist with the Weather Channel who has appeared in a mixed reality segment on storm surge, told Earther. To create the segments, the Weather Channel uses a green screen and special cameras coupled with graphics created by Unreal Engine, a graphics package behind Fortnite and other video games. Right now, the company is working with a Norwegian production crew called Future Group, and it takes about 3-4 weeks to produce a 1-3 minute video, according to Michael Potts, the Weather Channels vice president of design. He told Earther theyll ultimately be bringing production in-house and hope to be able to turn these out at a much faster clip. The Weather Channel can also repurpose visuals theyve already got down patthe storm surge scenario Postel starred in was modified during Florence and Michael, for instance. After showing National Hurricane Center inundation maps, both videos zoom out to show what the projected storm surge looked like in mixed reality. With Postel standing within a cone of dry studio like a modern day Moses, the waters rise around him, underscoring why you should evacuate if you have the means. I had all sorts of dreams maybe that someday we could have three dimensional animations of weather, Postel said of when he got his start in meteorology more than two decades ago. Were getting toward that. This winter offers a chance for new uses of mixed reality, from burying meteorologists in digital lake-effect snow to standing amidst the slurry of saltwater and ice that accompanies noreasters. But beyond showing the danger of various types of weather, mixed reality conveys the gravity of climate change. Its one thing for me to write that wildfire season is more than three months longer than it was in the 1970s or that storm surge is lifted by rising seas. Its another to layer that clear cut science within an immersive environment. I dont mean to get all hopeful, but it feels like the recent United Nations report warning the world has a decade to get control of the future climate coupled with the increasingly obvious impacts could be a turning point in how the public and media treat climate change (jurys still out on elected Republican officials ). The Weather Channels augmented reality is yet another way to drive home just how dramatic the choices are.","Firestorm. Storm surge. EF-5 tornado.

Marina Koren,"The most recognizable storm in the solar system used to be so big that it could fit three whole Earths. Now, it has room for only one. Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is shrinking, and has been for decades. The earliest observations of a massive, red spot on the face of Jupiter date back as far as the 1600s. Astronomers don’t know whether this spot was the Great Red Spot we know today, but it’s likely. Routine telescope observations of the oval-shaped storm, where winds can reach 400 miles an hour, began in the late 1870s. For the Great Red Spot, these were the “years of its glory,” according to John H. Rogers, who plotted the history of the storm’s dimensions in The Giant Planet Jupiter. Not long after, perhaps around 1920, astronomers noticed the storm was getting smaller. In 2012, amateur astronomers using backyard telescopes to observe Jupiter saw that the rate of shrinking had actually accelerated. The storm’s glory days are behind it, and scientists are trying to figure out why. They don’t have an answer yet. The Great Red Spot formed like most storms do on Jupiter, as elongated bands of wind that swirled into shape over time. “We think what happens is they hit a stable size, and that’s when it should stop and just kind of stay that size, unless something breaks it apart,” says Amy Simon, a senior scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center who studies Jupiter. But the Great Red Spot is a weird one. According to computer simulations based on our understanding of Jupiter's weather, it's rare for storms to last as long as the Great Red Spot has. And yet, here it is—shrinking, certainly, but persisting, quite stubbornly, for centuries. “We’re still figuring out what it all means,” Simon said. Simon and her colleagues recently tracked the history of the Great Red Spot by combing through a number of sources, including the earliest telescope observations and data from the Voyager spacecraft and Hubble Space Telescope. Their analysis provided another confirmation that the storm has been steadily decreasing in size, since about 1878. They also found that the storm is growing taller as its base shrinks, like a chunk of clay being shaped into a vase on a potter’s wheel. Despite years of observations by telescopes and spacecraft, much about Jupiter remains a mystery, including the mechanisms that drive the Great Red Spot. The storm maintains its latitude because it spins between two jet streams moving in opposite directions. Jupiter’s jet streams are bands of powerful winds that can descend as deep as 3,000 kilometers, or about 1,800 miles, beneath the planet’s cloud tops. The Great Red Spot feeds on a steady parade of small storms that emerge to its northwest, march all the way around the planet for a few months, and then return. “The Great Red Spot is a lot like a big, beautiful mountain lake, with a small inlet and a small outlet,” says Timothy Dowling, a scientist at the University of Louisville who studies planetary atmospheres. “Any slight change to the inlet or outlet of such a lake eventually changes the lake’s appearance dramatically, and it is just the same with the Great Red Spot and its diet of small storms.” Computer models show that changes to Jupiter’s jet streams, either in their speed or location, would result in changes to the inlets and outlets, and consequently to how the Great Red Spot absorbs and releases small storms. This, in turn, would lead to changes in its size and shape. Scientists don’t know for sure, but these jet streams likely play a role in the storm’s gradual shrinking. The jet streams, of course, are among the properties of Jupiter they’re still trying to really understand. Simon’s analysis of the Great Red Spot over the years also revealed that the storm’s shades of orange and red are becoming deeper, particularly since 2014. The cause is—yep, you guessed it—another mystery. In fact, scientists don’t know why the Great Red Spot is red in the first place. Scientists say the oranges and reds come from the chemical composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere. One theory suggests the colors come from the presence of sulfur and phosphorus, while another says they’re a product of chemicals being broken down by sunlight. Either way, the saturation of the storm’s colors may have to do with altitude. Scientists have seen that the deepest reds occur at higher altitudes. In the 1930s, three white, oval-shaped storms emerged elsewhere on Jupiter and eventually merged into a single storm. “Soon after, this storm turned from white to red,” Dowling said. “Apparently, once a high-pressure storm gets high enough, its middle is exposed to enough ultraviolet light from the sun for photochemistry to produce the red.” If this is indeed the case, the Great Red Spot will become the Great Redder Spot as it grows taller. Scientists are hesitant to predict what will happen to the Great Red Spot in the coming years. The storm may continue to contract. It could also rebound and swell. Simon said the next decade will be particularly interesting because we may see the storm transform from an oval into a circle, a shape that would be more difficult to maintain. If and when the Great Red Spot shrinks into oblivion, its winds absorbed into Jupiter’s swirling landscape, humanity—if it hasn’t shrunk into its oblivion itself—will have plenty of photographs to remember it by. Amateur image-processors have spent nearly a year transforming raw data from NASA’s Juno spacecraft into stunning, high-resolution photos of the planet’s stormy landscape. Last November, the spacecraft flew directly above the Great Red Spot, producing wildly detailed images of the storm. Juno came within 5,600 miles of the cloud tops, marking humanity’s closest approach to the storm. It’s likely the closest humans will ever get, but at least we got there before it was too late.",The mystery behind the solar system’s most famous storm,2018-04-09T19:59:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Why Is Jupiter's Great Red Spot Shrinking?,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/jupiter-shrinking-great-red-spot/557456/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/04/41252320871_098b795dce_h/facebook.jpg?1523304070,,Theatlantic.com,Lake Storm,1
"USA TODAY, USA TODAY","Bone-chilling cold gripping much of the U.S. is breaking century-old records. The National Weather Service has issued wind chill advisories and freeze warnings covering a vast area from South Texas to Canada and from Montana through New England.

In Florida, authorities on Wednesday shut down a stretch of Interstate 10 east of Tallahassee because of icy conditions. In Savannah, Mayor Eddie DeLoach urged residents to keep off the roads. City officials, bracing for a rare bout of ice and up to three inches of snow, filled dump trucks with sand to spread on major streets. Icicles form on the tritons in the Forsyth Park Fountain, Jan. 2, 2018, in Savannah, Ga. (Photo: Steve Bisson, AP) “The streets will be slick,” DeLoach said as the storm closed in. “We could have some serious issues for folks who aren’t used to driving in this kind of weather.” Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency through Friday for 28 counties because of the frigid weather. In northern Florida, at least five districts canceled school. In Tallahassee, students were supposed to return from winter break, but got another day thanks to the weather. In central Florida, the state’s largest theme parks announced that water attractions such as Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon, Universal Orlando’s Volcano Bay and SeaWorld’s Aquatica were closed Wednesday because of the cold snap. The North Carolina Zoo offered half-priced admission, giving visitors a rare chance to see polar bears frolic in their kind of weather. The brutal weather, fed by the punishing cold air sweeping in from Canada, put much of the country in a deep freeze, across the northern tier and into the Deep South. Wind chill advisories and freeze warnings were in effect from South Texas to Canada and from Montana through New England. Indianapolis on Tuesday tied a record low of -12 degrees for Jan. 2 set in 1887, leading Indianapolis Public Schools to cancel classes. A commuter makes her way to work in sub-zero temperatures on Jan. 2, 2018 in Chicago. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images) In the Chicago-area, wind chills were expected between -35 and -20 degrees, as forecasters warned of frostbite and hypothermia risks and urged residents to take precautions. Along the East Coast, the ""bomb cyclone,"" known as ""bombogenesis,"" was expected to form off New England Thursday, and could generate blizzards from Connecticut to Maine, and winds on Cape Code from 50 to 60 mph or more. Accuweather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski notes that as the pressure inside the storm system plunges rapidly, forming the ""bombogenesis,"" the surrounding air rushes in at high speed, and can bring property damage, falling trees and power outages. ""Storms that undergo bombogenesis are among the most violent weather systems that affect a broad area,"" Sosnowski says. Aside from bone-chilling temperatures, the system was expected to leave major cities largely unscathed, with little or no snow expected in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and less than four inches in New York City.

Bill Cleverley,"High winds gusting up to more than 100 km/h have cancelled sailings on several B.C. Ferries major routes, including between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen, until at least this evening.
 About 80 sailings had been cancelled by 3 p.m. Just when things will get back to normal is anyones guess.
 For the Swartz Bay route, Swartz Bay/Tsawwassen and Duke Point/Tsawwassen, they will continue to be cancelled until at least 7 p.m., said Deborah Marshall, B.C. Ferries spokesperson.
 As he sat in the Swartz Bay terminal playing cards about 11 a.m., a ferry to Tsawwassen was the only thing standing between Peter Matthews and tickets to the Vancouver Canucks tonight. His bought the tickets as a birthday present for his brother, who lives in Coquitlam, but if he doesnt get to Vancouver by 6 p.m., his brothers date will be their dad.
 Im doing something nice for my brother and now I might miss out, said the 23-year-old University of Victoria student. He was carpooling with three friends who are all trying to get back to the Mainland to spend Christmas with family.
 Australians Rebecca and Andrew Strauss and their kids, 13-year-old Amelia and 16-year-old Lachlan, are in the middle of a 25-day holiday across B.C. and Alberta. They said they dont mind waiting for ferries to resume sailing, as long as they can catch their noon train to Jasper on Friday. They plan to spend Christmas in Lake Louise.
 I love Victoria but we do need to catch that train tomorrow, said Rebecca Strauss.
 Jena and Sean Trowbridge of Colwood were waiting in the terminal with their two daughters, eight-year-old Marleigh and nine-year-old Rylea. They had planned to make an early start on Christmas travel to Harrison Hot Springs, where Jenas parents live. Today, they planned to shop at Tsawwassen Mills and visit the Build-a-Bear workshop with the kids grandparents.
 Jena and Sean took the delays in stride.
 Lets think positively, think calm seas, she said.
 Environment Canada issued a wind warning for Greater Victoria about 4:46 this morning as a powerful low-pressure system was approaching the B.C. coast.
 The low was forecast to make landfall near central Vancouver Island about noon, then move across the Mainland coast this afternoon.
 According to the Environment Canada website, sustained southeast winds of 60 to 80 km/h this morning were to shift to strong southwesterly winds through Juan de Fuca Strait this afternoon and last into the evening. Those southwesterly winds will range from 70 to 90 km/h with gusts potentially above 100 km/h.
 Winds are to ease later in the evening.
 The cancellations and resulting backups undoubtedly will mean more demand on Friday sailings heading into the holiday weekend, which were already expected to be busy.
 While extra sailings can be added to ease the backlog, Marshall recommended travellers planning to take B.C. Ferries through the weekend make reservations, if they can.
 Reservations are always a good idea, although a lot of the reservations have been subscribed because people are planning well in advance for the holiday season, Marshall said.
 Anyone who had a reservation on a sailing that is cancelled gets an immediate refund.
 Reservations for the cancelled sailing are automatically redunded, so the customers dont have to worry about contacting us for that. But if they are cancelled, then they would be getting in the queue for tomorrow or later today, if we get up and running, Marshall said.
 I would recommend keeping an eye on our website. Well certainly update customers as soon as we have more information and Twitters a great way to follow us. 
 You can find the current conditions on the B.C. Ferries website.

(Photo: Google Maps) BRANSON — Eight people are dead and seven others hospitalized after a ""mass casualty"" drowning incident on Table Rock Lake. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader provided the casualty information at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, more than two hours after a Ride the Ducks tourist boat reportedly sank near the Branson Belle with a reported 31 people on board. Rader said a sheriff's deputy was off duty working security at the scene and helped rescue people. Recovery efforts continued after dark, with some passengers still unaccounted for. A dive team from Western Taney County was in the water and a team from the Missouri State Highway Patrol was on the way, as well. Rader said family members of passengers should got to Branson City Hall. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader provided the casualty information at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, July 19, 2018. Springfield News-Leader First responders from multiple agencies responded to the incident, initially reported as a “mass casualty incident” involving a ""tourist type boat"" on Table Rock Lake. Divers staged near the Showboat Branson Belle, according to a statement issued by the Southern Stone County Fire Protection District. The statement, issued at 8:20 p.m., specified that the Branson Belle itself was not involved. Rader said weather was thought to have caused the Ride the Ducks boat to capsize. Weather reports had high wind hitting the area about 7 p.m. Capt. Jim Pulley, owner of Sea Tow Table Rock Lake, said the storm hit the lake with 80 mph winds that kicked up waves five feet high. He said his Sea Tow boats were helping with crowd control near the site where the Duck boat capsized a short distance behind the Showboat Branson Belle, which was tied to its dock. “Western Taney County has got divers in the water where the Duck boat went down,” Pulley said. “The Ducks have a ramp access where they put in, and when the wind hit it pushed the boat right square behind the Branson Belle.” Pulley said several docks also broke loose during the wind storm, and the Water Patrol helped rescue two personal watercraft boats that capsized in the wind. Crews are working at the scene of a ""mass casualty incident” involving a ""tourist type boat"" on Table Rock Lake. Springfield News-Leader A spokeswoman for Ripley's Believe It Or Not said the company is aware of an incident involving one of its tour boats.

Fire district spokesman Eric Nielsen confirmed there had been casualties and said more information about the search effort would be available soon. Steve Linderberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said a severe line of storms blew through the Springfield between 6:15 and 6:30 p.m. ""We had a line of very strong thunderstorms that caused 74 mph winds here in Springfield,"" he said. Linderberg said a top wind speed of 63 mph was measured at the Branson Airport near 7 p.m. Thursday. He said the winds were likely stronger over the lake.

(Photo: Nathan Papes, Springfield News-Leader via USA TODAY Network) Seventeen people, including children, were killed when a duck boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson, Missouri, on Thursday evening. The driver of the Ride the Ducks tourist boat was among the victims as the vessel sank in 40 feet of water, Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader told reporters Friday. The captain of the boat survived. Rader said the amphibious boat is currently resting upright on its wheels in 80 feet of water. The vessel was expected to be pulled from the lake Friday, he added. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson said other details of the accident remained unclear as local, state and federal authorities began an investigation. What happened? The boat, carrying 29 passengers and two crew members, flipped during a severe thunderstorm. Seven passengers – three children and four adults – received medical attention at the nearby Cox Medical Center in Branson, Missouri. Three were admitted as patients. Two are in the critical care unit and one is in ""fair condition,"" said Kaitlyn McConnell, a media relations coordinator at CoxHealth. What was the weather like? The National Weather Service predicted winds of up to 70 mph Thursday, and issued a severe thunderstorm warning around 6:30 p.m. ET, shortly before the boat sank. The storm hit the lake with 80 mph winds that kicked up waves 5 feet high, said Capt. Jim Pulley, owner of Sea Tow Table Rock Lake. Have there been other deadly duck boat accidents? Duck boats — amphibious vehicles that can travel on both land and water — have a long history of fatal crashes and accidents. In 2015, five college students died and 69 others were injured in Seattle when a duck boat crashed with a bus. That same year, a woman in Philadelphia was killed when she was hit by a duck boat while crossing a street. Last Slide Next Slide What are duck boats? Duck boats were first used during World War II to carry supplies over land and water to troops. When the war ended, the military made certain supplies available to the public, and Bob Unger, a veteran from Minnesota, purchased a boat and began giving tours along the Wisconsin River. Since then, duck boat tours have become popular attractions across the United States, especially in cities with rivers like Boston and Washington, D.C. In 2005, multiple ""Ride the Duck"" companies merged under the name Ride the Ducks International, LLC, according to the Missouri Secretary of State's website, including tours in Branson, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Memphis and San Diego. In December, the company was acquired by Ripley Entertainment. Rescue boats are seen on July 20, 2018 at Table Rock Lake in Branson, Mo.

(Photo: Nathan Papes/News-Leader) SPRINGFIELD, Mo. – The captain of the duck boat that sank last week in a thunderstorm, killing 17 passengers, made reference to the weather prior to taking passengers out on Table Rock Lake, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB released its initial review of the Branson duck boat's onboard video recorder Friday afternoon. The recorder included audio that the NTSB used to construct a timeline. The boat entered the water at 6:55 p.m., according to the video's timestamp. At 6:29 p.m., ""the captain made a verbal reference to looking at the weather,"" according to the NTSB's review, which noted that the times in the video ""are as-recorded by the DVR and have not yet been validated against local time."" A thunderstorm warning was issued by the National Weather Service office in Springfield at 6:32 p.m. A thunderstorm watch had been issued several hours prior. The amphibious vessel's video system included four outward-facing recorders and one camera looking inward, according to the NTSB. A small memory card and a removable hard drive were recovered. More: Branson duck boat accident: Area warned of storms 8 hours in advance More: Branson duck boat, which sank in 80 feet of water, raised from bottom of lake The duck boat captain, identified in a Missouri State Highway Patrol report as Kenneth McKee, ""was told to take the water portion of the tour first,"" the NTSB said, ""by an individual who briefly stepped onto the rear of the vehicle."" The NTSB does not identify this person. The driver (identified as Bob Williams by the patrol, and who was in charge of operating the vehicle on land) drove the vehicle while the captain narrated. At about 6:50 p.m., McKee delivered a safety briefing about the lake part of the tour. ""The briefing included the location of emergency exits as well as the location of the life jackets,"" the NTSB's initial report said. ""The captain then demonstrated the use of a life jacket and pointed out the location of the life rings."" McKee took over after that, and the boat went into the lake, at which time ""the water appeared calm."" In the five minutes after the boat hit the water, ""the captain allowed four different children to sit in the driver's seat, while he observed and assisted,"" according to the NTSB. By the end of that time, ""whitecaps rapidly appeared on the water and winds increased,"" according to the NTSB. McKee got back into his seat and Williams lowered the plastic curtains on the side of the duck, the NTSB said. At least 17 are dead after a severe storm flooded a tourist boat on a southwestern Missouri lake. Warning: Video contains emotionally or visually disturbing content. USA TODAY At 7:01 p.m., ""the captain made a comment about the storm,"" the NTSB said. Two minutes later, he made a call on a handheld radio, the contents of which the NTSB called ""currently unintelligible."" At 7:04 p.m., ""an electronic tone associated with the bilge alarm activated,"" the NTSB said. The captain made a downward motion a minute later, and the alarm stopped, according to the news release. McKee made another unintelligible radio call at 7:05 p.m., according to the NTSB. In the final minutes of the recording, ""water occasionally splashes inside the vehicle’s passenger compartment"" and the bilge alarm tone sounds again. The inside video recording cuts out at 7:08 p.m., at which time the vehicle was still on the lake's surface, according to the NTSB. The Missouri State Highway Patrol's initial report shows the duck boat submerged about 7:13 p.m. The driver, Williams, and 16 passengers drowned. McKee, the captain, was among the 14 survivors, according to the highway patrol. Attempts to contact him have been unsuccessful. After divers recovered the duck boat's video recorder, it was taken to an NTSB lab in Washington, D.C. The boat itself was taken to an undisclosed location for further investigation. ""The information does not contain analysis,"" the NTSB said in a news release. ""As such, no conclusions regarding the cause of the accident should be made from this preliminary information."" It was unclear if and when the NTSB would release the audio or video to the public.

James Rogers,"Experts are planning to investigate a mysterious Great Lakes shipwreck that they say may be the oldest in Lake Erie and might be nearly 200 years old. The National Museum of the Great Lakes wants to identify the shipwreck, which archaeologists believe is the Lake Serpent, a schooner that sank in 1829. The shipwreck site was discovered by Cleveland Underwater Explorers (CLUE) in 2015. “Since then we have narrowed the possibilities from over 200 shipwrecks to 3,” explained the Museum, in a statement released Monday. “To make a final identification we need to spend about 10 days underwater excavating the portions of the buried schooner to be sure!” MYSTERIOUS SHIPWRECK DISCOVERED IN LAKE ONTARIO Built in Cleveland in 1821, the Lake Serpent carried cargo for 8 years until its sinking in late September or early October 1829, according to the Toledo, Ohio-based Museum. “Identifying and surveying this shipwreck is important because once completed we will understand why the Lake Serpent sank in 1829 and the site can tell us about early 19th century shipbuilding techniques that were used in Cleveland,” it explained. An Indiegogo campaign has been launched to raise funds for an investigation of the wreck site. The Great Lakes continue to reveal their shipwreck secrets. In May 2008, for example, two explorers discovered the British warship HMS Ontario, which was lost in Lake Ontario in 1780. The Ontario is the oldest shipwreck ever found in the Great Lakes and the only British warship of this period still in existence in the world. EXPLORERS FIND 2ND-OLDEST CONFIRMED SHIPWRECK IN GREAT LAKES Later that year, the explorers - Jim Kennard and Dan Scoville, also discovered a rare 19th-century schooner sitting upright 500 feet under the waves of Lake Ontario. In 2016, Kennard was also part of a team of underwater explorers that discovered the second-oldest confirmed shipwreck in the Great Lakes. The Washington, an American-built, Canadian-owned sloop sank in Lake Ontario during a fierce storm in 1803. The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Kelly McLaughlin,"Witnesses captured video footage of two Ride the Ducks boats facing stormy weather in Missouri. Facebook/KOLR Nine members of the same family were among the 17 killed when a tourist duck boat capsized in Missouri on Thursday, Gov. Mike Parson told Fox News. Two other members of the family — a 13-year-old boy and his aunt — survived when the Ride the Ducks boat sank in Table Rock Lake in Branson, Missouri, during severe thunderstorms. Parson provided no further information about the family, though Katie Cox from RTV6 reported that five adults and four children under the age of 10 were among the victims. Authorities have not yet identified the victims. The amphibious vehicle went down with 29 passengers and two crew members on board. The boat's driver was also among the 17 who died, Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said in a press conference on Friday morning. The boat's captain survived. Bodies of the victims, whose ages range from one year old to 70 years old, have all been recovered from Table Rock Lake. Of the 14 survivors, four adults, including two in critical condition, and three children were taken to Cox Medical Center Branson shortly after the incident. Winds in Branson reached more than 60 miles per hour on Thursday, and the National Weather Service had issued a severe-thunderstorm warning for the area. In video taken from a nearby dock, the duck boat can be seen maneuvering through the choppy lake with water just inches from its windows. Rader said during a press conference that there were life jackets on board the boat when it capsized, though it is unknown if passengers were wearing them. The US Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident. Duck boats were originally used by the military during World War II.

In Garner, reports show up to 13 inches fell; in Clear Lake, there were 10 inches of snow; in Hampton, 7.1 inches; and in Rockwell City, there were 6 inches of snow. The National Weather Service in Des Moines said an additional 4-6 inches is possible by 1 p.m. across northern portions of the state, as winds of 15-25 mph and gusts up to 30 mph will reduce visibilities to one-fourth of a mile at times. The Weather Service said to watch out for slick and snow-packed roads. If you’re traveling, be sure to use extra caution and slow down, as visibility will be reduced due to the falling snow and deteriorating road conditions.

The Associated Press,"A new round of evacuations was ordered in South Carolina as the trillions of gallons of water dumped by Hurricane Florence meanders to the sea, raising river levels and threatening more destruction. With the crisis slowly moving to South Carolina, emergency managers on Friday ordered about 500 people to flee homes along the Lynches River. The National Weather Service said the river could reach record flood levels late Saturday or early Sunday, and shelters are open. Officials downstream sounded dire alarms, pointing out the property destruction and environment al disasters left in Florence's wake. ""We're at the end of the line of all waters to come down,"" said Georgetown County Administrator Sel Hemingway, as he warned the area may see a flood like it has never seen before. In North Carolina, a familiar story was unfolding as many places that flooded in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 were once again inundated. Two years ago, flooding ruined the baseboards and carpet of the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant in Spring Lake. The congregation rebuilt, This year, water from the Little River water broke the windows, leaving the pews a jumbled mess and soaked Bibles and hymn books on the floor. ""I'm so sad just thinking about all the work we put in. My gut is turning up,"" church member Dennis DeLong said. ""We put a lot of heart and soul into putting it back up."" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion in a letter that says the flooding will be the worst disaster in the state's modern history. McMaster asked Congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he knows the damage in his state will add up to billions of dollars, but said with the effects on the storm ongoing, there was no way to make a more accurate estimate. Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center said it was monitoring four areas in the Atlantic for signs of a new tropical weather threat. One was off the coast of the Carolinas with a chance of drifting toward the coast. About 55,000 homes and businesses remain without power after Florence, nearly all in North Carolina, and down from a high of more than 900,000 in three states. Florence is blamed for at least 42 deaths in the Carolinas and Virginia, including that of an 81-year-old whose body was found in a submerged pickup truck in South Carolina. Well over half the dead were killed were in vehicles. Potential environmental problems remained. Duke Energy issued a high-level emergency alert after floodwaters from the Cape Fear River overtopped an earthen dike and inundated a large lake at a closed power plant near Wilmington, North Carolina. The utility said it did not think any coal ash was at risk. State-owned utility Santee Cooper in South Carolina is placing an inflatable dam around a coal ash pond near Conway, saying the extra 2.5 feet (76 centimeters) should be enough to keep floodwaters out. Officials warned human, hog and other animal waste were mixing in with floodwaters in the Carolinas. In Wilmington, things kept creeping back closer to normal in the state's largest coastal city. Officials announced the end of a curfew and the resumption of regular trash pickup. But they said access to the city of 120,000 was still limited and asked people who evacuated to wait a few more days. They also warned people to not get caught off guard as rivers that briefly receded were periodically rising back. The storm continues to severely hamper travel. Parts of the main north-south route on the East coast, Interstate 95, and the main road to Wilmington, Interstate 40, remain flooded and will likely be closed at least until nearly the end of September, North Carolina Department of Transportation Secretary Jim Trogdon said. More than a thousand other roads from major highways to neighborhood lanes are closed in the Carolinas, officials said. Some of them have been washed out entirely. The flood has been giving so much warning to Horry County, South Carolina, that officials published a detailed map of places that flooded in 2016 and warned those same places were going underwater again. One man had time to build a 6-foot-high (1.8-meter) dirt berm around his house. The Waccamaw River has started its slow rise in the city of 23,000, and forecasters expect it to swell more than 3 feet (0.90 meters) above the previous record crest by Tuesday while still rising. Some areas could stay underwater for weeks, forecasters warned. ——— Derosier reported from Spring Lake. Associated Press writers Jonathan Drew, Martha Waggoner and Gary D.

"http://www.nytimes.com/by/john-eligon, http://www.nytimes.com/by/timothy-williams, http://www.nytimes.com/by/mitch-smith","The duck boats are modeled after DUKWs, which brought materials ashore during the invasion of Normandy and hauled howitzers during the landings in Iwo Jima. In the decades since, duck vehicles have been used to transport tourists in places like Philadelphia, the Wisconsin Dells and Branson. In duck boats, passengers sit close to the surface, which critics have said make them more dangerous than a typical boat. Before Thursday’s accident, the deadliest event involving a duck boat was the 1999 accident in Arkansas, when the Miss Majestic sank to the bottom of Lake Hamilton. The N.T.S.B. cited inadequate maintenance as the cause and ordered duck boat operators nationwide, including the company in Branson, to outfit their vessels with additional flotation devices to help prevent sinking. The victims on the Miss Majestic drowned after they became trapped beneath the boat’s heavy canopy as the vessel took on water and eventually sank in 60 feet of water, the N.T.S.B. found. The N.T.S.B. investigation found that the United States Coast Guard had failed to follow its own rules regulating the vessels. The agency’s report said that the Coast Guard had generally displayed a “lack of adequate oversight” and that its inspection of the vessel had been “inadequate and cursory.” The likely reason for that sinking, according to the N.T.S.B., was that the vessel’s owner, Land and Lakes Tours, had failed to maintain the boat. The safety board also found that duck boats converted for passenger service lacked adequate buoyancy to stay afloat once they began to flood. It issued a stern warning to operators of duck boats to fix the problem: “Without delay, alter your amphibious passenger vessels to provide reserve buoyance through passive means, such as watertight compartmentalization, built-in flotation, or equivalent measures, so that they will remain afloat and upright in the event of flooding, even when carrying a full complement of passengers and crew.”","New York Times Missouri Duck Boat Accident Kills 17, Ranging in Age From 1 to 70 New York Times BRANSON, Mo. — As the duck boat made its everyday tour around Table Rock Lake, a popular, summertime tourist stop in southern Missouri, the skies grew dark and a f…",2018-07-20T19:10:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Missouri Duck Boat Accident Kills 17, Ranging in Age From 1 to 70 - New York Times",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/us/duck-boat-branson-accident.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/21/us/21xp-capsize-3/21xp-capsize-3-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Lake Storm,1
Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Residents of the Carolinas struggled to return to normalcy on Tuesday after taking a beating from Hurricane Florence, but their efforts were hindered by standing water and additional flooding expected from already swollen rivers. At least 32 people have been killed since Florence came ashore as a hurricane on Friday, including 25 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed when Florence spawned at least 16 tornadoes on Monday in Virginia, where dozens of buildings were destroyed, the National Weather Service reported. Waterways were expected to keep rising on Tuesday in places like Fayetteville, North Carolina, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state, according to the weather service, hampering efforts to restore power, clear roads and return to homes. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday, including portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Sixteen rivers in the state have reached major flood stages, with three more expected to peak in the next two days, he said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state, but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” he said in a news conference. Officials said residents should not attempt to return to the counties along the state’s coast around Wilmington yet due to ongoing risk of flooding. The storm dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. On Tuesday, the storm’s remnants were continuing to soak the mid-Atlantic region and southern New England with heavy rain. Property damage from the storm is expected to come to $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure. The risk modeling agency Air Worldwide on Tuesday said insured losses from Florence’s winds and storm surge will range from $1.7 billion to $4.6 billion. Those figures do not include losses from continuing flooding. President Donald Trump is expected to travel to the region on Wednesday, CNN and local news media reported. ROAD CONDITIONS ‘STILL CHANGING’ Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. “Road conditions are still changing,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “What’s open now may become impassable.” Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. A portion of a motel collapsed from the weight of water, which made only the roof of the Starlite Motel visible in Spring Lake in Cumberland County, said Sherita Brooks of the county’s Division of Social Services. More than 347,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday morning, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina’s Emergency Management department has opened four mass feeding kitchens and has plans to open four more shortly. Gasoline shortages were a problem. In Wilmington, dozens of cars lined up for fuel at a Kangaroo Express service station. “It is ridiculous that we don’t have enough fuel supplies back in this area,” Stephanie Schauer, 39, a contractor, said as she waited her turn at the gas pump. “It’s been days since the storm.” Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Miami; Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee: Jessica Resnick-Ault and Barbara Goldberg in New York; Anna Mehler Paperny in North Carolina; and Rich McKay in Atlanta; Writing by Brendan O'Brien and Bill Trott; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Jonathan Oatis","Residents of the Carolinas struggled to return to normalcy on Tuesday after taking a beating from Hurricane Florence, but their efforts were hindered by standing water and additional flooding expected from already swollen rivers.",2018-09-18T16:44:03Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Travel snarled by flooding as Carolinas size up Florence's damage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence/travel-snarled-by-flooding-as-carolinas-size-up-florences-damage-idUSKCN1LX126,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180918&t=2&i=1305636267&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE8H1DJ,reuters,Reuters,Lake Storm,1
https://www.facebook.com/zezimak,"Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west. Floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and could spur life-threatening landslides as the storm’s remnants move west. The storm has been linked to several deaths, according to authorities. Follow the storm’s projected path here and read the latest forecasts here. Key updates: Death toll rises to 17 | Flash floods in Mecklenburg County 1:01 a.m.: ‘It don’t look good’ – North Carolina county orders mandatory evacuation in preparation for potential dam breach Hoke County (N.C.) officials announced on late Sunday night a mandatory evacuation for people living near McLaughlin Lake due to a concern that a dam could be breached as heavy rains continue to fall on the area. Hoke County is located about 25 miles west of Fayetteville, N.C. “It is seriously damaged and we’re just getting prepared for the worst,” Scott Locklear of Hoke County’s Office of Emergency Management told The Washington Post. “It don’t look good,” Locklear said, adding that water is already coming over the dam. According to the county’s announcement, both the Coast Guard and units from Fort Bragg are on the scene to assist with evacuations. The National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., also issued an update at 11:30 p.m. Sunday on the status of six rivers in North Carolina. Officials said two of these rivers, Little River and Rocky River, are in “major flood,” meaning there is “extensive inundation of structures and roads” in certain areas along the waterways.

Some areas could receive as much as eight inches. The center reported that as of Sunday night, Florence had dumped a total of 40 inches of rain in southern North Carolina and 20 inches in northern South Carolina. Due to the unceasing rain, officials warn that “flash flooding and catastrophic/historic river flooding” is still a concern for “large portions of the Carolinas.” The warnings also extend to the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, and there is a risk of landslides in affected areas. Throughout Sunday evening, multiple flash flood warnings were issued for North Carolina and southwest Virginia, the National Weather Service tweeted. Many of these warnings are in place until Monday morning. Tornado warnings were also issued for several cities in North Carolina. Parts of North Carolina and South Carolina were also put on a tornado watch until 5 a.m. Monday. A couple tornadoes remain possible in the area through Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is moving north at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. — Allyson Chiu 7:27 p.m.: Storm death toll rises to 17 Officials in Gaston County, N.C., said a 3-month-old was killed Sunday when a tree fell through the family’s single-wide mobile home. The infant and the mother were taken to a hospital, where the baby died, said Maj. Jamie McConnell with Gaston County EMS. At least 11 people have died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and six in South Carolina. — Katie Zezima 6:42 p.m.: At least 16 people have died in the storm At least 16 deaths are now attributed to the storm. A woman in Lexington County, S.C., lost control of her car, hit a tree and was ejected from the vehicle, according to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. At least six people have now died in South Carolina. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at least 10 people have died in that state. — Katie Zezima 6:10 p.m.: ‘Looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte’ The National Weather Service declared a rare flash flood emergency for parts of Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, because streams and creeks were running unusually high, in some locations reaching record levels. Tim Habershaw and his roommate, Zachary Finley, walked in their Carolina Panthers jerseys down Central Avenue in Charlote to view swollen Briar Creek, a normally placid brook that had turned into a torrent. “I drove by earlier on my way home from work, and I was like, ‘Whoa, looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte,’ ” said Habershaw, 51, a restaurant server who lives two miles away with Finley, 25, a line cook. “I went home and took a nap, and when I woke up, I told [Finley], ‘We’ve got to go see this.’ ” About 3,000 miles’ worth of creeks, the vast majority little more than unnamed trickles, crisscross Mecklenburg County in a vast lacework that flows to larger rivers and, eventually, to the Atlantic Ocean. Charlotte’s rolling topography tends to funnel floodwaters into low areas that usually correspond to creek beds. Habershaw has lived in Charlotte for 30 years and said he had never seen Briar Creek as high as it was Sunday afternoon. “It’s kind of scary,” he said, “but beautiful.” The heaviest rain fell in southeastern Mecklenburg County. Some places received 10 inches of rain this weekend. — Greg Lacour 5:30 p.m.: Hundreds of dialysis patients rescued from their homes Late Sunday afternoon, Tom Cotter, North Carolina team leader for the relief group Americares, was waiting in the parking lot of a shelter in Wilson, N.C., for the arrival of 105 dialysis patients who were on their way by bus after having been rescued from their flooded homes in Jacksonville, N.C., 90 miles to the south. Many of them had been rescued by boats from their homes, and some had not received treatment for as many as five days. Cotter had brought health screening devices, essential medicine, adult diapers, cleaning supplies and more. A dialysis center across the street will deliver care. “This is very much an ongoing disaster,” Cotter said. “People are still coming into these shelters.” — Steven Mufson 4:27 p.m.: Warily watching the rivers in South Carolina Renee Matthews has been walking to Lynches River at least once every day, checking how far it has risen. Two days ago, the river that surrounds her family’s property in rural Florence County, S.C., was dry and barely rose past her nephew’s knee. By Sunday, the river bank was nowhere to be seen. The boat landing that leads to the bank was buried in debris, and the four-foot concrete barrier next to it was nearly submerged. “It’s probably come up two to three feet,” she said, aiming her phone to take a picture. “You could walk right there two days ago. You could walk all around that tree two days ago,” she said, pointing at a submerged tree. And the deluge of rain has barely started. Flooding happens every few years in this wooded riverfront neighborhood of mobile homes and big houses, some of which were built several feet above the ground. “The water goes all the way to the top of that house,” Matthews said, pointing at an empty vacation home that stands at least six feet from the wet, grassy land. There has been no flooding yet in the county that shares a name with the storm. But officials are monitoring the Lynches River and other bodies of water inland as rain continues and rainfall from the north flows downstream, said Dusty Owens, director of the county’s emergency management division. Here in Florence County, several bodies of water – the Great Pee Dee River to the east, Lynches River to the south, and Black Creek to the north, are all expected to rise. Lynches River, for example, has risen by more than five feet since Friday. The Great Pee Dee could rise to 27 feet by Thursday, surpassing the flood stage by eight feet. “Next week, it’ll be our problem,” Matthews, 48, said. “This river’s going to keep rising.” — Kristine Phillips 3:47 p.m.: At least 15 people dead due to the storm At least 15 people have now died as a result of tropical depression Florence, which slammed into the Carolinas as a hurricane on Friday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said five people were killed in the storm: Amber Dawn Lee of Union County; Mark Carter King and Deborah Collins Ryan, who lost their lives in a generator-related incident on Saturday; Michael D. Prince, who died this morning when he lost control of his car in Georgetown County; and Jeffrey B. Youngren, who died Sunday morning in Kershaw County after driving into a support beam. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said 10 people in the state have died due to the storm. — Felicia Sonmez 3:17 p.m.: An aging levee system holds, while a temporary barrier weakens As the swollen Lumber River in Lumberton, N.C., rose ever higher in Sunday’s pouring rain, the aging levee system in Robeson County held strong, said county spokeswoman Emily Jones. But a temporary sandbag barrier built by volunteers and National Guardsmen amid pouring rain this week had been “compromised” by the rising water levels, Jones said. Water had broken through that section of the river, which passed by railway tracks on the west side of town, during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, flooding businesses and homes. Sebastian Milton, a volunteer with the Cajun Navy who came to Lumberton from Covington, La., to help with rescue operations, said it’s a matter of time before the levee fails as well. [ Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters ] “That’s a man-made structure,” he said, “it can’t keep holding back the river.” Milton and fellow volunteers were posted on a bridge overlooking the Lumber River and a flooded section of Interstate 95 on Sunday afternoon. Their boats at the ready, they waited in pouring rain for the next emergency call to come in. “There’s still people out there,” Milton said, gesturing toward the expanse of dark water and trees that hid flooded homes. — Sarah Kaplan 2:49 p.m.: In Pembroke, N.C., ‘We’re having problems already.’ In Pembroke, N.C., emergency officials conducted about 120 evacuations and 20 rescues – complicated procedures like pulling people out of submerged cars – since the storm began. Charles Gregory Cummings, the town’s mayor, said officials had been working all week to make sure that the most vulnerable people in the community were safe from the storm. Police officers gave homeless citizens rides to the local shelters and conducted daily drives through public housing complexes, using a bullhorn to inform people about the coming deluge. Pamphlets were posted at every mobile home park bearing information about the forecast and where to seek shelter. Officers checked in daily at a local senior home to make sure their generators were working and they had enough food. On a drive through town to examine flooding “trouble spots,” Police Chief Ed Locklear noted that most of the public housing in Pembroke is located in the low-lying north side of town. There, canals and underground systems that drain water into the nearby swamp are easily overwhelmed by downpours. Several officials said that these canals were still clogged with downed trees and debris from Hurricane Matthew – the town hadn’t had the resources to fix the problem earlier, and only just received recovery funding from the federal government. Now Locklear cruised past a street to one of those housing complexes; it was submerged beneath what looked like a foot of muddy brown water. Sandbags rested against the homes’ front doors. “These are places that always flood,” Locklear said. “And you can see we’re having problems already.” — Sarah Kaplan 2:34 p.m.: Trump monitoring ‘the preparedness and response efforts’ The White House, in a statement, said President Trump is monitoring the storm and its effects: “Today, President Trump continues to monitor the preparedness and response efforts for Hurricane Florence. He was briefed again this afternoon by Sec. Nielsen, Admiral Schultz and Administrator Long. Yesterday, he spoke with Mayor Brenda Bethune of Myrtle Beach, SC and Mayor Dana Outlaw of New Bern, N.C. They discussed the rescue and response efforts in those communities and the President offered the full support of Federal government. Mayor Outlaw thanked President Trump for immediately authorizing the emergency declaration.” 2:31 p.m.: Mandatory evacuations in Fayetteville City officials in Fayetteville, N.C., said at an emergency meeting of the city council on Sunday that the Cape Fear River is expected to crest at 62 feet on Tuesday and recede sometime after 8 p.m. Friday. The river is already above flood stage, and there continues to be flash flooding and critical river flooding in the area, they said. Officials have been notifying residents that there is a mandatory evacuation order for those living within one mile of the Cape Fear and Little rivers. For other neighborhoods there is a voluntary evacuation order. There is also a curfew in effect until further notice. Thirteen roads in the city are closed so far due to high water or flooding, 50 to 60 traffic lights are out, and the city is closely monitoring the levels of nearby dams. Currently there are fewer than 10,000 people without power. Officials also said they have been pushing back against rumors that the city’s water supply is going to be shut off later Sunday afternoon; there are no plans for water to be shut off, they said. One official said that 160 people were transported from a nursing home to shelters last night. The city is working with EMS and others to provide transport to people in wheelchairs and those who need help getting out of bed. Officials are also working to open up more shelters for as many as 7,500 people who may be displaced. — Felicia Sonmez 1:46 p.m.: The storm is spawning an array of safety and environmental hazards Federal officials described an array of life-safety and environmental hazards spawned by Hurricane Florence in a Sunday afternoon teleconference. Among them: The floodwaters are potentially contaminated and could present a health hazard. “If you can avoid contact with floodwaters, do so,” said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. He said there are an estimated 3,300 “hog ponds” in North Carolina that hold manure. There is concern that heavy rainfall could cause them to overflow and send hog manure into waterways. Officials so far are “fairly confident” that farmers prepared adequately in advance of the storm to prevent the ponds from overtopping, Cheatham said. “But we’re not out of the woods yet.” Cheatham said that, at last count, there had been 28 boil-water orders issued by local water systems. Meanwhile there has been a significant spill of coal ash from a storage pond at a closed Duke Energy plant near Wilmington, N.C. Cheatham said 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash spilled into a ditch after floodwaters eroded a portion of the pond wall. That ditch leads to a cooling pond that has an outflow into the Cape Fear River, but he said there’s no evidence so far that the coal ash has reached that cooling pond. Duke Energy said in a statement Saturday that the company “does not believe this incident poses a risk to public health or the environment.” Federal officials are urging evacuees to stay where they are and not attempt to return home. “Don’t feel a need to rush home to file a claim” said National Flood Insurance Program chief executive David Maurstad. Coast Guard Adm. Meredith Austin said three major ports in the Carolinas remained closed, including the Cape Fear port near Wilmington. That closure is significant because the Cape Fear water utility has put out an urgent plea for fuel. “Cape Fear is the number one priority of getting a port open,” she said. “We are aware of the need to get fuel into the port.” FEMA associate administrator Jeff Byard provided the big picture: “This is a long event. We are definitely likely to have isolated communities.” — Joel Achenbach 1 p.m.: ‘This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now.’ North Carolina officials said floodwaters continue to rage and residents across nearly the entire state are in danger from torrential rainfall, rising rivers, floodwaters and, in the mountains, mudslides. “This storm has never been more dangerous than it has right now,” in many areas of the state, Gov. Roy Cooper (D), said at a midday news conference. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be on alert for sudden flooding.” Cooper said numerous rivers throughout the state – including the Cape Fear, Lumber, Neuse – are still rising and not expected to crest until later Sunday or Monday. The storm has dumped nearly two feet of rain in many places, and some places are being pummeled with to three inches of rain an hour. Flooding is getting worse in parts of the state, including Pollocksville, Lumberton, Kinston and Goldsboro. The danger is growing in North Carolina’s western mountains, where rains could lead to dangerous mudslides. Officials urged North Carolinians to stay off the roads. Many are closed; at least 171 primary roads are closed throughout the state, including portions of Interstates 95 and 40. People are urged not to drive east of Interstates 73/74 or U.S. Route 64 South. Many secondary roads are closed because of flooding. Cooper estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people have evacuated certain areas, a figure that will rise with expected mandatory evacuations in some places as rivers rise. About 15,000 people are staying in about 150 shelters across the state, he said. Four medical shelters are open in North Carolina, serving at least 170 patients. More than 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters, Cooper said. At least 700,000 people remain without power and residents should expect to be without for days because so many roads are impassible. “People need to understand that some areas are likely to be without power for a while,” Cooper said. The governor said food, water and high-water vehicles are being delivered to hard-hit areas. The Coast Guard has rescued at least 50 people via helicopter. — Katie Zezima","Washington Post Florence dumps torrential rain, raises floodwaters across the Carolinas Washington Post Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west.

"USA TODAY, Bart Jansen, USA TODAY","At least 17 are dead after a severe storm flooded a tourist boat on a southwestern Missouri lake. Warning: Video contains emotionally or visually disturbing content. USA TODAY The duck boat that sank in Table Rock Lake in Branson, Mo., is raised July 23, 2018. (Photo: AP) WASHINGTON – The Coast Guard made several safety recommendations for amphibious vehicles Wednesday as it convened its formal investigation into the sinking of a duck boat in Missouri that killed 17 people. The Coast Guard said the industry need not wait for the Marine Board of Investigation, the agency's highest-level inquiry, to reach its conclusions involving Ride the Ducks Branson before taking immediate action on safety measures. The recommendations included making sure owners and operators of passenger vessels review routes and conditions allowed under their Coast Guard certificates. Other suggestions included conducting crew training for emergencies and encouraging frequent communications between boat masters and headquarters for hazards such as changing weather. “Additionally, ensure everyone is aware of all operational limitations of each vessel,” the Coast Guard said in a statement. The duck boat sank in Table Rock Lake during a storm July 19. The accident killed 17 people including one crew member and 14 people survived. The Marine Board of Investigation is a five-member group that will review historical events relating to the accident, the regulatory compliance of the duck boat, crew duties and qualifications and weather conditions. The panel will determine what factors contributed to the accident, whether there is evidence of misconduct or negligence and whether there is evidence the Coast Guard or other government contributed. “The Coast Guard will conduct a thorough and detailed investigation to identify all potential causal factors associated with this tragedy,” said Capt. Wayne Arguin, chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board will continue to investigate the accident, too. The five-member board determines the probable cause of an accident and makes recommendations about how to avoid another one. The board announced July 27 that it had retrieved information from the boat’s digital video recorder with audio. The video shows the captain explaining the location of emergency exits and life jackets. The water was calm when the boat entered, but whitecaps appeared about a half-hour later as winds increased. At one point a bilge alarm sounds. The bilge pumps in other duck boat accidents had trouble keeping pace with the amount of water coming aboard. The captain is seen reaching down and the bilge alarm ceases. Investigators have made no conclusions yet about what caused the accident, and the investigation could last a year or longer.

Jeff Baenen and Rick Callahan / AP,"(MINNEAPOLIS) — A deadly storm system churning through the central U.S. has blanketed parts of the Upper Midwest in heavy snow and ice and battered areas farther south with powerful winds and even tornadoes. About 200 flights were cancelled Sunday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where two runways were open but nearly 13 inches of snow combined with strong winds were making it difficult to keep the runways open and the planes de-iced, spokesman Patrick Hogan said. On Saturday, the storm caused the cancellation of nearly 470 flights at the airport. The wintry grip on the Twin Cities continued to keep the boys of summer off the diamond, forcing the postponement of the third straight Twins-White Sox game. The Yankees and Tigers were rained out Saturday in Detroit and had planned to play a double-header on Sunday, but the first game of Sunday’s twin bill was also postponed, leaving just the night game. Two northeastern Wisconsin communities, Tigerton and Big Falls, received more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow over the weekend, the National Weather Service in Green Bay reported. Parts of the state that were already blanketed were getting a second helping of snow on Sunday. The storm finally let up in South Dakota, allowing the airport in the state’s largest city, Sioux Falls, to reopen for the first time since Thursday. Interstates 90 and 29 in parts of eastern South Dakota also reopened, and no-travel advisories were lifted across the state border in southwestern Minnesota. The weather service predicted that a large swath of southern Minnesota, including the Twin Cities, could get up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimeters) by the time the storm moves eastward into New England. Keith White, a weather service meteorologist in Marquette, Michigan, said moderate to heavy snow was falling Sunday morning in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. He said more than a foot was possible by early Monday in the communities of Ishpeming and Negaunee, west of Marquette. Powerful winds knocked out power to thousands of customers in Michigan, which was expected to get more snow and ice throughout the weekend. The weather service also warned of potential coastal flooding along Lake Michigan in Wisconsin and Illinois, where Chicago residents were warned that waves could reach as high as 18 feet (5.5 meters). There have been three deaths blamed on the storm system, which stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. A sleeping 2-year-old girl in Louisiana was killed when a tree fell on her family’s recreational vehicle early Saturday. A Wisconsin woman was killed when she lost control of her minivan on slick roads and veered into an oncoming SUV. And an Idaho truck driver was killed when his semitrailer struck a semi in western Nebraska that had been stranded on a highway by the bad weather. In Arkansas, a tornado ripped through the tiny Ozark Mountain town of Mountainburg on Friday, injuring at least four people. Video showed uprooted trees, overturned cars, damaged buildings and downed power lines. Powerful winds also damaged several buildings at the University of Central Arkansas, though no injuries were reported there. The storm made its mark in Texas, where hail the size of hen eggs fell south of Dallas, according to meteorologist Patricia Sanchez. In Austin, fire officials said strong winds helped spread the flames after lightning struck and badly damaged two houses.",The storms have slammed parts of the Upper Midwest,2018-04-15T18:28:57Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Spring Storm Blankets Parts of Midwest in Snow and Ice, Resulting in Canceled Flights",http://time.com/5240900/spring-storms-midwest/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/winter-storms-travel.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Lake Storm,1
STACEY PLAISANCE / AP,"(GULFPORT, Miss.) — Boaters evacuated to safe harbors, and motorists fled barrier islands Tuesday as the Gulf Coast hustled to get ready for Tropical Storm Gordon, which was on track to hit Mississippi as a Category 1 hurricane sometime after nightfall. People rushed to fill sandbags while red no-swimming flags flew along the shore where waves were kicked up. Some schools called off classes, and homeowners worried that their yards could soon be submerged under seawater. Pensacola Water Safety Capt. Jake Wilson told local television station WEAR that the wind was generating a lateral current “where it’s just going to push you down the beach.” A hurricane warning was in effect for the entire Mississippi and Alabama coasts. The National Hurricane Center predicted a “life-threatening” storm surge of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters) along parts of the central Gulf Coast. Flooding was also a risk. As much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday as the tropical weather moves inland toward Arkansas. By late Tuesday morning, the storm was centered 145 miles (235 kilometers) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, with top sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph), forecasters said. It was moving relatively quickly, at about 15 mph (25 kph). A storm surge warning was issued for an area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama. The region could see rising waters of 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 meters). “The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,” the hurricane center said. Governors in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana all declared states of emergency, allowing them to quickly mobilize state resources and National Guard troops to help during and after the storm. Gordon became a tropical storm Monday near the Florida Keys, so residents and businesses rushed preparations Tuesday, taking in patio furniture, filling and placing sandbags and making sure they had bottled water and other supplies. On some of the barrier islands, mayors warned that only hours remained before their links to the mainland could be severed by rising water or debris. The storm appeared to be coming toward Dauphin Island, Alabama, closer to low tide around 7 p.m. Tuesday. Police planned to monitor the only highway to the mainland. “When you get the higher waves, water starts splashing across. Sometimes it starts pushing not only water across but debris, logs and things of that nature, which makes it very treacherous to get across,” Mayor Jeff Collier said. Grand Isle Mayor David Campardelle called for a voluntary evacuation of his barrier island in Louisiana, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of New Orleans. Ongoing construction on Highway 1, the lone road that connects Grand Isle to the rest of the state, could cause problems for people evacuating. “If you leave, you have to leave before the road floods,” Landry said. Gordon was poised for only a glancing blow to New Orleans, where Mayor LaToya Cantrell said the city has “the pumps and the power” needed to protect residents. Authorities issued a voluntary evacuation order for areas outside the city’s levee protection system, including the Venetian Isles, Lake Saint Catherine and Irish Bayou communities. Cantrell urged residents within the levee protection area to stock up on supplies and shelter in place. Separately, Hurricane Florence formed Tuesday far out over the eastern Atlantic, but it was not currently a threat to any land. ___ Associated Press writers Jeff Martin and Ben Nadler in Atlanta; Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi; Rebecca Santana in New Orleans; and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.",It's expected to hit Mississippi as a category 1 hurricane Tuesday night,2018-09-04T16:58:51Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The Gulf Coast Is Preparing As Tropical Storm Gordon Could Become a Hurricane,http://time.com/5386344/the-gulf-coast-is-preparing-as-tropical-storm-gordon-could-become-a-hurricane/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/tropical-storm-gordon1.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Lake Storm,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionCane toads ride on python's back after thunderstorm
Some called it the Outback Uber - ten cane toads have been caught riding a python.
Paul Mock of Kununurra in the far north of Western Australia filmed the bizarre sight after a heavy thunderstorm on Sunday night. 
The animals were trying to escape an overflowing dam on the Mock's property when the toads came up with the novel form of transport.
Mr Mock sent the images to his brother Andrew, who then posted them online.
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Mock explains he had ventured out after a bad thunderstorm that dropped close to 7 cm (2.7"") of rain on Kununurra in the space of an hour.
""I went out and the lake had overflowed,"" he says, and realised the toads, who nested around its edge, were fleeing the rising waters.
""Thousands of toads were all trying to find somewhere to go,"" he says. ""And then I saw Monty our local python with a bunch of hitchhikers on his back.""
The snake, which stretches to a length of 3.5m (11'4""), is a regular on Mr Mock's property.
""Monty's well known to us,"" he says. ""He hangs around back of our pool and scares my wife when she's hanging up our washing.""
And the python seems smart enough not to have tried to eat his passengers - cane toads carry a deadly toxin which can threaten even larger species like snakes, lizards and crocodiles. 
While online some were horrified or even suggested the photo was staged, most jumped at the chance to make jokes. 
However, there were also suggestions the cane toad's actions were not so innocent.
Conservation biologist Jodi Rowley tweeted that the amphibians were trying to mate with Monty.
Ms Rowley posted that the males can get ""a bit carried away"".","Paul Mock filmed the cane toads riding the python, known as Monty, after a bad storm in Kununurra.",2018-12-31T10:51:55Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Australian cane toads hitch a lift on python's back after storm,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46720029,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p06ww2sf.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Lake Storm,1

If you live in the Northeast or Midwest, you're not dreaming: It's probably going to be a white Christmas. But the trade-off is hazardous driving conditions across New England and the Great Plains. Out west, the Rocky Mountains have been pounded this weekend. The storm system attacking the Mississippi River and to the east started in Nebraska, swept across Iowa and will dump several inches of snow on Chicago. Aside from a lake-effect dump of as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters), accumulation in the nation's third-largest city will be slightly less than predicted, said Ricky Castro, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. It's headed for the East Coast Sunday night to dump more through midday on Christmas. It's a welcome site for snow-lovers in a season short on the white stuff — just over 2 inches (5 centimeters) previously in Chicago, Castro said. ""It's a more wintry feel for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, with a cold week ahead,"" Castro said. Despite the whiteout conditions at Soldier Field along Lake Michigan, the Chicago Bears slid to their fifth victory of the season over the winless Cleveland Browns. No injuries or deaths had been reported because of the weather, but travel was hazardous. Most of Indiana was under winter weather advisory with officials urging motorists to stay put unless they absolutely had to travel. Northern Indiana was expecting up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) with slightly less in the southern part of the state. O'Hare and Midway international airports in Chicago were reporting minor delays averaging 15 minutes. Arriving flights at O'Hare were delayed by an average of 80 minutes by late in the afternoon Sunday. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport was experiencing gate delays of about 15 minutes. New England could get up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow. Forecasters say the storm will sweep across the region late Sunday until midday on Christmas. Strong winds are predicted for Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island with gusts up to 65 mph (105 kph). ""Along the coast, New York could end up with wet snow, but areas inland could see substantial snowfall,"" Castro said. Mountain areas in parts of Colorado, Montana and Wyoming received more than 1 foot (30 centimeters) of snow, which started Saturday. It was good news for holiday skiers and resorts which have struggled with a slow start this season. But it meant a heightened warning of avalanches in higher elevations outside of ski areas. In Washington state, forecasters said 1 to 3 inches of snow could be on the ground by Christmas morning in parts of the state.","If you live in the Northeast or Midwest, you're not dreaming: It's probably going to be a white Christmas.

https://www.facebook.com/WTHR13/,"BRANSON, Mo. (WTHR) – An Indianapolis woman is on her way home after suffering a tragic accident that killed 9 of her family members. Tia Coleman was discharged from the hospital after suffering a tragic duck boat accident in Missouri. According to Cox Health, all patients at Cox Branson who were being treated after Thursday's water disaster have been discharged. Tia Coleman lost her husband and three children in the tragedy. The viewing arrangements have been set for her husband and children. The viewing will be at Grace Apostolic Church on Friday, July 27 at 8 a.m. The church is at 649 E. 22nd St. in Indianapolis. Coleman spoke to the media from the hospital Saturday. Eleven members of Tia Coleman's family were on the boat when it capsized as a storm rolled through Branson, Missouri Thursday night. ""I've always loved water but when that water came over the boat, I didn't know what happened,"" said Coleman. ""I had my son right next to me. When the water filled the boat, I could no longer see, I couldn't feel anybody, I couldn't see and I just remember thinking 'I gotta get out.'"" Coleman said she was trapped in the boat for a while before she was able to swim and float to a rescue crew. When she got to shore, at first, she said she was thankful. ""I just remember kicking and swimming to the top and as I was swimming up, I was praying 'Lord please, I gotta get to my babies, I gotta get to my babies,'"" said Coleman. Coleman recounts being told by boat officials where the life jackets were but says the family never grabbed them because they had been told they wouldn't need them. ""I'm going to show you where they are but don't worry, you're not going to need them,"" Coleman remembers the boat captain say. As Coleman recalls the horrific day, she said to the media, ""Based on what happened to my family, I never want to be on a boat ever again, nobody's boat."" In addition to her husband and children, Coleman's sister and nephew, as well as her sister-in-law, father-in-law, and an uncle perished in the accident. Eight other passengers died, as well, 17 tragedies Tia feels did not have to happen. Coleman is unsure of when she will be released from the hospital but says that she is making small steps to recovery after swallowing so much water after their boat capsized. Coleman would not answer questions regarding her nephew, who also survived the accident, in order to protect his privacy. Coleman says her nephew is going through a lot right now and is holding up. Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb released a statement Saturday morning regarding the Coleman family: Janet and I are stunned and heartsick over this tragedy. To lose so many loved ones in an instant is horrifying, and I cannot imagine the depth of pain the Coleman’s friends and family are going through now. I ask my fellow Hoosiers to join me in offering prayers and condolences, especially for the two survivors. Coleman works as a paralegal for the Marion County Prosecutor's Office. The office issued their condolences in a statement Saturday: We are devastated by the unimaginable loss suffered by our friend and colleague Tia Coleman. The thoughts and prayers of our entire Marion County Prosecutor’s Office family are with Tia, her extended family and friends, and the other survivors of this tragic incident. Friends of the Coleman family have started a GoFundMe account to help Tia and her family lay nine family members to rest. Funeral services for Tia's husband and their three children will be held Friday. Monday morning, Ride The Ducks Branson released another statement regarding the tragedy. We remain deeply saddened by the tragic accident that occurred at Ride the Ducks Branson. Our focus from the start has been on the guests, families, and employees who were affected last Thursday. Today, we continue to focus our efforts on the families. We are offering to pay for all related medical bills and funeral expenses, return all personal items from the rescue scene, and assist with any related travel or accommodations that will help the families in their time of need. An event like this deeply touches everyone and we are also providing grief counseling to our employees who have been affected by this tragic accident. We are fully cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Highway Patrol and all federal and state authorities involved in the investigation.

"grapier@businessinsider.com (Graham Rapier), Graham Rapier","Fred Prouser / Reuters Shares of Tesla sank as much as 4% in trading Wednesday as the flurry of news surrounding Elon Musk’s plan to take his electric car maker private continued. Fox Business reported Wednesday that the US' top equities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, had issues subpoenas to Tesla regarding its privatization plans and Musk's ""funding secured"" tweet. Reporter Charles Gasparino said the investigation — which was first reported on by the Wall Street Journal last week and confirmed by Bloomberg — had reached ""formal"" stages. Twitter Business Insider has not been able to confirm the Fox Business report. Both Tesla and the SEC declined to comment on the report. Further complicating Tesla’s situation were subsequent tweets from Musk, saying he was excited to work with Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Silver Lake on the transaction. However, Bloomberg reported that no formal agreement had been signed between the firms as of Tuesday. Goldman Sachs declined to comment when asked by Business Insider if it had been hired by Musk or Tesla. Securities lawyers have told Business Insider that Musk’s tweet, followed up with an explanation that funding was not actually secured at the time of the announcement, could leave Tesla and Musk liable to lawsuits from the SEC and shareholders. Tesla initially skyrocketed to a new record high of $389.57 shortly after the announcement last week, but has since given up all of its gains and is now trading around $333 — 26% below the $420 price laid out by Musk.

Matthias Gafni,"LAKE TAHOE — Heather Turning and her boyfriend were taking a rest about a quarter of the way down Squaw Valley’s K-22 mountain, beneath the Olympic Lady chairlift, when they both heard a noise and looked up the hill. Rockets of snow exploded through the trees, followed by a loud roar, as if rushing water had been released from flood gates. The gully beside them disappeared in a mist of snow. “Avalanche!” someone yelled. “It changed the entire terrain,” Turning said. “We could feel pellets of snow when it roared by us.” In under a minute, Turning said they watched a 40-yard-wide wall of snow break off a rock outcropping above them and funnel into a steep gully tossing skiers and snowboarders aside, burying one, before coming to a stop about 50 to 100 yards below them. The pair had just witnessed a rare “inbounds avalanche,” inside the resort boundaries, near the Olympic Lady chairlift. Five people were hit by the mass of snow with two being hospitalized, one with a serious lower body injury, according to Squaw Valley. The resort received 68 inches of snow from Thursday to Saturday. The massive winter storm across California created some perilous avalanche dangers. On Saturday, Mammoth Mountain had its own avalanche in the Southern California resort. Six employees working a chairlift were partially covered in snow. No one was injured. On Friday, after the Squaw Valley avalanche stormed past Turning and her boyfriend, the mist quickly cleared and the Roseville pair saw about six people still standing in the area. People started yelling and checking on each other and everyone seemed OK. Turning, who had taken an avalanche survival course about six years ago, started searching for her beacon or probe in case there were rescues needed. Suddenly, screams came from the bottom of the ravine. “I can’t find my husband! Find my husband! Help!” a woman yelled. “I just thought: ‘Crap,’ ” Turning said. The couple snowboarded down toward the area and Turning unbuckled her snowboard, crawling through waist-high snow at the foot of the avalanche. Four or five people were already frantically digging, flinging snow into the air, captured in a short 10-second video clip. A skier had spotted the tip of a man’s snowboard sticking out of the snow. By the time Turning reached the man, his face and upper body had been cleared of about two to three feet of snow. Turning worked to free him from his bindings and gently brushed snow off of his face and beard as ski patrol arrived with shovels. Video posted on Instagram captured those final moments of the rescue, with the snowboarder smiling as jubilant rescuers continued digging him out. A snow patrol rescuer told the man he had been under the snow for six minutes. “He had blacked out and when we pulled the snow away from his face he came to,” Turning said. “He was so lucky.” The first thing the snowboarder asked Turning was: “Is my wife OK?” The man told her when the avalanche hit he was “tossed all about.” Once freed, the rescuers all exchanged a quick fist bump with the unidentified skier who had spotted the snowboard. His wife gave the uninjured husband a big hug. The pair had just started a three-week ski vacation at a variety of resorts in the Sierras, Turning said. Turning, who was celebrating her 39th birthday that day, said the entire episode was “surreal.” The pair even snowboarded down with the buried snowboarder and his wife to the resort lodge. “We took the nice and easy way down,” Turning said. “It was kind of quiet. He was kind of in shock, but healthy and intact.”","The Mercury News Rescuer describes harrowing avalanche rescue of… The Mercury News This screenshot from a video of a reported rescue shows people digging out someone who was buried during a March 2, 2018, avalanche at a Squaw Valley resort near Lake Tahoe.

Max Golembo,"A major storm system moving through the central and southern U.S. delivered more than two dozen tornadoes, flooding and heavy snow throughout the weekend. On Saturday, at least 22 tornadoes were reported in Illinois, and two were reported on Sunday in Georgia, which also saw almost a foot of rain over the weekend, leading to flooding. Parts of Florida saw 10 inches of rain from the same storm. Parts of the Rockies and into the upper Midwest saw at least a foot of snow during that same period. That system is moving through the East Coast this morning, with the Southeast again on the lookout for potential flooding as the Great Lakes and Northeast may see more snow. The Southeast could be in for some flooding this morning. Flood watches already have been issued this morning in Florida and in Georgia. Later this afternoon, severe storms packing hail and tornadoes are expected in northern and central Florida. Lake-effect snow is likely to continue behind that storm in the Northeast, including western New York and Pennsylvania. Much of the strong East Coast storm will be out to sea later tonight. Another new storm is forecast to strike the West Coast on Tuesday and then head east with more rain and snow that could lead to flooding. This storm first will hit the Bay Area before moving into southern California. Mudslides and flooding are possible. The West Coast could be seeing heavy rain by Tuesday afternoon.

"JOHN SCHWARTZ, JAMES GLANZ and ANDREW W. LEHREN","Shifting Terrain As early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing “wooded areas and a few rural home sites,” according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market. Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years. That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve. “This would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,” Mr. Gilmer said. FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek — including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there “when it wasn’t flooded.” By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show. The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place — Ms. Martinez’s street — 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place — Mr. Hickey’s street — and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas. The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Seañez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, “They said, ‘You don’t even have to purchase it,’” Ms. Seañez recalled. Photo The view outside Ms. Martinez’s second-floor window this week. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey’s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. “We see that the flood plain was revised recently,” the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck. A number of residents asked whether managers of The Woodlands since Mr. Mitchell had been as careful as its predecessors in designing the newer developments, and pointed to what they called more aggressive policies since the Howard Hughes Corporation — a brand revived in 2010 by the activist investor Bill Ackman — took over. Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent — a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent. In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Seañez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected — a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns. “They’ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody’s business,” he said. “Our name for it is not The Woodlands, it’s Concrete Land.” The company stated that “the senior development team is ‘essentially the same team’ that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.” Tim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm’s waters. “We met the standard,” he said. “This event exceeded the standard.” Still, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey — and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.

James Rogers,"Torrential rain from Hurricane Lane caused steamy white-out conditions at Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano this weekend. “Steam created from #HurricaneLane rain falling on still hot rocks has created white-out conditions in #Kilauea's #LERZ,” tweeted the U.S. Geological Survey Sunday. “LERZ” refers to Kilauea’s Lower East Rift Zone. “The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) will continue to closely monitor Kīlauea's seismicity, deformation, and gas emissions for any sign of reactivation, and maintain visual surveillance of the summit and LERZ as best we can,” said the U.S. Geological Survey, in a statement. HAWAII VOLCANO: KILAUEA LAVA BOILED AWAY BIG ISLAND'S LARGEST FRESHWATER LAKE Hurricane Lane brought record rain to Hawaii before it quickly dissipated into a tropical storm and moved off from the Big Island. Lane dropped 51.53 inches of rain as of early Sunday morning, according to figures from the National Weather Service. “Preliminary rainfall measurements from the Big Island of Hawaii over the last four days, associated with former Hurricane #Lane, have produced the third highest storm total rainfall from a tropical cyclone in the US since 1950,” tweeted National Weather Service Honolulu Sunday. Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Houston last year, dropped the most rain in that span with 60.58 inches. Hurricane Hiki dropped 52 inches in Hawaii in 1950, and Amelia produced a 48-inch rainfall in 1978. HAWAII VOLCANO ERUPTION: HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY VOLCANOES? Kilauea began spewing lava on May 3. The volcano, one of the most active in the world, has destroyed more than 700 homes. President Trump declared a major disaster area in Hawaii on May 11. In June lava from the Kilauea eruption boiled away Hawaii’s largest freshwater lake in just a matter of hours. In a statement released on June 2, the U.S. Geological Survey explained that lava from the eruption’s fissure 8 entered Green Lake and boiled its water away, sending a white plume high into the sky. Earlier this month USGS reported a slowdown in activity at Kilauea, noting that the volcano may be entering a pause. The slowdown prompted scientists to downgrade their alert level for the mountain. This, however, doesn't mean the eruption is over, they said. Kilauea has paused for days, weeks and even months during previous eruptions.

Jake Kanter,"Duck boat survivor Tia Coleman. AP Tia Coleman, a survivor of the duck boat disaster that killed 17 in Missouri on Thursday, has given an extraordinary account of the ordeal. Nine of Coleman's relatives, including her husband and three children, died in the accident when an amphibious boat capsized on Table Rock Lake. Coleman's 13-year-old nephew, Donovan Hall, was the only other member of her family to survive. Speaking during an emotional press conference at the Cox Medical Center Branson, where Coleman has been receiving hospital treatment, she described the moment the boat sank, her swim for survival, losing her family, and returning home. The family boarded the boat after having their tickets swapped from an earlier tour. She said the 31 passengers on board were told by the captain that a storm was coming, but that life jackets were not needed. Coleman previously told local news channel KOLR that a ""really huge wave"" swept over the boat, and the last thing she heard was her sister-in-law shouting ""grab the baby."" The water filled up the boat and blinded her, she said, but she was thinking ""I got to get out, I got to get out."" Coleman hit her head, but managed to free herself from the boat, entering icy water near the bottom of the lake. ""I knew I was close to the bottom,"" she recalled. ""I just remember kicking and swimming to the top. As I was swimming up I was praying 'Lord, let me get to my babies.' The harder I fought to get to the top, I was getting pulled down. ""And I kept fighting and kept fighting, and then I said 'Lord if I can't make it, there's no use in keeping me here.' And so I just let go and I started floating and as I started floating, I felt the water temperature change and it got warmer. As it got warmer I knew I was to the top. So I stuck my hand out."" When Coleman emerged, she was eventually hauled out of the water by rescuers on a nearby riverboat. ""Somehow I managed to get to the boat and these beautiful people, angels... they pulled me up. And when they pulled me up onto the boat I didn't see any of my family,"" she said. Coleman said her family could have been saved by life jackets. ""The biggest thing that stood out to me is I felt like if I was able to get a life jacket I could have saved my babies because they could have at least floated up to the top and somebody would have grabbed them,"" she explained. Coleman is not sure if she is happy to be alive, but said: ""God must have something for me because there's no way I should be here."" Nearly $240,000 has been raised for the family through crowdfunding website Go Fund Me. Coleman said returning home will be ""completely difficult."" She added: ""I don't know how I'm going to do it. Since I've had a home it's always been filled. It's always been filled with little feet and laughter, and my husband. I don't know how I'm gonna do it.""

"Associated Press, Associated Press","View of the flooded streets of the town of San Felipe, in the state of Baja California, Mexico, on Oct. 1, 2018. (Photo: EPA-EFE) PHOENIX After soaking northwestern Mexico with heavy rains as it neared the Baja California Peninsula, reportedly claiming at least one victim, Tropical Storm Rosa is expected to drench the U.S. Southwest. From Arizona to Utah, some residents filled sandbags in anticipation of heavy rainfall forecasts and potential flooding. The center of Rosa, which was a hurricane until late Sunday, was expected to hit Baja California and Sonora by early Tuesday, bringing 3 to 6 inches of rain, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Its then expected to move quickly northwestward as it weakens, bringing 2 to 4 inches of rain to central and southern Arizona and 1 to 2 inches to the rest of the desert Southwest, Central Rockies and Great Basin. Isolated areas might see even more precipitation. In southern Arizona, heavy rain Monday flooded streets in Yuma and caused power outages in parts of the city. At least six roads in Tucson were closed because of flash flooding from washes that overflowed. The Utah National Guard was activated Monday to assist in flood mitigation efforts in Utah County. The National Weather Service earlier announced flash flood watches through Wednesday for areas including southern Nevada, southeastern California, southwestern and central Utah and the western two-thirds of Arizona. More: Tropical Storm Rosa reminds Arizona of its history of jaw-dropping flash floods Forecasts call for heavy rainfall in the watch areas, which include Las Vegas, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, with possible flooding in slot canyons and normally dry washes and a potential for landslides and debris flows from recent wildfire burn scars. National Weather Service meteorologists in Phoenix said central and northern Arizona stood to get hit with the heaviest amounts of precipitation. Metropolitan Phoenix, where temperatures were above 100 degrees Fahrenheit only a few days ago, had already cooled to the 80s on Monday thanks to Rosa. Moisture associated with the storm arrived ahead of it, bringing rain Sunday night and Monday morning. Phoenix meteorologist Jaret Rogers said more showers were expected across central Arizona before a weakened Rosa was to arrive in the area Tuesday morning. According to the National Weather Service, the entire Phoenix area is expected to see between 1 and 2 inches of rain. But some areas could see between 2 to 3 inches. All that means is conditions are favorable for flash flooding if it rains, Rogers said. It doesnt mean somethings imminent. Rosas maximum sustained winds had decreased to 40 mph as of Monday afternoon, and the storms center was heading north-northeast at 10 mph. The Civil Defense agency for Baja California state said schools were closed Monday in several communities, including the state capital of Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, California; San Felipe, on the northern Sea of Cortez; and south of Ensenada, on the peninsulas Pacific coast. Federal authorities declared a state of emergency for Ensenada and Mexicali. Various Mexican media outlets reported that a woman was swept away by floodwaters and drowned in the city of Caborca, Sonora, on the Sea of Cortez. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Sergio was strengthening in the Pacific and was forecast to reach hurricane force, though it posed no immediate threat to land. Sergio had winds of 70 mph and was centered about 695 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The storm was moving west at 14 mph.

WRAL,"By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press About 3.4 million chickens have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped at least 60 farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Sanderson Farms said Tuesday 1.7 million of the losses occurred at independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn't restored quickly, the company said. The Department of Agriculture said that about 5,500 pigs were also killed in the storm, and that number could changed based on further recovery efforts. The pork industry trade group says farmers have been working before and after the storm to move at-risk animals to higher ground. The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another 25 of the pits containing animal feces and urine have either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. Even though the sun shown in parts of the state Tuesday, major flooding is continuing after Florence's passage and is expected to worsen in some areas. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday with an additional three forecast to peak by Thursday. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant's former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke's assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke's handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029. In South Carolina, workers with electricity provider Santee Cooper erected a temporary dike in hopes of preventing flooding of an old coal ash dump at the demolished Grainger Generating Station near Conway. The dump is adjacent to the Waccamaw River, which is expected to crest at nearly 20 feet (6 meters) this weekend. That's nine feet above flood stage and would set a new record height. ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck","WRAL.com 3.4 million chickens drown as NC rivers swollen by Florence WRAL.com By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press.

"jshamsian@businessinsider.com (Jacob Shamsian), Jacob Shamsian","One Jake Paul isn't enough. Meet Tydus Talbott. He's four years old, loves eating candy and riding down waterslides, and is already a YouTube star. How'd that happen? In the past 10 months, Tydus has made nine different videos with Jake Paul, one of YouTube's biggest celebrities. A single video has 27 million views, among Paul's most popular. The collaboration was so successful, this past spring Team 10, Paul's collective of YouTubers, brought Tydus along to six cities of their 21-city tour, trotting him out on stage in front of thousands of fans. Branded as Mini Jake Paul, Tydus has used his association with the 21-year-old vlogger to amass a following of his own. His family has more than a million subscribers on YouTube, and just passed that on Instagram — and there's plenty of room to grow. His parents, Travis and Corey Talbott, are planning a merchandising line and are in talks with agencies to represent him. So how did a child end up stealing every scene in some of Jake Paul's most popular videos, become his miniature doppelgänger, and regularly perform in front of thousands of screaming fans? And is any of this a good idea for a 4-year-old? The Talbott family went from home videos to viral skits. Even as a toddler, Tydus was photogenic and charismatic, his parents told INSIDER. ""He loves being funny,"" said Tydus' father, Travis. ""he's just kind of a naturally funny entertainer and people-pleaser."" Tydus Talbott vlogging as ""Mini Jake Paul."" Trav and Cor/YouTube As Travis explained, his son's celebrity built slowly over the years, but his earliest brush with virality came when he was just a year old. His parents posted a video of him snowboarding to YouTube shortly after another video of a snowboarding toddler went viral. Their own video was a modest hit, with tens of thousands of views at the time. ""It got a lot of recognition. Even [Olympic snowboarder] Shaun White saw it,"" Travis told INSIDER. ""So we always knew as he was growing up that he was kind of a special boy."" That first video made fans eager to know more about the Talbott family. So Tydus, his little sister Ryatt, Corey, and Travis continued to vlog together, with some family friends showing them around the YouTube community. At first, the family made simple home videos, some of which garnered hundreds of thousands or even millions of views on YouTube. Travis and Corey Talbott in one of their family videos. Trav and Cor/YouTube But as they continued to use the platform, Corey and Travis became more familiar with the world of YouTube influencers. Their videos became more inventive, like one where Tydus wears a blazer and pretends to be a businessman, and one where he's left home alone with his father. That's when they first became acquainted with Jake Paul. Paul, one of YouTube's biggest personalities, has more than 15 million subscribers, and has created a personal empire worth millions based on his on-screen antics, penchant for drama, and savvy merchandising. A quick stroll through Paul's repertoire reveals a litany of prank videos, original songs and raps, and personal vlogs with titles like ""I got into a fight with CloutGang at my hotel"" and ""I made my Lamborghini remote-controlled."" Paul is one of the most powerful and influential figures in the new wave of internet celebrity. The first Mini Jake Paul skit changed everything. In September 2017, the Talbott family filmed its biggest hit: ""3 Year Old JAKE PAUL!! (RARE FOOTAGE)."" Just three minutes, the video is cut with the choppy, Adderall-fluent pace familiar to anyone who's seen a Jake Paul vlog. In it, Tydus pretends to be a younger version of the YouTube star, wearing a bright pink tie dye shirt, yellow-tinted aviators, his blonde hair carefully tussled. In the opening seconds, he repeats Jake Paul's signature catchphrase. ""Good morning, Jake Paulers!"" he shouts. ""I be dabbin' on them haters."" The video continues in this mold, as if it's one of Jake Paul's daily vlogs. Tydus plays with his Jake Paul-styled ""merch gun;"" throws around slang like ""lit;"" rides a ""blood shark,"" which is Paul's nickname for his Tesla; chases after a ""mini-Erika"" — a character based on Paul's girlfriend; and works out in his home gym. It became the family's most popular video, garnering more than 9 million views. ""Tydus was watching a little bit of Jake Paul... and I was watching Jake Paul and Logan Paul and I thought what they were doing was so cool and kind of interesting,"" Travis said. ""And I just thought that would be fun to do a little skit of Tydus pretending to be Jake Paul, kind of doing all his famous little things he does in a lot of his videos."" It wasn't long before Paul himself saw the video. He invited the Talbott family to Los Angeles from their home in northern California to make a video where he meets the ""Mini Jake Paul."" At first, Travis said, he wasn't totally sold on Paul. Though Paul's videos were fun to watch, he also knew the YouTuber had a reputation as a mischief-maker and provocateur. In 2017, Paul kicked out female YouTuber Alissa Violet from his house and the Team 10 collective, which escalated into a massive made-for-video feud. He warred with his West Hollywood neighbors over his viral stunts and baselessly accused them of trying to kill him. He also accused Violet's assistant of assault — and then withdrew his remarks after a lawsuit threat. And he made an apparently Islamophobic joke about how a Kazakhstani fan might be a terrorist. Paul's personal credentials are less than stellar: He's a college dropout and made a music video critical of teachers, although he's since walked back on his anti-school stance. (His elder brother, Logan Paul, is even more controversial, in part because in 2017 he filmed a dead body in Japan's ""suicide forest"" as part of a vlog about the country, criticized by many as racist.) But after meeting with Paul, Travis changed changed his views. Paul has improved from his wilder days, he said, and his stunts are ultimately harmless. ""For us, when we first met him, we did have our guards up,"" Travis said. ""But knowing him now for about a year, 100% he is a very positive person. Not just for our son but for a lot of kids."" Jake Paul teaching Tydus how to swim in a video. Trav and Cor/YouTube Paul is kinder than his public persona suggests, Travis said, and has an admirable work ethic. ""There are so many things that Jake and Team 10 does that doesn't get published, doesn't get recognition,"" Travis said. ""He's a really hard worker, really kind to us, very kind to Tydus."" (A representative for Team 10, Paul's collaborative and production organization, declined to make Paul available for comment for this article.) Jake Paul and Mini Jake Paul started collaborating. The first video between Tydus and Jake Paul was a smash hit. ""MEETING THE MINI JAKE PAUL?!"" has more than 26 million views and features Tydus, once again, pretending to be Paul — reeling off his catchphrases, causing trouble in a Walmart, and carrying all the swagger a three-year-old can muster. During the vlog, Paul and his tiny doppelgänger also made a music video together — for a song called ""Mini Jake Paul"" — which includes the not-exactly-age-appropriate line ""He's an OG / So damn fast, a Lamborghini / He likes his girls in bikinis / He'll poop on you if you mess with me."" ""That just blew up,"" Travis said of their first video. ""Jake started to really see that Tydus was something special."" Jake Paul and Tydus in their first video. Jake Paul/YouTube The video introduced many of Jake Paul's fans to Tydus. From then on, his following grew exponentially. Eden, a 14-year-old Jake Paul fan who lives in Texas, said she started keeping track of Tydus and his family after Paul featured him. ""I think what makes him stand out is the things he does at just four years old,"" Eden told INSIDER over Instagram direct message. ""He understands a whole lot for a 4-year-old and I think this is just the beginning for him."" Like any good producer with a hit on his hands, Jake Paul made sequels with Tydus. The first was a video where Mini Jake Paul met ""Mini Erika,"" referring to Erika Costell, Paul's girlfriend (Jake Paulers call them ""Jerika""). It, too, was a hit. At that point, Tydus became something like the Scrappy Doo to Jake Paul's Scooby Doo: An eccentric and confident smaller version known for showing up in special episodes. Jake Paul got his mini-me a miniature Lamborghini ( which Tydus rode around on his own channel ), hung out with animals together, fled killer clowns, ""lost"" Tydus in a Walmart, babysat him, and taught him to swim. But the collaboration between the Talbotts and Paul didn't end there. Paul, who found fame at 16, allowed Tydus to become an honorary member of the Team 10 family. The Team 10 cadre includes six people and one dog — including Ben Hampton, who started working with Paul (under the supervision of his parents) at just 6 years old. This summer, the group went on tour, bringing Tydus along for six of their stops. His role was small, but fans loved it. Jake carries out Tydus to his thousands of screaming fans in the audience. It's a sight to behold. Tydus says Jake's trademark line, ""Dabbin' on them haters,"" and they scream even louder. Eden attended one of the Team 10 events and said meeting Tydus after the concert was a highlight. ""Tydus came over to take some pictures because everyone was waving at him,"" Eden said. ""When I got up to him he said 'hi' and turned himself upside down to take a picture with me. Then right after I met Jake he came up to me to tell me about his new truck."" Joseph, a 12-year-old fan of Tydus from Indiana, said he finds the 4-year-old inspiring. ""He's like 4 years old,"" Joseph told INSIDER in an Instagram direct message. ""He doesn't have to say anything. He is already inspiring by his actions."" The Talbott family says they don't rely on their son for money. While the family's vlogs are monetized on YouTube, and they've accepted sponsorships from the health app Lifesum, Travis said they don't rely on their son's YouTube channel for money. And though they're planning a merchandise line — a straightforward and reliable source of income for many internet celebrities — it's not a priority. The Talbotts own a ""nice boutique hotel"" by Lake Tahoe, which Travis renovated from its run-down state before Tydus was born. Most of the day-to-day work is managed by on-site staff while Travis and Corey take reservations and work from home. In one video, Tydus and his father bought his mom products from Gucci, one of Team 10's favorite brands. Trav and Cor/YouTube The lodge, as well as other properties owned by Travis, make enough money so that they don't need to use their YouTube channel to pay the bills. If anything, Travis said, the family's work situation allows the parents to spend more time with their kids. That also means they can vlog more. ""Because we work from home, we're able to travel, we're able to do the vlog life,"" Travis said. ""I don't have, like, a nine-to-five that I have to wake up and go do every day. So it's been a real easy transition into doing this a little more full time now."" Tydus talking to fans after a stage appearance. Trav and Cor/YouTube Travis argues that the ""New Hollywood"" system of YouTube-famous children is preferable to the older child star system. Instead of children signing restrictive contracts with movie studios or places like Nickelodeon and Disney Channel, parents have more direct control over their children's lives. ""You don't have directors, you don't have other people telling you do this, do that,"" Travis said. ""It's on your own time, which leaves all this extra time for hands-on teaching and taking your kids to their school yourself."" The Talbotts say they're being careful now that Tydus is a celebrity. Becoming famous changes people, for better or for worse. When a 4-year-old's involved, there's always the specter of exploitation. Is the life of a famous YouTube vlogger appropriate for a kid? Take, for example, Lil Tay. She's a 9-year-old Instagram and YouTube star with an even bigger internet presence than Tydus. A former Jake Paul collaborator herself, her brand was built on trash-talking other internet celebrities, as well as ""flexing"" luxury status symbols like expensive cars and houses. But it all came crashing down after a video leaked of her brother apparently feeding her lines, raising questions about her parents' care. Jake Paul and Lil Tay in the music video for ""My Teachers,"" a diss track about teachers. Jake Paul/YouTube Lil Tay's management team hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment. Travis Talbott said he is ""not a fan"" of Lil Tay, and sees her situation to be different from his son's. She's an invented character, he said, while his videos with Tydus are authentic representations of the Talbott family. ""It's just a very odd character that her brother and her mother, or maybe just her brother, have developed,"" he said. ""She doesn't vlog, she doesn't show her real life more. All you see is Lil Tay, this character that her brother has created."" In one video, Tydus is set up with a ""girlfriend."" Jake Paul/YouTube Both the Talbott parents graduated from college, and say they prioritize education. Tydus attends preschool twice a week right now, and is otherwise home-schooled. ""We are able to do a lot of teaching and stuff [at home] that people don't really see,"" Travis said. ""It's not really something that anyone really wants to watch. We keep our vlog kind of fun and interesting so that people continue to watch, but as far as behind the scenes, schooling is super important to us."" Starting in the fall, Corey said, they're developing a homeschooling plan based on their travel schedule. But the idea of a 4-year-old being famous on social media is controversial. Travis and Corey don't see their son as someone who's performing in front of a crowd. He's a child who's having fun. Whether he's acting as Mini Jake Paul or in family videos, he's just being himself, they say — like he'd be without a camera around. ""Tydus really is just himself,"" Corey Talbott said. ""He's just this natural kid and he is a very smart little boy. We call him magic."" Given that social media is a relatively new frontier, published research about the psychological effects it has on children is fairly scant. There aren't yet any studies about how being a YouTube influencer affects a child's brain. But the Talbotts say they're taking care to be responsible, and they've ""gone to great lengths to surround Tydus, and our family, with trusted experts and advisors"" to protect him. Tydus and his mother, Corey, playing with makeup. Trav and Cor/YouTube Psychologists have often written about the potentially harmful effects of fame on children. Tovah Klein, the author of ""How Toddlers Thrive"" and a child psychologist who leads the Barnard College Center for Toddler Development, told INSIDER children Tydus' age are at crucial point for development of the ""self-concept,"" meaning a solid sense of who they are. When a child is being told that they're loved and appreciated for being adorable on social media, she argues, they can't build their own sense of self. Klein is skeptical that any form of celebrity can be good for a child. ""What happens when the audience goes away?"" Klein told INSIDER. ""What happens when the child is left to its own devices without an adoring audience? There's nothing there."" Tydus' sense of self, Klein said, is being cultivated by his parents behind the camera. They introduced him to feedback in the form of likes, comments, and subscribers by thousands of people looking at him on their screens, as well as fans he meets on the road. Tydus on stage at a Team 10 concert in front of screaming fans. Trav and Cor/YouTube The message Tydus receives, Klein said, is that he'll be loved and appreciated as long as he gets other people to adore him. He is like a child who competes in beauty pageants, she said, but with a greater audience and potentially greater crash. ""It says your life is a performance,"" Klein said. ""As opposed to [wondering], 'How do I figure out who I am? What do I like, what don't I like? What makes me happy, what upsets me?'... You're missing this part that says who am I for me?"" Tydus Talbott taking a photo with fans before an event. Trav and Cor/YouTube In an emailed joint statement, Travis and Corey Talbott said they respect Klein's work as a child psychologist, but argued it would be impossible to make a professional assessment about Tydus without meeting him. They insist that Tydus isn't performing for an audience, but is being himself. ""We understand her views are more of a generalization and certainly can't represent Tydus' specific circumstances since none of us have ever met or spoken,"" they said. ""That said, the points she raises are important for us all to consider and be mindful of."" The question remains: Does Tydus know what he's getting into? At 4 four years old, a child can't consent to having a public life in the same way an adult can. And Klein doubts whether a child Tydus' age can understand what this level of fame might mean to him later in life. But the implications are potentially dangerous, she said. ""I wouldn't say that a toddler — whether he's 2 or 4 or even 6 years old — has a choice,"" she said. ""You're doing it at a very developmentally fragile time of your life rather than saying, 'If he's really that great, when he grows up, if he wants to act we'll give him a chance to act.'"" In their emailed statement, Travis and Corey Talbott said that Tydus loves making other people happy, and that's part of his ""remarkable spirit."" ""Tydus will continue to be surrounded by love, respect, mindfulness, and a support system of loving adults as we collectively help him along his own journey,"" they said. ""[It's important] for us to protect him, while allowing him to grow and express himself in a healthy way."" Tydus taking a photo of fans on the Team 10 tour. @minijakepaul/Instagram I tried asking Tydus himself, over the phone, how his life has changed since he became a celebrity. But it's difficult to interview a 4-year-old. His parents rephrased my question for me. ""So, buddy, what's different now that everyone knows you and likes your videos?"" Travis asked him. ""When you see fans and stuff, what's that like?"" ""They scream,"" Tydus said. Travis followed up with more questions, phrased so they'd elicit a yes-or-no answer. ""Do you like it?"" Travis asked. ""Giving them hugs and high-fives?"" ""Yeah,"" Tydus said. ""Do you like that people always tell you they watch your videos?"" Travis asked. ""Yeah,"" Tydus said.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","More rain, snow and wind hit the West on Wednesday, flooding roads, toppling trees and cutting power while raising threats of debris flows from wildfire scars. But while the weather impacted travel, some tourists were undaunted.(Feb. 13)
 AP
A massive storm marching across the nation Tuesday was promising heavy snow, crippling ice and torrential rain to more than 200 million Americans over the next few days.
""Parts of 39 of the 48 contiguous United States will be touched by the massive storm, including every state east of the Mississippi River,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Faith Eherts said. 
Wintry temperatures will translate to snow and ice across from Minnesota as far south to North Texas. The storm will roll east all the way to Maine. On Monday, the storm aimed its fury on the southern Rockies. As much as a foot of snow fell in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.
On Tuesday, the storm will spread heavy snow and strong winds into the central U.S., the National Weather Service said. Late Tuesday and into Wednesday, the threat for heavy snow, ice and dangerous travel will expand across the Midwest, Ohio Valley, Mid Atlantic and the Northeast.

""Kansas City, Omaha, Des Moines, Minneapolis and Duluth could all receive several inches of snow,"" said AccuWeather meteorologist Tyler Roys.

The Weather Channel warned that the Washington D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia metro areas will see accumulating snow to start before it changes to a mix of sleet, freezing rain and then rain. That could make the Wednesday morning commute in those cities hazardous.
Freezing rain and ice will be especially dangerous in the mountains of West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina, weather.com said, causing tree damage and scattered power outages. Lighter amounts of ice are forecast for portions of Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
In the South, several rounds of heavy, flooding rainfall and even some severe thunderstorms are expected Tuesday and Wednesday. 
Up to a half foot of rain could swamp much of northern Mississippi, northern Alabama and Tennessee, where flood watches and warnings have been posted. 
Summer will continue to pay an early visit to Florida on Tuesday as temperatures soar into the 80s. Several Florida cities set record highs Monday, including Vero Beach, which tied an all-time February record high of 89 degrees. 
The unusual warmth is expected to continue in the Sunshine State for most of the week.

Andrew Freedman,"The stage is set for a dramatic change in the weather pattern across the Northern Hemisphere during the next seven to 10 days. That change will likely bring a brutal Arctic blast across the Midwest and eastern U.S., put Western Europe into the deep freeze, and maintain an area of extreme cold in eastern Asia. The new weather pattern could give rise to snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S., though it's too early to tell whether that will happen, forecasters say. What is clear is that winter is coming — ASAP. SEE ALSO: La Niña is officially here to shape U.S. winter weather, along with global climate Computer model projections show an Arctic air mass diving southeastward, into the U.S., by Dec. 10, and potentially setting up shop for one to two weeks. Daytime highs will be at least 15 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average for this time of year, with the heart of the cold projected to be centered somewhere near the Ohio Valley. The cold air blowing across the comparatively mild waters of the Great Lakes could yield prolific lake effect snows from Wisconsin to New York State. While the Arctic air won't be historically cold, it will cause a nasty outbreak of weather whiplash after the historically mild fall that much of the U.S. enjoyed. ""I think the locations that will see the most anomalous cold will be the Great Lakes down through the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,"" said Michael Ventrice, a meteorologist with WSI Corp, which is part of The Weather Company. Ventrice added that he thinks northern Minnesota could see sub-zero temperatures for nighttime low temperatures, while even Nashville and Atlanta could have low temperatures that dip into the 20s Fahrenheit. Computer model projection for Dec. 9 through Dec. 14, showing areas of unusual warmth (red), and unusual cold (blue). Image: wsi via michael ventrice. The weather pattern that is going to take shape features a wavy jet stream, with big swings to the north and the south, like a snake slithering along a path. The jet stream consists of a corridor of high winds blowing near the top of the troposphere, or about 35,000 feet up, that separates air masses and both steers and helps fuel storm systems. A wavy jet stream can cause weather features to get stuck in place, with large ridges of high pressure acting as atmospheric traffic lights, preventing oncoming weather systems from passing by. In mid-December, strong areas of high pressure are forecast to develop and hold in position in high latitudes, forming what's known as a blocking pattern. Such blocks, particularly a high pressure area over Greenland, tend to be associated with cold air outbreaks and snowstorms in the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. The high latitude blocking will bring unusually mild air for this time of year to the Arctic, likely resulting in a sharp slowdown in the growth of winter sea ice across the region. ""The most unusual warmth is going to be across Alaska [on] through the Arctic Circle,"" Ventrice said. We are seeing temperature anomalies in excess of 30 degrees [Fahrenheit compared to average] in some locations around the North Pole, which will likely delay or reduce Arctic sea ice growth/extent,"" he added. As of late November, Arctic sea ice extent was at its second-lowest level on record in the satellite era, with virtually no ice cover in the Chuckchi Sea near Alaska.

Decent coverage and intensity of cold for early December. pic.twitter.com/dqHwuUWkDb — Ryan Maue | weather.us (@RyanMaue) November 29, 2017 Emerging research suggests that slow growth of Arctic sea ice during the fall and early winter can alter weather patterns in the northern midlatitudes, including by increasing fall snowfall in parts of Siberia. Such developments may help, through a series of complex interactions between the lower and upper atmosphere, disrupt the polar vortex encircling the Arctic region, and bring more frigid air into North America and Europe. The main polar vortex consists of a circulation of air enveloping a near-permanent area of low pressure that exists in the upper atmosphere, a layer known as the stratosphere, over the Arctic. When these winds weaken, which is forecast to occur by Dec. 11 to 15, pieces of the vortex can break off, and drift south into the U.S., Europe, and parts of Asia. Arctic sea ice extent, with 2017 in orange. Image: jaxa/nsidc/zack labe Such a polar vortex disruption is forecast to be part of the reason why the weather pattern will change so drastically across such a broad area during the next few weeks.

"Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle, Steve Orr, Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle","Tug Hill Plateau in New York and the Keewenaw Peninsula in Michigan vie most years as the snowiest spots on the Great Lakes. Wochit Redfield, Oswego County, weather observer Carolyn Yerdon marks 300 inches of snow Thursday night. (Photo: Provided) ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Midway through the winter, the Oswego County hamlet of Redfield, N.Y., remains the snowiest spot in all the Great Lakes. They broke 300 inches — yeah, that's 25 feet — Thursday night. Redfield last winter won the first-ever Golden Snowdrift award, which the Democrat and Chronicle bestows on the Great Lakes community with the most snow. Because each of the five Great Lakes can spin off prodigious quantities of lake-effect snow, the region is one of the snowiest in the world. More: Snowfall totals climb after major Midwest storm, roads remain treacherous More: Snow! Airlines cancel 1,700+ flights, delay 4,400 more Last season, Redfield's indefatigable weather observer, Carolyn Yerdon, measured 350.5 inches of the stuff. The runners-up, Osceola in Lewis County and Houghton in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, has 303.9 and 285 inches respectively. Who will get the most snow on the Great Lakes this year? This season, communities in Michigan that sit in the snow belt near Lake Superior jumped off to a quick Golden Snowdrift lead in November. Places in Wisconsin and the Canadian province of Ontario got early snow as well. New York snow-belt locales lagged far behind. Then Erie, Pennsylvania vaulted to the top and garnered national headlines in late December with five feet of snow in two days. The city on the Lake Erie shore set its all-time seasonal snowfall record earlier this week. But Redfield has come charging back. Yerdon measured nearly 15 inches of fresh lake-effect snow on Thursday, pushing the seasonal total to 307 inches. Just like last season, Redfield has built a wide lead over the competition. As of Thursday, Houghton, Michigan was second with 227.2 inches. A neighboring Lake Superior town, Calumet, had 207.5 inches and Lacona in Oswego County had 186.3. Erie sat in 14th place with a relatively paltry 152.1 inches. The closest Canadian competition, Wiarton, Ontario near Lake Huron, had recorded only 117.7 inches.

Dave Faherty,"WATAUGA COUNTY, N.C. - Two people were killed Wednesday afternoon in Watauga County after a landslide destroyed the home they were in, officials said. Authorities told Channel 9 that the landslide ruptured a gas line at the home on Pine Ridge Drive, resulting in the collapse of the house at about 5 p.m. Credit: Boone PD Several agencies responded to the pile of rubble in the Heavenly Mountain Community. First responders dug through the rubble and found two people dead. The names of the victims have not been released. Boone police posted video overnight of crews working at the scene of the collapse, using a backhoe and other equipment to remove materials. Extensive cleanup at the site is expected to last all day Thursday. On Wednesday, Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency after days of rain caused havoc in western North Carolina. The region has seen flash floods, rising rivers, mudslides, and falling trees. On Thursday, Cooper will visit some of the areas heavily damaged by the storms, including Polk, Rutherford and McDowell counties. McDowell County Emergency Management confirmed 200 people from campgrounds and residential communities near the Lake Tahoma Dam were in shelters Tuesday night. Patsy Barnwell was praying the rain stops. Her camper, where she lives full-time, was flooded by high water along the Catawba River. She and others woke to the sound of a loudspeaker ordering everyone to get out. ""It's dangerous,” Barnwell said. “We have seen a lot of people pulling people out and saw some of them just about washed down the river."" Around 10 a.m. on Wednesday, officials said they were closing those shelters and that residents could return home. Engineers deemed the dam safe and the mandatory evacuation order was canceled. ""The soil became saturated and slid off a rock face but it's well below the toe of the dam, so there's no concern at this time,"" dam engineer Jeffrey Brown said. Marie Belton spent the night in a shelter with her family and isn't sure what will be left when she finally gets home. ""I'm terrified,” Belton said. “There's no insurance on that camper so if it is gone, it is gone and there's nothing we can do about it.” Old Fort and Marion were the hardest-hit communities Tuesday night. Emergency management officials said there had been several landslides in the county as well as moderate flooding in western and central communities. Four swift water rescues were carried out. Two NCDOT workers were rescued after the tandem dump truck they were using to help clear a mudslide was pushed off a road by another slide and into the Catawba River. They climbed out through a passenger window and stood on the side of the truck in the water until emergency crews got them to safety. ""Our emergency response and transportation crews have been working through the night to keep North Carolinians safe as conditions deteriorate,"" Cooper said. ""But this storm isn't yet over. I'm urging people to keep a close eye on forecasts and flood watches, and asking drivers to use caution especially when traveling in our western counties,"" said Governor Cooper. Early Wednesday morning, the Charlotte Fire Department sent a 16-person water rescue team to McDowell County. That personnel is trained in boat operations and technical water rescue.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Siberia is geographical shorthand for “very cold.” But even by Siberian standards, what’s happening in the eastern Siberia hamlet of Oymyakon right now is ridiculous—and it begs the question of just what the heck makes this part of the world so freaking cold. Temperatures have been topping out at minus-40 degrees Fahrenheit in Oymyakon, home to 500 permanent residents. The village officially bottomed out at minus-74 degrees Fahrenheit earlier this week, though local residents reported temperatures as low as minus-88 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s just shy of the minus-90 degree reading recorded in Oymyakon in 1933, the coldest temperature ever recorded outside of Antarctica. The cold has left at least two dead, which seems like a miraculously low number, given that frostbite can set in in just minutes. The town is known for its extremes but the daily average temperature from November to March is well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. It holds a bevy of other cold weather distinctions, too. A sane person might wonder what makes the weather in Oymyakon so special, as well as why anyone would want to live there. The answer is a mix of geography and weather, at least as far as the weather is concerned. Why people live there is a whole other story. Let’s get the obvious out of the way first. Oymyakon is pretty far north, and places in the north get cold in the winter owing to a lack of sunlight. But that alone doesn’t explain it. It’s not even the furthest north point in Siberia, and it sits below the fabled Arctic Circle. We need some special sauce from the atmosphere. Eastern Siberia is also home to what weather forecasters call the Siberian High, a semi-permanent ridge of high pressure that camps over the region for much of the winter. We’ve seen high pressure lock in warm, dry weather in California this winter. The Siberian High keeps things pretty dry, but warm, not so much. Further west, storms are more frequent. That mixes the atmosphere, and allows warmer air that comes with them from the North Atlantic to regularly flush the worst of the cold away. But the high steers those storms away from eastern Siberia for most of the winter. That means there’s no warm air for the region to draw from. Instead, the high pressure ensures cold, dry air stays on tap, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of deepening chill. The snowpack that usually forms in the fall only makes things worse, reflecting the very limited warmth from the few hours of sunlight a day back into space. That’s the weather setup stacked against any warm air that may attempt to take hold in the region. But what makes Oymyakon a unique island of cold in a veritable frozen sea is its geography. Landlocked areas tend to be colder than coastal locations in winter in most parts of the world. And Oymyakon is landlocked in eastern Siberia, the heart of the coldest part of the world. Cut off from storms to the west, it’s also too far from the relatively warm seas to the north and east to get a heat boost. Oymyakon’s final secret weapon for attracting cold is its location in a valley. This valley—or almost any valley, really—is a magnet for inversions, a process where cold air sinks to the valley floor while warm air rises and acts as a cap. In other valleys like Salt Lake City, that can lead to major pollution issues, in addition to colder-than-normal conditions until a storm comes to mix things up. In Oymyakon, it’s a recipe for record-setting deep freezes. A 1991 study found that the eastern Siberia is home to the most common and strongest inversions in Eurasia, due to this combination of weather and topography. And Oymyakon is the bullseye of the worst of it. A study published in 2011 looked at the temperature difference in the valley Oymyakon sits in vs. the surrounding mountains. The researchers found that, though the mountains are less than 1,000 feet higher than the valley, the temperature could be up to 36 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter time. As the Siberian High clears out in spring and weather patterns allows the atmosphere to mix more, the inversions basically disappear. A graph in the 2011 study—which by the way, also shows that climate change is melting glaciers in the world’s coldest inhabited place—makes this shift abundantly clear. The cold in this tiny northern Siberian village is more than just a novelty. The forces behind it, particularly the atmospheric ones, can affect the rest of the world. “The current cold snap across Siberia can influence the weather across the Northern Hemisphere,” Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting for Atmospheric and Environmental Research, told Earther. “The stronger the contrast in temperatures between the continent and the oceans in winter the stronger the waves in the atmosphere. The stronger the waves in the atmosphere the more likely is the polar vortex is to weaken or become disrupted.” In this case, disruption can mean the polar vortex plunging into the mid-latitudes, similar to what happened in early January in the eastern U.S. Cohen said he expects a disruption to occur in the coming weeks and that “the cold in Siberia now is probably a good omen for the winter Olympics in South Korea in February.” There’s a good omen in the cards for Oymyakon as well: snow early next week. That means temperatures will likely moderate and could reach minus-3 degrees Fahrenheit, which is veritable bikini and Speedo weather.","Siberia is geographical shorthand for “very cold.” But even by Siberian standards, what’s happening in the eastern Siberia hamlet of Oymyakon right now is ridiculous—and it begs the question of just what the heck makes this part of the world so freaking cold.…",2018-01-17T18:12:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Earther.com'}",Why the Eastern Corner of Siberia Is the Coldest Inhabited Place on Earth,https://earther.com/why-the-eastern-corner-of-siberia-is-the-coldest-inhabi-1822160684,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--SWJ5mCr1--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/njucdt3xcdvm35k3xylb.png",,Earther.com,Lake Storm,1

Sheri Fink,"W ayne Dailey sat in a waiting area at a Houston hospital, anxious for word about his wife. He and his sister stared at the television to distract themselves. It was Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2017, and broadcasters described a large storm moving off the Yucatán Peninsula with Texas in its sights, potentially bringing historic flooding to Houston that weekend. Wayne, who as a child in Galveston County spent hours watching the cloudscapes drift over the Gulf of Mexico, kept multiple weather apps on his phone and had already been tracking the storm. “It’s going to get us,” he told his sister. But coastal storms were a part of life that he had prepared for, and they did not concern him. He was more worried about his wife. Casey Dills-Dailey was undergoing surgery to remove the adrenal gland above her left kidney. The surgeon predicted an uncomplicated operation, conducted through tiny incisions. Still, Wayne wondered, would the surgery do what it was supposed to do? Was the doctor as skilled as he said he was? It was hard to grasp that the life of his 38-year-old wife could be endangered. The operation came after years of mysterious symptoms that began when Casey was in her early 30s. She had hot flashes and eventually stopped menstruating. Her face became chubby, and her full-but-shapely figure ballooned to nearly 250 pounds, fattening in odd places, including the space between her shoulders. Ugly red marks appeared on her abdomen. The illness left her in pain, nauseated and unable to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time. Casey Dills-Dailey talking about her health issues on March 26, 2016. Casey would scour books and the internet to help others solve medical or legal problems — Wayne, 39, called her a doctor without a degree — but the cause of her own health issues had eluded her. She blamed herself, ascribing her weight gain to overeating. Finally, in late March, after an ambulance took her to the hospital for a bout of severe abdominal pain, doctors detected a mass on one of her adrenal glands. Weeks of tests produced a diagnosis: Cushing’s syndrome, a curable but potentially deadly disorder caused by an overabundance of cortisol, a steroid hormone. The mass appeared on a 2015 scan for kidney stones, doctors realized, but because it is a common and typically nonproblematic finding, its significance was missed. Casey was referred to Dr. Curtis Wray, a surgical oncologist, to remove what doctors suspected was a noncancerous tumor that was releasing extra cortisol, causing her Cushing’s syndrome. The diagnosis helped explain many of her problems, from high blood pressure to erratic moods. Casey could not wait to look and feel like herself again. That morning, a resident surgeon said Casey should expect to stay three or four days for recovery. He described the operation’s potential complications — bleeding, infection, damage to other organs — which frightened Wayne. Dr. Wray, the senior surgeon, came in and reassured them. His team had performed the operation many times. Surprising Wayne and Casey, he predicted she would be home in 24 hours. Wayne asked to see the tumor when it was out. After surgery, Dr. Wray called him from the waiting area and showed him an image on his phone. The tumor was the width of Wayne’s two thumbs put together. Most important, to the surgeon it appeared benign. After Casey was settled in her hospital room, Wayne drove home to spend the night with their two sons. The family lived outside the Houston city limits in northeast Harris County, in a trailer park where homes stretched along fancifully named streets — Drifting Winds, Island Song and theirs, Enchanted Path Drive. The Daileys were what Wayne called a “simple, simple family”: Casey, a housewife who home-schooled their oldest son, Luke, 14; their youngest son, Ronnie, 10; and Wayne himself, a “middle-class worker, a lower-class worker,” without a steady job. For more than a dozen years, he had operated heavy machinery at oil refineries, clawing trenches into the earth for foundations and pipe racks. The finances were in his wife’s name in case he did not make it home. He had survived explosions, survived co-workers. Lately, he had been working for a friend’s tree-service firm. Casey made their uncertain income stretch, scrapping junk metal and advertising homemade quilts for $50 on social media; it took her about a week to make each one. Their trailer-park community had its drugs and gangs and violence, the evening cracks of gunfire and whining sirens. But four generations of family members and friends filled the homes on their block. Casey’s parents lived across the street, next to her aunt. Three homes over, there was Casey’s grandma’s bowling partner. Next door was Erasmo Villa, from Mexico, who with his brother-in-law had drywalled the Daileys’ home free of charge just because they were neighbors, and neighbors help each other. Casey cultivated roses that bloomed from pale pink to vivid red, growing impossibly high. Casey grew up in the trailer. Her mother had many miscarriages before giving birth to her only child, and Casey quickly took a place at the center of the family, clinging like a bear to her grandpa’s neck. As an adult, she cared for him and other sick relatives until they died. Having little money did not mean the Daileys could not be generous. Casey joined the homeowners’ board, chaperoned school field trips and led a Cub Scout troop with Wayne because nobody else volunteered. An evicted family with three children had slept on pallets on the Daileys’ living-room floor. Wayne and Casey served as temporary guardians for one of Ronnie’s friends so he wouldn’t be sent to a foster home during his parents’ rough patch. Their Wi-Fi password evinced their Christian faith: 12loveGod. That night after Casey’s operation, Wayne picked up the boys from their grandparents’ trailer. He ate dinner, put the television on in the bedroom and fell asleep. At around 9:30 the next morning, Casey called him from the hospital. “Come up here,” she said. They were discharging her. Tropical Storm Harvey was rapidly strengthening in the gulf, and Wayne stopped to pick up necessities. When he walked into the imposing hospital in the early afternoon, though, nothing looked amiss. In truth, doctors at Casey’s hospital, Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, were preparing for a possible hurricane, sending stable patients home. During Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Memorial Hermann, with 540 patients inside, lost power and was evacuated, as medical workers manually squeezed air into the lungs of patients whose mechanical respirators had failed. Since then, billions of dollars had been spent to protect the hospital and other facilities at the Texas Medical Center campus. A surgical intern just weeks out of medical school examined Casey. He prepared discharge instructions and wrote two prescriptions: one for a stool softener and the other for 40 tablets of Tramadol, an opioid painkiller. He did not prescribe steroids, which would typically be needed when a steroid-producing tumor like Casey’s was removed. A nurse went over the bright-orange folder of information, explaining how to keep the incisions clean to avoid infection and emphasizing the importance of being as active as possible to help prevent a potentially deadly blood clot from forming in her legs or lungs. Casey was to follow up with Dr. Wray in a week. She arrived home that afternoon in pain and ready for a nap. Casey’s aunt from across the street texted to offer help and asked whether Casey and Wayne were ready for the hurricane. Casey responded that they would fill containers with water, hunker down and keep an eye on their outdoor dogs. “It’s all we can do.” Late the next night, Friday, Harvey barreled into the Texas coastline northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest to strike the United States in over a decade. It stalled, losing strength but absorbing more water from the gulf, before pinwheeling into Houston. The view of the storm from Wayne Dailey's porch on Saturday night, Aug. 26, 2017. On Saturday night, before 10 p.m., Wayne opened his screen door, stepping barefoot onto the stoop to look at what was coming. Wind chimes tinkled, and the roof dripped a steady beat of rain between crashes of thunder. Branches tipped with small red flowers swayed dizzily above the door. A shock of lightning brought the trees into sudden light. Less than an hour later, he opened the door again to a hiss of sheeting rain that obscured the rumble of thunder. Behind him in the house, an emergency alert blared from one of their mobile phones, a flash-flood warning: “Imminent Threat — Severe.” A s the storm strengthened, emergency officials appeared to have the situation well in hand. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, had warned that Harvey would be a “major rainmaker” for the city and asked people to stay off the roads over the weekend, but he did not call for an evacuation — he later told reporters that sending millions of people fleeing onto the highways would be “asking for a major calamity.” In 2005, more than half of the county’s population drove out ahead of Hurricane Rita, just weeks after Hurricane Katrina. Traffic stalled, gas tanks ran dry and dozens of residents died on the freeways from the heat, vehicle-fire injuries, traffic accidents and delayed medical attention. Then Rita swerved and missed Houston. Harris County’s top elected official, Judge Ed Emmett, also decided that there should be no mass evacuations. With a population of more than 4.5 million — about equal numbers outside and inside Houston — Harris County’s roughly 1,700 square miles held more people than half of the states in the country. Texas law requires every jurisdiction to have plans for managing emergencies, and as the lead county official, Judge Emmett served as its emergency-management chief. On Sunday, he was based at the county’s emergency operations center, in the Houston TranStar building, which houses Harris County’s lead agency for disasters, the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. As the storm moved into the area, the activity in the vast headquarters picked up. Personnel from various agencies gathered at rows of desks, their partitions marked by edge-lit glass signs with the office logo glowing an eerie white. Just below the room’s high ceilings, giant video screens played the news and tracked weather. Webbed with rivers, creeks, lakes, bayous and reservoirs, Harris County had experienced a notable increase in severe, storm-induced floods in recent years. Storms in 2015 and 2016 killed more than a dozen people and swamped parts of the “500 year” floodplain — an area that according to previous models had only a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in a given year. Climate experts predicted that the trend would continue as the atmosphere warmed and extreme weather rose in frequency and intensity. The built environment worsened the problem: Concrete covered ever more miles of rainfall-absorbing prairieland, and sewers and ditches were designed by the local government to overflow into the streets, which were considered part of the drainage system. This helped protect homes and businesses from flooding, but it could trap their inhabitants when streets became canals. A dizzying array of agencies participated in emergency response, coordinating their activities using the National Incident Management System, a protocol that arose from efforts to jointly battle wildfires in the 1970s and that was adopted nationally after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The concept was simple: Disaster response, and the responsibility for it, started at the point of impact and moved out and up as resources were overwhelmed. Individual and local-community preparedness — stocking food, water and medicines and looking out for neighbors — was the initial safeguard. The 911 system was the next, connecting people with police, fire, rescue and emergency medical assistance. The circle expanded from there. If one of the county’s 54 independent fire departments, which were responsible for water rescues, found itself overwhelmed, it could reach out to the fire desk at the county emergency operations center in the TranStar building, which could request assistance from other local fire stations or from representatives of the Coast Guard or the Federal Emergency Management Agency sitting nearby. Health and medical services had a separate hierarchy of support agencies. When Harvey reached Harris County, beginning to release what became a once-in-a-thousand-years rainfall of more than 1 trillion gallons, officials were confident they could prioritize people in life-threatening situations. But as the water rose on Sunday, it overwhelmed those preparations. Many local fire departments lacked boats or trucks that could handle flooded streets, and those that had them could no longer share. A Houston police sergeant drowned in his vehicle trying to drive to work. The flooding was so widespread that it impeded the arrival of additional state and federal teams. At TranStar, officials felt agitated and helpless. They were getting personal emails appealing for rescues, sometimes with photographs of elderly relatives attached. There was no time to wait. “I got a crazy idea,” Rodney Reed, the assistant chief for operational support for the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office, said as Judge Emmett walked into a snack-filled room. “I need you to support it.” Reed argued that they should invite unaffiliated volunteers into the rescue effort. According to conventional wisdom, they get in the way and often end up needing help themselves. But Reed assured the judge that taking the step would save lives. And so at noon on Sunday, Judge Emmett stepped to a lectern before news cameras to make an unusual statement. A large screen looped colorful radar images of the storm behind him. “Those of you who have boats and high-water vehicles that can be used in neighborhoods to help move people out of harm’s way, we need your help,” he said. “Government assets are fully utilized.” Judge Emmett asked the public to call the emergency operations center if they were willing to volunteer. County officials wrote each offer on a sticky note or scrap of paper, affixing it to a wall with blue tape in neat rows according to geographic quadrants, ready to be pulled whenever a fire department called requesting boats. The perhaps-even-greater challenge was connecting the volunteers to the people who needed rescuing. Callers had trouble getting through to 911 as the volume of calls for assistance more than quadrupled. Judge Emmett asked people to stop calling unless they faced immediate danger. “The phone lines are backed up,” he said. Like most other emergency agencies, the Coast Guard, which controlled many boats and helicopters, had not prepared to respond to distress signals posted on the public’s technologies of choice: Facebook and Twitter. Instead, it used social media to disseminate five emergency numbers for the local Coast Guard station, setting up a separate, parallel dispatch system for residents in need of rescue. In a sign of the ad hoc nature of the triage system, personnel tracked urgent medical cases with a pencil-and-paper checklist. In its postings, the Coast Guard instructed people to mark their roofs or “wave sheets, towels etc.” to get rescuers’ attention. Identifying who needed help the most was the crucial first step to responders saving lives. During the county’s news conference, authorities sent a wireless emergency alert to cellular customers, including Wayne and Casey: “Call 911 for LIFE THREATENING emergencies ONLY. STAY PUT IF SAFE.” The view from Wayne's porch on Sunday morning, Aug. 27. W ayne felt safe. He had renovated, moving electrical equipment from underneath the trailer into the attic. The yard angled down into the street. He had purchased plenty of food, and he filled the bathtub and washing machine with water. His family, like Texas, could stand on its own. If there had ever been a time to evacuate, this was not it. That morning, a man named Samuel Saldivar had driven into the neighborhood about a mile south of the Daileys’ home to rescue his parents, who had Alzheimer’s disease. He loaded them and four of their great-grandchildren into a large white van and crossed a small bridge over Greens Bayou after sunrise. The bayou had often swamped bridges along its path, and officials had recognized the need to improve it. As Saldivar came off the bridge, the rising waters swept the van from the road. Saldivar was able to escape, and clung to a tree for the better part of an hour. The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, had no boats. The sheriff’s deputies arrived with one and, with a local firefighter, rescued Saldivar. But the van, with everyone else still trapped inside, was now submerged. The rescuers’ boat, not fit for swift water, could not reach it. Saldivar’s parents, two great-nieces and two great-nephews all drowned. Throughout Sunday, brown water continued to fill Enchanted Path Drive. By the afternoon, the floodwaters reached Wayne and Casey’s garden. Luke asked his father if the flooding was going to kill the grass, or the rose bush, or the plants in the yard. Wayne said no. He also cut off the boy’s restless entreaties to wade across the street, where Casey’s aunt’s car now stood parked in water to the top of its wheels. “Be smart,” Wayne snapped. “Not like these people over here.” He gestured at neighbors tracing a milky brown path toward the main road, submerged to their upper thighs and carrying umbrellas. “You don’t know what’s in that water,” Wayne said. As Wayne monitored the flooding, he also kept an eye on Casey. Her pain had quickly become far more severe than anticipated. The Tramadol was not helping, and a months-old injury to her hip and leg was making it even more difficult to get up and move. She grew queasy shortly after Wayne removed an anti-nausea medication patch from behind her ear as instructed, three days after it had been applied at the hospital. Having coped with bouts of vomiting for years, Casey had the drug Zofran at the ready, and it seemed to help for a few hours at a time. The view from Wayne's porch on Sunday evening, Aug. 27. On Sunday her temperature was slightly higher than normal. Wayne’s father, a former volunteer fire chief with some training in emergency care, explained by phone how to check her incisions for signs of infection like redness, swelling or pus. They looked fine. When she woke up, she even took a few phone calls, including robocalls with updates from Luke’s home-school academy and Ronnie’s elementary school. As the sky deepened into gray on Sunday evening, Wayne padded to the door in his bare feet and jeans. Rain dripped from the trees, drawing expanding circles in the dim water that now covered their lowest step. A man in a blue baseball cap, his shirt rolled up below his chest, waved as he waded by, water above his buttocks, pushing a small, round raft with a woman inside it. “You ought to go out,” he warned. Wayne chortled, unconvinced. “Y’all be careful,” he responded. On Facebook Live, Wayne repeated the message officials were spreading. “If you’re safe where you’re at, stay where you’re at. If you have to get out, get out.” He reassured his anxious mother on Facebook. “We are safe.” Wayne did not like to worry anyone. He had done enough of that when he was young, partying hard and spending time in jail for marijuana possession as a teenager. Marrying Casey and becoming a father had helped transform him. They went to high school together, but did not know each other well. When they met again a few years later, she electrified him. The young woman with the long brown hair had a radiance that drew him. He couldn’t not look at her. She was the girlfriend of his friend next door. He told himself he would marry her one day. As the waters rose Sunday night, Wayne stayed up with Casey, who could not stop vomiting. “Something ain’t right,” Casey said. On Monday morning, it continued raining, and the muddy water rose to their top step, just below the front door. Casey had finally fallen asleep, and when Wayne checked on her, he found it hard to keep her awake. Audio has been edited for brevity. Around 1:30 in the afternoon, Wayne called 911. In Harris County, 911 calls were routed based on geography to one of several primary “public safety answering points,” or PSAPs — independently managed call centers that were most typically housed in local police departments. He reached the answering point for calls outside Houston in unincorporated Harris County, at the Harris County sheriff’s office. He told the woman who answered that Casey had recently had surgery. “She has been very sick. She’s been vomiting for the past day and a half approximately, and she’s in severe pain. And I don’t want her to get in this water in her sutures. She needs to get airlifted to a hospital.” This was not a police emergency, so the communications officer transferred the call to a secondary PSAP, which would determine the next steps. The phone rang 10 times over the course of about a minute, much longer than usual. Another woman picked up, speaking quickly. “Fire and ambulance.” After giving his address and confirming that he needed a water rescue, Wayne said that Casey had recently had surgery and had been vomiting for a day and a half. The second call-taker interrupted him. There were over a thousand calls for help, she said. “As soon as the fire department is able to make it to this area then you will be evacuated.” T he second call-taker had made an important decision, based on incomplete information. She noted Casey’s vomiting and recent surgery, but she did not know that Casey was in severe pain, or barely conscious, or that Wayne thought she needed an airlift to a hospital. The first call-taker stayed on the phone after the second call-taker picked up, but — counter to national guidelines for 911 call-takers — she did not intervene to ensure that the second call-taker had the missing information on Casey’s medical condition. And so the second call-taker entered Wayne’s call into the computer system as one requiring water rescue from the local fire department, not urgent medical response from the local E.M.S. service, which was a separate agency. The job of a 911 call-taker is emotionally and technically demanding at the best of times. During Harvey, the stress was extraordinary. The overloaded call center where the second call-taker was working, Harris County Emergency Corps, served roughly a dozen independent fire and ambulance services in the county. The corps had doubled its staff to eight from four for the storm, but call volume had more than tripled. Every one of the six 911 lines and additional non-emergency lines was ringing nonstop. Personnel were working 12-hour shifts and sleeping in the building and a nearby hotel. Someone had posted the center’s direct-dial phone numbers on Twitter, and it was now receiving calls from other parts of the county, requiring phone transfers that took up to 20 minutes. The center did something it had never done before. Its leaders walked to the call floor and told call-takers to bypass the formal triaging system that it normally used to assign emergency-priority codes to callers. Instead, they would log the call for water rescue and read a script saying that there were many calls and that the fire department would respond as soon as it could. The sheriff’s communications division, which handled primary calls, also faced severe challenges. The basement had filled up with water from Buffalo Bayou, causing power failures. Its staff moved to a regional 911 training center, the only available backup location with a connection to the physical 911 network. After the move, key technical functions stopped working, including, for a time, the internal dispatch system. As Harris County flooded, the total volume of calls to one 911 call center shot up, but the number of calls that were assigned medical priority codes (in red) increased only slightly — some medical emergencies were coded as flood rescue calls after the center suspended normal questioning protocols. 8/24/2017 12:00 am, 2 calls 8/24/2017 1:00 am, 2 calls 8/24/2017 2:00 am, 1 calls 8/24/2017 3:00

Corps According to data provided by the sheriff’s office, the proportion of 911 calls answered within an industry target of 10 seconds plummeted. On Sunday, more than 40 percent of 911 callers to the sheriff’s office hung up during the long waits, according to internal email records from the regional 911 network provider. That further increased the load on communicators, who typically had to follow up on the so-called “abandoned” calls. In Houston the problem was even worse — of the nearly 40,000 calls, more than half ended in hang-ups. Why couldn’t the overburdened centers simply press a few buttons to redirect 911 calls to unaffected centers elsewhere? At the heart of the problem was an astonishing fact: A majority of 911 systems in the United States use primarily analog, rather than digital, technology. Until recently, even the ability to text 911 for help has been rare. Government and industry experts agree on the need to upgrade to so-called next-generation 911 systems that are Internet Protocol-based and can be designed to redistribute calls automatically in a crisis. While some entire countries have completed the upgrades, relatively few areas in the United States have. Vermont was among the first, and it seamlessly transferred calls after Hurricane Irene in 2011 from a flooded communications center to call-takers at centers outside the area of impact — who had maps, data and uniform training to help them handle calls from unfamiliar areas. Oversight of 911 is fragmented among states and localities, systems are often poorly funded and there is no national mandate to upgrade. By the time it is widely adopted, experts say, next-generation 911 technology itself may well be obsolete. Harris County had been in the process of updating its technology for 10 years when Harvey struck, but the new system would not be operational until February of this year. Wayne knew none of that, though. Nor did he know that Casey had not been tagged as an urgent medical case. W hile he waited for the fire department, Wayne spent Monday afternoon exploring every other option he could think of, including the list of emergency numbers the Coast Guard Sector Houston-Galveston command released the previous day. He kept the porch light on and, as some had advised online, hung a towel out a window and another over the screen door to alert potential rescuers. With his cellphone service cutting in and out, he managed to reach an area hospital to say that Casey would be on the way as soon as responders arrived. The person who answered assured him that the hospital was accepting patients. Wayne told his family he was thinking of pushing Casey through the water on an inflatable mattress. They thought it was a bad idea. That evening, as it continued to rain, Wayne heard an airboat passing by his house and tried to flag down its driver, who had earmuffs on to protect against the earsplitting engine noise. The man slowed down when he saw Wayne in the doorway standing next to Ronnie. “My wife and my kids and I need out!” Wayne shouted to the man. “My wife needs help. She has a medical condition.” The man said he was on the way to pick someone up and would get Wayne and his family on the way back. “Just stay right there.” Casey was in the bedroom with the television on, lethargic and in pain. Wayne gave her the news, and she nodded. Wayne stuffed clothing, dry towels and rain jackets into bags. He let family members know that an airboat was coming for them, and his sister posted the news on his Facebook page. “I’m glad he didn’t swim out,” one of his oldest friends wrote. Wayne told everyone he loved them. “We are going to be O.K.,” he wrote around 7 p.m., and then turned on Facebook Live. “As we wait for the airboat to come back for us, I’ll just show y’all what it looks like,” he said. It was raining, but the water level had stopped rising. “Airboats will be here any time now,” Wayne said. A droning sound in the background grew louder. “Matter of fact, I think I hear them now, so I’m going to go ahead and end the video,” he said. Wayne leaned out his front door to look at the main road, which was five trailer lots away at the end of their street. The airboat came into view. But instead of turning onto Enchanted Path Drive to pick them up, it continued on to wherever it was heading. Wayne felt a wave of panic, but he tried to keep his composure for his kids. He wanted them to feel sure that their father would get them out of there. Minutes later, their home lost power. The television news switched off along with the Wi-Fi, which the boys were using to watch videos. It would be night soon, and Wayne could see that the homes of their remaining neighbors were also dark. Wayne turned off Casey’s fully powered cellphone to conserve its battery. His own phone could last nearly a day, and he had an external battery to extend it for another. Late into the night, he called and texted every number that his family and friends sent him to reach volunteer rescuers. He placed calls to a number for the Cajun Navy, an ad hoc volunteer group. He called strangers and took calls from strangers. By midnight, he believed Casey had been added to about a half-dozen rescue lists. But most rescue operations, both official and unofficial, had shut down for the night for safety. Casey was still running a slight fever. Wayne checked her incisions again. They still looked good. He tried to reassure worried friends and family members. “It will be tomorrow,” he wrote on Facebook. “I have Casey stable for now. I have everyone sleeping. I am going to get some rest. I only had about an hour of sleep in about 28 hours. Love you guys and will keep y’all posted.” A few minutes before sunrise on Tuesday, Wayne called 911 for the second time. It had been a bad night. Casey’s movements were shaky, and when she tried to speak, her words were mostly gibberish. Just as with his first call, he was transferred to a call-taker at Harris County Emergency Corps. “Fire and ambulance,” she said quickly and sneezed. Wayne explained about Casey and her recent surgery. He said they needed a water rescue. The flooding in the street was six feet deep. The call-taker, sounding groggy, asked if his home was flooded. “I’ve been blessed, no water in it,” he said. She told Wayne that many neighborhoods in his area had to be evacuated. “As of right now they haven’t resumed water-rescue operations,” she said. The fire department would do so at daylight. She had Wayne’s phone number for them, and they would get to him as soon as possible. “O.K., thank you very much,” Wayne said. But the 911 center did not assign any personnel or resources, and the call-taker once again categorized the incident as a water-rescue call to be sent to the local fire department, not a medical emergency for the E.M.S. agency. The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, was in charge of rescues. But Sheldon owned no boats or high-water vehicles and it had flooded out one of its fire engines. The day before the flooding began, Sheldon personnel responded to five incidents, a typical number. On Sunday the number of calls shot up to more than 170, nearly all of them requests for water rescues as opposed to reports of fires; roughly 40 more calls came in for addresses already in the system — people who had called for help and then called back after they did not get assistance. The fire desk at the emergency operations center had little it could offer. It gave the cellphone numbers of Sheldon Fire chiefs to civilian volunteers with boats, which was helpful but also added to the logistical burden. On Sunday night, Sheldon Fire and Rescue leaders called the 911 center to say that the service lacked resources to conduct water rescues, especially at night. Instead of dispatching calls one by one to the handful of Sheldon Fire and Rescue crews, the 911 center put those calls into a holding pattern. Fire captains could access the ever-lengthening list on a mobile data terminal in their cars. On Monday, new calls for rescue in the district arrived on average every minute to two minutes. By the time of Wayne’s 911 call that day, Sheldon Fire had already received more than 500 water-rescue calls, not counting duplicates. The triage method was haphazard. Sometimes if a call sounded urgent, a 911 dispatcher would text or phone District Capt. Isaac Pinson, saying, “Hey, man, can you get to this?” Pinson said later that whenever possible, he read the dispatchers’ notes and, by radio from his Tahoe truck, prioritized sending fire crews on fishermen’s boats to homes where lives were in danger, or to areas with the greatest concentration of flooding. Sometimes a personal contact helped identify someone needing rescue. One crew went to get family members of a Texas state trooper out of their house. The chaos created considerable wasted effort. Captain Pinson sent personnel to rescue people who became stuck on flooded streets after wading out of homes where they could have stayed safely. His crews lost precious time responding to false alarms, including a report that the roof of the local high school had collapsed with hundreds of people sheltering inside. For the most part, Captain Pinson concluded, people clamoring to get out of their homes were just scared, not at risk of drowning or dying of a medical emergency. Audio has been edited for brevity. At daylight on Tuesday, Wayne saw that the water level outside had dropped slightly. He could barely rouse Casey. He tried calling the Texas Department of Public Safety and, failing to reach someone who could help, called 911 a third time. “I need a medical-emergency rescue,” he said with an edge to his voice he did not have before. The call-taker at the sheriff’s office asked him if it was because of flooding. Wayne said no and explained about Casey’s surgery and the last two days of vomiting. “She’s kind of unresponsive,” he said. When the call-taker said she would get an ambulance there, he said, “There’s no way” and explained that five or six feet of water still lay outside. “I’ve been trying for two days to get her out of here,” Wayne said. Emergency workers later reported that 911 dispatchers in Harris County had limited knowledge of impassable roads, including routes to local hospitals. Although dispatchers were kept abreast of major road closures, some could not use their terminals to access potentially useful websites like the state transportation department’s web page showing blocked roads, or even Google Maps. A next-generation 911 system that incorporates layers of multimedia information might help solve that problem in future disasters, perhaps even incorporating information from drone overflights. The communications officer at the sheriff’s office told Wayne that she would get an ambulance to him and instructed him to let the paramedic know the situation when the call transferred. A Harris County Emergency Corps call-taker picked up the call and asked for Wayne’s address. “O.K., we do already have your two calls for service,” the woman said. “My wife, she’s getting worse,” Wayne said. “She’s unresponsive, she’s real lethargic, she’s been vomiting. She’s in a lot of pain. And I really, really, really, really need to get her to a hospital A.S.A.P.” She told Wayne brusquely that there were thousands of calls for service in the area. “The fire department is working as quickly and safely as they can to get everybody out, O.K.? It’s just going to take some time for them to be able to get everybody, O.K.?” It wasn’t O.K., but Wayne said, “O.K.” Nineteen seconds into the call, the communicator closed the incident as a “duplicate” without assigning any responders, since Wayne’s previous call was already in the queue. Wayne called family members, and his mother commented on Facebook at 10 a.m., asking for help from anyone who could provide it. “Casey’s condition has worsened. She is feverish and unresponsive.” Audio has been edited for brevity. Wayne tried 911 again. This time, his call ended up in Houston. About one call in seven was misrouted by cell towers during the storm, a higher than normal rate, according to data obtained through a public-records request from the regional 911 network, Greater Harris County 911. Communicators had to stay on the line trying to transfer these misrouted calls, adding to the gridlock. The Houston call-taker rerouted Wayne to the Harris County Emergency Corps. This was now the fourth time Wayne had spoken to this center, and he could not have been clearer with the call-taker on the line when she asked him what he was reporting. “My wife is in urgent need of medical, medical attention,” he said, “she’s almost unresponsive.” At last, the call-taker classified the problem as a “31,” an unconscious party, rather than as someone in need of water rescue. “We’re getting medical to you as soon as they can get there,” she said. A fter 21 hours, Wayne’s call had moved out of the queue for the local fire service, which was responsible for water rescues, and was now in the hands of the independent local medical-response agency, South Lake Houston E.M.S., which was in charge of medical emergencies. Both of South Lake Houston’s two stations, the newer of which was now itself surrounded by water, were normally about a 10-minute drive from Wayne and Casey’s trailer. South Lake Houston covered a territory of around 70 square miles, much of it rural or industrial. A rotating staff of five paramedics and emergency medical technicians typically worked two 24-hour shifts per week and supplemented their income with other jobs, including with other ambulance services. Normally, they answered five or six calls a day. On Sunday, they were dispatched to 17 calls. On Monday, it was 39, and because of flooding they only reached two of them. Tuesday was looking to be even worse. The ambulance service had not staffed up before the crisis, and the flooding prevented some personnel from making it in for their shifts. Two paramedics who had worked two days straight in a nearby district drove in on Monday morning to help. From the beginning, the disaster had been harrowing for the paramedics. One crew sped in an ambulance toward a hospital downtown in the midst of the violent storm, with a critically ill patient on a ventilator. Floodwaters stopped them on the roadway. They tried hitching a ride three separate times with three different trucks, but the water was too high. Ultimately the paramedics lifted the woman into a volunteer’s kayak and walked her the last mile. The crew had to be flown by helicopter back to the station. Several times, the paramedics waded through water only to arrive where someone did not really need help. Once, they were dispatched to respond to a reported death and spent an hour canvassing a flooded neighborhood on foot, unable to locate the person. Sometimes they worked with the fishermen and pleasure-craft operators who formed an impromptu rescue network but were not trained or equipped to save lives. In the broader region, volunteers sometimes overturned in rough floodwaters (at least four ultimately drowned). By midday Monday, the E.M.S. service’s leaders concluded that, in the case of callers who were inaccessible by ambulance, it was best to keep track of their conditions and try to reach them only if they became critical. Joe Fress, the director, asked his personnel at the station to write out a list of all the medical calls that were listed as “pending” in the computer system, with locations and phone numbers. On Monday, one of those pending patients was Randy De’Shun Belcher, a 38-year-old man with diabetes who did not have his insulin with him. His fiancée, De’Licia Thomas, called 911 after midnight to report he was having difficulty breathing. “I’m sending the paramedics to help you now,” the call-taker at Harris County Emergency Corps said, and South Lake Houston E.M.S. was dispatched. Thomas called back when the ambulances did not arrive as promised. The call-taker incorrectly assured her that units were en route. “You gotta understand we’re going through a hurricane,” she said. The apartment complex was just off the Texas State Route 8 Beltway, which was not flooded. But the entrance to the apartment complex was under water, about 100 feet from the beltway’s frontage road, and not navigable by ambulance. Nobody called Thomas to let her know. Just after noon on Monday, Thomas tried 911 again. “He’s not breathing properly,” she said. She called again 90 minutes later. The call-taker sighed loudly, sounding exasperated as she took down the address. Thomas repeated what was happening, now sounding tired and dejected. At 5 p.m., still waiting, she again called 911 in tears to report that her fiancé was barely breathing. “O.K., I’m sending the paramedics to help you now,” a communicator again told Thomas. The call was coded in a way that indicated Belcher was getting sicker, which led Fress, finally, to tell his paramedics, “Let’s just try to get there, let’s try to make it.” They parked on the Beltway and grabbed gear and medications from the ambulance. They crossed the feeder road and entered the complex, the floodwaters rising to their waists in the parking lot. Their rescue equipment was splashed even as they held it aloft on their shoulders. Their boots grew heavy with water, and their hips ached. As they made their way, another 911 call-taker, speaking quickly but patiently, was giving Thomas’s mother, also in the home, instructions on how to start CPR. At 5:50 p.m., the paramedics finally walked into the apartment. Belcher, a father of 12, had been without a pulse and not breathing for at least a half an hour. The paramedics knew they would not get him back, but they also knew, for the sake of the devastated women, they had to try. The medical interventions did not work. The paramedics felt horrible that they could not save him, and that the medical examiner’s staff would not be able to get there to pick up Belcher’s body. They needed to do something they had never done before Harvey — they left Belcher’s body on the living-room floor with a breathing tube in his mouth and an intravenous catheter in his right arm so the medical examiner would know what they had done. Before they left, they covered Belcher with a bedsheet, knowing that Thomas might be stuck in the apartment with him for days before his body was retrieved. W ayne raised Casey from their bed and shuffled her in his arms to a recliner in the living room so she would be closer to the front door when help arrived. Ronnie and Luke sat, hushed and frightened, on the adjacent sofa. Before noon on Tuesday, Wayne heard the thrum of helicopter rotors and saw a rescue line being lowered behind the trailers two streets over. He burst through the back door, where the grade was higher, sloshed through water that reached his thighs and lifted an extension ladder against the side of the trailer. He climbed to the roof, shouting and waving a flashlight. Luke stood on the front steps signaling with a bright yellow broom. Ronnie hollered for his father from the back door, not knowing where he had gone. The helicopter moved toward them. It hovered overhead. Then it flew away. Wayne swore. He made a decision: He did not want his children to watch their mother die. “I’m going to bring y’all over there,” he told his boys, gesturing to Casey’s parents’ trailer across the street. “And I’m going to get Mommy out of here.” He carried little Ronnie, with Luke sloshing along beside them. Wayne had no idea for whom the helicopter had come, or how it had been dispatched, but he learned months later. Norma Anderson, 75, had kidney failure and, having missed dialysis, was in bad condition. A 911 communicator told her daughter that ambulances could not reach the neighborhood, and she would have to await fire-rescue crews. Fortunately for Norma, the owner of her trailer had a friend who knew the district’s congressman, Gene Green, and thought to call him. An intern in the representative’s Washington office, Simon Handler, took the call and phoned a federal agency for a helicopter, which soon arrived. Wayne returned from Casey’s parents’ house soaking wet. He changed his clothes and went back to Casey’s side, telling her over and over that help was coming. Shortly before 1 p.m., nearly a day after Wayne’s first 911 call, a paramedic from South Lake Houston E.M.S. called Wayne back. It was the only call Wayne’s cellphone recorded having received from the station, although paramedics later recalled talking with Wayne more than once to keep track of Casey’s condition. Greg Perches, a paramedic who said he spoke with Wayne, arrived at South Lake Houston E.M.S. on Monday night, which allowed the ambulance service to assemble a second crew. Wayne impressed him by saying he thought Casey was becoming septic, using a medical term that indicated a potentially deadly consequence of a severe infection. The county’s systems were supposed to prioritize people like Casey, people who “have a medical situation, even if they’re not in an area where flooding is life-threatening,” Francisco Sánchez, a deputy emergency-management coordinator for Harris County Homeland Security and Emergency Management, later said. Perches says his director, Joe Fress, phoned the county fire desk to see whether the county had resources to send to Wayne and Casey’s street, but was told it did not. By the logic of the county’s emergency-management plan for health and medical services, the ambulance service should have been able to call for assistance from a regional catastrophic medical operations center, which was in charge of coordinating patient evacuation, transport and placement. But that center did not have its own air or boat resources, and additional ambulances would have been of no use in reaching flooded areas. The ambulance companies had to rely on fire services to help them. But in South Lake Houston’s district, unlike in some other parts of Harris County, including Houston, fire and ambulance services were completely independent agencies. Although they were responsible for largely overlapping districts, Sheldon Fire and South Lake Houston E.M.S. did not follow recommendations to set up a joint command in response to the disaster, in part because there were so few workers available. Also, while personnel were individually friendly and respected each other, there was “bad blood from a long time ago” between the agencies, Sheldon Fire’s Captain Pinson says. “They don’t work with us that well.” Workers from both agencies would later agree that communications between them during the disaster were poor. Their radios were on different channels, and their calls were dispatched separately by the 911 center. That meant that when someone having a medical emergency was also trapped by floodwaters, the fire department would not necessarily know about it. The paramedics were fatalistic. “We were fortunate to get what we could get” in terms of outside help, says Billy Slagle, a supervisor at the E.M.S. service. Theirs is a “very small community,” he says, “who’s nobody.” Perches told Wayne to flag down any boat he could, both men later recalled. Right after the call, Wayne turned his phone to record Casey as she lay, flushed and barely conscious, on the recliner chair by the front door. He had heard on the news that people were making false reports when they called 911. He wanted to document that this was a true medical emergency, and that Casey needed help, in case anyone ever questioned him. “Casey?” Wayne asked as he recorded her. The feverish eyes of his wife flickered and focused. She made a sound that might have been the beginnings of the word, “What?” “Someone’s coming to help us, O.K.? I love you.” She groaned softly and turned her head away from him. “Just keep breathing, O.K.?” he said. Pearl Jam’s “Just Breathe” was their special song. It was 12:54 p.m. There was still no power, and light from the open door threw shadows across her reddened face as she lay on the easy chair. Outside, the flooding continued receding, but slowly. After he finished the short recording, Wayne heard a sound that made him look outside. He saw a tiny aluminum boat motoring past the house with two men in it. Wayne stood up and kicked the door open, shouting: “My wife is dying, man. I got to get her out of here.” T he men said they were from the Cajun Navy. They tied the boat to the handrail, came into the trailer and looked stunned when they saw Casey. “We’ve got to get her out of here now,” one of them said. They carried Casey to the boat and motored 300 feet to the drainage ditch at the corner of Enchanted Path Drive and John Ralston Road, where the street was dry. One man took off running to try to flag an airboat, waving his arms and screaming: “We got a medical emergency! We got a medical emergency!” Stephanie Vincent, a 37-year-old respiratory therapist from Kinder, La., was with a group of boat volunteers about a half-mile up the road and saw the man running in their direction. “They got something over there,” she said, and started running toward the man with several friends. One of the airboats they were with flew ahead of them. About a half-dozen men picked up Casey by her arms and legs and loaded her into the airboat. “Be careful of her left side,” Wayne warned them. Vincent and a medical student whose name nobody could later recall tried to get a history of Casey’s problems, but a glance told them all they needed to know. “This woman needs critical care right now,” the medical student said. “She’s fighting for her life, and she looks like she’s losing.” They headed to a nearby field free of power lines where a helicopter could land. A volunteer from Pasadena, Tex., tried calling a number he had found for the Coast Guard on Facebook or Zello, a walkie-talkie app that citizen rescuers were using. Other volunteers stood on a bridge where the road crossed a swollen channel, waving their brightly colored life jackets to try to flag passing helicopters. Vincent stood beside Casey, holding her hand and trying to talk to her. Casey was able to open her eyes and squeeze Vincent’s hand, but she could not speak aside from moaning. Casey was trembling, and Vincent took off her jackets to make a pillow. For the volunteers, the day to that point had been filled with waiting. They had slept in a Baptist church overnight and followed a member of the Cajun Navy to try to evacuate 275 people from a flooded trailer park. But when they reached the neighborhood, residents did not want to leave. The volunteer boat fleet had not managed to find anyone willing to be rescued until Wayne and Casey. Now Vincent felt there was a reason they were supposed to be there. She wished she had brought a monitor to check Casey’s oxygen level. Wayne kept hold of Casey’s hand and murmured encouragement to her. He repeatedly thanked the volunteers. “I’m so sorry,” Vincent said. She and her friends had waited hours for something useful to do. If they had known about Casey, they would have gone right to her. The man from Pasadena called again to check on the helicopter. There were several operating in the area, but all were fully loaded with passengers and would not be back for the better part of an hour. A half-hour passed, then more, with Vincent growing irritated and panicked. Why were they just sitting there? Casey was going to stop breathing and die if they did not get her somewhere. “Put her on our boat,” she told the others. Her idea was to take Casey back to the meeting point where the boats had launched that morning, at the Houston Motorsports Park, about three miles north off a major parkway. Two Texas Department of Transportation high-water dump-truck crews had been parked there for hours, waiting to transport evacuees. Several volunteers lifted Casey onto a seat of the white bay boat, laying her head back on the bow, where Stephanie arranged life jackets to cushion it in anticipation of a fast, bumpy ride. Vincent and Wayne supported Casey’s head as they took off, speeding west along the swollen canal toward the flooded Greens Bayou. They began twisting along Greens Bayou, taking shortcuts where they could. Vincent sat on the bow facing backward, hair whipping in the wet wind, keeping a finger on Casey’s neck to monitor her carotid pulse. It was extremely fast and irregular, an indication that Casey’s heart was malfunctioning. The skin around Casey’s lips was blue. All of these signs were ominous, and Vincent later said she thought about the possibility she would need to start CPR. She had the sense that Wayne expected it, too. At one point, Vincent’s friend Rachelle McClellan jumped out of the boat to help push them over a sand-choked levee against a current — she had to be pulled back in on the other side, where the water was deeper. To McClellan, the way Casey’s hands and feet looked reminded her of how her mother’s did the day she died. The entire journey took about 15 minutes. When they arrived, a truck was already backed up deep into the water. McClellan held onto the truck bed to keep it steady, and several men lifted Casey into it, where the gravel normally goes. Wayne and a transportation employee hopped in behind her. They planned to drive to a hospital, but found the roads were closed, and a National Guardsman they passed recommended that they drive to a small shopping center off Beltway 8, about four miles north. There was supposed to be a medical station at a Kroger grocery store, and there was also a 24-hour emergency-care center run by Memorial Hermann, the hospital system where Casey had undergone her surgery. As the truck bumped and jerked along the road, Wayne could not recall a more uncomfortable ride. The motion was beating up Casey. He struggled to keep her covered as the rain started up again. She was wet and filthy and surely cold. They arrived to find no medical clinic outside the Kroger, and the emergency medical center was closed. The two transportation employees in their orange vests cussed and looked scared. “This woman is dying,” Wayne heard one of them say into a phone or radio. “She’s going to die right here if we don’t get her an ambulance.” A lthough the dump-truck crews were deployed as part of the official storm response, their radios allowed them to communicate only among themselves. So the driver, Calvin Milburn, a maintenance technician, called 911 on his cellphone. Harris County Emergency Corps received at the call at 2:49 p.m. Milburn told the call-taker that Casey was septic and in and out of consciousness, and the call-taker helped him determine her rate of breathing, which was very rapid. She said the paramedics would do their best to get there and asked whether he had access to a defibrillator. He did not. The call center dispatched a South Lake Houston E.M.S. ambulance to the far north of its territory. “You need to bring the patient to the freeway,” the paramedic who took the call, Tyler Cegielski, said. The paramedics were not willing to exit the freeway for fear of swamping their ambulance in high water. They would have to navigate around some areas of flooding and predicted they would be at that part of the freeway in 10 or 15 minutes. The dump truck bumped back out of the parking lot and onto the freeway to await the ambulance. Wayne leaned over Casey, cradling her head in his left arm, and caressing her with his right, her body half in his lap and half in the bed of the dump truck. “Just hang in there, sweetheart. Just breathe. Just breathe,” he said. “Help is on the way. The ambulance is coming.” It was taking much longer than 15 minutes. Wayne saw several ambulances pass by, but they seemed to be going other places. The rain picked up again, and the workers let out a tarp over the truck bed to protect them. Casey had been fading in and out of consciousness for hours now. Wayne felt her stir. Her left hand rose to clench his shirt, pulling his face down to her so they were nose to nose. Her eyes were open now, looking at him. “Let me go,” she said, the first clear words he’d heard her say in more than a day. “Let me go.” “What are you talking about?” he said. “Help is right here.” But Casey did not respond. She vomited something dark and foul-smelling. She stopped breathing. Wayne reached his hand out and beat on the driver’s side window. “My wife’s dying back here,” he yelled. Milburn climbed into the truck bed with them. Casey had no pulse. He began performing CPR. Wayne saw a constable on the other side of the Beltway and leapt out of the back of the dump truck to run to her, jumping over the central median. She called for help on her radio and, seeing another constable pulling up, she told Wayne, “Get that one.” Wayne ran over and told the second constable the situation. That constable, too, got on his radio. Wayne crossed back over the median and hailed a third constable, who turned on his emergency lights, cut off traffic and pulled up behind the dump truck. Another constable arrived along with passers-by who had been driving on the freeway. One went into the back of the dump truck to help work on Casey. About three minutes after Wayne returned to the dump truck, at 3:16 p.m., the ambulance finally arrived. Two of the paramedics who had tried to save Randy Belcher the previous day, Jeremy Fuentes and Jason Foster, took over and brought Casey out of the dump truck. They figured it had been about eight minutes since her heart had stopped. They inserted a breathing tube, started an intravenous line in the crook of her right elbow and placed a needle into the tibia of her right leg to deliver fluids. They attached a pistonlike Lucas device that uses a suction cup to compress and recoil the chest, providing automated CPR. The idea that the young woman had been breathing and even speaking just a few minutes earlier made Fuentes think they had a chance to revive her. They went through everything they had on their truck that might restart Casey’s heart — multiple doses of epinephrine and atropine — but nothing seemed to work. The monitor showed a flat line, no electrical signal that they could shock back to regular rhythm. To Fuentes, the hardest part was watching Wayne watch Casey. After about 20 minutes, one of the paramedics said, “Mr. Dailey, we got to go.” Wayne rode in Ambulance No. 25 with Casey. He supplied her medical history as the ambulance, slowed by the rain, headed to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital in Humble, more than 11 miles away, the only working hospital they knew they could reach. They arrived at 3:54 p.m. Casey’s temperature was high, but her pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure were nonexistent. Her pupils did not react to light, a sign that her brain had not received enough oxygen. For eight minutes, the hospital team pumped Casey’s chest, filled her lungs with oxygen, and gave her additional doses of epinephrine. But at 4:04 p.m., Dr. Christopher Langan concluded nothing could revive her. It was 1 day 2 hours 30 minutes after Wayne’s first call to 911. Wayne reached Casey’s parents on the phone. “I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry,” he said. “Casey’s gone.” F or days after Casey died, Wayne kept receiving calls, texts and Facebook messages from people across the nation. Someone had posted Wayne’s phone number on a Hurricane Harvey Google map, and his address was one of relatively few marked with a pink dot to signify a medical emergency. “Hello, this is Wesley Brown with the Cajun Navy, I’m calling to see if you have been rescued or not.” “Wayne, this is Monica from Houston Rescue. Please let me know immediately if you are still in need of a rescue.” “Hi, this is the Cajun Navy dispatch. I’m calling to see if you’ve been rescued or need to be rescued.” “You don’t know me, but I live in Georgia. I picked up your emergency signal on the Facebook account. I’ve tried to call FEMA and all them, and I can’t get nobody on the phone, but I’ll keep trying.” Wayne responded to the messages. “I’m sorry to say that my wife passed away on the way to the hospital,” he wrote in a text message to a stranger with a South Carolina area code. “I appreciate your efforts, thank you.” “I am so so sorry for your loss,” the stranger wrote back. “Sending prayers your way.” The next week, Wayne’s and Casey’s parents noticed that she was not named as a victim of the storm. Wayne called the Harris County Medical Examiner’s office, distraught. “How come my wife is not on the list of people who died as a direct impact of Harvey?” he asked. The investigator explained that “direct impact” primarily meant drowning. Wayne’s wife, on the other hand, had a medical problem. Wayne said he knew that, “but she wouldn’t have died in the back of a dump truck on Beltway 8 after going through three boat rides if there were no floodwaters in front of my house. Because E.M.S. is 10 minutes down my street. She’d be in a hospital right now.” The investigator apologized and offered to talk to her administrator to see if she could get Casey on the list. To this day, Casey’s death is not included in Hurricane Harvey’s official toll. Randy Belcher’s is not either. In interviews, personnel at South Lake Houston E.M.S. said they believed that at least four or five other people in the district who called 911 with medical emergencies died when they were not rescued in time. Local media highlighted deaths of people in other districts as well: Noah Delgado, an 8-year-old who died of an asthma attack in northwest Harris County and whose mother could not get through to 911; Bonnie Parsutt, 69, who died in Galveston County after her oxygen failed when the electricity went out; Mary Avila, 80, also in Galveston County, who died in a nursing home when she could not get dialysis; and a heart-attack victim who died at home in a flooded neighborhood of Montgomery County that emergency workers could not reach. The City of Houston reported to the F.C.C. that many people with disabilities who had entered themselves into the State of Texas Emergency Assistance Registry and had repeatedly called 911 and 211, the city’s non-emergency line, to request help when their homes flooded did not receive assistance. The number of acutely ill people who lost their lives because of delayed rescues has not been tallied. Preliminary data from the state health department’s Center for Health Statistics indicate that 2,498 people died in Harris County in August 2017, nearly 200 more people than died in July of that year. Over the period of 2008-16, deaths in July compared with August typically varied only slightly. August 2017 appears to be an outlier. The Harris County medical examiner lists only 36 deaths as storm-related, all of which were caused directly by drowning, falls in floodwaters and electrocutions. “We consider only deaths that are a direct consequence of environmental factors,” says Tricia Rudisill Bentley, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner’s office. By contrast, the Centers for Disease Control, in guidance issued last October, recommends that medical examiners “consider indirect causes of death that can be related to the disaster,” including disruption of health care and transportation. Calculating deaths in this way is much more likely to convey the true toll of a disaster. But the C.D.C.’s recommendation “hasn’t changed anything here,” says Jason Wiersema, a forensic anthropologist with the Harris County medical examiner’s office, which has instead provided public health agencies with access to data for further analysis. T he medical examiner ultimately determined that Casey died of pulmonary emboli, blood clots that had most likely formed in her legs and then traveled to block major blood vessels in her lungs. But experts who reviewed her case believe that her deteriorating state in the days leading up to her death was probably related to how her care was managed after surgery. The tumor in one of Casey’s adrenal glands had made too much of the hormone cortisol, which typically suppresses the other gland’s release of it. After her tumor was removed, it would have taken time, perhaps months, for her body to begin producing enough again, with steroid medication needed in the interim to avert life-threatening complications. The deficit of steroid hormones would explain Casey’s pain, vomiting and weakness. The resulting dehydration and her immobility would have raised her risk for developing the blood clots — as would her recent operation and her history of Cushing’s syndrome. When they discharged Casey before the storm, doctors at Memorial Hermann did not send her home with this medicine, which is routinely given after removal of a hormone-producing adrenal-gland tumor. Memorial Hermann referred questions about the case to the individual physicians. Dr. Curtis Wray, her surgeon, declined several requests to speak through UTHealth, where he is an associate professor of surgery. The intern who discharged Casey also did not respond to several email and phone inquiries. Wayne breaking down at the funeral home during preparations for his wife’s burial with, from left, his mother, Darlene Zavertnik; his sister, Michelle Dailey Garcia; and his aunt Ruby Dailey. Andrew Burton for The New York Times Dr. Geoffrey Thompson, the head of endocrine surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Casey’s symptoms were consistent with insufficient cortisol. “Someone forgot to give her steroids,” says the surgeon, whose group has performed close to 3,000 operations of the type Casey had. That failure, and the delay in her transport to the hospital, was all the more tragic, Dr. Thompson added, because the condition she had “is highly curable.” Dr. Laurence Katznelson, medical director of the pituitary center at Stanford School of Medicine, agrees. “Everybody gets placed on steroids,” he says. Asked whether he could come up with reasons Casey’s doctors might not have prescribed steroid medication, Dr. Katznelson replied, “I can’t think of one.” After Harvey, Sheldon Fire acquired a high-water vehicle and boat and sent firefighters for swift-water rescue training; South Lake Houston E.M.S. received approval to purchase a high-water truck for transporting people with life-threatening medical emergencies. But a major problem identified by the county was the lack of a common platform for responders to share information on local, county, state and federal levels. The information-sharing problem is a national one, recognized after the Sept. 11 attacks and the deaths of emergency workers who could not communicate with one another. The establishment of an interoperable communications system, FirstNet, for public-safety personnel was stalled by years of political wrangling over the sale of a portion of the radio spectrum, but it is finally under construction, including in Harris County. Other local and national agencies have also been experimenting: During the storm in Harris County, the Coast Guard brought in a civilian programmer to map distress signals, and in Charleston County, S.C., people can now provide information to 911 online. For Wayne Dailey, who has struggled emotionally and financially in the wake of Casey’s death, improving systems for identifying people with medical emergencies in disasters and getting help to them in time is his most fervent wish. As the climate continues to change, Harvey is far from Houston’s most extreme hurricane possibility. Parts of Harris County prone to devastation from storm surges — windswept walls of water that slam onto land with great power — were spared that additional hazard this time. “As catastrophic as Harvey was,” Francisco Sánchez, the Harris County emergency-management coordinator, says, “it had the potential to be much worse.” O n the afternoon of Sept. 14 last year, in a small, packed sanctuary in a white-painted wooden church in High Island, Tex., Casey’s funeral service began to the strains of Pearl Jam’s “Just Breathe.” The pastor read a eulogy written by Casey’s father, Chuck Dills, who was too devastated to deliver it himself (Dills died of newly diagnosed bladder cancer less than six months later). “A gift from God, that’s what she was,” Chuck wrote. The crowd left the church wiping their eyes. Wayne and Luke, two of the pallbearers, followed behind them. “Your Mom would be proud of you,” Wayne said to Luke, touching his cheek. The family drove to the graveyard. As Casey’s coffin was lowered, all was silent except for the sound of grass being mowed in the distance. One by one, each guest departed, until only Ronnie remained, peering into the broken ground. Wayne came to get him, but for a long time the boy refused to leave.","Houston thought it was prepared for a major hurricane like Harvey.

ABC News,"A series of storms have lined up to bring rain, snow, wind and more waves to the West Coast over the weekend. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Waves of 20 to 40 feet pounded the Pacific Northwest coast from Washington to Oregon producing flooding and damage to coastal cities. At least one man was swept to sea in Depoe Bay, Oregon, and presumed dead after the Coast Guard stopped a search for him late Thursday, ABC affiliate KATU reported. Eight western states are under snow, wind and high surf alerts for the storm Friday. Storm alerts are in place across much of the West Coast ahead of a series of big storms. The first two storms are already bringing snow to the West, including the mountains outside of Los Angeles and San Diego, where several inches of snow could accumulate Friday. The first pair of storms are already impacting the West Coast on Friday. By Saturday, the storm system will be moving through the Rockies with heavy snow expected to add up to 1 to 2 feet locally. Snow will be falling in Salt Lake City and Denver as well. Heavy snow will hit the Rockies on Saturday, as another storm approaches the Pacific Northwest. The storm system will move into the Great Plains by Sunday, strengthening and bringing a chance for heavy wet snow to the western Great Lakes and the Northern Plains, including the Twin Cities. Heading south, thunderstorms are possible from Dallas to Oklahoma City. Some of the storms could be strong to severe with gusty winds and lightning. At the same time, a new storm system will bring more rain, snow, high surf and wind to the Pacific Northwest beginning Sunday afternoon. Rain and wind will impact the Pacific Northwest on Sunday. Some rain is expected today even in Southern California, around Montecito, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, but most rainfall amounts will be less than one-quarter of an inch. Snow will be measured in feet in the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies, where up to 2 feet is possible. As much as 2 inches of rain could fall in Northern California, while the Rockies will see as much as a foot of snow, through the weekend. Major warm-up in the East The final morning of freezing temperatures in Florida and the Gulf Coast comes Friday. Wind chill readings are still relatively cold for the South this morning with 20s and 30s in Florida and the teens for Atlanta and Nashville, Tennessee. The last day of cold temperatures will be Friday before a warm-up in the East. But you won’t have to wait too long for warmer temperatures, as already a major warm-up is on the way for the Gulf Coast, Great Lakes and the Northeast. Temperatures will be in the 70s from Texas to Florida and in the 50s and 60s for most of the mid-South. The temperatures are expected to be in the 40s and 50s from the Midwest into the Northeast.

Jason Parker,"Epic Games As Fortnite: Battle Royale 's season 5 draws to a close (with players still wondering where the Fortnite Cube's going next and playing the new Getaway game mode ), time is running out to level up your ever-important Battle Pass. We're now on week 9 of season 5's challenges, which means there's only one more week until season 6. More than ever, it's time to grind out those challenges and unlock all the gear before it's gone. This week's challenges are pretty standard, but one thing to note is there are no stage challenges this week. We don't know if Epic decided they weren't working for players or if they wanted to mix things up, but don't expect a lot of highly-unique challenges this week. And if you haven't completed the week 8 challenges yet, check out our guide here. So without further ado, here are the challenges for week 9: Free Deal damage with explosive weapons to opponents (0/500) Use an ATK (All Terrain Kart) (0/1) Follow the treasure map found in Shifty Shafts (0/1) -- Hard Battle Pass Search chests in Pleasant Park (0/7) Dance off with another player near Loot Lake (0/1) Assault rifle eliminations (0/5) -- Hard Eliminate opponents in Tomato Temple (0/3) -- Hard How to deal damage with explosive weapons to opponents Get out your rocket launchers, everyone, because they're going to be the go-to weapon for this challenge. You could also use grenades or grenade launchers, but the rocket launcher still packs more bang for your buck. I would suggest going into the 50 vs. 50 game mode, try to find a rocket launcher, then head to the storm circle for the end game, then try to find groups of enemies and fire away. Though it may seem mean, look for downed (but not out) players because you'll get the damage from killing them and those who are trying to heal them. How to use an ATK (All Terrain Kart) This must be the easiest challenge of all time because there are ATKs all over the map, but for safety's sake, players should probably head to Lazy Links where the most ATKs spawn. Jump in, drive and you're done. How to follow the treasure map found in Shifty Shafts Like all follow-the-treasure-map challenges, you could head to Shifty Shafts to find the map then figure out where to go, or just Google it like you just did and get the answer from us! Here's where this week's Battle Star is: Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET How to search chests in Pleasant Park This is your standard chest search we've seen in previous weeks where you'll obviously want to land in Pleasant Park and try to hit all the chest spawn nodes you can. It will probably be pretty crowded as others try to do the same challenge, so you'll just want to focus on it for a few games to get all seven chests. How to have a dance off with another player near Loot Lake We've seen challenges with dancing at various locations before, but never quite like this one. For this challenge, you'll need to fly to the two buildings on the west side of Loot Lake with a friend and head to the dance floor in the north building. From there you just start dancing to complete the challenge. For the best results, play a squad game and make sure to mark the building on the map so your teammates know where to go. Here's where the dance floor is: Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET How to get assault rifle eliminations This is another straightforward quest that will be especially easy if you like assault rifles. Obviously, you'll need to find one of the many different varieties of assault rifles in the game, then get to work. There are a couple different ways to attack this one. You might head for Tilted Towers where you know there will be a lot of action, but I have a different plan. If you like using ARs, you'll likely complete this challenge naturally over the week as you play the game. How to eliminate opponents in Tomato Temple This is one of those challenges you'll want to do right away because that's when you'll find the most people going to Tomato Temple. Simply drop in, gear up and start shooting. You'll want to hop into solo mode for this one to get the highest concentration of enemies.

Antti Kautonen,"The Manasoo, a 178-foot steamer that sank in Georgian Bay on Lake Huron near Ontario, was discovered by an international dive team earlier this year. The Manasoo sank in a heavy storm on September 14, 1928, and 16 people and 116 head of cattle perished in the incident. After some 90 years underwater, the wreck was discovered to be rather well preserved. And it was found to have carried a car onboard: a still-intact 1927 Chevrolet coupe. The Detroit Free Press, which reported on the discovery, called the Chevy a muscle car, yet ""mussel car"" would be more apt after all this time sitting 200 feet deep on the lakebed. The Chevy was originally brought onboard the ship by Donald Wallace, a cattleman, who was the only passenger to survive the sinking (along the the captain and three crewmen). The Series AA car with a 2.8-liter four-cylinder engine probably survived as well as it has thanks to being submerged in cold lake water, not seawater — Great Lakes shipwrecks are typically well-preserved for that reason. The Chevy is likely to continue its watery slumber for some time, as no plans have been announced to extract it from the vessel that took it to the bottom of the lake. The story of the Manasoo can be heard on this diving video, with 1982 audio narration by the then-last living survivor of shipwreck, Dr. Arthur Middlebro, who was the ship's purser.
