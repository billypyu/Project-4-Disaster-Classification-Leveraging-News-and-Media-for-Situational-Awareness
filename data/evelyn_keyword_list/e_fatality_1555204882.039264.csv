Connie Loizos,"Lime, the 18-month-old, San Francisco-based company whose bright green bicycles and scooters now dot cities throughout the U.S., launched a pilot program in Tacoma, Washington, today, but that tiny victory might have felt short-lived. The reason: on the opposite side of the country, a Lime rider was killed today by an SUV while tooling around Washington D.C.’s DuPont neighborhood. The local fire department shared video of the rescue, which shows that the victim, an adult male, had to be pulled from the undercarriage of the vehicle. It’s the second known fatality for the company following a death earlier this month in Dallas, when a 24-year-old Texas man fell off the scooter he was riding and died from blunt force injuries to his head. On the one hand, the developments, while unfortunate, can hardly come as a surprise to anyone given how vulnerable riders or e-scooters are. E-scooter use is on the rise, with both Lime and its L.A.-based rival Bird, announcing this week that their customers have now taken north of 10 million rides. At the same time, city after city has deemed their use on sidewalks illegal out of fear that fast-moving riders will collide with and injure pedestrians. That leaves riders sharing city streets with the same types of giant, exhaust-spewing machines that they hope to increasingly displace. In fact, sales of traditional SUVs has continued to surge, thanks in part to low unemployment, high consumer confidence, and American’s enduring love with gigantic vehicles. One solution to the issue, and one for which the e-scooter companies and their investors have been advocating, are protected lanes that would allow e-scooters to be operated more safely. Bird has even publicly offered to help fund new infrastructure that keeps cyclists and scooter riders safer. Another possible answer would appear to be mandating the use of helmets with e-scooters, though California evidently disagrees. On Wednesday, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into a law that states Californians riding electric scooters will no longer be required to wear helmets as of January 1. The bill was reportedly sponsored by Bird.","Lime, the 18-month-old, San Francisco-based company whose bright green bicycles and scooters now dot cities throughout the U.S., launched a pilot program in Tacoma, Washington, today, but that tiny victory might have felt short-lived.

Jon Russell,"Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing firm, is rolling out new security systems one month after a female customer was raped and murdered by a driver, the second such fatality on its Hitch service this year. Today the company said it introduced a number of new safety features which include random biometric ID testing for drivers (in addition to a selfie-based log-in each day) and the introduction of an SOS button within Didi’s driver app which connects directly to police. Didi said that SOS feature is tied into “a streamlined critical response process” — which includes “a special police response team” set up to assist with issues on the Didi service — and there are fatigue and tiredness alerts for drivers. Earlier this month, Didi added a safety center featuring guidelines and help, and updated the SOS button within the passenger app so it goes directly to the police rather than customer support agents. The company also started trialing an on-route audio recording function for its Express and Premier services. Didi’s CEO and chairwoman earlier said that it plans to prioritize user safety over growth. The company faced strong criticism after it emerged that its own systems had been at fault in both murders. For the first fatality, the driver who committed the murder bypassed Didi’s driver authentication system (using an account belonging to his father) while a sexual harassment complaint lodged against the account before the incident was not followed up on. The second murder showed further problems. The driver had been flagged to Didis safety team just one day before the murder after a female passenger complained that he had requested her to ride in the front seat and then followed her for some time after she left his vehicle. Yet, the safety center representative who handled the complaint had not followed company policy of initiating an investigation within two hours. Didi fired two executives following the second murder — the general manager for Hitch and the companys vice president of customer services — and it suspended the Hitch service for the second time this year. China instituted new regulations around ride-sharing last month which included tasking provinces and autonomous regions with setting up passenger safety committees and ensuring that incidents are investigated promptly. Rival Meituan, which raised $4 billion from an IPO in Hong Kong last week, entered the ride-hailing space earlier this year. The company has been keen to battle Didi but, perhaps sensing the difficulty of the moment, it suspended plans to expand beyond Nanjing and Shanghai and into more parts of China. Didi has been without a strong direct competitor since it reached a deal to acquire Uber’s China-based service two years ago.","Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing firm, is rolling out new security systems one month after a female customer was raped and murdered by a driver, the second such fatality on its Hitch service this year.

Ed Cara,"When a 32-year-old man was struck and killed by lightning while visiting Sunken Meadow State Park in Long Island, New York this August, he became the first lightning fatality recorded in the state since 2016. And he was only the 16th lightning death reported in the entire U.S. this year. As late as the 1940s, lightning used to kill hundreds of Americans every year. But even as our population has tripled, these deaths have become vanishingly rare, largely thanks to advances in city architecture that steer ground strikes away from humans. But the New York mans tragic death illustrates how dangerous lightning can still be. In his case, he was reportedly struck while standing beneath a tree. But while the heat and energy of a direct hita lightning bolt can reach temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sunis more than enough to kill, the truth is that lightning causes death in many strange ways. Sometimes, as with people who send off a powerful streamer discharge, lightning can be fatal without physically hitting a person at all. And to this day, scientists are still stumbling onto new theories about what makes lightning so deadly. Our latest video, above, delves into the peculiarities of lightning death, and offers some tips on how to stay safe during a storm (Hint: Crouching close to the ground wont help).","When a 32-year-old man was struck and killed by lightning while visiting Sunken Meadow State Park in Long Island, New York this August, he became the first lightning fatality recorded in the state since 2016.

Patrick Allan,"Plane travel is incredibly safe—your odds of dying on a commercial flight are about one in 11 million —but accidents still happen and travelers sometimes make it to a different kind of final destination. Many past fatalities may, however, have been avoidable. Here’s the safety info you should be up on in case you go down. https://lifehacker.com/six-airplane-facts-to-cure-your-fear-of-flying-1788654431 Before we get too far into this, you should know that no two airplane accidents are the same and incidents can vary wildly. There is no consistent way to avoid a plane crash, and no methods that guarantee survival. For example, a plane that nose-dives into the ground before bursting into a ball of flame isn’t a survivable incident no matter what you do. That said, most accidents are not like that. Even if your flight has an incident, the National Transportation Safety Board estimates there’s a 95% chance of survival. As John Hansman, director of the International Center for Air Transportation, puts it, “Riding on a commercial airplane has got about the same amount of risk as riding on an escalator.” Sit in the Back of the Plane Location, location, location. Where you choose to sit may greatly affect your odds of survival in a plane crash, depending on the incident. A few years ago, TIME magazine scoured Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Accident Database statistics and seating charts to look for trends over the course of 35 years. Here’s what they found : Seats in the rear third of the aircraft had a 32% fatality rate. Seats in the middle third had a 39% fatality rate. Seats in the front third had a 38% fatality rate. This suggests the safest part of the plane to sit is the rear third of the aircraft. Basic economy, baby. Moreover, the middle seats in that back third of the aircraft had the lowest fatality rate of all seats at 28%. Hope you like sharing armrests. The seats with the highest fatality rate were aisle seats in the middle third of the cabin at 44%. Popular Mechanics performed a similar study in 2007 with similar findings. Their analysis suggests that passengers sitting behind the wing of the aircraft had a 40% greater chance of surviving than the passengers in the front of the plane. The numbers regarding whether you should sit in the aisle, middle, or window seat aren’t exactly consistent, however. A separate study from University of Greenwich found that aisle seats actually provided a marginally higher chance of survival, so it’s honestly a bit of a crap shoot in that regard. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, it all depends on the incident itself. There are plenty of examples out there, like United Airlines Flight 232, where the front of the plane was safer, they’re just fewer in number. Wherever you choose to sit, just make it a seat on a big plane. Larger commercial planes have a larger number of redundant systems, have a lower accident rate, and can absorb more force during impact. Remember the “Five Row Rule” A majority of plane crash fatalities occur because passengers are unable to exit the plane in time after an emergency landing. To give yourself a better shot of getting out in time, always consider what Professor Ed Galea of the University of Greenwich calls the “Five Row Rule.” After studying 105 plane crashes and interviewing over 2,000 surviving passengers and crew members, Galea found that survivors move an average of five rows before escaping safely. Always pick a seat within five rows of an emergency exit. If you can, grab a seat right next to an exit, or one just a single row away. Galea says sitting more than five rows away from an exit means “the chances of perishing far outweigh those of surviving.” It’s no guarantee, of course, but the logic is sound. The further you have to travel inside a burning plane, the lower your chances of actually making it out. Regardless of where you sit, Cheryl Schwartz, a retired flight attendant for United Airlines, highly recommends you count how many rows you are away from the nearest emergency exit, no matter how familiar you think you are with the aircraft. Double check if you have to. That way, if the cabin fills with smoke and your visibility is impaired, you can still find your way out. https://lifehacker.com/where-to-sit-on-an-airplane-for-a-smoother-ride-1787059815 Dress Appropriately As I mentioned before, the impact itself isn’t what causes most fatalities in plane accidents. According to a report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the FAA, 68% of occupants involved in aircraft accidents die from post-crash fires—either from burn injuries or smoke inhalation. The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) had similar findings. They estimated that 90% of aircraft accidents are survivable, and that at least 40% of the fatalities in past accidents were actually survivable. A large portion of those instances were fire-related. To limit your time on board a burning aircraft, and to avoid severe burns, Cynthia Corbett, a human factors specialist at the Federal Aviation Administration’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, suggests you should dress like you need to run away from a burning plane : “If you have to do that, how well are your flip-flops going to perform? How well are your high-heeled shoes going to perform? When you’re sliding down that fabric slide out of the plane, are pantyhose going to withstand? Shorts and skirts and high-heeled shoes just are not our preferred attire for flying, because it’s hard to run in those kinds of shoes and actually escape when you’re not clothed properly. We like to see tie-on shoes that you’re not going to run out of and long pants. Jeans are good. I know in the summer that’s really tough, but short-shorts are just real dangerous in that event...” It’s a good idea to have a long-sleeved t-shirt or jacket as well. Make sure your clothing is made out of 100% cotton or wool so they won’t melt. Do not wear synthetic fabrics. Sorry, I know they’re comfy. And it doesn’t hurt to pack a handkerchief in your jacket pocket just in case you need something to cover your face. You can wet it with the water they hand out and create a temporary breathing mask. Listen to Flight Attendants and Read the Safety Card I know, it’s a drag, and you’ve heard it a billion times, but it’s a good idea to listen to that speech the flight attendants give before takeoff. I get that you know how to put on a seat belt—I mean, you know how to read this right now so you must have the intelligence required to understand basic seat belt mechanisms—but flight attendants are still giving you valuable information. They show you where exits are, demonstrate how to use flotation vests and oxygen masks (which you definitely need to know how to do quickly), and the safety card will have evacuation routes on them that you should absolutely be aware of. But you know all that stuff, right? You’ve flown so many times you could repeat it all by memory! I doubt it. According to a report from the FAA, frequent fliers proved to be the least informed and most complacent of all passengers. Listen to the speech or video, look at the safety card, and develop a plan for yourself and loved ones so you can spring into action the moment something happens. You won’t have time to make a plan later. https://lifehacker.com/how-i-beat-my-fear-of-flying-1052703615 Follow the “Plus Three, Minus Eight Rule” It’s true that most plane accidents occur during takeoff or landing, and there’s a time window for when these incidents most commonly take place: sometime during the three minutes after takeoff; and sometime during the eight minutes before landing. In The Survivor’s Club, author Ben Sherwood explains that 80% of all plane crashes actually happen during this time. To increase your odds of survival during one of those incidents, you should pay attention be vigilant during those times. That means no sleeping, no listening to music, no taking off your shoes, no being sloppy drunk or drugged out, and no unbuckling your seat belt during that time window. Stay aware and be ready to execute your plan of action. Know How to Brace for Impact So it’s happening; you’re going down and the flight crew has warned you to brace for impact. What do you do? If you have time, Corbett suggests you remove sharp objects from your pockets (like pens, pencils, and keys), and stuff your carry-on belongings under the seat in front of you. This keeps the area clear for you and other passengers to walk after the impact, but it also pads the legs and blocks them from going under the seat in front of you. You’ll reduce the likelihood of breaking your legs and hindering your escape. Once you’ve prepared, it’s time to assume the position. First, put on your seat belt. Then, how you brace depends on where you are seated: If you have a seat in front of you : Cross your hands on the seat in front of and rest your forehead on top your hands. This will help reduce whiplash and head injuries. If you don’t have a seat in front of you : Bend over as far as possible, grab your legs around your knees, and keep your head down until you feel the plane stop. Place your hands on the back of your head, dominant hand first. If you’re unsure about your seat, review your safety card before takeoff. It will have the instructions you need to know for your specific aircraft. And make sure your seat belt is on tight. The more slack you have in your seat belt the more G-force your body will experience during impact. Be Ready to Get Out of the Plane Super Fast Okay, you’ve survived the impact of the crash landing and people are yelling and scrambling about. Don’t sit around in a daze. Schwartz says there’s a phenomenon where people sit around surprised they survived the crash, then wait for rescue: “Most crashes are survivable. Yet, with survivable crashes, crash scene investigators find passengers without a scratch on them still belted in their seats, dead.” Get out! Fire and smoke are almost certainly coming. As Sherwood explains in The Survivor’s Club, you have about 90 seconds to escape the cabin before the fire burns through the plane’s aluminum fuselage and gets to you. Ideally, you’ve got your capable shoes on, clothes that won’t melt into your skin, and you wet a handkerchief before the impact so you have something to breathe through. Now you need to follow your designated evacuation route. If you sat near an exit as planned, that’s good. If you didn’t, hopefully you’ve been hitting the gym. The FAA notes that fit young people tend to make it out alive more often than older, more heavy-set folks (evacuation times can differ up to 31%). https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tread-water-efficiently-1819386226 Why? You need to move quickly, slide through narrow aisles, clear wreckage and luggage strewn about, and possibly have to physically move blockage. Climbing seats to reach an exit isn’t ideal, as it can create more congestion at exits, but if it’s your only way out, take it. Once you’re out, get away from the wreckage as fast as possible. You don’t want to survive impact then manage to escape, only to be killed by shrapnel with the plane decides to explode. Now, take a deep breath, and thank your lucky stars you knew what to do.","Plane travel is incredibly safe—your odds of dying on a commercial flight are about one in 11 million —but accidents still happen and travelers sometimes make it to a different kind of final destination.

GREGORY SCHMIDT,"Photo A fiery crash killed a Tesla driver last week in California. Tesla said its Autopilot feature had been turned on before the crash. Credit KTVU, via Associated Press Tesla said on Friday that its semiautonomous Autopilot feature had been turned on before a fiery crash of a Model X sport-utility vehicle that killed the driver last week in California, raising more questions about the safety of the company’s self-driving technology. This is the second fatal crash in which the Autopilot system had been engaged, including a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that the Florida crash did not result from a flaw in the system, but the agency found that the system lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse. Federal investigators are looking into the crash in California, which occurred March 23. The company said in a statement posted on its website that the driver in the crash last week had “about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view” before he crashed into a median barrier, adding that “the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.” The driver, Wei Huang, had been given “several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive,” Tesla said. Still, Tesla defended its Autopilot hardware. In its statement, the company said there was one automotive fatality for every 86 million miles across all vehicles in the United States, compared with one fatality for every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot. “If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident,” the company said. The crash has only added to Tesla’s woes. The introduction of the company’s Model 3 has been mired in delays, and the company has continued to lose money quarter after quarter. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the company’s credit rating, concerned that it was burning through cash.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Around 200 people in the U.S. die every year from run-ins with animals, according to a new study, which found that over one million emergency room visits and approximately $2 billion in healthcare spending are attributable annually to problematic animal encounters. While bear or shark attacks might spring to mind, the majority of the deaths were either from venomous attacks by insects, encounters with dogs, or farm incidents. “The risk of death due to domesticated animals such as farm animals and dogs far outweigh those due to any wild animals,” lead author Jared A. Forrester, with Stanford University’s Department of Surgery, told Earther. “The rates of death due to wild animals remained exceedingly low.” During the study period from from 2008-2015, there were about 86 deaths annually from venomous encounters, with the most lethal being stings and subsequent anaphylaxis from bees, wasps, and hornets. For comparison, the U.S. averages less than 20 shark attacks per year, and only one shark-related fatality every other year. According to the study, “Africanized” honey bees, or killer bees, may be particularly lethal when they swarm, something that’s increasingly common in the southern and western U.S. Similar to more docile European honeybees, Africanized bees, which are invasive, are extremely aggressive and are known to chase anything that disturbs the hive. Forrester said a large price increase recently in epinephrine autoinjections, essential in the treatment of anaphylaxis, “may impact the risk of death in this category,” though it’s too early to tell. As for nonvenomous encounters, a range of domestic and human-associated mammals including cats, horses, cows, pigs, and raccoons made up the bulk of the fatalities, most of which occurred on farms. The two largest culprits for human mortality were horse or cattle accidents. While the database doesn’t reveal exactly how individual animal-related deaths occurred, the study states that humans can be harmed by animals through “bites, stings, strikes, crushing, or contact.” Forrester believes that public health initiative to prevent potentially fatal farm animal encounters should be better promoted and supported, and that opportunities exist to improve safety measures and injury reporting on farms in the U.S. Agriculture is already one of the most potentially hazardous work environments, according to the study, and “severe injuries and fatalities on the farm can result from these interactions with large animals.” In comparing new data to 1999-2007 numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the authors determined that deaths due to human-animal encounters did not decrease. In total, between 2008 and 2015, 1,610 people were killed during animal encounters. For kids under four years old, one type of animal encounter is especially troubling: dogs. The rate that young children meet dog-related fatality—4.6 deaths per 10 million persons—was four times higher than most other age groups. There were an average of 34 dog-related deaths per year. Forrester said that educating children under four to properly interact with dogs “is not very fruitful” and “therefore preventing these interactions until they are at an age of comprehension is quite important.” “The burden of fatality upon young children after dog encounters remains troubling,” he said. “These are preventable deaths.”","Around 200 people in the U.S. die every year from run-ins with animals, according to a new study, which found that over one million emergency room visits and approximately $2 billion in healthcare spending are attributable annually to problematic animal encou…",2018-03-01T16:26:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Earther.com'}",Bee Stings and Cow Kicks Kill Way More Americans Than Sharks,https://earther.com/bee-stings-and-cow-kicks-kill-way-more-americans-than-s-1823402460,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--yq2uaGH2--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gfalodavok1dbcmsct6p.jpg",,Earther.com,fatality,1

Megan Rose Dickey,"Tesla says it willingly withdrew from the party agreement with the National Transportation Safety Board, adding that the NTSB is more concerned with “press headlines than actually promoting safety,” a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “Last week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement,” a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “ On Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot — claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true.” This comes after the NTSB said it revoked Tesla’s party status in the investigation regarding the fatal crash involving one of Tesla’s Model X cars. The NTSB said it did so because Tesla, without permission from the NTSB, relayed information to the public regarding the investigation. Tesla went on to note the prevalence of automotive fatalities in the United States in comparison to fatalities involving cars with Autopilot. Tesla says for every 320 million miles cars equipped with Autopilot drive, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities. That’s compared to one fatality for every 86 million miles driven for all vehicles, Tesla said. “If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve,” the spokesperson said. Tesla also alleges its “clear in our conversations” with the NTSB that it cares less about safety and more about press headlines. “Among other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts,” the spokesperson said. “We don’t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be.” Tesla also took time to note how the NTSB is an advisory body, rather than a regulatory one, and how Tesla has a “strong and positive relationship” with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA) “When tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category,” the Tesla spokesperson said. “This was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well.

Melissa Daniels/ AP,"(PHOENIX) — Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended Uber’s self-driving vehicle testing privileges Monday in the wake of a pedestrian fatality in a Phoenix suburb last week. Ducey told the company CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that video footage of the crash raised concerns about the company’s ability to safely test its technology in Arizona. He said he expects public safety to be the top priority for those who operate self-driving cars. “The incident that took place on March 18 is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation,” Ducey said. The move by the Republican governor marks a major step back from his embrace of self-driving vehicles. He previously welcomed Uber and other autonomous vehicle companies to use Arizona as a place for testing under few, if any, regulations. In early March, he authorized self-driving vehicle companies to run tests without a person in the car to act as a safety operator. Police in Tempe released a 22-second video showing a woman walking from a darkened area onto a street just before an Uber SUV strikes her. The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, police said. Uber’s human backup driver appears on the video to be looking down before crash and appears startled about the time of the impact. Experts who viewed the video told The Associated Press that the SUV’s sensors should have seen the woman pushing a bicycle and braked before the impact. The fatal crash in Tempe was the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle in the United States. Uber immediately suspended its self-driving vehicle testing in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. On Friday, The New York Times reported that the company’s own documents showed the testing program was rife with issues. They included trouble driving through construction zones and requiring far more human intervention than competing companies. In Arizona, companies such as Uber only need to carry minimum liability insurance to operate self-driving cars. They are not required to track crashes or report any information to the state. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",The governor had embraced self-driving vehicles until the pedestrian fatality last week,2018-03-27T02:01:27Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Arizona Is Suspending Uber’s Self-Driving Vehicle Tests After a Pedestrian Was Killed,http://time.com/5216457/arizona-uber-autonomous-tests-suspended/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-609845728.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,fatality,1
,"A FIVE-MONTH-OLD baby boy from Cebu City is the latest measles fatality in the region, according to records of the Department of Health (DOH) 7.
He is the 10th measles fatality in Central Visayas so far this year.
Dr. Jeanette Pauline Cortes, Medical Officer IV of DOH 7, said the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit 7 has recorded a total of 1,058 measles cases from Jan. 1 to March 18 this year.
This is 1,026 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
Cebu City has the highest number of measles cases among the localities in the region with 322 cases.
Dr. Jonathan Neil Erasmo, chief of the Local Health Support Division of DOH 7, said that as of March 18, there is still a measles outbreak in the region.
However, the number of measles cases is plateauing. Hopefully by last week of March or first two weeks of April, our measles cases will drop. Thats what were expecting, he said, explaining that the increase in the number of cases occurs at a slower rate in comparison with earlier phases.
Cortes said that on the 35th day of the measles outbreak response, the DOH has vaccinated a total of 301,961 individuals.
Of the number, 120,697 are six to 59 months old. This is equivalent to 49.45 percent of the targeted 244,091 population in that age group, she said.
We also received 6,000 measles rubella vials to augment the logistics of the Province and the local government units, Cortes added.
Meanwhile, the DOH 7 has recorded a total of 5,339 dengue cases with 33 deaths from Jan. 1 to March 19.
The number is 234 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
The DOH called on the rural health units and the local government units to ensure that households that store water do so properly to avoid creating breeding sites for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.
If we have to store water, we have to make sure the containers are covered. We also have to clean our surroundings, DOH 7 senior health program officer Ma. Michelle Acosta said.

Andrew J. Hawkins,"The annual report on deadly motor vehicle crashes in the US is usually a pretty depressing read. The last couple years have been especially morbid, with traffic deaths rising at an alarming rate year-over-year. And even though the latest report, released Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, contained a few slivers of optimism — slightly fewer people were killed in 2017 compared to the year prior — there were still enough startling statistics to make the overall picture of public roads in America exceedingly grim. There were 37,133 people killed in car crashes in 2017, a 1.8 percent decrease from last year’s total. This is notable considering total deaths were up 6.5 percent in 2016, and an alarming 8.4 percent in 2015. This decrease is the first since 2013. The numbers are still too high, but at least they appear to be leveling off, if slightly declining. Fatalities decreased in almost all segments of the population, with the exception of crashes involving large trucks and SUVs. (We’ll get back to that in a moment.) 37,133 people killed in car crashes in 2017 An important number is the amount of traffic deaths per mile driven. If people are driving more miles, it’s considered natural that traffic crashes (and then fatalities) would increase as well, as long as technology and behavior remain the same. But while vehicle miles traveled (VMT) increased 1.2 percent in 2017, the fatality rate per 100 million VMTs decreased by 2.5 percent. The trend lines for the first half of 2018 are looking even better. In the first six months of this year, an estimated 17,120 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes — 3.1 percent less than the first half of 2017. The fatality rate for the first half of 2018 is down too, 1.08 fatalities per 100 million VMT compared to 1.12 fatalities per 100 million VMT in the first half of 2017. So that’s also pretty encouraging. Here are a few stats that are anything but: more people in cities are being killed in car crashes, and the number of bicyclists and pedestrians killed by automobile drivers is at a 20-year high. This is likely thanks to an increase in VMT in urban communities — cities are bursting at the seams, and as a result there are more people driving. But it represents a fundamental shift in American life. Up until 2015, there were more rural deaths than urban ones. That has now flipped. it represents a fundamental shift in American life Unsurprisingly, SUVs are continuing to wreak havoc on the roads. America’s favorite motor-vehicle type is also the most deadly. The number of people killed while driving or riding in SUVs rose 3 percent in 2017, the only population to register an increase. Sales of SUVs and crossovers in the US have more than doubled since 2010 and rose 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, last year — even though overall industry sales declined 2 percent in 2017. SUVs and light trucks now make up over 60 percent of the cars bought by Americans each year. But while it’s undeniably dangerous to be inside an SUV, it’s exponentially more deadly to be outside of one. The number of pedestrians killed in crashes involving SUVs has skyrocketed by 81 percent in the last decade, according to a report released earlier this year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. America’s favorite motor-vehicle type is also the most deadly This is mostly because of the way SUVs are designed: larger bodies and higher carriage mean pedestrians are more likely to suffer deadly blows to the torso. And higher clearance means victims are more likely to get trapped underneath a speeding SUV instead of pushed onto the hood or off to the side. Speed is also a factor, because SUVs have more horsepower than a typical sedan. A recent investigation by USA Today and the Detroit Free Press found that the growing popularity of SUVs account for the alarming rise in pedestrian deaths. Automakers mostly talk about safety and reducing motor vehicle deaths in the context of new technology, like advanced driver assist systems (think Tesla’s Autopilot) and fully driverless cars. It’s become a cliche for car companies and AV startups to cite the 37,000-plus figure at public events or in their press releases as a way to tout their so-called life-saving technology. But rarely do they acknowledge the undeniable truth: the best way to prevent these deaths is to design cities and residential communities to better encourage more walking and biking, and less driving. Fewer cars, not more, will help curb this carnage.","There were 37,133 people killed in car crashes in 2017, a 1.8 percent decrease from last year’s total.

,"At a Glance Florence's remnants spun up tornadoes in the mid-Atlantic Monday afternoon. One person was killed and another injured when a building collapsed. Damage has been seen in Chesterfield County and in Richmond, Virginia. One person has been killed and another injured in a building collapse in Chesterfield County caused when the remnants of Florence whipped up several tornadoes in Virginia Monday afternoon. ""We can confirm one fatality at the building collapse. All other employees accounted for. We transported one other minor injury to hospital,"" said Chesterfield County Fire Lt. Jason Elmore That would bring the toll from Florence to 21, 14 in North Carolina, six in South Carolina, and this one in Virginia. The building, an Old Dominion Flooring warehouse on Speeks Drive at Hull Street in Clover Hill, Virginia, suffered heavy damage in one tornado. A furniture store on Hull Street was also heavily damaged. Cars were flipped outside the Planet Fitness gym on Hull Street. Several tornadoes were reported near Richmond and damage was reported about 3 p.m. near Hampton Park and Hancock Village, the National Weather Service said. Elmore confirmed a tornado touched down in Hampton Park, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Elmore added trees were down and homes damaged. An Exxon gas station at Archer Road and the Midlothian Turnpike was damaged. Schools that were about to dismiss students instead sheltered in place. WTVR reported that some school buses that had already left were told to return the students to school. Several colleges in the area also canceled evening classes and events. More than 9,000 customers were without power at 5:15 p.m., Dominion Energy Virginia reported. Spokesman David Botkins told the Times-Dispatch there was “extensive damage” to utility poles, transformers and wires. At least 11 tornadoes were reported in Virginia on Monday afternoon, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. All tornado warnings expired at 5:45 p.m., but a tornado watch remains posted for parts of central Maryland, eastern Virginia and the District of Columbia until 10 p.m. The NWS office in Wakefield, Virginia, said it plans to send crews out beginning Tuesday to survey the damage and determine how many tornadoes touched down and their ratings on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The remnants of Florence are interacting with a warm, humid airmass in place over the mid-Atlantic states, weather.com meteorologist Brian Donegan said. Wind shear – the change in wind speed and/or direction with height – is high across the region, leading to the development of multiple tornadoes Monday afternoon. These storms will target Washington D.C.

SANDRA E.

A child fatality is an unimaginable tragedy.
The statements did not specifically explain how the infants died and representatives from the companies and agency were unavailable on Saturday.
Parenting blogs have praised the baby sleeper for years. In a blog post from 2016 on storyoffive.com, a mother called the sleeper the best baby product she had ever bought. In a blog post in February, writers at CynicalParent.com called it magic but suggested that parents see their childs pediatrician before making a purchase.
In a 2013 blog post, Dr. Roy Benaroch, a pediatrician in Atlanta, wrote his first recommendation against using it. He cited sleep guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics as reason enough not to use the Rock n Play.
The guidelines went over several important ways that parents can ensure that their children were sleeping safely, Dr. Benaroch said on Saturday. Among them was that babies should be placed to sleep on a firm, flat surface, and on their back.

"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908, https://www.facebook.com/markberman","OJAI, Calif. — As the Golden State continued to burn for a sixth day, California officials warned that higher Santa Ana winds forecast through the weekend could create more erratic fire behavior, offering little chance of a reprieve for residents and firefighters who have endured flames and smoke for nearly a week. On Saturday, multiple wildfires continued to rage throughout Southern California, cloaking the area in nightmarish flame and towering plumes of smoke so thick they were visible from space. On Friday, authorities reported the first fire-related death: The Ventura Medical Examiner Office identified a body found on Wednesday as Virginia Pesola, 70, from Santa Paula, the “only confirmed fire-related death in Ventura County to date.” Pesola had died from “blunt force injuries with terminal smoke inhalation and thermal injuries” in a traffic incident during “active fire evacuation,” according to the county medical examiner. As the fires spread, much of the region also faces the threat posed by the dense smoke. Public health officials warned of dangerously bad air quality and said it was particularly threatening for the elderly, children and people with respiratory or heart conditions. Los Angeles County issued smoke advisories, urging people to remain indoors when possible, while Santa Barbara County officials said they expected to distribute 50,000 masks to area residents. Phil Moyal, an air quality specialist in Ventura County, said the smoke was causing hazardous conditions there, especially in the Ojai Valley, which is surrounded by mountains that have been trapping the smoke. “When we say ‘off the charts,’ we mean off the charts,” Moyal said Friday about air-quality measurements there. “I would not want to be there too long... I would tell people to go to Seattle. There are not many places in Southern California that are clean or will stay clean, and that can change in a minute depending on the wind.” [ How Santa Ana winds spread wildfires ] There were a few positive signs for the state. Officials battling the Thomas Fire in Ventura County — the biggest active blaze in the state after burning through 140,000 acres — spoke in cautiously optimistic tones as they lifted evacuation orders for cities along the fire’s southern edge: Santa Paula, and parts of Ventura. The coastal enclaves of Carpinteria and Santa Barbara were still under threat as the fire’s northern vanguard continued to move. And officials said that winds which could strike up at a moment’s notice remained a concern. The fire had burned more than 200 buildings in that county, alone. President Trump on Friday declared a state of emergency in California, ordering federal aid to the state in response to a request from Gov. Jerry Brown (D). Firefighters, joined by reinforcements from outside the state, battled the blazes. Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed and thousands more remain at risk as more than a half-dozen blazes continued to burn, officials said. The fires combined to burn across nearly 250 square miles. In San Diego County, firefighters continued to battle the Lilac Fire, which injured three civilians and two firefighters. Residents who fled described rapidly moving flames. “Oh my God, the heat, the heat,” Clifford Sise, a horse trainer who had to evacuate while trying to get his horses out of the San Luis Rey Downs, a racehorse facility in San Diego County. “One of my fillies wouldn’t leave, she burned to death in like one minute. I had ’em all out, and then when I went back after. I must’ve had two little babies run back in their stalls and they died.” The winds fanning the flames were lighter Friday, but forecasts call for them to increase again through Sunday. Red flag warnings of heightened fire risk will remain in place for at least Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Sunday, when winds could peak at around 50 mph. That could combine with extremely low humidity to create more unpredictable fire behavior and severe conditions for firefighters on the ground. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Dianne Jacob, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, said Friday at a news briefing. “We need to stay vigilant and be prepared.” Across the region, people who fled recounted fire and smoke that seemed to come from everywhere. The sounds of helicopters woke Patricia Hampton and her boyfriend at their house in Ventura as the Thomas Fire was growing. When they looked outside, the ground was covered in ash, the air so smoky it was hard to breathe, she said. They hopped on bicycles and tried to flee. “We didn’t know what had happened,” Hampton, 48, said at a temporary shelter at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Thursday, two days after leaving home. “We rode down into town trying to make sense of what we were seeing — police everywhere, firetrucks, helicopters. It was like a war zone. You could hear transformers blowing up.” In Los Angeles, Lili Hamedi said she went into her yard during the week and found her swimming pool filled with ash. “We were surrounded by the fires,” said Hamedi, who lives in the Encino area. “I heard the fire. I never knew you could hear a fire.” In Ojai, the favorable weather Friday allowed fire crews to make progress against what had been multiple lines of flames in recent days. A morning offshore wind calmed to nothing by midday, then shifted to a light breeze that had firefighters near Ojai preparing to defend the western edge of the city. Along the Thomas Fire’s northern edge near Carpinteria, a small city in Santa Barbara County, fire crews, backed by helicopters dropping water near homes and ranches, made great strides against multiple blazes Friday morning and throughout the day. Parts of the city remained under mandatory evacuation orders, but the flames just miles away the previous day had turned into smoldering plumes of smoke. This let fire crews concentrate on Ojai, a quirky town where New Age and the Old West mix in the hills high above Ventura. It has been surrounded by the Thomas Fire for much of the week. Over several breezeless hours, smoke settled into the canyons and dry river beds, complicating visibility for the helicopters making drops to the north and west of the city. For firefighters, the stillness meant the wind was shifting, so they had to get ready, said Forrest Rowell, a battalion chief and strike team leader from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department. “We’re preparing to go in and keep the fire off the city from the north, and clean up some edges that could worsen with the new wind,” Rowell said. The smoke spreading through Ventura pushed Jet Kauffman to pack up her two dogs, two cats and valuables into a car. “Everything is literally burning around you and it’s raining ash and ember, and things are just lighting on fire around you, and you can’t really do much to stop it,” Kauffman said. Her boyfriend, Shaun Kelleher, stayed behind to protect the Victorian house he bought in 2012. He looked out a back window and saw the glow creeping over the hillside, consuming palm trees in its path. The 32-year-old, ignoring mandatory evacuation orders, threw a scarf over his mouth and goggles over his glasses and ran outside to douse the home and yard with a hose. “I saw a house light on fire, and that’s when I started to freak out, because there was no one around,” Kelleher said. A second house burst into flames, then a third, and then an apartment complex. Fire and smoke were getting closer to his house and the wind was picking up. Kauffman, at a friend’s house, called Kelleher and pleaded with him to leave. Then he heard a sound that filled him with relief: Sirens. Some 20 firetrucks pulled into the area, he said, and firefighters stopped the flames bearing down on the house. The couple ended up in Thousand Oaks, a nearby city, staying with Kelleher’s father. Their Victorian home in Ventura had no power or drinkable water, but it was still standing. Ventura resident Nate Weber wasn’t so fortunate. The anesthesiologist and his wife Christine fled Monday evening with their four- and two-year-old daughters to his mother’s house in Oxnard Shores. Early the next morning they got a call from a neighbor: their home at the top of a hill on Mint Lane was gone. Nate returned to find sympathetic neighbors crowded around what remained of his house. He said the experience was “similar to a friend dying.” “I lived in that house six years, but it was a very formative six years,” he said. “I got married, I had two kids — just watching the kids grow up in that house, all those memories.” The kids, too, have had trouble processing the loss. When he showed his 4-year-old daughter a picture of the burned home, she remarked about how sad it was. “Then she goes off to play,” he said. “Two hours later she said, ‘Dad, I’m ready to go home.’ ” Wang, Berman and Rosenberg reported from Washington. Rob Kuznia and Noah Smith in Los Angeles; Soo Youn in Ventura, Calif.; and Angela Fritz in Washington contributed to this report. The Thomas Fire burns between the 101 Freeway and the Pacific Ocean.

David Schwartz,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - More family members of a woman killed by an Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] self-driving vehicle have hired legal counsel, indicating the ride services firm’s legal problems may not be over in the first fatality caused by an autonomous car. Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder said he has been retained by the mother, father and son of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died after being struck by an Uber self-driving SUV while walking across a street in the suburb of Tempe earlier this month. On Thursday, a different law firm representing Herzberg’s daughter and husband said it had reached a settlement with Uber. The terms were not given. That settlement does not affect the new case, McGroder said in an email on Friday. “We are in the initial stages of investigation,” he said, noting he and his two partners will represent the family members and that they had sent a letter of representation to Uber this week. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. The fallout from the accident could stall the development and testing of self-driving vehicles, designed to eventually perform far better than human drivers and to sharply reduce the number of motor vehicle fatalities that occur each year. Uber has suspended its testing in the wake of the incident. Toyota Motor Corp and chipmaker Nvidia Corp have also suspended self-driving testing on public roads, as they and others await the results of investigations into the Tempe accident, believed to be the first death of a pedestrian struck by a self-driving vehicle. The March 18 fatality near downtown Tempe also presents an unprecedented liability challenge because self-driving vehicles, which are still in the development stage, involve a complex system of hardware and software often made by outside suppliers. Herzberg was pushing a bicycle while walking across a four-lane road outside a crosswalk when she was struck. Video footage from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle, released by Tempe police, showed the SUV traveling along a dark street when the headlights suddenly illuminated Herzberg in front of the SUV. Other footage showed that in the seconds before the accident, the human safety driver behind the wheel was mostly looking down, not at the road.

JOE DRAPE,"He didnt find any. Shortly after the course was reopened, however, the filly Eskenforadrink became the 20th fatality, breaking down during a race and later being euthanized.
Track officials and horse trainers have, indeed, grown impatient with each other.
Ritvo is a trouble shooter for the Stronach Group, and was dispatched to California from its Maryland tracks in an effort to make Santa Anita more profitable. He has implemented policies to encourage trainers to run their horses more often in the afternoon races to ensure bigger fields in the hope of attracting more betting. The horsemen, in turn, grumbled when the racetrack was shut down for the recent testing, interrupting their training schedules to make particular races.
Statistically at least, California trainers appear to be more demanding of their horses. Horses at Santa Anita currently average 3.02 workouts per start compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York, according to data compiled by Equibase.
Arthur believes more regulation and vigilance can be exerted during the morning training hours, when nine of the deaths occurred. When a horse is to run in a race, it is examined by state veterinarians for soundness and can undergo drug testing.
In the mornings, we leave the training to the trainers and private vets, Arthur said.
As Santa Anita officials try to figure out why their racetrack has become so dangerous, it will also have to deal with a mounting public relations problem. Animal rights activists have protested outside the gates, and PETA has called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to close the track and asked the Los Angeles County district attorney to open an investigation into the use of drugs that mask injuries.","There have been 21 horse deaths at Santa Anita since Dec. 26.

Tom McKay,"Its April 2019and perhaps the month that will later be known as the dawn of the Age of Fungus. A concerning report in the New York Times this weekend detailed how multiple strains of Candida auris, a drug-resistant species of pathogenic fungus, have quietly spread across the globe. The Centers for Disease Control reports a fatality rate of nearly 50 percent within 90 days of infection and the agencys fungal branch chief, Dr. Tom Chiller, described it to the paper as a creature from the black lagoon that bubbled up and now it is everywhere. Theorized to have spread as widespread use of fungicides weakened the hold of less-resistant species, C. auris is not only deadly, but extremely difficult to eradicate.
In other words, another straw on the human species collective back! But were not quite in The Girl with All the Gifts territory yet, and plenty of other worthy news is competing for your attention. This week, Gizmodos reporters looked into leaked Microsoft emails that appear to show a nightmarish environment for female staff, the drugs that people like to use while having sex, Facebooks failure to change even after accusations of complicity in the Myanmar genocide, and a labor unions resistance to Amazons heavy-handed union-busting tactics.

KIRO 7 News Staff,"EVERETT, Wash. - Police say an 18-year-old Everett student was arrested on attempted murder charges after they read excerpts from his journal that said he was planning to attack his high school with a gun and explosive devices. Grandmother called police Everett police said that a woman called 911 at about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday to report what she believed were credible threats by her grandson to shoot students ACES High School, where he is a student. Scroll down to continue reading More news from KIRO 7 DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP Officers met with the grandmother at her Everett home, where she showed officers excerpts from her grandson’s journal. Officers were also told the grandson had a rifle stored in a guitar case. According to probable cause documents, the journal contained statements and detailed plans to shoot students and use homemade explosive devices at the school. Journal detailed preparations for attack Some excerpts from the journal follow: I’m preparing myself for the school shooting. I can’t wait. My aim has gotten much more accurate … I can’t wait to walk into that class and blow all those (expletive)s away. I’ve been thinking a lot … I can make this shooting/bombing at Kamiak infamous. I need to get the biggest fatality number I possibly can. I need to make this count. I’ve been reviewing many mass shootings/bombings (and attempted bombings). I’m learning from past shooters/bombers’ mistakes, so I don’t make the same ones. Probable cause documents also said the journal “contains a ‘coin flip’ that he did to decide whether his target would be Kamiak High School or ACES High School, then wrote about how ACES won the flip and would be his target.” His grandmother told officers that her grandson had recently purchased inert grenades, which he discussed making “live” in his journal by filling them with black powder, according to police documents. He also wrote about making pressure cooker bombs and where and what order he would be placing his explosives, documents said. Student arrested could be charged with attempted murder Police contacted school officials about the threat and then arrested the student ACES High School. Police said he was carrying a knife and marijuana. He was booked into the Snohomish County Jail on probable cause for attempted murder ""due to planning and taking substantial steps toward executing a school shooting,"" as well as assault, investigators said. Police said once the suspect was at the Everett Police Department South Precinct, he managed to get one of his hands out of the handcuffs and then ran across the parking lot. As he ran, with an officer in pursuit, he fell to the ground and then “mule-kicked” the officer in the thighs and lower torso. Detectives served a search warrant at the grandmother’s house and seized the journal, a rifle, military-style inert grenades and other evidence. © 2018 Cox Media Group.","KIRO Seattle Documents: Student in school shooting plot: 'I need to get the biggest fatality number' KIRO Seattle EVERETT, Wash. - Police say an 18-year-old Everett student was arrested on attempted murder charges after they read excerpts from his journal tha…",2018-02-14T18:41:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kiro7.com'}",Documents: Student in school shooting plot: 'I need to get the biggest fatality number' - KIRO Seattle,http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/everett-student-arrested-on-attempted-murder-charges-in-school-shooting-plot/699779641,https://mediaweb.kirotv.com/photo/2018/02/14/aces%20hs%20larger_1518634389870_10791672_ver1.0_640_360.jpg,,Kiro7.com,fatality,1

Larry Loftis,"Ask a World War II aficionado to name the war’s most highly decorated spy and you’re likely to get one of three answers: Dusko Popov (code name: TRICYCLE), the MI5/MI6 double agent who warned the FBI about Pearl Harbor and inspired Ian Fleming’s James Bond; Juan Pujol (code name: GARBO), the crafty Spaniard who fooled the Germans with a fictional network of 15 agents; or Roman Garby-Czerniawski (code name: BRUTUS), the Polish double agent who at one time had a hundred agents in his INTERALLIÉ circuit. All were terrific spies and each played a key role in deceiving the Germans about D-Day. Each was awarded the Order of the British Empire, Popov and Czerniawski as Officers and Pujol as a Member.
Yet their decorations pale in comparison to those of a courier spy named Odette Sansom (code name: LISE). She was awarded not only an Order of the British Empire (Member), but also a Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest decoration; a George Cross, Britain’s second highest honor; and five other medals. World War II buffs—even military historians—lose sight of the fact that female couriers operating in occupied France had the second highest Allied fatality rate (42%, behind only Bomber Command’s 45%) of the war. But it was Odette’s commitment to honor and duty that allowed her to persevere under such perilous conditions.
Odette was a courier for the SPINDLE circuit of Special Operations Executive (SOE), the secret sabotage outfit Winston Churchill had charged to “set Europe ablaze.” She was a wife and mother of three who didn’t drink, smoke or swear, and to the casual observer she was quite ordinary, perhaps even boring. Yet she was a trained killer. She feared neither danger nor dagger, interrogation nor torture. She didn’t think twice about confronting German generals or commandants, and often placed principle before prudence. Like her colleagues in the SOE, she signed up for the war knowing that arrest (and execution) was a very real possibility—a fate that awaited almost one in two for F Section (France) couriers.
SOE circuits were comprised of three agents: circuit leader, courier and radio operator. These three would then recruit, arm and work with local French Resistance fighters to sabotage German trains, barges, bridges and supply depots. In some cases, hit-and-run guerilla attacks were staged. To accomplish these tasks, couriers carried messages and money to their associates almost on a daily basis.
And danger was ever-present. Wehrmacht soldiers, Vichy police, Abwehr (German military intelligence) and Gestapo were everywhere: control checkpoints, hotels, cafes, trains … even brothels. To be caught with a wireless radio—something every SOE agent would transport from time to time—was a capital offense. And as every spy knew, the Gestapo needed to turn only one operative to infiltrate a circuit and spoil the lot.
One secret policeman, sergeant Hugo Bleicher, did just that. Acting largely alone, the relentless German arrested over one hundred Allied agents, including Czerniawski and Sansom. Not long after Bleicher demolished the INTERALLIÉ circuit in the fall of 1941, the Abwehr recruited him to chase down spies in southern France, where Odette and her SPINDLE team operated.
Through an ingenious plot, Bleicher arrested Odette and her commanding officer, Peter Churchill (no relation to the prime minister), on April 16, 1942. They were sent to Fresnes Prison in Paris, and soon were interrogated at 84 Avenue Foch, the notorious Gestapo headquarters. While Peter followed SOE training and played the village idiot, denying everything other than being a British agent, Odette did the opposite: she told the Germans that she, not Peter, was the circuit leader, and that Peter was just a pawn in their operation.
The Gestapo pounced. They summoned her to Avenue Foch 14 times, always pressing her for the whereabouts of SPINDLE’s radio operator and the hideout of another circuit leader. Odette knew the locations of both, but refused to answer, saving their lives.
Starved and tortured, Odette never broke. Her pat answer was always the same: “I have nothing to say.” When the Gestapo realized that she would never talk, they condemned her to death and sent her to the one place feared by every woman in Europe: Ravensbrück. Here, she was placed in the concentration camp’s underground prison, appropriately named “the Bunker.”
For three months and eight days she languished in a small cell, again on starvation rations. Save five minutes a day when the overhead light was illuminated, she sat in total darkness. Her body was soon covered in scabs, and she suffered from dysentery and scurvy. Her hair began falling out, her teeth became loose and she lapsed into a semi-coma. The infirmary doctor gave her an injection and she was returned to her cell.
That she survived the war was almost miraculous. Many of her SOE comrades did not, however, and for the rest of her life Odette asked that we not forget them. To honor her is to honor them, she felt.
Odette’s medals can be seen today in her special display at the Imperial War Museum. Odette, who by that time had married her third husband and become Odette Hallowes, died in 1995 at the age of 82. On Feb. 23, 2012, almost 70 years after she joined the SOE, the Royal Mail released a stamp in her honor as part of its Britons of Distinction series.

SUSAN HAIGH / AP,"(WELLFLEET, Mass.) — A man was bitten by a shark Saturday in the water off a Cape Cod beach and died later at a hospital, becoming the state’s first shark attack fatality in more than 80 years. The man, identified by Cape and Islands Assistant District Attorney Tara Miltimore as 26-year-old Arthur Medici of Revere, was attacked around noon off Newcomb Hollow Beach, police said. Joe Booth, a local fisherman and surfer, said he was on shore when he saw the man and his friend boogie boarding when the attack happened. He said he saw the man aggressively kick something behind him and a flicker of a tail from the water. He realized what was happening when the friend came ashore dragging his injured friend. “I was that guy on the beach screaming, ‘Shark, shark!” Booth said. “It was like right out of that movie ‘Jaws.’ This has turned into Amity Island real quick out here.” Booth said others on the beach attempted to make a tourniquet while others frantically called 911. Hayley Williamson, a Cape Cod resident and former lifeguard who was on the beach at the time, was in disbelief after the man was rushed into an ambulance. “We’ve been surfing all morning right here and they were just further down,” she said of the two boogie boarders. “Right spot, wrong time, I guess.” Life-saving measures were attempted on the beach before the man was taken to Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, where he was pronounced dead, State Police spokesman David Procopio said. The beach on the side of the cape facing the Atlantic Ocean has been closed to swimming. The family of the victim was notified of the death but his name was not released, Procopio said. It was the first fatal shark attack in Massachusetts since 1936, and the second shark attack this season. A 61-year-old New York man was severely injured Aug. 15 after fighting off a shark off Truro, about 4 miles north of Saturday’s attack. He’s currently recovering in a Boston hospital. “Today is just keeping everyone out of water,” Wellfleet Police Lt. Michael Hurley said. “There’ll be a determination later about what the town wants to do with the beaches going forward.” Beachgoers said the Wellfleet beach is popular with surfers, and with sunny skies and warm temperatures Saturday it was busy, even though the summer season was over and lifeguards were no longer on watch. There have been frequent shark sightings this summer along the outer Cape, often leading to beach closings. The National Park Service, which manages many of the beaches, said it had closed beaches for at least an hour about 25 times by the end of August this year — more than double the annual average. A Cape Cod politician said officials who did not take more aggressive action against sharks bore some responsibility for the fatal attack. Barnstable County Commissioner Ron Beaty said he had warned something like this could happen and urged measures to reduce the number of white sharks. “It is my personal belief that the responsibility for this horrible shark attack rests squarely upon the shoulders of the aforementioned officials for their utter lack of attention and inaction regarding the growing shark problem on Cape Cod of the last few years,” he said. The state’s last shark attack fatality was on July 25, 1936, when 16-year-old Joseph Troy Jr. was bitten in waters off Mattapoisett. Troy, of Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood, was visiting an uncle and was swimming about 50 feet offshore when the shark attacked. __ Associated Press reporter Philip Marcelo contributed from Boston.",A man was bitten by a shark on Cape Cod and died later at a hospital in the state's first shark attack fatality in more than 80 years.,2018-09-16T13:47:30Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Man Dead After a Shark Attack in Cape Cod, Police Say",http://time.com/5397531/man-dies-shark-attack-cape-cod/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/wellfleet-beach-shark-attack.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,fatality,1

Ryan Grenoble,"A self-driving Uber has struck and killed a woman in Arizona in what’s believed to be the first ever fatal accident involving an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian. The accident occurred around 10:00 p.m. Sunday in Tempe, when a woman was struck as she crossed a road outside of the crosswalk. Tempe Police confirmed the Uber was in autonomous mode at the time of the accident, though there was a safety driver at the wheel. The woman, whom Bloomberg has identified as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, was transferred to a local hospital, where she died of her injuries. Video of the scene from ABC15 shows a self-driving Uber SUV with a damaged hood and right front fender. A bicycle with a bent rim lies on the sidewalk nearby. “Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Twitter. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.” The National Transportation Safety Board said it will send a team to investigate the incident. “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” Uber said in a statement released on Twitter. “We’re fully cooperating with @TempePolice and local authorities as they investigate this incident.” The company told HuffPost it has halted all of its autonomous vehicle testing in other cities as it works to understand what caused the accident. A self-driving Uber in Tempe was also involved in a crash last March that led to a temporary suspension of testing, though in that incident no one was injured and the vehicle was not found to be at fault.",It's the first known fatality involving a pedestrian and an autonomous vehicle.,2018-03-19T17:52:27Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Self-Driving Uber Involved In Arizona Pedestrian Death,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/self-driving-uber-involved-in-pedestrian-death-in-arizona_us_5aafeabbe4b0697dfe193348,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5aaff7112000007d06eb25b4.jpeg?cache=JxJEl6IGiJ&ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,fatality,1
Nathan Grayson,"Mortal Kombat 11's art director Steve Beran has seen a lot of fatalities, given that hes worked on the series since the 90s. His favorite in the new game involves bloodsicles, where the character Skarlet stabs an opponent over and over with spikes made from their own frozen blood. Then she pops an eyeball out the back of their head.
You think its over, but the final push with the eyeball at the end is just [chef kiss sound], Beran told Kotaku.
In some ways, the Mortal Kombat series fatalities are a relic of a bygone eraa blood-spattered artifact of pure 90s edginess. The series, however improbably, remains a fixture of the fighting game scene decades later, and fatalities, like everything else, have changed with the times.
 More often than not, we never do anything thats terribly sad. I dont think its ever intentional.
Yesterday, developer Netherrealm threw a big, bloody bash in Los Angeles to debut Mortal Kombat 11, which will be released for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PC on April 23.
While Netherrealm wanted the event to showcase all of the changes its made to this latest version of the game, it was inevitable that MK11's higher-than-ever-fidelity take on viscera-mutilating ultraviolence grabbed everyones eyeballs. (Sometimes literally.) I laughed at the sheer ludicrousness of it; others, like Kotakus Mike Fahey, understandably had some trouble stomaching it all. Speaking during an interview after the reveal, Beran said that the teams goal is to keep the fatalities funnyjust not too funny.
To some degree, theres a filter we have, he told Kotaku. More often than not, we never do anything thats terribly sad. I dont think its ever intentional. I think weve just done it so long that they tend to be more funny than anything.
But funny doesnt mean slapstick. Mortal Kombat has always had a sense of humor, but theres a line where things become corny, Beran said. One fatality move from 1995's Mortal Kombat 3 that was too corny was the character Kabal inflating his opponents heads and popping them. They were like balloons, he said. Thats way too silly for something wed do now. Its too Scooby Doonot Scooby Doo necessarily, but Bugs Bunny.
The key to a great fatality, Beran said, isnt extreme grossness, but rhythm. If theres too much of a drag between beats, its like Lets tighten that up, he said. It could look cool, but if theres not this dah, dah, dah, we adjust it to make it feel right.
If they like the rhythm, the proposed fatality gets sent off to creative director Ed Boon, one of the creators of the original 1992 Mortal Kombat and still involved with the series. Eds involved in every single fatality, Beran said. He usually adds something to it.
Making horrific death come to life in-game is another process entirely. Beran put special emphasis on effects, noting that the games chunky stew of spilled blood and torn flesh dredges up reactions from the pits of peoples stomachs thanks to hours of testing.
We do a lot of testing of, like, how liquid will land on carpet, how itll react on dirt, he said. And we do tests and talk about them like Does that look how youd think it would look?... If I get blood on my shirt, its gonna get dark, so it needs to react appropriately. Our tech artists dig into that and make it look very real.
The fatality process is awesome, Beran said. Its some of the most fun work.
Fatalities come at the end of a match of Mortal Kombat, because its hard to keep fighting after youre dead. In the middle of a Mortal Kombat 11 match, you can also pull off similarly brutal moves called crushing blows and fatal blows. These also tend to produce bone-crunching, organ-smoothie-making results, which are sometimes amplified by X-ray zoom-in effects to drive the point home. Those force the team to examine ultra-violence in different lights. Its one thing to put an elaborate, cringe-inducing sequence in which somebodys skull becomes a cracked bowl for a sloppy helping of brain soup once a match is over. Its another to risk interrupting a matchs rhythm with one in the middle. Crushing blows, as it turns out, are the development teams response to that very issue with a similar feature called X-ray blows from 2015's Mortal Kombat X.
Some players thought X-rays were too long, Beran said. Crushing blows, he said, are faster, a good punctuation that makes you grimace and then gets you back into the fight very quickly.
In a series as nonchalant about flying eyeballs, ripped-off faces, and torn-open mouths as Mortal Kombat, youd figure there wouldnt be anything thats off-limits. And youd be rightfor the most part.
 Some of the most tangible seem to be [like] the Baraka one where the victim is getting spiked through their hand. Thats more cringeworthy to me than someone getting their head smashed.
Its weird finding the barometer of what is too much, said Beran. Some of the most tangible seem to be [like] the Baraka one where the victim is getting spiked through their hand. Thats more cringeworthy to me than someone getting their head smashed. It just seems more realistic. I dont think that crosses a line, but it gets more of a reaction than something thats more cartoony.
One thing thats definitely off the table is a mode in which mid-match acts of limb-smashing, face-perforating violence create lasting damage that affects the characters ability to fight. It sounds like a neat idea, Beran said, but then when it feels like youre just beating up a wounded thing, it doesnt feel as competitive anymore.
 Given that Beran has worked on these sorts of scenes for decades, I wondered if there was anything that grosses him out anymoreif he views gnarly, nearly-photo-realistic violence differently than other people might. He doesnt really think of it on those terms anymore. I hate to keep saying this, but I think its more just the beats to me, he said. Its not so much whats happening. Its more just the animations. 
But fatalities are far from the only thing that the Mortal Kombat team obsesses over. Beran stressed, too, that Mortal Kombats art team spends countless hours obsessing over materials, trying to get the details of everything from metal and leather to dirt and glass just right. Metal looks like metal. Leather looks like leather, he said. Back in the day, the team pursued realistic detail to set Mortal Kombat apart from more stylized competitors like Street Fighter. Even though the look and feel of Mortal Kombat 11 is very different than, say, Mortal Kombat II the underlying spirit is similar.
Its almost full circle, said Beran. Even when it was low-res, wed hire real actors and videotape them and capture their moves. Now I think its just on a bigger scale... Its very common now, but at the time, it was pretty groundbreakingespecially to have huge characters on the screen, that was unheard of. Back then, we tried to make it realistic, and I think we just stuck to that.
Mortal Kombat is also known for its story, another important focus for this team. People have grown up with Mortal Kombat, Beran said. They know the story and have a general idea of the conflict between characters. Not to sound cocky about it, but I dont think any other fighting game does a story mode like we do. Its a full-length movie in the game. An ambitious undertaking for a series that used to prominently feature several palette swaps of the same ninja as central characters.
Ever since MK vs DC, even though it was our first dabbling into it, I think we got better and better and better at it, he said. This story, I couldnt be more proud of. Just visually and storytelling-wise, I think people are gonna be really pleased.
And if thats not your thing, well, therell still be brains getting forcibly scooped out of peoples heads. Something for everyone.","Mortal Kombat 11&#39;s art director Steve Beran has seen a lot of fatalities, given that he’s worked on the series since the ‘90s.

Nick Visser,"Uber will not be held criminally liable for a crash last year in which one of its self-driving cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona the first accident of its kind.
Yavapai County Attorney Sheila Polk wrote in a letter Tuesday that there was no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation arising from this matter but referred the conduct of the person behind the wheel to local police to obtain more evidence.
The crash took place last March when one of Ubers autonomous SUVs, traveling about 40 mph, struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was walking her bike across a dark section of a street. Software on the vehicle recognized her as a pedestrian but didnt stop the SUV  because a system to automatically apply brakes was deactivated to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior, according to a report from the National Transportation Safety Board.
It was the first known death of a person in America from a self-driving vehicle.
Uber said the person behind the wheel, Rafaela Vasquez, was expected to act in such situations. But video footage from inside the SUV showed she was distracted at the time and investigators later said she was watching an episode of The Voice on her phone at the time of the accident.
Vasquez said at the time that she didnt see Herzberg and that Herzberg came out of nowhere. Polks office has returned the case to the Maricopa County Attorneys Office to determine if Vasquez will face any criminal charges, which could include vehicular manslaughter, according to Reuters.
This Office has concluded that the collision video, as it displays, likely does not accurately depict the events that occurred. We therefore recommend that the matter be furthered to the Tempe Police Department to obtain additional evidence, Polk wrote Tuesday.
Herzbergs family filed a $10 million lawsuit against the city last month, accusing officials of paving a section of the road to look like a crosswalk.
[The site of the accident] has a brick pathway cutting through the desert landscaping that is clearly designed to accommodate people to cross, the claim reads. AZ Central notes that the city tore out the pathway last fall and replaced it with landscaping.
Uber stopped testing its self-driving vehicles in Arizona after the accident but has focused on a smaller program in Pittsburgh. Each car in that test had two drivers inside to take over in case of emergencies, and no passengers were inside during the rides. The company also said the cars wouldnt go faster than 25 mph.",The death of 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg was the first known fatality linked to an autonomous vehicle in the United States.,2019-03-06T01:02:25Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Huffpost.com'}",Uber Not Criminally Liable After Self-Driving Car Killed Woman: Local Prosecutor,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/uber-not-liable-death-elaine-herzberg_n_5c7f0f41e4b020b54d7fccde,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c7f14ac20000003046ed839.jpeg?cache=rohjpwsb0b&ops=1910_1000,,Huffpost.com,fatality,1
Mark Kaufman,"On Sept. 14, Wendy Dockray strolled down to Newcomb Hollow Beach, on the shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The waves were mighty that day, so she went to watch the surf pound the shore. The waves also attracted surfers. ""I actually thought, 'Aren't they worried?'"" Dockray, whose family has owned a house on the cape for 60 years, said in an interview. The next afternoon, a shark — suspected to be a great white — sunk its teeth into 26-year old boogie-boarder Arthur Medici. The tragedy was first shark attack fatality in Cape Cod since 1936, and it came a month after a shark latched onto the thigh of a New York neurologist, who was fortunately dragged ashore by group of beachgoers, and lived to tell a lurid tale. Decades ago, however, no one ever saw sharks in Cape Cod, New England's legendary hooked-shaped summer destination. No one even thought about them. ""Zero. No concern. We never worried about sharks,"" said Dockray. ""Sharks were something that happened in Australia."" Yet today, it's not just sharks that have returned to Cape Cod. It's a greater return of the ocean and coastal wilderness: What it was like centuries ago, before salty mariners arrived in droves to fish the plentiful seas; before the Pilgrims first stepped foot onto the cape, en route to establishing a colony at Plymouth. A Cape Cod beach closes in August 2018 following a shark attack. Image: William J Kole/AP/REX/Shutterstock SEE ALSO: Glowing snow is falling thousands of feet under the sea. Here's why. Sharks hunt seals, but seal populations were mostly exterminated from New England waters around 150 years ago, Sean Hayes, chief of the protected species branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, said in an interview. But, after being protected by the landmark Marine Mammal Protection Act nearly half a century ago, the seals are back, and growing their numbers. The sharks, also protected under U.S. law, have followed. ""From strictly a conservation goal of trying to recover these wild animals and upper-level predators, it's been incredibly successful,"" said Hayes. A truer wilderness, then, has largely returned to the shores of Cape Cod, well beyond just sharks and seals. In some areas, clouds of fish dart frantically beneath the surface as humpback whales open their jacuzzi-sized mouths and engulf them. But today, there's another dominant species in the water. ""We never worried about sharks."" ""Now, you’ve got a new player — and that new player is human beings,"" Greg Skomal, a senior scientist at the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, who has researched white sharks for three decades, said. ""Sharks are trying to hunt seals, and now people are in the mix."" For locals, the change is palpable. ""We live in a part of the country where, up until now, there was nothing that was going to kill you,"" said Dennis Minsky, a Cape Cod naturalist who spends his summer out at sea educating the public about whales, and anything else dwelling in the water. But before the sharks came the gray seals. They're everywhere now, and they promise to attract more predators. Gray seals in New England. Image: Noaa ""It's scary to us,"" Pete Hall, the owner of Van Rensselaer’s Restaurant and Raw Bar, just up street from the Wellfleet beach where the tragic Sept. 15 attack occurred, said in an interview. ""It's amazing to me how we went from like a dozen seals, to so many,"" Hall said. The expanding wilderness In the quiet twilight of Cape Cod, insulated from the boisterous pianos and merrymaking on Provincetown's Commercial Street, you can see the animals swimming, almost playfully, just 10 feet offshore. Their dark heads bob out of the water, silhouetted by the moon. The gray seals have colonized Cape Cod from farther north, where hundreds of thousands of seals breed on Canada's snake-shaped Sable Island. But like all islands, Sable has its limits. So the gray seals are radiating out. And as a seal destination, Cape Cod has it all: abundances of small fish and large beaches to haul out on. The gray seals are even radiating well-beyond Cape Cod. Hayes, the marine scientist, recently spotted one off of Virginia. ""Their range is likely still expanding,"" he said. A gray seal pokes its head out of the water on Cape Cod's Nauset Beach. Image: MATT CAMPBELL/EPA/REX/Shutterstock Yet in 1980, gray seal populations in New England were pitiful, at least compared to today. A survey at the time found 30 gray seals, though there were probably more. ""I would be surprised if there were a thousand,"" said Hayes. ""There definitely weren’t the tens of thousands that there are today,"" said Hayes. The sharks have noticed. ""They see rich foraging opportunities emerge on Cape Cod, and elsewhere,"" said Skomal, the shark scientist. Just how many great white sharks are? ""Counting fish is difficult,"" said Skomal. But he's cataloged 300 in the Cape Cod area, meaning at minimum 300 sharks have visited the region. Skomal's lab aims to have more precise population numbers next year. But there is one trend: ""The number seems to be increasing from year to year."" A great white shark. Image: noaa Living on the cusp of wilderness The top of the marine food web has returned to the Cape Cod shore. And that can be shocking. ""It's frightening to think this could happen here,"" said Dockray. For some, that means accepting reality and adapting. ""I’ll still swim in the harbor, but I’m not swimming in the ocean anymore,"" said Minsky, noting that his friend, a veteran lobster diver, recently had the dark shadow of a shark pass overhead. ""That was his last day in the water."" Yet, Minksy emphasized, even here the chance of getting attacked — while perhaps now elevated — is ""minute."" ""Its not Jaws,"" Sean Anderson, a biologist at California State University Channel Islands, said in an interview. Historic Provincetown sits at the edge of Cape Cod. Image: Shutterstock / Tono Balaguer Sharks aren't seeking humans. They're often just reacting to what they think is a seal, said Skomal. In 2017, there were a total of 88 unprovoked shark attacks globally, according to the Florida Museum. Just five of these encounters were fatal. Addressing the likelihood of a shark attack is a ""constant, constant, constant battle,"" said Anderson. ""Way more people are going to die in their cars."" ""If everything is so sanitized, we lose a part of what makes us a traveler on this crazy spaceship planet we have."" But, said Minksy, each person will find their own strategy to cope with the change. Some folks will be undeterred, and continue surfing. Some might hope for the local or state government to put up shark-deterring nets near the shore. Some might take a quick dip — and then scurry back to the beach. But there's a big payoff, said Anderson ""That's the wilderness — there's this rawness,"" he said. ""If everything is so sanitized, we lose a part of what makes us a traveler on this crazy spaceship planet we have."" Even without sharks, the seas are already a place full of dark unknowns to us land-dwellers. It's a wild, unruly place, even if we forget this for a century or so, until the sea creatures come back. ""The water is a foreign element anyhow,"" said Minsky. ""We really visit it at our peril.""","On Sept. 14, Wendy Dockray strolled down to Newcomb Hollow Beach, on the shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Sasha Lekach,"A woman rear-ended a fire truck in Utah last week and broke her ankle in the crash. That in and of itself doesn't seem like the typical story that would trigger national coverage, but because a Tesla electric car with semi-autonomous features was involved, everyone's talking about it. SEE ALSO: Pro-tip: Tesla's autopilot doesn't mean you can sit in the passenger seat This week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk doubled (tripled? quadrupled?) down on the safety of Tesla's Autopilot feature — a semi-automated driver assistance mode Tesla introduced to its cars in 2014 and now comes with every vehicle. The stat Musk and the company repeated (and will continue to repeat) about Autopilot reducing crash rates by 40 percent came under some scrutiny earlier this month. Wired found that the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration-backed stat is likely based on flawed, unreliable data. It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018 Because this sensor- and camera-heavy technology is still relatively new and constantly under development it warrants a closer look. Most drivers don't consider Autopilot and other semi-autonomous features commonplace even if Musk does. His stance may show how out of touch he is with the regular motorist. It's still unclear if the crash in South Jordan, Utah, was the fault of the Autopilot program gone awry. The woman told police she was on her phone while Autopilot was engaged in her Model S, which is the exact situation Tesla warns about. If you're not paying attention crashes can happen. Tesla told Jalopnik that it hasn't received any data about the incident and can't definitively say whether or not Autopilot was engaged. We reached out Tesla for more about the crash, but have yet to hear back. Police went out of their way to reiterate Tesla's warnings about automated features: ""It is the driver’s responsibility to stay alert, drive safely, and be in control of the vehicle at all times. Tesla makes it clear that drivers should always watch the road in front of them and be prepared to take corrective actions."" According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018 Earlier this year Tesla introduced event data recorder tools, or EDR, for crashes, so the woman could ostensibly log in and get more info about her car and what happened. As Tesla explains about the resource, ""The recorded data may help Tesla and other interested parties better understand the circumstances which lead to crashes and the potential for injury."" However, no Autopilot data will be logged through the black-box system. No matter what went down in Utah, the kinks of a self-driving system (even if it's only Level 2 automation and requires full attention of the driver, as Tesla repeatedly stresses) need to be highlighted, examined, and tracked. After March's fatal crash south of San Francisco in which a man driving a Model X in Autopilot mode hit the median, Tesla needs to examine its ""safety"" feature with more scrutiny. ""Someone gets used to having an autonomous driver, then they disengage. That's natural human behavior,"" Paul Hightower, CEO of video-recording tech company Instrumentation Technology Systems, said in a phone call Tuesday. Tesla, in his estimation, shouldn't expect its drivers to be able to switch from passive rider to attentive motorist. Autopilot certainly has its moments that Musk will quickly tell you don't get attention because it's saving lives like it's NBD. After moments like this one caught on camera show Autopilot narrowly avoiding a swerving truck, Musk must've beamed from his factory office couch — finally people see what the safety feature can do. Even if no one was killed or seriously injured, Friday's incident shows Autopilot has its work cut out for it. While Autopilot includes auto-steering, adaptive cruise control, lane-changing, automatic braking, auto lighting adjustments, side warnings, and front collision warnings, this isn't a perfect or fully autonomous system. The company warns that the car cannot detect everything and may not brake or slow down for stationary vehicles — especially if you're going faster than 50 MPH and the car ahead moves out of the way for a stationary object. That sounds beyond similar to what happened Friday in Utah. Tesla's owner manuals and built-in warning systems try to educate and persuade drivers to use the autonomous features safely and cautiously. Staying alert and present is a huge part of Tesla's messaging and education. If hands aren't detected on the wheel enough drivers get locked out of Autopilot. Other alerts are set off based on speed, road markings, and traffic. But in an instant, the Autopilot feature's flaws are exposed. In that situation where the vehicle ahead suddenly moves out of the way for a parked or non-moving vehicle, Autopilot needs to be able to respond — and quickly. ""if Autopilot isn’t capable of dealing with that you shouldn’t be able to use it,"" Hightower said. From the outside it was just another rear-ender, but with the possibility of Autopilot controlling the wheel most Tesla accidents will continue making headlines not matter how much Musk protests.","A woman rear-ended a fire truck in Utah last week and broke her ankle in the crash.

They include Iran Aseman Airlines; Iraqi Airways in Iraq; Blue Wing Airlines in Suriname; Med-View Airlines in Nigeria; Avior Airlines in Venezuela; and Air Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. While the cause of the Lion Air accident remains under investigation, statistics show that flying generally is a safe way to travel. The airline trade association International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 member airlines, or 82 percent of all air traffic, reported an accident rate of 1.08 per 1 million flights in 2017. Worldwide, air travel is incredibly safe, said Gary Leff, who writes the aviation blog View from the Wing. The things that go wrong are such outliers, he said, because things generally do not go wrong. The commercial website Airlineratings.com publishes safety ratings for more than 435 carriers worldwide. The site uses a seven-star system for rating airlines based on whether they have passed an operational safety audit with the International Air Transport Association; if they are allowed to fly in the European Union; if they are free of fatalities in the past 10 years, and whether they have passed the I.C.A.O. country audit. After the crash, Lion Air currently holds a six-star rating from the group. Air France has the same level of clearance; the website notes a 2009 fatality. All three legacy carriers based in the United States American, Delta and United have seven-star ratings. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Dozens of explosions apparently triggered by a natural gas pipeline rupture rocked three communities in Massachusetts on Thursday, killing at least one person and causing multiple injuries and evacuations. There have been 42 significant incidents involving gas distribution lines so far this year in the United States, according to data from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Significant incidents result in a fatality or injury resulting in hospitalization, create more than $50,000 in damage, or release a sizable volume of material. Gas distribution lines are the smaller gas pipelines that distribute gas to homes and businesses. Significant incidents resulted in two deaths and an estimated 29 injuries, according to data on PHMSA’s website that precedes the Massachusetts explosions. Below are statistics for gas-distribution pipeline accidents over the past two decades.

Cale Guthrie Weissman,"As a millennial, I would like to apologize. If you’ve been reading the headlines lately, all the destruction caused by people in my vague age group should be abundantly clear. We have killed so many things, and today is no different. According to Bloomberg, the latest fatality caused by millennials is American cheese. The article makes a clear case: American cheese consumption has fallen 1.6% this past year … something something something… millennials are to blame. “The product, made famous by the greatest generation, devoured by boomers on the go and touted as the basis for macaroni and cheese, the well-documented love object of Gen X,” the article writes, “has met its match with millennials demanding nourishment from ingredients that are both recognizable and pronounceable. As far as I can tell, the proof that people born between 1981 and 1996 are destroying this once-beloved food item is that sales have been down for the last four consecutive years. It’s unclear if the problem is that the people who died of old age over the last half decade were known for their processed-cheese purchase volume, or if millennials in 2014 all attended the same “down with Kraft” meeting. Whatever the answer, it’s clear my generation has done goofed again. What’s more, Bloomberg is on it. We can add American cheese to the long list of things millennials have killed. They include divorce, mayonnaise, the primary care physician, beer, and napkins. As someone who likes Tex-Mex queso, this news is an especially harsh blow. (I also do really like mayonnaise!) It’s true I don’t put Kraft singles on every one of my sandwiches, but it is necessary for the spicy dip. However, now that I’ve received the memo to kill American cheese, I suppose I have to stop.

Connie Loizos,"Over the last couple of days, serial entrepreneur Elon Musk has been tweeting about how to potentially help the 12 young soccer players and their coach who’ve been trapped in a cave in Thailand since entering it June 23rd, after which they became trapped by rising floodwaters. Now, suggests Musk, working with cave experts in Thailand, Musk and engineers from his rocket company, SpaceX, have decided on the “primary path” to attempt to freeing the group: a “tiny, kid-size submarine” that uses the “liquid oxygen transfer tube” of SpaceX’s Falcon rocket as hull. It’s “[l]ight enough to be carried by two divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust,” Musk tweeted a couple of hours ago, adding that construction on the vehicle will be “complete in about 8 hours” after which it will be sent on a 17-hour flight to Thailand. (SpaceX is based in Hawthorne, California, outside of L.A.) Whether the creation is made and shipped out remains to be seen, but Musk suggested on Twitter that it would be “[f]itted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air” with “[s]egmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights” and “adjust buoyancy.” Musk had tweeted last night that both SpaceX and his much newer, tunnel boring company, Boring Company, would be sending engineers to Thailand today to see how they could help. Today, somewhat strangely, Musk took a break from sharing his thoughts about how to engineer a rescue to promote a contest wherein one winner will receive a customized Tesla 3 car as the grand prize. Still, if SpaceX is able to create an escape pod that works, Musk — who enjoys a kind of cult status in the business world for building superior products in challenging, capital-intensive industries — will only further burnish his reputation as a kind of Tony Stark figure. Indeed, his Twitter feed is currently filled with adoring comments relating to his interest in rescuing the soccer team. It’s a daunting challenge. As reported in the New York Times, the cave complex has never been fully mapped and it features different waterways that don’t appear to be directly linked. Rescue attempts have already led to one fatality, that of former Thai Navy SEAL diver Saman Gunan, who brought tanks of air to the boys and their coach, then lost consciousness in one of its passageways on his swim out of the complex. Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 7, 2018 Got more great feedback from Thailand.

"USA TODAY, Bart Jansen, USA TODAY","In this National Transportation Safety Board handout, investigators examine damage to the CFM International 56-7B turbofan engine belonging Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 that separated during flight at Philadelphia International Airport April 17, 2018 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo: Handout, Getty Images) Southwest Airlines lost $100 million in revenue after an accident that produced its first-ever passenger fatality in April. But advertising helped revive traffic with record passengers and revenue in the second quarter, executives said Thursday. On April 17, an engine failed on a flight from New York to Dallas and hurled debris into the fuselage of the Boeing 737-700, which broke out a window. A passenger died after she was pulled halfway out of a window. The federal investigation continues into why one of the engine's fan blades broke and what could be done to prevent it from happening again. But airlines have inspected all the fan blades on similar CFM International engines. Southwest inspected 17,000 fan blades in 30 days, said Mike Van de Ven, chief operating officer. Southwest also speeded up inspections and lubrication of fan blades on General Electric engines, to occur every 1,600 flights down from 3,000 flights, he said. Southwest lost $100 million in passenger revenue after the accident, according to President Tom Nealon. Despite the accident and load factors 1 point down from the year before, the airline carried a record 35 million passengers during April, May and June, and posted a record $5.7 billion in revenue, Nealon said. “It feels like the business effects of the April accident are behind us,” CEO Gary Kelly said. To begin regaining passengers, Southwest embarked May 15 with a “very unusual” summer travel fare sale on television and internet, Nealon said. The sale was targeted for travel from June through October focusing on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, while preserving last-minute yields because of a 21-day advance purchase requirement, Nealon said. “The sole purpose was to get back in front of our customers,” Nealon said. “The sale worked just as designed.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uQNNnH","“It feels like the business effects of the April accident are behind us,” CEO said about accident that resulted in Southwest's first-ever passenger fatality.",2018-07-26T19:26:20Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Southwest: Passenger traffic has rebounded after fatal accident,https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2018/07/26/southwest-rebounds-after-fatal-accident-record-revenue-passengers/843944002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakabl,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/11865b4b237ef9098652f2bc491306eba55482af/c=0-532-5465-3620/local/-/media/2018/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636682139832328067-southwest-engine-1-.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop,usa-today,USA Today,fatality,1
Benjamin Zhang,"Southwest Airlines Boeing 737. Southwest Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 suffered a catastrophic failure of its left side engine last Tuesday. The uncontained failure of the engine's fan blade damaged the wing and punctured the Boeing 737-700's fuselage. The failure along with the resulting cabin depressurization forced the jet to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia. The incident also caused the death of passenger Jennifer Riordan. The mother of two and Wells Fargo vice president became the first fatality on board a Southwest Airlines flight in the company's 50-year history. Riordan is also the first passenger fatality for any US airline since 2009. That year, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed outside Buffalo, New York killing 50 people. In the decade since commercial aviation in the US has experienced a relatively trouble-free period of growth. The commercial aviation system is ""impossibly safe,"" industry analyst Richard Aboulafia told Business Insider in the wake of the Southwest incident. And the flying public in the US agrees. In a poll conducted after the Southwest emergency landing by our partners at MSN, 60% of respondents said they believe flying is very safe. Another 32% of respondents said flying is somewhat safe. While only 2% said flying is not safe at all. Of the nearly 209,000 people polled in the US, 51% of respondents said flying is the safest way to travel —compared to the 34% who believed the driving was the safest.

COREY KILGANNON,"Chris Nutter surveys the land around him in rural upstate New York from a tree stand, which are popular among deer hunters. At least five people have died this year statewide while hunting from tree stands and many more have been injured. Credit Brett Carlsen for The New York Times Jeff Callahan can still recall the morning he dozed off while hunting deer from a homemade tree-stand in upstate New York. The resulting fall — a 13-foot plunge that caused a spinal injury and left him paralyzed from the neck down — was avoidable, he said, if only he had followed precautions and tethered himself to the tree with a safety line. “Some guys think they’re indestructible, and that’s what I thought too,” said Mr. Callahan, 57, who now hunts from his wheelchair. Even aiming with his teeth and firing with the help of a breathing tube, he has bagged many deer with both shotgun and crossbow. “They call me one-shot,” he said. While the topic of dangerous hunting mishaps has long seemed synonymous with gun-related incidents, there is now a more deadly category: falls from tree stands that have become increasingly popular among gun and bow hunters seeking a high vantage point. Tree stand mishaps are not a new phenomenon, but have become chronic enough that, this year for the first time, New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation, which regulates hunting, has begun collecting information about such accidents from local authorities to better monitor and study the problem, said the agency’s commissioner, Basil Seggos. As this year’s deer hunting season winds down, New York State officials report only one gun-related fatality among hunters this year, while at least five people have died statewide while hunting from tree stands — many more have been injured. “Some guys think they’re indestructible, and that’s what I thought too,’' said Jeff Callahan, who was left paralyzed from the neck down after he fell from a tree stand while hunting deer. Credit Brett Carlsen for The New York Times State officials reported one tree stand death last year, but said that there may have been others, since they had not started to systematically begin tracking the incidents. Mr. Seggos said he had “heard at least anecdotally that a number of people die or get injured each year” from tree stand falls and mishaps, but lacked hard information. “I wanted to begin tracking them, to see where the problems were,” he said. Gun mishaps, the longtime scourge of hunting season, have been declining for decades because of safety awareness initiatives such as orange clothing meant to deter accidental shootings, said Glen Mayhew, president of the national Tree Stand Safety Awareness Foundation. “But we’ve seen tree stand incidents go up, because although people know they should wear harnesses, many still aren’t wearing them,” said Dr. Mayhew, adding that the mishaps continue despite persistent efforts to educate hunters about tree stand safety, the most important rule being the use of a safety line and harness attached to the tree both while in the stand and while climbing in and out. Several thousand hunters fall from tree stands each year nationwide — with roughly 4,000 falls in 2015 — and states where hunters use tree stands typically have a fatality or two a year, Dr. Mayhew said. “So to see five fatalities from one state in a year, is an outlier, or unusually high,” he said of New York’s figures. Mr. Seggos said his agency relies on some 2,500 teaching volunteers for its hunter safety program, and that about 45,000 hunters took advantage of the 1,500 courses given this year whose curriculum includes safety instruction on the stands, which often consist of a seat and a small platform that are fastened onto a tree’s trunk above brush lines and above an animal’s ability to spot or smell a hunter. Also, he said, the agency has created online videos on tree stand safety, posted online notifications, and put out advisories on social media. Mr. Nutter, a hunter who lives near Syracuse and teaches bow hunting safety, said he knows numerous hunters who have suffered broken limbs and spinal injuries from falls. Credit Brett Carlsen for The New York Times Of the five tree stand fatalities in New York in recent months, one is still under investigation, officials said. One was caused by the failure of a tree stand, and another victim likely fell while entering or exiting a stand, a particularly common circumstance. The two other victims fell after having heart attacks, state officials said. For some hunters, carrying equipment long distances to hunting locations and then climbing up to the stand can increase the chances of a heart attack, Dr. Mayhew said. Strapping into the stand can help a hunter survive a heart attack by enabling him to phone or signal for help, he said. Dr. Michael F. Kamali, who runs the emergency department at the University of Rochester Medical Center, said hunters are brought in perhaps once a week — usually still in their hunting outfits — after tree stand falls, with injuries that range from “minor to very significant to life threatening.” Chris Nutter, 57, a hunter who lives near Syracuse, and teaches bow hunting safety said he knows numerous hunters who have suffered broken limbs and spinal injuries from falls. Two hunters died in tree stand accidents in 2015 in Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse, he said. As a young man, Mr. Nutter said he sometimes felt impervious enough to neglect safety practices — “I was 8 foot tall and bulletproof” — and fell twice from his stand while in his 20s, but avoided lasting injury. Many hunters called tree stand accidents far more frequent than official figures indicate, because hunters are often reluctant to tell medical or law enforcement that they fell from a stand. Mr. Nutter heads into the woods in northern New York. As a young man, Mr. Nutter said he sometimes felt impervious enough to neglect safety practices — “I was 8 foot tall and bulletproof” — and fell twice from his stand while in his 20s, but avoided lasting injury. Credit Brett Carlsen for The New York Times “A hunter who goes to the E.R. is not going to admit they fell out of a tree stand,” said Bill Conners, 71, a lifelong hunter from Dutchess County who writes about conservation issues and serves as a regional director of the New York State Conservation Council. “Either out of embarrassment, or because they didn’t tell their wives or bosses they went hunting.” In fact, many hunters favor hunting alone and lose communication after a fall, especially if cellphone service is spotty. Years ago, many hunters built wooden tree stands, but affordable manufactured stands have become the norm. Many are left up year-round and become weakened over time, Mr. Conners said. Hunters often access the stands by rudimentary ladders, which can be tricky while wearing bulky winter clothing and lugging equipment, especially in icy conditions. Falls can be caused by alcohol, fatigue, sudden moves with a weapon and even excitement. “When deer comes along, or a squirrel jumps onto your head, you might suddenly take a step back and you’re not standing on anything anymore,” said David Hartman, the president of New York State Whitetail Management Coalition. It was sleepiness that caused Mr. Callahan’s fall in 1986. He now hunts from his wheelchair with the assistance of a friend. He finds flat areas in the woods or a field to roll onto, and behind camouflage material, rests his crossbow or shotgun onto a shooter’s rest. He aims it with a bar controlled by his teeth and activates the trigger with an air tube. “I‘ve talked to so many hunters who have fallen out of trees,” he said. “So the first thing I tell any hunter is to learn from my experience and put your safety strap on.”","Chris Nutter surveys the land around him in rural upstate New York from a tree stand, which are popular among deer hunters.

Jonathan J. Cooper and Sudhin Thanawala / AP,"(REDDING, Calif.) — The deadly Northern California wildfire that has forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes slowed down Sunday after days of explosive growth, giving officials hope even as they announced the discovery of a sixth fatality. Meanwhile officials said a second firefighter died fighting a huge blaze to the south near Yosemite National Park. The firefighter was treated for injuries at the scene Sunday but died before he could be hospitalized, said Mike Theune, a spokesman for the so-called Ferguson Fire. The firefighter was part of a crew removing brush and other fuel near the fire’s front lines, Theune said. He didn’t have additional details. In Redding, officials stuck a hopeful tone for the first time in days. “We’re feeling a lot more optimistic today as we’re starting to gain some ground rather than being in a defensive mode on this fire all the time,” said Bret Gouvea, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s incident commander on the blaze around Redding, a city about 230 mi (370 km) north of San Francisco. Gouvea spoke at a news conference with fire and law enforcement officials. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said authorities found a sixth victim of the blaze at a home that was consumed by flames, though he declined to say where. The victim’s identity was not released. The sheriff’s department is also investigating seven missing persons reports, Bosenko said. Redding police have an additional 11 reports of missing people, though many of them may simply not have checked in with friends or family, said Redding police Sgt. Todd Cogle. The so-called Carr Fire that affected Redding — a city of about 92,000 people — was ignited by a vehicle problem on Monday about 10 mi (16 km) west of the city. On Thursday, it swept through the historic Gold Rush town of Shasta and nearby Keswick fueled by gusty winds and dry vegetation. It then jumped the Sacramento River and took out subdivisions on the western edge of Redding. The latest tally showed at least 517 structures destroyed and another 135 damaged, with the fire having consumed 139 sq mi (360 sq km). A count by The Associated Press found at least 300 of those structures were homes. After days of fortifying the areas around Redding, fire crews were increasingly confident that the city would escape further damage. The fire had not grown inside the city limits since Saturday, Gouvea said. Some of the 38,000 people forced to evacuate said they were frustrated because they didn’t know whether their homes were standing or were destroyed. Authorities had not reopened any evacuated neighborhoods where fires raged due to safety and ongoing investigations and urged people to be patient, saying they would soon let residents back. Fed up, on Sunday morning Tim Bollman hiked 4 mi (6 km) on trails up steep terrain to check on the Redding home he built for his wife and two sons 13 years ago. He found rubble. “There’s not even anything to pick up,” he said. “It’s completely gone.” He took hundreds of photos, recorded video and texted his wife. “It’s the craziest frickin’ thing you have ever seen,” he said, his eyes filled with tears. But then he composed himself. “It is what it is,” he sighed, and then hiked off. Keswick, a mountain town of about 450 people, was reduced to an ashy moonscape of blackened trees and smoldering rubble. The San Bernardino County Fire Department was called in to tamp down smoking piles of debris that were scattered around the town amid downed electricity lines. “What we’re seeing here is an incomplete burn situation,” Capt. Doug Miles said as his crew used picks, shovels and rakes to open up piles that just days ago were family homes. The flames laid waste to about 25 blocks, and the “mop up” work was likely to take days. He said his crew would be looking for anything salvageable, but there was little left standing. The fatalities included two firefighters and a woman and her two great-grandchildren. “My babies are dead,” Sherry Bledsoe said through tears after she and family members met Saturday with sheriff’s deputies. Her two children, 5-year-old James Roberts and 4-year-old Emily Roberts, were stranded with their great-grandmother, Melody Bledsoe, 70, when flames swept through the family’s rural property Thursday on the outskirts of Redding. The sixth victim, who was not identified, did not evacuate despite receiving an evacuation warning, Bosenko said. It is the largest fire burning in California, threatening more than 5,000 structures. The flames were just 5% contained, though Gouvea said he expected that number to climb. “We’re here till the end, and we will get to an end, and we will bring some peace to this chaos,” he said. The firefighters killed in the blaze included Don Ray Smith, 81, of Pollock Pines, a bulldozer operator who was helping clear vegetation in the path of the wildfire. Redding Fire Inspector Jeremy Stoke was also killed, but details of his death were not released. The fire around Redding was among 17 significant blazes in the state on Sunday that had forced roughly 50,000 people from their homes, said Lynne Tolmachoff, a Cal Fire spokeswoman. About 12,000 firefighters were battling the fires, she said. “We are well ahead of the fire activity we saw last year,” she said. “This is just July, so we’re not even into the worst part of fire season.” About 100 mi (160 km) southwest of Redding, one of two blazes that started in Mendocino County forced the evacuation of Lakeport, a city of about 5,000 people, after destroying four homes. More than 4,500 buildings were under threat, officials said. The two fires had blackened 39 sq mi (101 sq km) and were each 5% contained. Authorities also issued evacuation orders in Napa County, famous for its wine, when a fire destroyed eight structures. The blaze had blackened 150 acres, but was 50% contained on Sunday. Officials did not immediately name the firefighter killed Sunday near Yosemite. Earlier this month, firefighter Barden Varney was killed when the bulldozer he was operating overturned while he was fighting the blaze near the national park. At least seven other firefighters have been injured since that fire broke out July 13. Some evacuations were lifted but officials said Yosemite Valley, the heart of tourism in the park, will remain closed until August 3. A big fire continued to burn in the San Jacinto Mountains east of Los Angeles near Palm Springs, but officials lifted evacuation orders for several communities.

Matt Novak,"Numerous buildings on Facebooks campus in Menlo Park, California were evacuated Tuesday evening after local police were forwarded a tip about a bomb threat. Police searched the area and determined there were no explosives that could be found. Menlo Park PD tweeted overnight : At 4:32 PM, Menlo Park Police communications center received a call from the New York Police Department Crime Stoppers Unit that they received an anonymous tip of a bomb threat at a Facebook facility located at 200 Jefferson Dr. in Menlo Park. Facebook management, as a precaution, requested buildings in the surrounding area be evacuated. Menlo Park Police Department assisted in the evacuation, secured a perimeter around the building, and traffic was temporarily diverted around the area. The San Mateo County bomb unit was dispatched with explosive detection dogs that conducted a sweep of the building and found no suspicious packages or devices. The building is all clear and secure. We take the safety and security of our people at Facebook extremely seriously and are glad that everyone is safe, a spokesperson said in a statement released to CNN. We are working closely with local authorities to investigate this threat and further monitor the situation. A number of news organizations and social media companies have received threats over the past two years, as President Donald Trump regularly calls the press the enemy of the people and Republican members of Congress claim that social media is biased against conservatives. Yesterday Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee, where numerous congressmen accused the tech giant of actively manipulating search results to silence conservative voices. A 38-year-old woman named Nasim Najafi Aghdam became a folk hero for the far right after perpetrating a shooting at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, though she injured just four people and she was the only fatality when she turned the gun on herself. The threats, both real and bluffs, are likely to continue as the political climate becomes even more heated. President Trump doesnt show any signs of letting up and he even seems to be making his rhetoric more explicit and violent. When asked yesterday if he was worried about the prospect of getting impeached, President Trump insisted that he wasnt concerned. Im not concerned, no, Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview. I think that the people would revolt if that happened.

Mahita Gajanan,"One person died after a Southwest Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia after an engine exploded midair on Tuesday. The passenger death marks the first fatality on a U.S. airline in nine years, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt said at a news conference Tuesday. The last fatal U.S. airline crash was on Feb. 12, 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed while approaching Buffalo, New York, according to the NTSB. Fifty people died in the crash, including 45 passengers, two pilots, two flight attendants and one person who was on the ground. Now, U.S. airlines are facing the first fatality in nearly a decade. Shrapnel from the apparently blown out engine broke a plane window on the Southwest flight, killing the passenger and injuring seven others onboard, the Associated Press reports. The flight, a Boeing 737 traveling from LaGuardian Airport in New York to Dallas, landed at the Philadelphia airport around 11:20 a.m. after suffering an “in-flight engine failure of the left engine,” Sumwalt said. The NTSB will have investigators take apart and inspect the engine to figure out what went wrong. The fatality on Southwest comes after a year of declining flight deaths, according to the Aviation Safety Network. The ASN reported in January that 2017 was the safest year for commercial flights around the world, with 10 airline incidents that led to a total of 44 deaths. At the time, President Donald Trump took credit for the low death rate. Despite saying he has been “very strict” on commercial aviation, Trump has not imposed significant safety regulations on airlines and growing airline safety has been attributed more to efforts by international aviation groups than the White House.",The flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia due to engine failure,2018-04-17T20:58:06Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Passenger Killed On Southwest Flight Is the First U.S. Commercial Airline Fatality In 9 Years,http://time.com/5243733/southwest-passenger-commercial-airline-death/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/southwest-emergency-landing.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,fatality,1
Connie Loizos,"You can probably argue over whether it’s a good or a bad sign, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter today a report in The Information that he has taken over direct control of the division that’s producing Tesla’s Model 3 electric sedan after the company failed to meet the delivery goals it had set. Specifically, Tesla had intended to produce 500 Model 3 cars per day or 2,500 per week by the end of last month. But according to a companywide email to employees that was sent today and obtained by Jalopnik, Musk said Tesla has been making closer to 2,000 of the cars per week. ( Musk estimated last July that Tesla would be making 20,000 of the cars per month by December.) In his email — fired off at 3. am. PDT — Musk added that if “ things go as planned today, we will comfortably exceed that number over a seven day period!” Musk may have been referring in part to the reorganization. But while the Information reported that Musk had seemingly “pushed aside the company’s senior vice president of engineering, Doug Field, who had been overseeing manufacturing in recent months,” Musk quickly took issue with that characterization of events. He complained on Twitter to Information reporter Amir Efrati, “Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.” Musk continued, tweeting: “About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering &amp; production. He agreed that Tesla needed [engineering and production to be] better aligned, so we don’t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide &amp; conquer, so I’m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell …” That Musk is feeling sensitive to press reports right now won’t come as a surprise to anyone who follows the company, given the string of negative publicity that Tesla has received in recent weeks. In addition to a voluntary recall of 123,000 Model S vehicles that owes to a problem with the power-steer component of some of the cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last week launched an investigation into the role of Tesla’s Autopilot in a fatal crash. In fact, in a series of separate tweets today, Musk responded to the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety agency that said it was “ unhappy ” with Tesla’s decision on Friday to publish a blog post about the accident, given that investigations are ongoing. Tesla wrote in that Friday post that the driver, since identified as an Apple engineer, “had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.” The company also noted that highway safety barrier that might have lessened the impact of the collision had been “crushed in a prior accident without being replaced.” The suggestion was plainly that Tesla can’t be blamed, at least not entirely, for the fatality. In response to the NTSB’s public frustration over release of investigative information by Tesla, Musk wrote on Twitter today, “Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.” Tesla closed down 5.1 percent at $252.48 in trading today.","You can probably argue over whether it’s a good or a bad sign, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter today a report in The Information that he has taken over direct control of the division that’s producing Tesla’s Model 3 electric sedan after the compa…",2018-04-02T23:27:02Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","Elon Musk just took charge of Model 3 production, saying it’s his “most critical” job right now",http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/elon-musk-just-took-charge-of-model-3-production-saying-its-his-most-critical-job-right-now/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/elon-musk.png?w=557,techcrunch,TechCrunch,fatality,1

Rafael Carranza, The Republic | azcentral.com Officer Jesus ""Chuy"" Cordova (Photo: Nogales Police Department) PHOENIX — A Nogales police officer was killed after he was shot multiple times when he attempted to apprehend a carjacking suspect during a traffic stop, officials said. Officer Jesus ""Chuy"" Cordova, 44, died Friday, police said. It's the first officer fatality in the city in nearly 129 years, underscoring the shock reverberating through this close-knit border community. Cordova joined the department in May 2017. He previously served as a detective with the the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office for more than a decade. Cordova leaves behind three children and a fiancée who is five months pregnant, Nogales Police Chief Roy Bermudez said. More: Suspect in Kentucky officer's death killed by law enforcement officials Police identified the suspected shooter as David Ernesto Murillo, 28, of Tempe. He's in police custody, and officers said they were not looking for anyone else. ""We are mourning as a department and as a community,"" Bermudez said during an emotional Friday night press conference, at times his voice breaking and holding back tears. David Ernesto Murillo (Photo: Nogales Police Department) Bermudez said the tragic encounter started Friday afternoon with a report of a carjacking near the town of Patagonia, located about 18 miles northwest of Nogales. Murillo evaded Santa Cruz County deputies, the police chief said, and ended up in Nogales. Cordova responded to an armed carjacking at about 2:45 p.m. Friday, according to police. Police said the suspect was driving away from the scene as the officer attempted to stop the car, police said. Murillo exited the car before firing multiple shots at Cordova inside his patrol car, police said. Investigators recovered possibly 10 shell casings and concluded the officer was struck multiple times, although the exact number is unknown, Bermudez said. Nogales firefighters treated Cordova and attempted to airlift him to a Tucson hospital, but they had to turn back to get him stabilized, the chief said. They instead transported him to a local hospital where he died from his injuries. Law enforcement personnel near the bullet damaged patrol car at where a Nogales Police officer was shot in front of Villas Market at Mesa Verde and Grand in Nogales on April 27, 2018. He died at a hospital in Tucson. The suspect was part of several carjackings across the city that culminated in more gunfire and a short standoff with officers. The suspect was taken into custody. (Photo: Kelly Presnell/Arizona Daily Star) In the meantime, Murillo then stole a second car before fleeing the scene, according to police. After the suspected shooter stole a third car, officers from multiple law enforcement agencies apprehended him without incident in a trailer park. ""I am frustrated. I am mad. So many emotions going through me right now,"" Bermudez said Friday night. Although Cordova was with the department less than one year, Bermudez described him as an exemplary officer. ""I was glad to take him in because of the reputation he had,"" Bermudez said of his decision to hire Cordova. ""The community of the Nogales Police Department is going to miss (him), losing a great officer."" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey extended prayers and condolences to Cordova's family and loved ones. He ordered all state flags to fly at half-staff Monday. My prayers and condolences go out to Officer Cordova's family and loved ones and the entire Nogales community. This tragedy is a solemn reminder of the sacrifices that police officers make daily to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/z21nMChWLp — Doug Ducey (@dougducey) April 28, 2018 ""This tragedy is a solemn reminder of the sacrifices that police officers make daily to keep our communities safe,"" Ducey said in a tweet. So far investigators have released very few details about Murillo. But records show he has lived in Tempe and Nogales, and he has family in both areas. He's also had several run-ins with the law, including a few driving-related incidents, and a misdemeanor drug charge in Santa Cruz County. Many Nogales residents said they were stunned by the shooting, and shocked that something like this would happen here. ""That's why I moved here. It's so peaceful,"" Hossana Real said. ""I used to be in Phoenix and now here. It's beautiful here, and that's the first time. I was surprised when it happened, honestly."" Real was cooking inside her food truck, just north of where Cordova responded, when she said she heard multiple shots. ""I lost count after six,"" she added. Nogales Mayor John Doyle echoed resident's comments, stating that Nogales is one of the safest communities in the state. He expressed his sympathy for Cordova's family and the police department. But also said he was glad that no one else got hurt. ""I believe they did an excellent job to make sure that the rest of the community was protected, and there was no more tragedies,"" he said.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","An Uber self-driving car drives on March 28, 2017, in San Francisco. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. A self-driving Uber car struck and killed a pedestrian early Monday morning in Tempe, Arizona, marking the first pedestrian fatality of the self-driving car era in the United States. The woman, 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, died at the hospital of her injuries. The vehicle was in autonomous mode, Tempe police told a local ABC affiliate, and an operator—capable of taking control of the car at any moment—was behind the wheel. “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” Uber said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.” The company is also pausing driverless car operations in Phoenix and elsewhere. Arizona has established itself as a testing ground for Uber and Google’s Waymo, each of which has deployed fleets of autonomous vehicles on the streets of the Phoenix metro. Sunny days and reliable car-centric infrastructure make the area well-suited for the evolving technology, which struggles with unusual road and weather conditions. More importantly, Arizona has leveraged its reputation as a regulation-free, disruption-friendly state. Waymo has been testing self-driving cars in the Phoenix metro since last spring, including cars without assisting drivers since November—a move that few states allow. Quartz reported last month that Waymo was given a license in January to operate a taxi service in Arizona and hoped to have a commercial self-driving service on the market by the end of 2018. Uber, meanwhile, had deployed self-driving trucks in Arizona earlier this month. Just this month Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey drafted the state’s first set of rules for autonomous vehicles. Monday’s incident will be a test for how much citizens are willing to tolerate AV experimentation on public roads. So far, there has been little public pushback as politicians and regulators race to welcome the AV industry. But there have been only a few notable accidents. In July 2016, a driver using Tesla autopilot died when his car drove into the back of a tractor-trailer. A self-driving Uber ran a red light in San Francisco just hours after the company first deployed the technology there. You can expect that Uber, local regulators, and tech evangelists will make much of the Tempe police report that the woman was outside a crosswalk, although North Mill Avenue—the eight-lane road the victim was attempting to cross—has only one crosswalk in nearly two miles of road, making jaywalking a requirement of the urban design. (Jaywalking arrests and pedestrian fatalities are also disproportionately concentrated in communities of color.) The crash will bolster street safety advocates’ case that regulators and companies are putting people at risk by experimenting on city streets. One of the central arguments for self-driving cars in the long term is that they will be safer than human drivers. In the short term, Google has gone to great lengths to reassure the public that the technology is safe, funding a project called “Let’s Talk Self-Driving” in collaboration with the National Safety Council, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and other road safety advocates. The Uber crash could jeopardize that narrative.","A self-driving Uber car struck and killed a pedestrian early Monday morning in Tempe, Arizona, marking the first pedestrian fatality of the self-driving car era in the United States.",2018-03-19T17:52:56Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Uber Crash in Arizona Kills Woman in First Pedestrian Death Caused by a Self-Driving Car,https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/uber-crash-kills-woman-in-first-pedestrian-death-caused-by-a-self-driving-car.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/b02423e4-d045-4a24-a2d2-466e8edf0093.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=3000x2000&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,fatality,1

Tyler Miles, an ex-director of operations at the Schlitterbahn Water Park, was charged on several counts including involuntary manslaughter. The boy who died, Caleb Schwab, suffered head injuries when his raft went airborne and he struck a pole. Mr Miles pleaded not guilty on Friday. He was later released on bail, which had been set at $50,000 (£35,000), CBS News reports. It follows a 19-month investigation into the incident involving Caleb Schwab, the son of state politician Scott Schwab, which occurred on 8 August 2016 in a three-person raft on the Verrückt ride at the water park in Kansas City. The ride includes a drop of almost 169ft (52m) at 65mph (105km/h). According to the criminal indictment presented to the court, the slide had been examined by experts who found evidence indicating that other rafts had gone airborne and collided with overhead poles and netting before the fatality, ABC News reported. The indictment added that examiners believed that the Verrückt ride ""violated nearly all aspects of the longstanding industry safety standards"". It alleges that those responsible for the ride's operation, including the Schlitterbahn company, attempted to conceal information from law enforcement. On Friday, Schlitterbahn said in a company statement that it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Mr Miles was being personally charged over the ""terrible accident"". ""Throughout his employment with us, our operations director, Tyler, demonstrated the highest dedication to safety, from the training of our lifeguards and ride operators, to ensuring all rides have operated in accordance with our strict protocols"" the statement reads. A spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn, Winter Prosapio, said: ""Our review of the facts and circumstances of the accident has never shown any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of anyone."" The company has said it plans to contest the allegations.

Jonathan M. Gitlin,"reader comments 9 Uber was told on Monday evening to suspend its autonomous car-testing program in Arizona. The move follows the death of Elaine Herzberg, a pedestrian who was struck and killed by one of the company's self-driving vehicles on March 18. According to the Associated Press, Governor Doug Ducey told Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that public safety should be a top priority, and that ""[t]he incident that took place... is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation."" In recent months, Arizona has become a hotbed of autonomous-vehicle testing. In contrast to California, the state has very little in the way of oversight, and both Waymo and Uber have been testing extensively, along with other, smaller self-driving programs. Beyond carrying liability insurance, autonomous vehicles are free to drive and aren't subject to the crash or disengagement reports required by Arizona's neighbor to the west. Herzberg's death has shone a spotlight on a state which was already unfriendly to pedestrians—in the same week as this fatal crash, nine other pedestrians were killed by vehicles. But humans are generally more accepting of the risk from other human drivers than they are machines, and now Uber has the distinction of being responsible for the first self-driving fatality. Even though the company voluntarily suspended its testing program in Arizona and elsewhere, Ducey's action presumably means it can't start up again without official permission.",The state welcomed self-driving cars with open arms and minimal regulation.,2018-03-27T02:10:07Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Uber told to stop testing driverless tech in Arizona,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/03/uber-told-to-stop-testing-driverless-tech-in-arizona/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PHX4-1-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,fatality,1
Nini Cabaero,"THE whole discussion on whether vaccination of students will be made a requirement before enrollment has gone silent.
It shouldnt. Not when the number of children dying of measles continues to rise.
Health officials said last week that measles claimed its ninth fatality in Central Visayas. The latest fatality was an 11-month-old baby girl from Cebu City. Baby Grace became the third measles fatality in Cebu City this year and the ninth in the entire region. She died of multiple organ failure, following a measles infection, Jane Michelle Raagas of the Department of Health (DOH) 7 said.
The latest tally of deaths due to measles: Three in Cebu City and one each in Lapu-Lapu, Moalboal, San Fernando, Pinamungajan, Consolacion, and Carcar City.
The Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit 7 recorded from Jan. 1 to March 12 this year a total of 898 measles-rubella cases in Central Visayas.
The situation has DOH hospitals and facilities under a Code White that means all resources should respond to measles emergencies and a massive vaccination drive will be done for children aged six to 59 months.
The measles outbreak in the country was blamed on governments neglect of its immunization program. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III admitted that the low trust in the governments immunization drive may be linked to the controversy over the anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.
The Dengvaxia controversy arose when the manufacturer, Sanofi Pasteur, said in November 2017 that Dengvaxia posed a risk to people who had not been previously exposed to dengue. The governments response was mostly politicala blame game to let present and past officials answer for the messand less about changing procedures in its vaccination drive. The result was parents became wary of having their children immunized.
In the US, the vaccination program was boosted when a court dismissed a petition to stop the local governments order barring children without their measles vaccination from school. The petition for injunction was filed by parents of 42 children affected by the ban. They wanted to be excluded from the school order.
The court decision against the petition was seen as reflective of a growing public pushback against people who do not have their children immunized. There are even proposals to allow teenagers to have themselves vaccinated without parental consent.
All these point to the importance of continuing the discussion on the plan to require vaccination children before enrollment.
There are pros and cons to the idea. Cebu Provincial Health Office Chief Rene Catan is one of those opposed to it as he has said, Getting an elementary education is a right, so is the right to health. This cannot be imposed. People should be given a choice. We must instead strengthen our vaccination program in the community rather than resort to iron-hand tactics. Then there are other officials who think the situation demanded urgent action.

I was 15 when Mortal Kombat first hit the arcades in 1992. It was a different era thenno social media, no modern Internet to speak of, and we didn't have year-long teaser campaigns for new games. You would just walk into the arcade one day and there was a new cabinet sitting there, maybe back in a corner, like a secret, or maybe in the center of the floor, already gathering a crowd.
Being nostalgic for your teenage years is easy, and I don't want to over-mythologize the arcade of my youth. But there was something special about getting those surprises, and we've lost that. It seems rare now to be hit with the unexpecteddodging spoilers is practically a contact sport. Here was this game like nothing else we'd seen before, and it just appeared.
We were already fighting-game players. Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury, World Heroeswe dropped our quarters into every game we could get our hands on. But Mortal Kombat was different.
You heard it first. The arcade put Mortal Kombat in the middle, so you didn't see it the moment you walked in the door. The rumble of the subwoofer was the first clue there was something new. No other game had bass like this. When the announcer shouted FIGHT or TEST YOUR MIGHT, you could practically feel it in your bones. The sound of the gong cut through the noise of other players and games.
We'd seen digitized characters before, in games like Pit Fighter, but those were choppy and stiff. Mortal Kombat's characters had idle animations, they shot electricity, and there was a sea of bobbing, bald-headed monks watching you fight. The game looked, felt, and sounded so visceral and real. Uppercuts sent your opponent flying in a wonderfully meaty way while blood splattered everywhere. We were hooked from the start.
Then, of course, I saw my first fatality. I'm pretty sure it was Sub-Zero tearing someone's head off and holding it up, their spine still dangling below it. FATALITY. We didn't know Sen. Joe Lieberman was going to lead a moral panic and that it would spark the best console war ever (Genesis' blood cheat code versus Super Nintendo's sad, gray ""sweat""). We just knew it was amazing, and we had to know how to do it.
I became a Scorpion player, if for no other reason than I could do his fatality: space yourself right, hold block, press up up, and he'd take his mask off to reveal a flame-spewing skull, torching his enemies into Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. It was violent, realistic, and cartoony at the same time, and I loved it.
I kept playing for a few years. Midway knew it had a hit, so the company kept releasing new versions of the game that one-upped the environments, characters, and, of course, the violence. After Mortal Kombat 3, I left for college and stopped going to my favorite Market Street arcade in San Francisco, which later closed. The series moved to ugly 3D graphics, and I stopped following it.
Fast-forward to the end of 2018: NetherRealm Studios, the company created by Warner Bros. to carry the MK torch, announces Mortal Kombat 11. I'm still a fighting-game player to this day, still playing Street Fighter and whatever else I get my hands on, but Mortal Kombat just wasn't something I paid much attention to anymore. Something about the new announcement stirred all these arcade memories, though, and I found myself looking forward to today's reveal event.
Watch the new gameplay trailer below and form your own thoughts first:
Mortal Kombat 11 Gameplay Reveal
Wow. I'm in the arcade again. I know these characters. Well, some of them, at least. And it looks gorgeous. We're so spoiled by modern 3D graphics that it's hard to come by the surprises of the arcade days, but this is still a great-looking game. Textures, models, lighting, environmentseverything has been given a high level of polish and love. My 15-year-old self would be blown away, that's for sure. All these years later, Scorpion still throwing his spear and shouting GET OVER HERE!
I'm not 15 anymore, and I have to admit a little bit of old-man feelings creeping in while I watch these fatalities. It's, well, a bit much. Gone is that heady blend of realism mixed with the cartoony. The new finishers are a little uncomfortably real. Not sure I needed to see someone's bloody eyeball speared through the back of their head. My inner teen is cheering, I can't lie, but the rest of me isn't so sure this level of realism is what fatalities needed.
Still, there's no denying that this is a good-looking game. The story is apparently convoluted and crazy, but it looks well done and is clearly not throwaway content. The reveal showed off a very robust character-customization engine, and I'm a big fan of personalizing and owning your character. NetherRealm is known for packing a lot of single-player content into its fighting games, and MK11 looks like no exception. If you're not a fan of online play or you don't have any friends to try versus mode with, you're going to still have plenty to do.
I'll always be nostalgic for the original game. I still think the magic of the arcade is something special beyond just wistful youthful memories. But the legacy clearly lives on, and there's hopefully a new generation to get hooked on ripping people's heads off. It might be a little more realistic than I'm comfortable with, but if Mortal Kombat doesn't make the adults queasy, is it really doing its job?",Memories from a youth spent in arcades and the reveal of Mortal Kombat 11.,2019-01-17T23:03:42Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Mortal Kombat 11 gameplay as seen by a 1990s arcade rat,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/mortal-kombat-11-gameplay-as-seen-by-a-1990s-arcade-rat/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mk11-scorpion-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,fatality,1
Engadget,"Just days after Uber announced its plans to resume testing of its self-driving taxis, new information reveals that a whistleblower had made the company aware of the technology's safety failures before the incident in Arizona last March, which saw a pedestrian struck and killed by one of Uber's vehicles, and which led to the suspension of all testing activity. According to The Information, Robbie Miller, a manager in the testing-operations group, sent a cautionary email to a number of Uber's executives and lawyers, warning that the vehicles were ""routinely in accidents resulting in damage. This is usually the result of poor behavior of the operator or the AV technology."" It appears the email was prompted by an incident in Pittsburgh, where just a few days before Miller sent the message an Uber prototype swerved completely off the road and onto the sidewalk, where it continued to drive. According to Miller's email, the episode was ""essentially ignored"" for days, until Miller raised it with other managers. He also noted that toward the end of 2017, it took two weeks for engineers to investigate the logs of a separate Arizona incident, in which an Uber vehicle almost collided with another car. ""This is not how we should be operating,"" Miller wrote in the email, the assertions of which have been backed up by interviews with current and former Uber employees. Miller said the group has to ""work on establishing a culture rooted in safety,"" and offered a range of suggestions for improving matters, including reducing the size of the autonomous fleet, having multiple backup drivers per vehicle and giving authority to lower-level employees to shut down testing if they suspect the software is unsafe. According to a colleague of Miller's at Uber, none of the executives responded to the email, and Miller left the company three days after sending it. The Information reports that Uber has declined to comment on the email, but has released a more general statement that says, ""The entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in self-driving mode. We have every confidence in the work that the team is doing to get us there."" Indeed, the company has just hired a former National highway Traffic Safety Administration official for its autonomous vehicle team. Of course, with all eyes on the company given the incident that occurred in March, Uber must publicly demonstrate that it's taking steps to prevent a similar reoccurrence. But as Miller's email demonstrates, the company may have to improve how it handles allegedly limitations in its self-driving technology before expanding its tests wider.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/ALPINE CLUB OF PAKISTAN Image caption Fellow climbers branded Denis Urubko's decision ""completely suicidal"" Russian-Polish mountaineer Denis Urubko is said to have quit his ""suicidal"" bid to make the first solo winter ascent of the world's second highest mountain. He decided on Sunday to set out alone to climb to the summit of K2 after a row his Polish expedition. Urubko is said to have wanted to make the ascent before the arrival of better weather conditions in March. Amid concern over his safety, an expedition spokesman said Urubko was now heading down the peak to a base. Michal Leksinski tweeted that Mr Urubko was ""going down and had reached C2"", one of four staging camps on the peak. Leksinski earlier said he thought Urubko wanted to reach the top this month so his effort would definitely count as a winter climb. Why did they fall out? Mr Urubko reportedly left for the summit without a radio, after refusing to discuss his plans. ""He was trying to persuade the team to push for the summit in February,"" a porter with the group told AFP news agency. ""He has had a heated debate with the team leader and left for the summit without saying a word."" How dangerous would a solo bid be?

""You have to cross a traverse underneath a 30-storey ice serac, a hanging serac of a wall of ice that let loose in 2008 and killed 11 climbers that year. You have to put some type of protection, some type of rope going across that if you do fall. ""In good weather, that normally takes hours to do.

Cyrus Farivar,"Enlarge / A woman walks into the Uber Corporate Headquarters building in San Francisco, California on February 05, 2018. reader comments 0 A now-former Uber driver who struck a San Francisco family with his car on December 31, 2013—killing a six-year-old girl named Sophia Liu in the process—was convicted of vehicular manslaughter on August 2. In addition to the fatality, driver Syed Muzaffar also seriously injured Liu's mother, Huan Hua Kuang, and her five-year-old brother, Anthony, while driving a Honda Pilot SUV through a crosswalk at Polk and Ellis Streets. In January 2014, the family sued Muzaffar and Uber for wrongful death and other complaints. As Ars reported previously, Muzaffar had only been an Uber driver for a month and did not have anyone in his car at the time of the accident. Uber has previously argued that because Muzaffar ""was not providing services on the Uber system during the time of the accident,"" the company is not responsible. That lawsuit was ultimately settled in July 2015. However, more than two months after the fatal accident, Uber and its rival Lyft changed their policies to expand insurance coverage to include drivers who are waiting for a fare. Previously, these policies only covered drivers when they had passengers in the car. The Liu family’s attorney, Christopher Dolan, claimed in a blog post that Uber drivers have been responsible for ""hundreds if not thousands of deaths."" As a result of the lawsuit, he added, the new insurance policies can hopefully mitigate the awful tragedy. Still, Huan Hua Kuang added in the same blog post: ""He did the crime. I’m glad the jury held him responsible and that justice will be done. I miss my daughter every day and nothing will bring her back."" Muzaffar is set to be sentenced in San Francisco Superior Court at 9am on September 25, 2018.

Rayne Ellis,"How much plastic does it take to kill a sea turtle? According to new research, it doesn't take very much. A study published in the journal Nature Thursday found that sea turtles have a 50 percent higher chance of mortality once they've ingested 14 pieces of plastic. This means that researchers would expect 50 percent of sea turtles who have eaten this amount of plastic to die. The scientists also found that if a turtle had at least 226 pieces of plastic in its gut, then it was certain to die. SEE ALSO: You may swear off straws after seeing this poor sea turtle Scientists have been ramping up efforts to examine the precise impacts of ocean pollution on marine life, now that plastic has been found to affect 700 different marine species according to the newstudy's lead researcher Britta Denise Hardesty. To calculate the impact, a team of scientists led by Hardesty examined data from roughly 300 turtle necropsies around Australia whose deaths were recorded under three different categories: non-plastic related, unknown cause, plastic-related. Somewhere between 8 to 12 million metric tons of plastic debris was deposited in the ocean in 2010. Image: kathy townsend Using these distinctions, researchers were able to compare the unknown and plastic-related deaths to the plastic-related deaths to determine what is considered a normal amount of plastic ingested by turtles. Within the population they sampled, the amount of debris found in the turtles’ guts ranged from a single piece to 329 pieces. However, not all scientists agree with the study's conclusions. “I am more optimistic than the authors,” biologist Jennifer Lynch, who is unaffiliated with the study, said in an email. A study she conducted in 2017 found that turtles are not impacted by small amounts of plastic debris or even after ingesting 200 to 300 pieces of plastic. “All studies have some kind of bias, my study was biased towards turtles that were healthy and actively foraging when they drowned on a longline hook,"" Lynch, who plans to write a rebuttal to the study with other researchers, said. ""[The present] study is biased towards stranded turtles that died from a variety of causes, often unknown causes."" That said, the new study does add to a growing body of scientific literature on plastics and turtle mortality. Another important finding in the study had to do with the age of the turtles effected by the debris. Researchers also found a significantly larger amount of plastic in juvenile turtles compared to adults. To them, this signaled that adults are less likely to mistakenly ingest plastic than younger sea turtles. Not all scientists are on the same page about how much plastic a turtle can ingest safely. Image: kathy townsend Brendan Godley, a conservation scientist unaffiliated with the study, said in an email that this research points to the likelihood that plastic is a key threat to the youngest life stages which was suspected, but not known. “This is of particular concern as pieces of plastics and baby turtles are both likely to be aggregated together in similar areas,” he explained. But this doesn’t mean that turtles are on their way to extinction. Sea turtle populations are actually responding well to conservation efforts. It just signals that if ocean pollution gets worse, sea turtles are in harm’s way, Godley said. While the exact amount of plastic leading to fatality might be hotly debated, scientists have been aware that plastic is a threat to sea turtle populations for a while. In fact, sea turtles were among the first animals recorded to ingest plastic. And with rising plastic deposits in the ocean, the threat debris poses to marine life has expanded far beyond just sea turtles and will continue to expand if a solution isn’t found.","How much plastic does it take to kill a sea turtle?

Cory Doctorow,"This week, a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian in Arizona, the first pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous vehicle; in his analysis of the event, Charlie Stross notes that Arizona's laws treat corporations that kill people with considerably more forbearance than humans who do so, and proposes that in the near future, every self-driving car will be owned by a special-purpose corporation that insulates its owner from liability. Stross then starts to spin scenarios -- brain-meltingly interesting ones! -- about how a future software-as-a-service, gig-economy, externalizing Uber business might run, with ""independent"" drivers paying for ""gold"" or ""silver"" collision-avoidance features; remote-driving their cars from a terminal in another city, having to click away dialog boxes from Uber that sometimes obscure their view of the road and any pedestrians who wander into it. The manufacturer of the vehicle, who has a contract with the holding company for ongoing maintenance, disabled the enhanced pedestrian avoidance feature for which the driver was no longer paying. The road the child was playing chicken on is a pedestrian route closed to private cars and goods traffic but open to public transport. In this jurisdiction, private hire cars are classified as private vehicles, but licensed taxis are legally classified as public transport when (and only for the duration) they are collecting or delivering a passenger within the pedestrian area. At the moment of the impact the taxi has no passenger, but has received a pickup request from a passenger inside the pedestrian zone (beyond the accident location) and is proceeding to that location on autopilot control. The driver is not physically present in the vehicle at the time of the accident. The driver is monitoring their vehicle remotely from their phone, using a dash cam and an app provided by the vehicle manufacturer but subject to an EULA that disclaims responsibility and commits the driver to binding arbitration administered by a private tribunal based in Pyongyang acting in accordance with the legal code of the Republic of South Sudan.

Beatrice Christofaro,"The body of a 67-year-old man from California was found in the Grand Canyon, marking the third fatality in the popular tourist destination in eight days. 
 National Park rangers recovered the body on Wednesday responding to a call that someone had fallen near the Yavapai Geology Museum on the South Rim of the canyon, NBC News reported. 
 Helicopter and technical rescue teams found the man's body 400 ft below the rim, according to CNN. 
 The National Park Service and the Coconino County Medical Examiner are investigating the death, officials told NBC. 
 Two other people died while visiting the canyon last week. 
 Last Thursday, a man from Hong Kong stumbled over the edge of a rim while apparently trying to take a selfie at the famous Eagle Point attraction, the site's spokesman David Leibowitz told CNN. 
 Eagle Point's horse-shoe shaped glass bridge overlooking the canyon has some ledges, but no barrier between the visitors and the edge, according to The Associated Press. Signs warn tourists to keep a safe distance from the edge. 
 The Eagle Point attraction is at Grand Canyon West on the Hualapai reservation, outside the bounds of the Grand Canyon National Park. 
 Two days before the Hong Kong tourist's death, another person thought to be a foreign national was found dead in a forested area south of Grand Canyon Village away from the rim, the AP reported.

 Vanessa Ceja-Cervantes, the park's spokeswoman, told CNN that the cause of the death is unclear. 
 ""On average, there about 12 fatalities in the park per year, but a small percentage of those are from fatal falls,"" she said. 
 ""The causes of those deaths range from heat, to drowning, to medical issues and more. High elevation plays a role in some of the fatalities."" 
 Last year, the Grand Canyon welcomed 6.4 million visitors, the second highest of any national park, according to the National Park Service. 
 But the number of national park employees across the US has decreased dramatically, making managing the parks more challenging, Phil Francis, head of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, told NBC. 
 ""I know that the parks are trying to do everything they can, the question is how much can they actually do with limited resources,"" he said. 
 Francis also urged visitors to study the parks before visiting them to understand the safety hazards. 
 A Grand Canyon spokeswoman told NBC that visitors should stay on marked trails and avoid getting too close to the edge to enjoy their time at the canyon.","A 67-year-old man was found dead in the Grand Canyon — the third fatality at the tourist destination in eight days, park officials said.

Megan Geuss,"Enlarge / Aarhus, Denmark - September 14, 2016: Tesla car dealer entrance reader comments 4 Since Tesla's Model 3 production began in July 2017, the company's quarterly financial results have been very alike. Has Tesla produced the number of cars it said it would last quarter? (No.) Is Tesla burning through a whole lotta cash? (Yes.) Is Tesla still making progress on pushing out cars? (Yes.) Will Tesla be in the black again ever? (CEO Elon Musk offers a date one or two quarters into the future.) Such is the case today. From a previous press release we knew that in the first quarter of 2018, Tesla did not reach its stated goal of 2,500 Model 3s off the line per week. But it got close enough that investors weren't scared off, delivering 9,766 Model 3s and hitting just north of 2,000 such vehicles in the last week of the quarter. In today's financial statement (PDF), the company said it held that weekly number for two more weeks before stopping production in mid-April to ""further increase production."" On the accompanying call, Musk detailed some of the changes that had been made at the factory to speed along Model 3 turnover. ""We did go too far on the automation front and automated some very silly things,"" he said. One example the CEO offered: Originally the Model 3 included ""fiber glass mats"" of fluff on the top of the battery pack and the company had a ""FluffBot"" that would pick up fluff and place it on the battery pack. ""Machines are not good at picking up fluff, human hands are very well suited for that,"" Musk said, ""FluffBot would frequently just fail to pick up the fluff."" Tesla ended up testing whether the fluff made any difference in cabin noise, found that it did not, and dispensed with the FluffBot. Musk also said that in some cases the Model 3's manufacture process was over-generalized, or added unnecessary steps. The CEO said currently, the battery pack is no longer a bottleneck for production: it's churning out about 3,000 Model 3 packs per week, and the time to produce a battery pack has decreased from 7 hours to 70 minutes. Now, Musk said, general assembly is the issue. Despite all this, Tesla is clearly not giving up on making its factories increasingly automated. ""In the end, this is all about having factories that are producing the world’s highest quality cars as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible,"" its financial statement said, ""and with as close to zero injuries as we can possibly get. Our automation strategy is key to this and we are as committed to it as ever."" Still, the company showed evidence in its financial letter of hedging on its promise to produce 5,000 Model 3's per week by then end of the second quarter of 2018. ""We continue to target Model 3 production of approximately 5,000 per week in about two months, although our prior experience has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time because of the exponential nature of the ramp,"" the company wrote in its Wednesday financial statement. The bottom line(s) Tesla is also still burning through a lot of money. The company's net loss in Q1 was $785 million, with $710 million of that attributable to shareholders. Last quarter, Tesla's loss attributable to shareholders was $675 million. All this is on top of record revenues for the company—just under $2.6 billion this quarter in automotive sales alone compared to just over $2.4 billion last quarter and slightly more than $2 billion in Q1 2017. If revenues generated by auto leases, Tesla's solar and battery businesses, and other Tesla services are included, the company made $3.4 billion in Q1 2018 (but it spent more than it made). Despite the massive quarterly loss, there's reason not to be too worried about Tesla's burn rate. The company's numbers have showed similar losses in the ramp up of the Model S and Model X In it's statement today that a lot of the cash it has used is going to upgrading its facility for faster Model 3 production—the same kind of spending Tesla had to do in advance of the Model S and Model X. Tesla purchased a German automation engineering firm in 2016 to help it build out its Model 3 production lines. The company said in February that machinery from that firm had been ordered and was on its way to Tesla's factories. The company re-iterated that in its press release today, saying: ""We now expect to reach a [battery] module production rate of 5,000 car sets per week even before we install the new automated line designed and built by Tesla in Germany. Still, once installed, this new automated module line should significantly lower manufacturing costs."" Automation Tesla has struggled with its Autopilot endeavors in recent months, after a fatality and questions surrounding when ""full automation"" would be ready for users. In today's financial call, Musk said that ""full autopilot"" would be ready ""from a technical standpoint...by the end of next year."" However, he accused journalists of overhyping fatalities, causing regulators to balk at approving new systems. ""The thing that’s tricky about autonomous vehicles, is it doesn’t reduce the fatality rate to zero,"" Musk said, adding that millions of deaths happen in non-autonomous cars per year, but they rarely end up in headlines. ""It’s really incredibly irresponsible of any journalist with integrity to lead people to believe that a Tesla with autonomy is less safe."" [ Editor's note: A fatality incurred with new technology will always be news.] Still, Musk added that Tesla will start publishing quarterly safety statistics. He also noted that he didn't think people were getting in accidents because Tesla's system is overselling its capabilities with the name ""Autopilot."" ""When there is a serious accident …people think the driver thought the car was fully autonomous."" Instead, Musk said, ""it is almost always, in fact maybe always, that it is an experienced driver."" The other businesses For the most part, Musk shied away from giving too many pronouncements on Tesla's other endeavors. He noted that Tesla had about 2,000 reservations for Tesla Semis. (“It’s not really something we’ve tried to sell,"" he said, adding that a fair criticism at this point is Tesla's failure to turn a profit, which the company is trying to fix this year.) Musk also said capital investment in Model Y production would not be significant until 2019. He poked fun at a new design patent lawsuit that was filed against Tesla yesterday in Arizona, saying it was a ""laughable lawsuit from some company called 'Nikola.' They’re like suing us for the way the truck looks, which is absurd, nobody’s buying a Tesla for the way that it looks,"" Musk asserted. He also at one point in the call said Tesla's Semi would get ""more than 500 miles"" of range. In response to a question about whether there would be any value in Tesla working with SpaceX's satellite broadband endeavors, Musk said, ""There’s interesting things you could do. The car’s got a lot of computing power.... I haven’t really thought about it but probably there is."" Finally, Musk said that he didn't really care about publishing Model 3 production rates before the end of the quarter to satisfy day traders. ""I am not here to convince people to buy our stock. Do not buy it if you think volatility is scary,"" the CEO said. With Tesla falling 4 percent in after-hours trading as of this writing, some stock pickers may have taken Musk's advice.",Musk details a few nodes in production that had been causing trouble.,2018-05-02T23:55:03Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Tesla still grinding toward 2,500 Model 3s weekly, pins progress to consistency",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/tesla-still-grinding-toward-2500-model-3s-weekly-pins-progress-to-consistency/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-605780520-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,fatality,1
Kevin Loria,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread by a variety of viruses and are mostly untreatable. They affect many organs and damage blood vessels, sometimes causing internal and external bleeding. Infections often cause fever, weakness, soreness, and headache, often followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, organ failure, and bleeding. These diseases regularly emerge from the wild, as Ebola did again just recently. They can be extremely deadly — in past Ebola outbreaks, fatality rates ranged between 25% to 90%, with an average of about 50%. Hemorrhagic fevers feature on both the CDC's list of biological agents that could pose a national security threat and on the WHO's list of diseases that can cause a public health emergency, and for good reason. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa infected more than 28,600 people and killed more than 11,300. Such outbreaks can also cause public terror. Experts widely agree that the world needs to develop better ways to contain diseases like this. In the case of Ebola, researchers are testing an experimental vaccine to see if it can help stop the current outbreak. If a strain of this type of disease were to mutate or be modified to become more contagious, that could cause worldwide devastation.","A pandemic disease could be the greatest threat humanity faces right now.

https://www.facebook.com/dlamothe,"One U.S. service member was killed and two were wounded Saturday in an apparent insider attack in Afghanistan, said the U.S.-led military coalition. The ambush occurred in southern Afghanistan, U.S. military officials said in a statement without being more specific. The two wounded U.S. troops were in stable condition, the statement added. U.S. military officials at the top U.S. military headquarters in Kabul could not immediately be reached for additional comment. The Taliban released a statement praising an Afghan soldier for carrying out the attack, without taking credit for it themselves. The statement and Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, said the attack occurred in Uruzgan province. The incident marks the first combat fatality for the U.S. military in Afghanistan since April 30, and the second there this year. In the April 30 incident, Army Spec. Gabriel D. Conde, 22, was shot by enemy fighters in a firefight in Kapisa province while providing security for U.S. Special Operations troops. Insider attacks by Afghan security forces on coalition troops working alongside them were common in Afghanistan several years ago, when the Pentagon had more than 100,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. They became more rare as the number of U.S. troops shrunk afterward, and as the military coalition added security precautions.

Andrew Krok,"A Waymo self-driving minivan was just involved in a crash in Chandler, Arizona, according to multiple news reports. According to video provided by local TV station ABC15 and pictures from Fox 10 Phoenix's Twitter account, the Waymo-branded Chrysler Pacifica suffered extensive damage. ABC15 reports that a Honda sedan swerved to avoid striking another vehicle, which sent that Honda into oncoming traffic on Chandler Boulevard, where it came into contact with the Waymo vehicle. A police spokesman told ABC15 that he believed it was the first collision involving a Waymo vehicle in Chandler this year. The spokesman also said that the Waymo vehicle was operating in autonomous mode at the time of the collision, and that the operator only suffered minor injuries in the crash. Waymo did not immediately return a request for comment. This will be the second high-profile collision involving an autonomous vehicle this year. In March, an Uber vehicle operating in autonomous mode collided with and killed a person in Tempe. It was the first known fatality from an autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, and Uber suspended its autonomous testing shortly after the collision. Last November, Waymo announced that it would run a pilot program in Phoenix where its vehicles took riders around without a safety driver sitting up front, with the eventual goal in mind of creating a driverless car-sharing service. When California announced that it was accepting applications for driverless testing in The Golden State, Waymo was quick to apply. Waymo still tests its autonomous cars with safety drivers as a failsafe, as was the case with the vehicle involved in this collision. This story will be updated as more details emerge.","Reports claim that a vehicle swerved to avoid an accident and entered oncoming traffic, where it collided with the minivan.",2018-05-04T21:55:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",Self-driving Waymo minivan involved in crash in Arizona - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/waymo-self-driving-minivan-crash-arizona/,https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/BuwWxFYPyMrSU93DHl935rzqLxE=/2017/11/07/b97720c6-afb9-408b-ad99-5884e7a25122/waymo-ogi.jpg,,Cnet.com,fatality,1
"Opinion columnist, James Alan Fox, Opinion columnist","In Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 18, 2018. (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) With the Parkland, Fla., high school massacre several days gone but hardly forgotten, the time seems right to examine closely some of the statistical hype that made frightening news alongside details of the horrific shooting. In print and on TV, Americans were bombarded with facts and figures suggesting that the problem of school shootings was out of control. We were informed, for example, that since 2013 there has been an average of one school shooting a week in the U.S., and 18 since the beginning of this year. While these statistics were not exactly lies or fake news, they involved stretching the definition of a school shooting well beyond the limits of most people’s imagination. More: No, there have not been 18 school shootings already this year More: We have a right to bear arms. But after the Florida shooting, it's time for conversation. Everytown for Gun Safety reported that there to have been 290 school shootings since the catastrophic Sandy Hook massacre some five years ago. However, very few of these were anything akin to Sandy Hook or Parkland. Sure, they all involved a school of some type (including technical schools and colleges) as well as a firearm, but the outcomes were hardly similar. Nearly half of the 290 were completed or attempted suicides, accidental discharges of a gun, or shootings with not a single individual being injured. Of the remainder, the vast majority involved either one fatality or none at all. It is easy to believe that school shootings are the “new normal” as has been intimated, or that we are facing a crisis of epidemic proportions. When schools are placed on lockdown based on an active shooter alert (which many times is a false alarm), cable news channels immediately inform their viewers of the danger, and word is tweeted and retweeted to millions, most of whom have no direct connection to the event. And when gunshots ring out, we hear the sounds replayed from cell phone recordings and watch through satellite feed as terrified survivors flee the scene. It makes a lasting impression, to be sure. For all those who believe that schools are under siege like never before, it is instructive to take a statistical road trip back in time. Since 1990, there have been 22 shootings at elementary and secondary schools in which two or more people were killed, not counting those perpetrators who committed suicide. Whereas five of these incidents have occurred over the past five-plus years since 2013 claiming the lives of 27 victims (17 at Parkland), the latter half the 1990s decade witnessed 7 multiple-fatality shootings with a total of 33 killed (13 at Columbine ). In fact, the 1997/98 school year was so awful, with four multiple-fatality shooting sprees at the hands of armed students (in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ariz.; and Springfield, Ore.), that then President Clinton formed a White House expert committee to advise him. Nearly a decade later, President Bush convened a White House Conference on School Safety in the wake of multiple-fatality incidents during his administration. More: Survivor: I will never be OK until we stop school shootings POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Of course, I don’t mean to minimize any of the one-per week on average school shootings, but they should not be conflated with the most deadly but rare events. Unfortunately, most readers and viewers don’t appreciate the distinction when statistics including non-fatal school shootings are cited whenever there is mass killing at a school. Notwithstanding the occasional multiple-fatality shooting that takes place at one of the 100,000 public schools across America, the nation’s schools are safe. Over the past quarter-century, on average about 10 students are slain in school shootings. Compare the school fatality rate to the more than 100 school-age children accidentally killed each year riding their bikes or walking to school. Congress may be too timid to pass gun legislation to protect children, but how about a national bicycle helmet law for minors? Half of the states do not require them. There is no NRA — National Riding Association — opposing that. I’m all for shielding our kids from harm. But let’s at least deal with the low hanging fruit while we debate and Congress does nothing about the role of guns in school shootings.

Photo: Lori Van Buren, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Uber disabled Volvo SUV's safety system before fatality (Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. disabled the standard collision-avoidance technology in the Volvo SUV that struck and killed a woman in Arizona last week, according to the auto-parts maker that supplied the vehicle’s radar and camera. “We don’t want people to be confused or think it was a failure of the technology that we supply for Volvo, because that’s not the case,” Zach Peterson, a spokesman for Aptiv Plc, said by phone. The Volvo XC90’s standard advanced driver-assistance system “has nothing to do” with the Uber test vehicle’s autonomous driving system, he said. Aptiv is speaking up for its technology to avoid being tainted by the fatality involving Uber, which may have been following standard practice by disabling other tech as it develops and tests its own autonomous driving system. Uber’s system failed to slow the vehicle as 49-year-old victim Elaine Herzberg crossed the street pushing a bicycle. Police in Tempe, Arizona, and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident. Uber declined to comment. A Volvo spokesman said the company can’t speculate on the cause of the incident and is awaiting a full investigation report. Intel Corp.’s Mobileye, which makes chips and sensors used in collision-avoidance systems and is a supplier to Aptiv, said Monday that it tested its own software after the crash by playing a video of the Uber incident on a television monitor. Mobileye said it was able to detect Herzberg one second before impact in its internal tests, despite the poor second-hand quality of the video relative to a direct connection to cameras equipped to the car. ‘Challenging Task’ “The video released by the police seems to demonstrate that even the most basic building block of an autonomous vehicle system, the ability to detect and classify objects, is a challenging task,” Mobileye Chief Executive Officer Amnon Shashua wrote on Intel’s website. “It is this same technology that is required, before tackling even tougher challenges, as a foundational element of fully autonomous vehicles of the future.” Aptiv’s radar and camera system using Mobileye chips and sensors helps power the Volvo XC90’s driver-assistance system, which provides collision avoidance, lane-keeping aid and other safety features. In November, Uber agreed to buy 24,000 Volvo sport utility vehicles onto which it planned to install its own sensors and software to permit pilot-less driving.

Reuters Editorial,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California wildfire was close on Saturday to becoming the state’s third largest blaze on record, with more devastation possible from a resurgence of the harsh winds that have fueled the deadly fire’s growth. The so-called Thomas Fire has destroyed more than 1,000 structures, including about 750 homes, in coastal communities in Southern California since erupting on Dec. 4, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a statement. It has cost $97 million to fight the 256,000-acre (103,600-hectare) blaze, with thousands of firefighters contending with it around the clock and helicopters and airplanes being used to drop retardant on the flames. The vast landscape charred by the blaze, which is centered less than 100 miles (161 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, is approaching the 257,314 acres (104,131 hectares) destroyed by California’s Rim Fire in 2013. The Rim Fire is the third-largest blaze on record in the state. The Thomas Fire is only 35 percent contained and it threatens 18,000 structures, officials said, including some in the wealthy enclave of Montecito just outside the city of Santa Barbara. The blaze is chewing up tall grass and brush as it expands along the scenic Pacific Coast.

Courtesy Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department/Handout via REUTERS The hot Santa Ana winds that have helped the fire grow, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank, were forecast to remain strong through Saturday evening in the Santa Barbara County mountains, the National Weather Service warned. Gusts of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h) were expected. From Saturday night through Sunday evening, the winds could lash neighboring Ventura County, the Weather Service said. That is where the Thomas Fire first began due to unknown causes, and where it was still burning. Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore. Fire officials said Iverson, the blaze’s first fatality, left behind a pregnant wife and 2-year-old daughter. The Thomas Fire was one of several major blazes that broke out in Southern California this month, although the others have been contained. The blazes forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. The fires were also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California.

"Brinda A. Thomas, Ph.D.","Source: Tesla, Inc. The automotive industry is at the beginning of a grand experiment. If completely successful, humanity could be ushered into a new economy where driving is a hobby, only for sunny days along clear roads with a view. The struggles and tedium of the daily commute could be handled by autonomous vehicles, traffic accidents could fall to nil, passengers could focus on working and relaxing in their mobile offices, and the elderly, disabled, and blind could have considerable mobility and autonomy. If a complete failure, automobile companies would have invested billions of dollars in computer vision, sensors, and automated driving systems only to have no effect on or actually increase the number of traffic accidents and fatalities by introducing new risks. This would cause a public backlash, and requiring regulators to impose a slow, costly review process that slows the pace of innovation so that after an initial roll-out to a few hundred thousand vehicles, further roll-outs are halted. Then, autonomous vehicle technology may follow the same path as the U.S. nuclear power industry, which has stopped building new power plants since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Which scenario or whether something in between unfolds depends on good design, as well as careful understanding and communication of the safety of autonomous driving technology and the path from partially autonomous to fully autonomous vehicles. And understanding the safety of autonomous vehicles (AV) is a very thorny statistics problem. Recent fatal and injury-producing crashes involving vehicles with Tesla’s Autopilot and Uber’s self-driving pilot have led to significant disagreement among experts, reporters, automakers, and regulators about safety statistics for partial autonomy technologies[1]. Tesla, in particular, has made recent headlines after two crashes and 1 fatality with its Autopilot-equipped partial autonomy vehicles in the past few months. Tesla claims that its technology is 3.7x safer than the existing U.S. vehicle fleet, stating a fatality rate of 1 death per 86 million miles for conventional vehicles versus 1 death per 320 million miles for Autopilot-equipped vehicles, but many experts question the methodology and data behind these statistics. In this article, I’ll review the data, methods, and the three main criticisms of Tesla’s methodology for conventional vehicle fatality rates, provide my best estimates, and make recommendations for regulators and automakers on the safety of autonomous vehicles. I don’t have access to data to verify the fatality rate for Tesla Autopilot-equipped vehicles but the company has promised to release public Autopilot safety data in future quarters. 1. What’s an Autopilot mile? One informal complaint I’ve heard among analysts is the question of which miles should be included as an ‘Autopilot mile’ in Tesla’s statistic of 1 fatality per 320 million miles. Some analysts argue that one should only compare miles driven in a vehicle with Autopilot engaged to manually-driven vehicle-miles to obtain a fatality rate. Instead, Tesla’s methodology includes all miles driven with an Autopilot-enabled vehicle, whether or not the functionality was engaged. I agree with Tesla’s methodology on Autopilot mileage because the road conditions under which a partial autonomy system is rated for operation (highways, clear lane markings, etc) are systematically different from manually-driven miles. If one only used Autopilot-enabled miles in the fatality rate calculation, a comparable baseline of miles for a manual vehicle driven under similar road conditions would be difficult to obtain and there are already considerable gaps in the vehicle mileage data needed to compute good partial autonomy safety statistics (more below). Because the characteristics of manually-driven miles in Autopilot-enabled vehicles are very different than the miles driven in a manually-driven vehicle — more curves, poor lane markings, rain or poor-visibility weather, etc. — it could be possible that crashes are more likely to occur when an Autopilot-enabled vehicle turned over operation to the driver, because road conditions were worse. If that hypothesis were true, these types of crashes should be included as an Autopilot crash, as it pertains to the road coverage of Autopilot and the hand-off between autonomous and manual control, which is related to Tesla’s design choices. So, unless the owner of an Autopilot-enabled vehicle never or rarely chose to enable the functionality, the proper comparison for fatality rate safety statistics should be made between Autopilot vehicles and all other vehicles. 2. What are comparable vehicles and fatalities? Another criticism of Tesla’s Autopilot safety statistics is aimed at its choice of comparable baseline vehicles in the 1 fatality per 86 million miles statistic. Analysts believe this statistic was obtained from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)’s general statistics on fatal crashes, which includes all fatalities (driver, passenger, pedestrian) from accidents by all vehicle types (automobiles, pickups and SUVs, trucks and buses, motorcycles, etc), to arrive at a 2016 total rate of 1.16 fatalities per 100 million miles, or 1 fatality per 86 million miles. Criticisms that this is an ‘apples to aardvarks’ comparison are fair. There are two main factors that contribute to vehicle fatalities: the number of crashes per vehicle, and the number of passengers or pedestrians involved in each crash[2]. While the number of crashes per vehicle is related to Autopilot design, the number of passengers in the vehicle is essentially random. The ideal calculation of the fatal crash rate statistic should be the ratio of any crash with one or more driver, passenger, or pedestrian fatality to the number of miles traveled per vehicle. In addition, vehicles of similar classes should be compared, i.e. large luxury sedans vs. the Model S, large luxury SUVs vs. the Model X, and mid-size luxury sedans vs. the Model 3, as the demographics and driving patterns of drivers of these sub-classes of vehicles should be similar. Unfortunately, these ideal data are not reported by the IIHS, which either reports all fatalities, not broken out by vehicle sub-class, or driver-only fatality rates by vehicle models and sub-classes. If one uses the overall rate of 29–32 driver deaths per million vehicle-years for all vehicles, and 11,000 miles driven per year per vehicle, that corresponds to a driver fatality rate of one per 340 million to 380 million miles[3]. However, the fatality rate for any crash that included pedestrian, passenger, or driver deaths could be higher. According to the 2016 IIHS crash death by type statistics just under 60% of vehicle fatalities involve a driver, when including all vehicle types but excluding fatalities involving truck drivers/passengers, bicyclists, and motorcyclists. If so, the fatal crash rate could be one per 210 million to 230 miles if we included vehicle crashes with other types of fatalities. But we don’t know for sure because the IIHS doesn’t track fatal crash rates by vehicle, only driver death rates. By this last estimate, Autopilot has about the same to 35% lower fatal crash rates than any conventional vehicle at this time. Why does my estimate differ so much from Tesla’s reported baseline for conventional vehicles of 1 in 86 million miles? Partly because Tesla includes all deaths for all vehicle types for conventional vehicles which is not a fair comparison with Autopilot-equipped vehicles, and partly because that simple arithmetic calculation should not be used because it doesn’t tell the whole truth and misses the bigger business and public policy problem. 3. Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics If life is a simulation, a simple arithmetic calculation of the miles per fatality statistic is the outcome of a single run, a single roll of the dice. If a butterfly flapped its wings in China and an autonomous vehicle accident occurred earlier or later in time, a snapshot of the miles per fatality statistic calculated immediately after an accident would cloud our crystal ball. That one fatality per 320 million miles statistic for Autopilot should really be calculated using the same methodology (called Poisson regression) that IIHS used to determine the driver fatality rate of 29–32 per million vehicle-years for conventional vehicles. A Poisson regression is used to model independent random events in time, like fatal accidents, as a function of exposure, such as miles traveled per vehicle to obtain a probabilistic estimate of fatality rate. However, IIHS was only able to obtain a narrow range of driver fatality rate estimates (29–32 per million car-years) for the entire population of vehicles in the U.S. The driver fatality rates for some less-common vehicles makes and models (including some of the large luxury vehicles that could be compared with Tesla Autopilot-enabled vehicles), while shown on the IIHS website, have such large (confidence interval) ranges that the average driver fatality rate figures are useless for decision-making. Source: RAND Corp. Policymakers, automakers, and the general public need to get comfortable with the uncomfortable fact that over 8 billion of miles will have to be driven with partially-autonomous vehicles before we have statistical confidence that autonomous vehicles are 20% better than humans, according to RAND[4]. In the short term, we cannot be certain that partially autonomous vehicles are safer than drivers. However, that doesn’t mean we should delay the roll-out of autonomous vehicle technology. RAND has developed a useful decision analysis tool to allow anyone to compare the timing of a partial-autonomy roll-out, the safety of the technology (from half-as-safe to almost perfect), and the lives saved over the course of several decades, assuming that by 2060, almost perfect fully-autonomous vehicles are rolled out to the majority of the vehicle fleet in the U.S. This model shows that rolling out just as safe or a little safer partially-autonomous vehicles by 2020 will save 160,000 more lives over 50 years than a scenario that waits until 2025 to roll out almost perfect autonomous vehicles. Delaying the roll-out of partially-autonomous vehicles costs lives. This conclusion assumes that (1) automakers make steady progress in improving the safety and reliability of their partially autonomous vehicles and (2) drivers are comfortable enough with monitoring the partially-autonomous vehicles so that new sources of error associated with the transition to and from manual and autonomous control do not increase fatality rates. Automakers and regulators should do everything to verify and ensure that these assumptions are true. Recommendations for Regulators and Automakers NHTSA has been a strong supporter of the transition to autonomous vehicles throughout the years because of its potential benefits for safety and productivity for all and increased mobility for the disabled, blind, and elderly. It would be highly beneficial to development of autonomous vehicle technology if NHTSA coordinates the collection and analysis of safety statistics using the Poisson regression methodology used by IIHS for conventional and partially autonomous vehicles. These statistics should be developed for the specific vehicle classes that are likely to see partial autonomy features in the coming years, i.e. mid-size and large sedans and SUVs. These data are vitally important so that the automotive industry and the general public know where partial autonomy technologies stand relative to conventional vehicles, so that individual drivers can make informed purchasing decisions. Similarly, automakers should collect and report on safety statistics on partially-autonomous vehicles, including counts of fatal and non-fatal crashes, airbag deployments, fender benders, near-misses, manual overrides of vehicles, as well as miles driven with autonomy-enabled vehicles and non-autonomy-enabled vehicles. Over time, as vehicle fleets gain enough mileage, safety statistics could be computed using the Poisson regression methodology. According to RAND’s study, ‘developers of this [partial autonomy] technology and third-party testers cannot drive their way to safety’ with small fleets of ~100 vehicles driving 24 hours a day. Large-scale trials of 100s of thousands of vehicles would have to operate for multiple years before to obtain the mileage necessary to have confidence in better than human performance of a partial autonomy system. Researchers have proposed simulation and testing approaches of hardware and software to obtain autonomous driving safety data without on-the-road mileage. Regulators will have to work with manufacturers to develop and review these alternative safety tests and adapt regulations accordingly on the road to a self-driving future. Notes: The author is a data scientist, former Tesla employee with no involvement with Autopilot development, and holds TSLA stock. This article was written with no input from Tesla. All views are my own. [1] Some companies (e.g. Waymo/Google) argue that partial autonomy systems will never be safer than human driving and promote the development of fully autonomous vehicles, complete with no steering wheel, only. That debate is outside the scope of this article. [2] Treatment of crashes involving pedestrians is not just a statistics problem, it is a legal problem outside the scope of this article. With conventional vehicles, the driver is fully responsible for pedestrian crashes, but with partial- and fully-autonomy vehicles, the liability and insurance costs is a shared responsibility between drivers and automakers depending on the level of autonomy claimed or achieved. This is an area that requires a lot of further study and the development of custom insurance products. [3] Note that the correct number to use of this type of analysis is vehicle-miles traveled per vehicle, as opposed to vehicle-miles traveled per licensed driver as in Figure 4–4 in this FHWA reference (because people could drive multiple cars), or vehicle-miles traveled per capita (because not all people drive), to quantify the exposure to the risk of a fatal car accident per vehicle. [4] Less on-the-road mileage is needed if safety statistics on other types of road accidents, like non-fatal crashes, fender benders, and near-misses can be obtained. However, data on minor accidents and near-misses are spotty.","The automotive industry is at the beginning of a grand experiment.

A man running on a popular park trail in the mountains of northern Colorado killed a mountain lion after it pounced on him from behind.
Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) officials say the man sustained serious injuries after he was bitten on his face and wrist by the young male lion.
The man, who has not been named, turned after hearing a noise behind him, just as the lion lunged, officials say.
The cat died from suffocation, state wildlife officials have determined.
Monday afternoon's attack occurred on the West Ridge Trail at Horsetooth Mountain Open Space near the city of Fort Collins - about 66 miles (106km) from Denver.
The victim ""described hearing something behind him on the trail and was attacked by a mountain lion as he turned around to investigate,"" according to an official statement. 
""The lion lunged at the runner, biting his face and wrist. He was able to fight and break free from the lion, killing the lion in self-defence."" 
After killing the predator, the man was able to leave the park on his own and call for help.
In a statement, officials the described the wounds to his face, wrist, arms, legs and back as ""serious, but non-life threatening"".
Officials later found the dead lion, which was determined to be a juvenile male weighing around 80lbs (36kg). 
""The runner did everything he could to save his life,"" said Mark Leslie, CPW's Northeast Region manager, who did not say exactly how the runner killed the animal. 
""In the event of a lion attack, you need to do anything in your power to fight back just as this gentleman did.""
Cougars, also known as mountain lions, panthers or pumas, are members of the wild cat family. They live across the Americas, from British Columbia to Argentina.
Mountain lion attacks in North America are very rare, officials say, with fewer than 20 happening in the past 100 years.
Instances of attacks are often seen among sick or starving lions, which normally are elusive and tend to avoid humans. The animal in Monday's attack has been taken to a nearby lab for a post-mortem examination to be performed.

 The Horsetooth Mountain Open Space is a popular hiking spot outside Fort Collins
If you ever seen a big cat, authorities say not to run, since that may trigger the lion's hunting reflexes.
""Running may stimulate a lion's instinct to chase and attack,"" the park service said.
Instead people should stand firm and make an effort to look larger, and if attacked, fight back using any weapon at hand.
""What you want to do is convince the lion you are not prey and that you may in fact be a danger to the lion,"" officials said in a statement.
""People have fought back with rocks, sticks, caps or jackets, garden tools and their bare hands successfully,"" the park statement read, adding that sensitive areas such as the eyes should be targeted first.
Last May, two cyclists in Washington state were killed by what authorities described as an ""emaciated"" cougar. 
In September 2018, a hiker in Oregon was found dead in what officials suspect was the state's first ever fatality caused by a wild mountain lion.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Strong winds that have powered the third-largest wildfire in California’s history were expected on Sunday to further fuel a blaze that has burned 267,500 acres. Nearly 8,500 firefighters are battling the so-called Thomas Fire in Southern California, which began Dec. 4 and has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and threatened 18,000 more, including homes in the wealthy town of Montecito just outside the coastal city of Santa Barbara. While the winds were expected to ease on Sunday near Santa Barbara, northeast wind gusts up to 55 mph were forecast through Sunday for parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, National Weather Service forecasters said. The blaze, centered less than 100 miles (160 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, has forced evacuations that turned neighborhoods into ghost towns and filled the air with smoke. The fire is now 40 percent contained despite hot Santa Ana winds that have powered its expansion, at times sending embers far ahead of its main flank. Firefighters were employing more than 970 fire engines and 34 helicopters to battle the blaze. Firefighters keep watch on the Thomas wildfire in the hills and canyons outside Montecito, California, U.S., December 16, 2017. REUTERS/Gene Blevins “It is a beast,” Santa Barbara County Fire Department Division Chief Martin Johnson told a news conference on Saturday. “But we will kill it.” Five of 20 most destructive fires in recorded history ravaged the state in 2017, according to Cal Fire. The Thomas fire, the seventh-most destructive in state history, forced many schools to close for days, shut roads and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes. It was also responsible for poor air quality throughout Southern California. On Saturday, evacuation orders were issued for parts of Santa Barbara County as high winds whipped the fire through bone-dry terrain. In Montecito on Saturday, smoke billowing from nearby canyons and pushed by the high winds choked the air, hindering aircraft from dropping flame retardant, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services said. An evacuation order for the city of Ventura was lifted on Saturday morning. Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, died on Thursday while battling the flames near the Ventura County community of Fillmore.

Neil Charm,"THE Department of Health (DoH) said dengue cases from January to March 2, 2019 increased drastically compared to the same period last year and reminded the public to help prevent the illness.
In a press release the DoH said its Epidemiology Bureau reported 40,614 dengue cases from the said period. That total is 16,383 cases or 68% higher compared to the same period last year with 24,231 cases.
The department called on the public to help prevent dengue by implementing the enhanced 4-S strategy in their homes, including: search and destroy of mosquito-breeding sites, self-protection measures such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants and use of mosquito repellents, early consultation, and fogging/spraying in hotspot areas.
“We are encouraging the public to practice the 4-S strategy, especially now that there are more opportunities for the mosquitoes to make stagnant water around these water containers their breeding places,” Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III was quoted as saying.
The DoH also cited an advice by the World Health Organization that there is no specific treatment for dengue but early detection and access to health care can lower fatality rates to below 1%.

EditorDavid,"Long-time Slashdot reader rufey writes: Last weekend a Tesla vehicle was involved in a crash near Salt Lake City Utah while its Autopilot feature was enabled. The Tesla, a Model S, crashed into the rear end of a fire department utility truck, which was stopped at a red light, at an estimated speed of 60 MPH. ""The car appeared not to brake before impact, police said. The driver, whom police have not named, was taken to a hospital with a broken foot,"" according to the Associated Press. ""The driver of the fire truck suffered whiplash and was not taken to a hospital."" Elon Musk tweeted about the accident : It's super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage. What's actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. The Associated Press defended their news coverage Friday, arguing that the facts show that ""not all Tesla crashes end the same way."" They also fact-check Elon Musk's claim that ""probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla,"" reporting that it's impossible to verify since Tesla won't release the number of miles driven by their cars or the number of fatalities. ""There have been at least three already this year and a check of 2016 NHTSA fatal crash data -- the most recent year available -- shows five deaths in Tesla vehicles."" Slashdot reader Reygle argues the real issue is with the drivers in the Autopilot cars.

Associated Press,"(DALLAS) — Federal investigators arrived in Dallas Sunday to look into a suspected natural gas leak that caused an explosion at a newly renovated house, killing a 12-year-old girl and injuring four other members of her family. Ravi Chhatre, head of a three-person National Transportation Safety Board team, said he was early in the process of gathering information after firefighters Friday found the home shattered but no fire. Four injured people were in the front yard and one of them was holding the unconscious girl, Linda Rogers, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. “We don’t want any community to go through a tragedy like you guys have,” Chhatre said at a news briefing shortly after arriving at the scene. “We don’t want homes getting exploded.” Two other gas-related problems were reported last week in the neighborhood where a construction crew had been working. City officials on Saturday lifted a mandatory evacuation order for about 300 families in the area but natural gas service was suspended. He said the NTSB had jurisdiction because of the case involved an apparent pipeline accident, a fatality and damage. Asked if he had any preliminary findings, Chhatre replied, “Right now, I haven’t reached anything. Right now, I’m looking to see where I move.” He said he might have “a better picture” in a couple of days but said the agency’s investigations typically take six months to a year, depending on nature of the accident. “We don’t rush any investigation,” he said. “Accuracy is more important to us.”","(DALLAS) — Federal investigators arrived in Dallas Sunday to look into a suspected natural gas leak that caused an explosion at a newly renovated house, killing a 12-year-old girl and injuring four other members of her family.

Tina Bellon,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla on Thursday reached an agreement to settle a class action lawsuit with buyers of its Model S and Model X cars who alleged that the company’s assisted-driving Autopilot system was “essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous.” No further details of the agreement, announced in a filing in San Jose federal court late Thursday, were available. The deal still has to be approved by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman. Tesla and Steve Berman, a lawyer for the car owners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The case was closely watched in the automotive and legal communities, as it was the only known court challenge Tesla faced with regard to its assisted-driving technology. The company has come under increased scrutiny over its Autopilot system in recent months after two Tesla drivers died in crashes in which Autopilot was engaged. The most recent crash, in March, is being investigated by safety regulators. Autopilot, released in 2015, is an enhanced cruise-control system that partially automates steering and braking. Tesla has said the use of Autopilot results in 40 percent fewer crashes, a claim the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration repeated in a 2017 report on the first fatality, which occurred in May 2016. Earlier this month, however, the agency said regulators had not assessed the effectiveness of the technology. The 2017 lawsuit in San Jose federal court named six Tesla Model S and Model X owners from Colorado, Florida, New Jersey and California who alleged the company had engaged in fraud by concealment, and had violated various state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. They sought to represent a nationwide class of consumers. The Tesla owners said they had paid an extra $5,000 to have their cars equipped with the Autopilot software, which promised to provide additional safety features, but in fact was “completely inoperable,” according to the complaint. The plaintiffs alleged that features such as automated emergency braking, side collision warnings and auto high beams did not work or were unreliable. They said the system was unsafe to use as it brakes unexpectedly for no reason and fails to brake when approaching large vehicles, such as trucks and buses. On Wednesday, two U.S. consumer advocacy groups also urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate what they called Tesla’s “deceptive and misleading” use of the name Autopilot for its assisted-driving technology.

Larry Greenemeier,"A self-driving Uber sport utility vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz., on Sunday night. Elaine Herzberg, 49, had been pushing a bicycle across a busy road about 100 meters from the closest pedestrian crosswalk when she stepped in front of the vehicle, which was traveling 38 miles per hour in a 35 mile-per-hour zone, Tempe police chief Sylvia Moir told the San Francisco Chronicle. The fatal accident prompted Uber to temporarily halt testing of its driverless vehicles on public roads in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Herzberg’s death is the first reported incident of a pedestrian killed by a self-driving car, and raises questions about whether such vehicles are ready to operate autonomously on public roads. The vehicle’s cameras and other sensors apparently did not detect the victim and made no attempt to brake or otherwise avoid her. An Uber employee was in the Volvo XC90 SUV acting as a safety operator but told police he did not have time to react to avoid hitting Herzberg Self-driving cars rely on a combination of sensors and data systems to navigate and avoid obstacles. The vehicles typically include some combination of global positioning systems (GPS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, radar, cameras and other equipment to help detect lane markings, bicycles, other vehicles and pedestrians. Each of these systems has particular strengths and weaknesses. “One of the things that we have noticed about accidents involving self-driving cars is that they seem strange from a human perspective; for example, the vehicles do not hit the brakes prior to the collision, which is something most human drivers do,” says Bart Selman, a computer science professor at Cornell University and director of the Intelligent Information Systems Institute. “That’s because the vehicles make decisions based on what their sensors detect. If its sensors don’t detect anything, the vehicle won’t react at all.” That was evident following a fatal accident in May 2016, when a Tesla Sedan S using its driver-assist Autopilot technology failed to brake to avoid hitting a tractor trailer that was making a left turn across its lane, killing the Tesla’s driver. Given the time the Uber accident occurred—10 P.M. local time—it is possible the vehicle’s cameras did not see the pedestrian, but its LiDAR and radar should not have been affected by the darkness, says Ragunathan Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering in Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Security and Privacy Institute. “Self-driving vehicles are trained to identify crosswalks and yield to a person crossing a road,” Rajkumar says. (He has helped lead Carnegie Mellon’s efforts to develop autonomous vehicles, including the “Boss” SUV that won the DARPA 2007 Urban Challenge.) “Even in a jaywalking scenario [such as this] the vehicle is still always looking for obstacles in its path,” so its failure to see the pedestrian is puzzling, he notes. Uber is one of several companies developing self-driving cars, with an eye toward eventually putting fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet, is testing similar technology throughout Arizona (including Tempe) and California as well as in Detroit, Austin and other cities. The main difference is that Waymo has begun testing completely driverless vehicles —without even a human safety operator—in Arizona since October. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also has plans to include driverless technology in his company’s roadsters, which currently have an Autopilot driver-assist feature that still requires human control. Uber’s policy of having a human operator onboard its self-driving vehicles “is perhaps the most interesting aspect of this particular accident,” says Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor in Arizona State University’s School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems Engineering. “Unlike the Tesla’s infelicitously named Autopilot, which is meant to be only a glorified driver’s assistant, the Uber cars were supposed to be fully autonomous. Nevertheless, unlike Waymo’s, Uber self-driving cars here in the [East Valley region near Phoenix] have always had a driver—supposedly ready to intercede in tricky situations.” Uber has human operators in its vehicles because the technology is not mature enough to be completely driverless, according to Rajkumar. “The human has a very specific safety role to play,” he says. There are lots of unexpected scenarios that can happen on the road that the vehicle’s software is not capable of handling. The vehicle drives itself in many situations but not in all situations. A human driver is most likely to take over when the road conditions are bad—such as when ice or snow hides the lane markers—or in downtown urban areas where there are lots of taxis weaving through traffic and people jaywalking. A human operator must proactively assume driving responsibilities from the car before it encounters a scenario that it is unable to safely negotiate, says Gary Marchant, a professor of emerging technologies, law and ethics at Arizona State. But it is unlikely that person would be able to prevent a crash by taking over for a self-driving system at the last minute because most accidents are unexpected and happen suddenly, Marchant says. Uber released a statement on March 19 via the company’s Twitter account saying, “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We’re fully cooperating with @TempePolice and local authorities as they investigate this incident.” The National Transportation Safety Board also announced Monday it is sending a team to Tempe to investigate the collision. “The investigation will address the vehicle’s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists,” according to an agency statement. “In some ways, a self-driving fatality was to be expected sooner or later, and it [was] only a matter of time,” Kambhampati says. “Arizona [Gov. Doug Ducey] has been quite deliberately courting self-driving car companies, and the Phoenix metro area has become the proving ground for this technology, with both Uber and Waymo operating in our suburbs.” Rajkumar agrees such an accident was imminent, but also acknowledges road testing is the only way for self-driving technology to truly improve. “A good amount of testing can happen in computer simulation, but that goes only so far because it can’t be entirely faithful to the unpredictable situations the vehicle will face in the real world,” he says. “This [accident] is the scenario that people working on the self-driving vehicle technology have always dreaded. But the big picture is that the technology has the potential to save many lives over time by reducing the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities.

Benjamin Zhang,"U.S. NTSB investigators are on scene examining damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane in this image released from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., April 17, 2018. NTSB/Reuters The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive (EAD) on Friday that requires airlines inspect the fan blades on certain older CFM56-7B engines. The EAD comes after a fan blade on a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700 snapped off mid-flight, spraying shrapnel that punctured the aircraft's fuselage causing depressurization. The incident claimed the life of passenger Jennifer Riordan, the first fatality on board a US commercial airliner since 2009. National Transportation Safety Board investigators found signs of cracking and metal fatigue at the point where the blade broke. As a result, FAA is ordering airlines use ultrasonic detection devices to inspect all 24 fan blades on older CFM56-7B engines for cracks. The order applies only to engines with more than 30,000 cycles which equates to roughly 20 years of service. The directive stipulates that these inspections must be completed within the next 20 days. The engine in question, the CFM56-7B turbofan, is the product of a 40-year-old joint venture between GE Aviation and France's Safran Aircraft Engines called CFM International. The CFM56 arguably the most popular jet engines in the world with more than 30,000 units produced since 1980 and is used on both civilian and military aircraft. The CFM56-7B debuted in 1997 and currently powers more than 6,700 planes in the world. According to the FAA, CFM International expects the directive to affect 352 engines in the US and 681 engines worldwide. The FAA directive comes as a result of a service bulletin issued earlier Friday by the engine's manufacturer as well as information gathered from the investigation of Southwest Flight 1380. The CFM International service bulletin also called for airlines to repeat these inspections every 3,000 cycles or two years.","The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered airlines to inspect certain older CFM56-7B turbofan engines.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. It was bound to happen. With autonomous vehicles on the streets across the country, one of them—through computer error, supervisor carelessness, or a pedestrian’s mistake—was going to hit someone. On Monday morning, a self-driving Uber with a supervising driver struck and killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she tried to cross eight lanes of traffic in Tempe, Arizona. Herzberg’s death was the first recorded fatality caused by a self-driving car. Much of the debate going forward will circle around the particulars of the accident—the design of the intersection near which Herzberg was killed, the viability of Uber’s autonomous vehicle technology to detect pedestrians at night, the actions of the supervising engineer, and the fact that the victim was reportedly crossing the street outside the crosswalk. More broadly, observers will be tempted to use the death as a data point to evaluate the safety record of AVs, which is both one of most promising long-term benefits of the technology and a present-day talking point of companies like Google’s Waymo. On the surface, after today, the results do not look good: Waymo claims to have driven more than 5 million miles, including 3.5 million on public roads. In September, Uber claimed to have done more than 1 million miles. The industry’s other players are behind them, so it seems certain that AVs as a whole clocked fewer than 10 million public miles before recording a pedestrian fatality. Nationally, the rate is closer to one pedestrian fatality every 480 million miles traveled. If you include all auto deaths, the 2015 rate was one every 88 million miles. Reaching either marker would require a lot of safe driving for AVs right now. But there are a few reasons that back-of-the-napkin comparison doesn’t make a lot of sense. For one thing, when you’re evaluating something that happens once every 88 million miles, 5 million to 10 million miles is not a big sample size. (Even Tesla’s claim that its autopilot tech constituted a “statistically significant improvement in safety” after its first fatality was recorded after 130 million miles is not a huge sample size.) You’d need many more hundreds of millions of miles—or a few more fatalities—to establish an accurate sense of how often this is likely to happen. And the calculation makes even less sense than that, because most of those miles have been performed with an engineer ready to take over. How often have human drivers taken the wheel? How many of those situations represent serious mistakes by the computer driving the car? What if human intervention makes a situation worse? All that introduces an uncomfortable amount of noise into the data that we do have. Finally, fatality rates vary widely by age and especially by gender. Male drivers between the ages of 16 and 25 tend to be about five times as likely to die behind the wheel than women between the ages of 46 and 55. (Men are much, much worse drivers across the board.) They also vary geographically. Pedestrian mortality rates are more than four times higher in Florida than in Vermont. So the safety improvement we can expect from autonomous vehicles depends in part on where and how they are deployed, which drivers they are taking off the road, and at which times of day. The gist is that we little have no idea how the current fleet of AVs compares, safetywise, to our existing (and fairly lousy, all things considered) crop of human drivers. If the technology were considerably more unsafe, we would probably have seen a few more crashes like the one that happened today in Tempe. But given the small sample size and complicating factors, it’s hopeless to try to make a side-by-side statistical comparison. What is true is that autonomous vehicles are likely to be better and safer than human drivers in the long term, and the sooner we make the transition away from human drivers, the more lives we will save on the road. The uncomfortable question we have to ask now is what kind of short-term cost we are willing to bear to help self-driving technology make that leap.","It was bound to happen.

Reuters,"LOS GATOS, California ― Tesla Inc. said on Friday that a Tesla Model X involved a fatal crash in California last week had activated its Autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. Tesla also said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by the driver soon before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel. “The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken,” Tesla said. The statement did not say why the Autopilot system apparently did not detect the concrete divider. The fatal crash and vehicle fire of the Tesla near Mountain View, California, involved two other cars and delayed traffic for hours. The 38-year-old Tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly after the crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which launched an investigation into the crash earlier this week, did not immediately comment late Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating the fatal crash. Autopilot allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel “at all times” before they can use autopilot, but users routinely tout the fact they can use the system to drive hands-free. The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal autopilot crash. In September, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said operational limitations in the Tesla Model S played a major role in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using autopilot. That death — the first fatality in a Tesla vehicle operating in Autopilot mode — raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for long stretches with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system’s misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention and for “overreliance on vehicle automation.” In January, NHTSA and NTSB launched investigations into a Tesla vehicle, apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode, that struck a fire truck in California. Neither agency nor Tesla has offered any update. The government probes raise the risk for Tesla and automakers at a time when the industry is seeking federal legislation that would ease deployment of self driving cars. The crash comes soon after an Uber vehicle in Arizona in self-driving mode struck and killed a pedestrian in the first death linked to an autonomous vehicle. Tesla said late Friday that “Autopilot does not prevent all accidents – such a standard would be impossible – but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.” Tesla said that in the United States “there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware.” Tesla in September 2016 unveiled improvements to Autopilot, adding new limits on hands-off driving. On Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S sedans built before April 2016 in order to replace bolts in the power steering component that can begin to corrode after contact in cold temperatures with road salt. No accidents or injuries were reported.",A Tesla driver died at a nearby hospital shortly afterward.,2018-03-31T13:51:29Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Tesla Says Deadly Crash Involved Vehicle’s Autopilot System,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesla-says-deadly-crash-involved-autopilot-system_us_5abf8fb1e4b055e50acdf3c4,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5abf91741e0000fb077b03ec.jpeg?cache=l9chbok2qk&ops=1910_1000,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,fatality,1
Midwestern Hedgie,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has worked hard to convince shareholders, media, and, most-importantly, car buyers that Tesla is the “safest vehicle” on the road. He said in May that the brand’s fatality rate is “approx 4X better than average,” expanding upon his claim by Tweeting, “According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla.” What is the actual record of Tesla cars when compared apples-to-apples with their luxury peers? In this article, we answer that question with statistical rigor. Musk is a phenomenal salesman. In 2016, he facilitated Tesla’s $7.4 billion acquisition of financially-troubled residential solar installer SolarCity — which he owned more than 20% of — by hosting a public event surrounded by an entire neighborhood of “solar houses,” richly illustrating the rationale for the business combination. Amidst much applause, Musk introduced “a solar roof that is better than a normal roof? That looks better, lasts longer, has better insulating effect, and where the cost of roof-plus-electricity is less than that of a normal roof… We’ve got an electric car, a Powerwall [battery storage], and a Solar Roof. The key is that it needs to be beautiful, affordable, and seamlessly integrated. If all of those things are true, why would you go any other direction?” Musk holding a Solar Roof tile in the “solar neighborhood,” with the “solar house” with an installed Solar Roof and two Tesla vehicles in the driveway. Long after Tesla shareholders voted to approve the SolarCity acquisition, we learned that the solar panels were non-functional props. A year later, Fast Company revealed that the Solar Roof product displayed that day was completely non-functional. The entire solar neighborhood was a Potemkin village. A source close to Musk told the author “It’s all about the narrative for Elon. Solar Roof was as ‘real’ as anything he’s ever shown [off to the public]. Was it a finished product? By no means.” The reality of Tesla’s solar business is now bleak. Nearly two years after Musk’s “solar neighborhood” show, the Solar Roof is vanishingly rare and extremely expensive ($42/sq ft for solar tiles), Powerwall is a niche product with long wait times, and SolarCity installations have steadily fallen 70% below their peak. Musk’s numerous ardent supporters might ask “What’s wrong with optimism when you are trying to save the world?” A skeptic might consider this “optimism” to be fraud, an attempt to mislead investors in order to avoid a SolarCity bankruptcy, massive personal financial losses, and a giant reputational hit. Tesla fans and critics alike can agree that buyers of luxury cars do not wish to die behind the wheel of their automobile — a wish that is usually granted. Perhaps due to the superior construction and safety features of more expensive cars, or maybe because of the driving habits of their owners, luxury cars typically have a superior safety profile compared to the average car. Just how safe? Our firm analyzed the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) data to find out. IIHS is a not-for-profit organization funded by auto insurers which uses accident data to calculate driver death rates for each common model of car in the United States. To do so, IIHS uses fatality data from the federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and combines that fatality data with vehicle registration data from IHS Automotive (an unrelated, for-profit company). The most recent IIHS fatality data were published in May 2017 and include model years from 2011–2014 and accidents from 2012–2015. IIHS reports the rate of driver deaths per million vehicle-years. The data are presented car model-by-model, which is great for car buyers who are considering a specific car. One limitation of this method is that, for models with a limited sample size, the 95% confidence interval is very large. [A quick statistics review: fatal car crashes are rare, binary events. Either a driver had one or s/he didn’t. When the size of a sample is small, or the rate of events in question is low, that means there is wide uncertainty as to what the true population rate of events — the incidence of driver fatalities, in this case — actually is. The 95% confidence interval is a mathematical way of expressing the range of possible values for the true population average; in other words, given the sample size we have, there’s a 95% chance that the actual correct real-world value is within our confidence interval.] For example, IIHS reports that the Audi A6 4WD had 0 driver fatalities over 101,164 vehicle-years of driving, for a rate of 0 driver deaths per million vehicle years. The 95% confidence interval is 0 to 36, meaning that we can be 95% certain, based upon that sample, that the true rate at which Audi A6 4WD cars of that vintage incur an accident fatal to the driver is between 0 and 36 per million vehicle years. By looking at groups of models, for example “all large luxury cars” or “all cars made by Mercedes,” we can get a more precise estimate of the driver fatality rate for each group. We did exactly that, and here are some of the most interesting findings: Large luxury cars are safe. The observed IIHS fatality rate for large luxury cars is 7 per one million vehicle years. Because we have a relatively large data set, we can say with 95% confidence that the fatality rate for large luxury cars is between 3 and 13 per one million vehicle years. Here are the data for the entire group: Large luxury cars are nearly as safe as houses. Just 8 driver deaths in 1.2 million vehicle years. In fact, all luxury cars rated by IIHS are generally safe. Across the entire universe of luxury cars, the driver death rate is only 13 per one million vehicle years (95% confidence interval 9–18): All luxury cars are pretty safe. Just 13 driver deaths per million years (confidence interval 9–18). German luxury cars — Mercedes, Audi, and BMW — may be modestly safer than the luxury car group average. All three of the German brands have a similar driver death rate, ranging from 10 deaths per million vehicle years for Audi and BMW to 12 deaths per million vehicle years for Mercedes. German luxury cars appear slightly safer than the luxury car group, on the whole. So what about Tesla? Is it “the safest car” on the road? Is it “4X better than average?” Is the “probability of fatality much lower in a Tesla?” I’m willing to accept a huge amount of puffery when it comes to Taco Bell menu items, considerably less when dealing with financial matters (apparently much less than most people, given that Tesla sports a $64 billion valuation after the SolarCity debacle), and very little when it comes down to things that may kill me. Tesla cars look cool and, like most high-performance electric vehicles, are extremely fun to drive. But I have a wife and kids to worry about. Like most potential luxury car buyers, I want a very safe car. Neither IIHS nor NHTSA have yet published summary quantitative real-world fatality data on Tesla cars. As has been previously noted by astute observers, when Musk said, “According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles,” only the first part of that data was actually “according to NHTSA.” Musk’s “every 320 million miles” wasn’t the correct fatality per mile figure, and Musk either knew or should have known that. Regardless, summary national data obtained dividing all deaths (including drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) by an estimate of total miles driven in the United States isn’t very useful for comparing one model of car against its peers. We don’t know how far most cars have actually gone. That’s why IIHS uses “vehicle years” instead of miles; we know if a car is registered or not. And IIHS counts only driver fatalities, since there is always one driver in a car, but some cars tend to have more passengers than others. Apples-to-apples, how does Tesla’s real-world driver fatality experience compare with other cars in its class? IIHS’ latest published analysis didn’t have enough Tesla data to include the make in their numbers, however the NHTSA-FARS database is now searchable through 2016. We set out to use the NHTSA-FARS database to perform a comprehensive analysis of Tesla driver deaths through 2016. Along the way, we discovered several errors in the database, likely due to fact that Tesla is not assigned a unique model code but is rather part of an obscure basket of “Other domestic manufacturers” with Studebakers, Hudsons, Packards, and others. Worse yet, that isn’t even the only “other vehicle” basket. We found Tesla accidents coded correctly, Tesla accidents coded incorrectly, and Tesla accidents seemingly completely missing. The NHTSA-FARS code for Tesla. Just choose (29) Other domestic manufacturers. It’s easy to imagine the local people entering this data at hundreds of thousands of disparate localities struggling here. Wrong ways to code a Tesla include leaving the field blank (-1), or choosing (69) other import, (97) not reported, (98) other make, or (99) unknown make. A sample of make codes for other cars; very simple in comparison to Tesla. California, Tesla’s largest market by far, accounting for approximately 45% of Model S sales during the period of our analysis, appears to be a massive source of error. From other public sources, we noted four Tesla driver fatalities in California between July 2014 and June 2015. In California’s SWITRS (Internet Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System) database, only one of the four Tesla driver deaths was coded properly as a Tesla. We found a second fatal accident coded with model year 2012 but no model information. We were unable to locate the other two fatal accidents in the California database at all. Those two were, unsurprisingly, also missing from the Federal NHTSA-FARS database. California SWITRS data for Tesla is largely missing. Above: known Tesla death (from news) with a model year but no make. Only one death out of the four publicly known before June 2015 is correctly recorded; there are none recorded from July 2015 to December 2016. Very concerningly from a data integrity standpoint, as the number of Tesla vehicles on the road increased, and ex-California fatalities increased from zero in the pre-December 2015 period to seven in the period from December 2015 to December 2016, reported Tesla driver fatalities from the entire state of California were zero. That’s exceedingly unlikely to be correct. Given the data errors in California and NHTSA-FARS, which are likely specific to Tesla given its unusual make/model code, we decided to include all available public sources in our analysis, to get the most robust analysis possible. We include all accidents on or prior to December 31, 2016. To have the largest sample size and best confidence intervals possible, we also included international accidents (three total, from Canada, Holland, and China). Given the higher incidence of fatal accidents per vehicle-year in China compared to the United States, and the lower incidence of fatal accidents in Holland and Canada, these three deaths should adjust to 3.63 deaths. However, for the sake of conservatism and to avoid a large debate about a rather small difference, we use 3.00 deaths in our analysis. Because we included both U.S. and international accidents as the numerator, it is appropriate to use all (including U.S. and international) Tesla vehicle-years as our denominator. We included Model S and X, but not the very low volume Tesla Roadster. Model 3 was not available until 2017. Tesla quarters tend to be back-end loaded, with more vehicles delivered near the end than the beginning, so we made a very slight adjustment for this (see table below). We also assumed that every Tesla ever sold was still on the road at the end of the period, December 31, 2016, which has the effect of modestly underestimating the true fatality rate. Total Tesla Model S and X vehicle years through December 31, 2016 To build our list of Tesla driver fatalities, we searched the NHTSA-FARS database using various methods, including for vehicles of make 29 &amp; model 5 (Tesla), and separately for VINs beginning with 5YJ. This search found five Tesla driver fatalities. We conducted a Google search for Tesla driver fatalities reported by English-language sources, using a variety of search terms, and reviewed and fact-checked the crowdsourced Tesla mortality file maintained by @ElonBachman (EB) on Twitter, first published in May 2018. The EB list included three driver fatalities prior to December 31, 2016 not found in our NHTSA-FARS search. Our NHTSA-FARS search identified one fatality not found on the EB file (and incidentally also identified one additional Tesla-associated pedestrian fatality in a separate accident). Documented United States Tesla driver fatalities through December 31, 2016 Documented international Tesla driver fatalities through December 31, 2016 Remember that BMW and Audi combined had 9 driver fatalities in nearly 900,000 vehicle years? Clearly, 11 Tesla driver fatalities in 265,000 vehicle years is not a good start. But even those numbers likely understate the danger of driving a Tesla. We believe it is nearly certain there are other fatalities not discovered in our search. Many fatal accident reports in local media don’t bother to mention the make of the car(s) involved and NHTSA-FARS reporting of Tesla fatalities seems to have significant data entry errors due to the unusual make/model coding for Tesla. It’s nonsensical that Tesla fatalities dropped from four to zero in California for the last 13 months of the data, while the number of Tesla vehicles on the road increased dramatically and fatalities ex-California ramped dramatically as well — especially when we consider that only one of the four California fatalities in the early part of our data series was actually entered correctly in their state database. Internationally, many accidents are not reported by English-language media or do not contain the make of the car involved, so there’s likely some missing data there as well. We interviewed @ElonBachman, who believes “[there is a] 0 percent chance I have all of the [fatalities]. There’s one on there that someone sent me because even though it doesn’t say Tesla in the article, they watched the video and saw it’s a Tesla; that sort of thing. Another was sent to me by a personal injury lawyer, etc. [I’m] probably missing a ton in China.” The fatality we found that wasn’t previously reported, NHTSA case 17–964, occurred the day before Thanksgiving 2016 in Winnebago County, Illinois. A single-occupant crash which caused the death of Dr. Kevin Gander, it received little media coverage, and none mentioning the make of the car. The crash scene was dark, and the car was so badly damaged that the first policeman on scene told the dispatcher the car was “like a Chrysler 200.” It was a 2012 Model S, with special Illinois electric vehicle license plate 1375 EL. http://www.rrstar.com/news/20161124/osf-family-physican-dies-in-high-speed-crash Even without making any adjustment whatsoever for missing fatality data, Tesla drivers are much more likely to die than their peers driving other luxury cars. Eleven deaths in 265,290 vehicle-years is a stunningly high driver fatality rate of 41.46. That’s quadruple the rate of Audi and BMW, and more than triple the rate of all luxury cars combined. Tesla’s driver mortality rate of 41 per million vehicle years compares extremely unfavorably with the luxury car average of 13 per million and the German luxury car rate of 11 per million. The extended bars on the chart represent 95% confidence intervals. Tesla’s mortality rate (41 deaths per million vehicle years) is so much higher than the average luxury car (13 deaths per million vehicle years) that when comparing the two, the difference is hugely statistically significant. The difference is 28 additional deaths per million vehicle years, with a confidence interval of 11 to 63, and a p-value of 0.0001. Remember that, unless California Tesla driver deaths magically went to zero in 2016 as Tesla increased production, and unless there were zero unreported deaths in the rest of the world, the true value for Tesla’s fatality rate is likely even higher. Regardless, Musk’s assertions that Tesla is the “safest vehicle” on the road or “four times better than average” are ridiculous untruths. Tesla’s driver fatality rate was massively higher than luxury peers, and at least 37% higher than the average 2011–2014 car. Musk’s “safest vehicle” on the road claim is as phony as his 2016 solar neighborhood. Lest anyone believe that because we are short Tesla shares, our analysis somehow doesn’t matter, it’s important to note that we are short Tesla precisely because of our open-minded analysis of the stock’s prospects. We are a long-biased fund, meaning we own more shares of businesses than we are short. We could have have had a long position or no position in Tesla, but we are short because Elon Musk makes a lot of promises he doesn’t keep, because Tesla, though fun to drive, has more than its fair share of quality issues, because profitable manufacturing of a $35,000 Model 3 is almost certainly a fiction, and because demand at realistic price points is dramatically lower than the 400,000 cars or $29 billion of revenue that analysts project for next year. Personally, I would have loved to see Tesla produce an extremely safe, high-quality, affordable Model 3. We’d have covered our small short position in a flash, instead of increasing it.

(AP) — The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 7 p.m. Authorities say there has been one more fatality in the Camp wildfire, bringing the death toll from it to 84. They also say the fire is 95 percent contained. The blaze that started Nov. 8 leveled Paradise, destroying more than 13,000 homes. The Butte County Sheriff's Office says more than 560 names remain on the missing list. Authorities stressed that many of the people on the list may be safe and unaware they have been reported missing. Paradise is about 140 miles north of San Francisco ___ 12:15 p.m. People who lost their homes in the deadly fire that destroyed Paradise are filling their plates with turkey and pie at a community Thanksgiving meal. Patty Rough says she and her husband Chuck would normally host their family at their home in Paradise. But on Thursday, she instead gathered her son, daughter, future son-in-law and two grandchildren at California State University, Chico, where 15,000 meals were being served. Rough teared up as she called the holiday ""bittersweet."" Eduardo Garcia was also enjoying a warm meal. The construction worker says he helped build the campus auditorium where the meals were provided. The home he shared with a friend burned down and he says he's trying to ""give it a good face instead of being sad."" ___ 11:15 a.m. Rain is hampering teams searching for remains of people in rubble left by the devastating fire that destroyed Paradise. Richard Ventura of Orange County's FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team said Thursday the rainy, windy, cold conditions are making the search process ""miserable."" His team has 27 people involved in the effort. Ventura says the rain ""clumps things together"" while making the terrain soggy and harder for workers to see and move. Ventura says the workers are soaking wet and trying to keep their socks dry to avoid hypothermia. The Orange County team is one of eight FEMA response teams in California that assists with disaster recovery. ___ 9:30 a.m. Fire officials say rain is helping the fight against the deadliest blaze in California in the past century. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Thursday the fire that leveled Paradise is 90 percent contained two weeks after it started. The blaze was 80 percent contained Wednesday before the first of three storm systems arrived in the area where at least 83 people died in the fire. The first storm has moved on and another is expected later Thursday, raising concerns about mudslides and other problems. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea says more than 800 people will search the rubble for human remains on Thanksgiving. Thousands of people displaced by the blaze will spend the holiday with family in the area or with strangers who open their homes for dinners put together by nonprofit groups. ___ 12:10 a.m. Thousands of residents who lost their homes or their loved ones in a Northern California wildfire will spend Thanksgiving in unexpected situations and with unfamiliar faces.

David Cyranoski,"An emerging virus in East Asia gets transmitted to people by the tick﻿ Haemaphysalis longicornis. Credit: Aukid/iStock/Getty Infectious-disease experts in East Asia are preparing for this year’s wave of a lethal tick-borne virus. The virus causes a disease called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which has affected a rapidly growing number of people since it emerged nearly a decade ago. Scientists in the region say they are worried by the rising incidence of the disease, and by signs that the virus can spread more easily than previously thought. In March, Japan launched the first clinical trial of a drug to treat the disease, and some researchers say that governments should devote more resources to raising awareness and studying the virus. ""It is our responsibility to come up with an effective treatment,” says Masayuki Saijo, a virologist at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, who helped to launch the trial. Cases of SFTS were first reported in China in 2009 1. Researchers identified the virus responsible in blood samples from a cluster of people who shared a combination of symptoms that included high fever, gastrointestinal problems, low white blood cell count and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). The virus killed 30% of those infected in China that year 1. It was even more lethal when the first cases appeared in Japan and South Korea in 2013. More than one-third of those infected in Japan and nearly half of those infected in South Korea died that year. And the number of cases in each country has risen sharply. In 2013, there were 36 reported cases in South Korea, but by 2017 the number had jumped to 270. In 2010, China reported 71 cases; in 2016, there were around 2,600. Japan experienced a 50% increase between 2016 and 2017. Improved prognosis All﻿ three countries implemented measures aimed at educating local physicians and citizens in endemic areas about the risks of tick bites. Those infected now fare much better. In China, only around 3% of peop﻿le infected died in 2016, and in Japan the number fell to 8%. In South Korea, the figure dropped from 47% in 2013 to 20% in 2017. Scientists credit the reduced fatality to earlier recognition and better general treatment — although no cure exists — and to the likelihood that wider surveillance has led them to recognize mild as well as severe cases. The SFTS virus is not expected to evolve into a rapidly transmitted disease like Ebola. And those infected are generally limited to people, such as farmers or hunters, who come into contact with the animals that carry Haemaphysalis longicornis, the tick that harbours the virus. But many say that the virus’s toll and potential threat have been under appreciated. Those infected have a better prognosis, but the virus still kills a higher percentage than any other infectious disease in South Korea, says Keun-Hwa Lee, a microbiologist at Jeju National University in South Korea. And the higher number of infections means that the disease claims more than 100 lives globally each year. Many animals, including goats, cattle, sheep and deer, expose humans to the ticks, and are often infected without showing symptoms. Current efforts that focus on known endemic areas could fail, says Bao Chang-jun, a biostatistician at Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Nanjing. The course of the epidemic ""may change with human activities and climate change,” say Bao. “It’s necessary to conduct research on potential risk areas.” Two reports from Japanese health officials last year caused particular alarm. One stated that a woman had likely been fatally infected through a cat bite, and the other that a man had been infected by his dog. ""To the warnings of previous years, we have to add the risk of touching sick domestic animals,” says Kazunori Oishi, director of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center in Tokyo. Clinical trial Last month, Japan began a clinical trial of an influenza drug, favipiravir, that was used to treat Ebola during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. The drug is effective on viruses with a certain molecular structure that Ebola and SFTS share, says Saijo. Although the number of cases has risen sharply, scientists can’t say whether the increase is due to heightened surveillance and awareness, a real growth in the number of ticks and the animals that carry them, or an increase in risk as humans encroach on areas where the disease is endemic. Shigeru Morikawa, director of the department of veterinary science at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, says that some researchers suspect the number of ticks has increased because fewer people hunt wild animals in Japan now, and this has allowed deer and boar populations to surge. Researchers say they have many questions about the virus and how it spreads, but they are concerned that the chances to study the disease will go up soon,﻿ as warm weather returns and people flock to the outdoors, where they come in contact with the ticks. “There will be more cases,” says Hideki Hasegawa, a pathologist at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. “The season is just beginning.”",Rapid rise in number of infections and high fatality rate concern researchers.,2018-04-13T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",East Asia braces for surge in deadly tick-borne virus,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04486-6?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04486-6/d41586-018-04486-6_15632296.jpg,,Nature.com,fatality,1
Reuters,"A policeman stands guard in front of a China Southern Airlines plane as the plane of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama departs from Chengdu airport, Sichuan province, March 26, 2014. REUTERS/Petar Kujundzic Petar Kudjundzic/Reuters A Sichuan Airlines flight made an emergency landing in the southwest Chinese city of Chengdu on Monday after a windshield on the right side of the jet's cockpit broke off, China's aviation authority said. No passengers were injured in the incident but the pilot sitting in the right seat, who is usually the first officer, suffered scratches and a waist sprain, the Civil Aviation Administration of China's (CAAC) Southwest Regional Administration said on its website. A cabin crew member was also injured in the descent, it added, without providing details on what had caused the windshield to break off. The flight, Sichuan Airlines 3U8633, left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday morning and was bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, the authority said. According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, the aircraft was an Airbus A319. A spokeswoman for Airbus said that the planemaker would provide all necessary support upon request by the CAAC and Sichuan Airlines. Sichuan Airlines said on its official Weibo account that the flight had experienced a ""mechanical failure"" without providing further details. It said it had switched the flight's passengers to another aircraft to carry on their journey to Lhasa. Pictures published by government-run Chengdu Economic Daily showed the plane missing one of its cockpit windows and damage to its cockpit controls. Chinese social media users praised the pilots for landing the flight safely without incurring any passenger injuries. Sichuan Airlines, a regional airline headquartered in Chengdu, operates mostly domestic flights but also flies internationally to countries such as Japan, Canada, and the Czech Republic. Incidents involving cracked windshields do happen on a regular basis due to occurrences such as bird or lightning strikes but ones involving entire windshields coming off are rare. In 1990, one of the pilots on British Airways Flight 5390 was blown partially out of the cabin window after its windshield blew out at 23,000 feet. He survived the incident, which occurred on a BAC-111 jet. An engine on a Southwest 737 in April ripped apart in flight and shattered a cabin window, killing a female passenger in the first U.S. airline passenger fatality since 2009. On May 3, another Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing after a cabin window pane cracked in flight.

Amy Lieu,"A shooting at a high school football game in Jacksonville, Fla., on Friday night left one person dead and two injured, officials said. The shooting happened about 10 p.m. ET, 15 minutes after the game ended at Raines High School, where about 4,000 spectators attended, the Florida Times Union reported, citing Jacksonville authorities. About three-quarters of the crowd was gone by the time the gunfire started, the newspaper reported. Authorities said they had one suspect in custody. “The best information we have so far is that we have a single black male shooter, and we are working to get a more refined description,” Jacksonville Sheriff's Office director Ron Lendvay said, according to the report. During the game some disturbances and fights took place among the spectators, but Lendvay said it was too soon to determine if those confrontations were related to the shooting. “It was a great game, and for it to end in violence like this is just unfortunate, and quite frankly, we should all be saying unacceptable.” - School Superintendent Diana Greene The stadium for the Raines-versus-Lee High School game was placed on lockdown as security personnel worked to keep the remaining fans and players safe, Jacksonville's WJXT-TV reported. The victims' names were not released. The fatality was reportedly a young adult male and the injured people were teeangers, one boy and one girl, police said. “It is shocking. I was actually here, at the game,” Superintendent Diana Greene told the Times Union. “It was a great game and for it to end in violence like this is just unfortunate, and quite frankly, we should all be saying unacceptable.” The superintendent said everyone coming into the game had to undergo a magnetic detector wand search and that security inside the game area was tight. ""This is a community issue,"" Greene said. ""I need parents, students to stand up. If you see something, say something."" ""This is evidence that there is a community issue that has to be addressed, and one of those issues includes access to guns,"" Paula Wright, a school board member, told the paper.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In news that’s become all too common, a massive wildfire swept into a California city overnight. Hundred-foot walls of flames and traffic jams created a nightmare scenario in and around Redding, California, a city of 90,000. Neighborhoods and even entire surrounding towns have been evacuated, including a news station that stayed on the air until they were force to leave mid-broadcast. In their update late last night, CAL FIRE said that the hard work of nearly 1,750 firefighters couldn’t contain the flames due to “extreme fire behavior and unfavorable weather conditions.” As of midnight, the fire ballooned 50 percent overnight to 44,450 acres and was only three percent contained. “This fire is extremely dangerous and moving with no regard to what’s in its path,” CAL FIRE Chief Brett Gouvea said at a news conference late last night. Up until Thursday, most of the damage played out west of Redding, with the Sacramento River acting as a buffer between the city and the flames. Residents there have seen signs of the fire for days as it whipped up smoke and towering pyrocumulus clouds, as well as news reports of its trail of destruction. But on Thursday night, the fire jumped the river, sparking an evacuation of the neighborhoods on the western edge of town that caused bumper-to-bumper traffic. Around 2:30 a.m. local time, CAL FIRE also issued a mandatory evacuation for Shasta Lake City, a town of 9,000 on the northern edge of Redding. As fire started to rampage through the neighborhoods, firefighters stopped their containment efforts and began doing everything they could to get residents to safety. Local news report indicate that entire neighborhoods were ablaze. CAL FIRE is reporting that only 15 structures have been destroyed and another five have been damaged, but those numbers will surely rise as the sun comes up on the Redding area and firefighters begin to assess the damage. There has also been at least one fatality (a bulldozer operator who was working to contain the fire). That number that may unfortunately rise given the speed with which the fire tore into town. KRCR, the local NBC affiliate, was in one of the mandatory evacuation zones. Visibly uneasy anchors signed off, saying “we are going to leave the station because it is now unsafe to be here” as they cut to the station’s webcam showing the quintessential suburban view of street lights and trees lit by the bright glow of fire burning in the night. A scorching heat wave has helped create such dangerous conditions. Temperatures reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit in Redding yesterday and are forecast stay above 110 degrees Fahrenheit all weekend. The 10-day forecast shows 100+ degree Fahrenheit heat is likely to continue throughout next week. The heat, coupled with the moderate drought gripping the western portion of Shasta County, is a potent combination. But the fire has burned so intensely that it also appears to have created its own weather, as the heat from the flames rises and stirs the atmosphere. Towering pyrocumulus clouds, basically fire-driven thunderstorms, were clearly visible on satellite images during the day. The powerful winds that come along with those clouds likely spurred the Carr Fire on over dried-out brush and forest. The fire is one of three large blazes that have lit up California. The Cranston Fire continues to burn largely out of control about 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles, while the Ferguson Fire forced Yosemite National Park to evacuate visitors for the first time in decades. They come a year after the state had both its most destructive and largest wildfires ever recorded. The major blazes are a reminder that we’re living in a changed climate that’s increasing the odds of wildfire conditions. Wildfire season in the West is now 105 days longer than it was in the 1970s, and large fires are becoming more common, according to research by Climate Central (full disclosure: I used to work there). Climate change is responsible for half of the uptick in fires from 1984 to 2015, according to a 2016 study. In California in particular, recent research shows that precipitation in spring and fall—the shoulder seasons to California’s wet winter—is likely to dry up, further lengthening wildfire season. All this is happening as more people move into wildfire-prone areas, raising the risks of devastating consequences like the ones playing out in Redding. And it’s of course why we need to start preparing now for more intense urban fires.","In news that’s become all too common, a massive wildfire swept into a California city overnight.

Sasha Lekach,"The safety driver in a self-driving Uber was not being very safe — aka, not paying attention — when the vehicle in autonomous mode struck and killed a woman in an Arizona city earlier this year, police records show. Included in a massive Tempe Police Department report this week were details about the March 18 fatal crash. The 318-page report found that Rafaela Vasquez, the 44-year-old driver, was frequently looking down and even smiling and laughing at what appears to be a cellphone streaming an episode of the talent search show, The Voice. In the moments before the test vehicle hit 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was walking her bicycle across a Tempe, Arizona, road, the test driver, Vasquez, was apparently streaming the TV show through Hulu. A video of the moments before the crash shows Vasquez looking toward her right knee while occasionally looking up and around. SEE ALSO: People are losing faith in self-driving cars following recent fatal crashes Police seized Vasquez's two LG cellphones and found that YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu had been used on them. After search warrants were served, Hulu confirmed that the phone and account linked to Vasquez was streaming an episode of the show up until the time of the crash. Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report noted that the test driver said she'd been looking at the self-driving system interface before the crash. The NTSB also found that the vehicle didn't alert the driver about the pedestrian, even after sensors detected Herzberg six seconds before impact. The car didn't automatically brake or slow down after detecting the pedestrian. Vasquez manually hit the brakes after hitting the woman. With this week's release of police data, Uber responded with a statement about its own internal review and strict rules about phone usage during testing. The Uber self-driving program was suspended after the fatality and the Arizona program shut down. Autonomous testing is expected to resume in other cities in the coming months. “We continue to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations while conducting our own internal safety review. We have a strict policy prohibiting mobile device usage for anyone operating our self-driving vehicles. We plan to share more on the changes we’ll make to our program soon,” an Uber spokesperson said in an email. Other information, including post-crash photos of the damaged Uber and the red bicycle Herzberg was walking, were included in the report, along with audio clips of 911 calls from Vasquez and bystanders, and police officer video footage once emergency crews arrived at the crash site. A photo from the police report show's the self-driving Uber's front-end damage after the fatal crash. Image: tempe police department We've seen this before — drivers using semi-autonomous or nearly autonomous features in cars start looking away from the road, going on their phones, and watching much more entertaining things like TV shows and movies. A fatal Tesla crash in Florida may have involved the driver watching a Harry Potter movie on a portable DVD player while the car's Autopilot mode was engaged. It's the same situation: the driver thinks the car's got this because they've repeatedly seen the car handle the road without them. In the Uber crash, the car was in autonomous mode for 19 minutes before hitting the pedestrian. Experts and researchers know that humans get bored and lose focus once machines start taking over most of the work. Cody Fleming, assistant professor of systems engineering at the University of Virginia, told me in a conversation about autonomous vehicle levels — Level 0 means no vehicle automation with the driver fully in control; Level 5 is the highest, with the car able to drive itself in any situation and condition — that humans don't do well with boredom. That's precisely what happens when the autonomous vehicle takes over the main parts of driving. Suddenly you have to ""come online"" in a critical situation — instantaneously. ""Imagine that the first thing when you wake up in the morning is you have to make a safety critical decision,"" Fleming offered as a comparison. The handoff between robot and human responsibility isn't ever as smooth as it theoretically could be. That's because humans aren't robots. It's very difficult to go from barely-aware-of-the-cars-around-you to alert and focused, making split-second decisions to brake or slow down. That's why Waymo, Google's self-driving car company, has sped ahead. They've left behind those murky, semi-autonomous levels with a driver at the ready (while the car performs basic functions on its own) and moved to fully driverless cars. Waymo is leap-frogging the stages where human intervention is needed at the drop of a hat. It just doesn't work well enough. Either the human needs to be in charge — or the robot.","The safety driver in a self-driving Uber was not being very safe — aka, not paying attention — when the vehicle in autonomous mode struck and killed a woman in an Arizona city earlier this year, police records show.

Jamie Ducharme,"Passengers aboard the Southwest Airlines flight forced to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia on Tuesday are calling pilot Tammie Jo Shults a hero and an “angel.” Shults, who reportedly became one of the Navy’s first female fighter pilots in the 1980s, sprung into action when her Boeing 737-700 jet blew an engine during a Tuesday flight from New York to Dallas. One passenger died in the explosion — and another was nearly sucked out of a window that had been broken by shrapnel — but Shults’ emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport guided the remaining 148 people aboard to safety. “God sent his angels to watch over us,” passenger Amanda Bourman posted on Instagram. Prior to Tuesday’s incident, a U.S. airline had not seen a passenger fatality caused by an accident in nine years. The incident also marked Southwest’s first-ever in-flight death caused by an accident. While Southwest has not released the identities of the crew, passengers identified Shults, 56, as the pilot, according to Reuters. Some, including Bourman, praised her by name on social media. Shults, who dreamed of flying from a young age, became a Navy instructor after her career as a fighter pilot, Reuters reports.

Sean Captain,"The first fatality involving an autonomous car shocked the industry this week–even though we still don’t know exactly how it happened. And if the self-driving Uber car that stuck and killed pedestrian Elaine Herzberg in Tempe, Arizona, was not at fault (she wasn’t using the crosswalk), car companies can largely avoid such accidents by doing a lot more rigorous training in virtual environments before hitting the road. So says Danny Lange, who developed the machine-learning AI platform that Uber uses across its operations, including in its self-driving car division. Lange left Uber in December 2016 to become VP of AI and machine learning at game engine maker Unity. In a conversation with Fast Company, Lange says he couldn’t comment on the accident in Tempe, since he has no inside knowledge on the circumstances, but one lesson is clear. “I think personally that there’s too much emphasis on getting cars out on the real street–over, let’s drive billions of miles in a simulated environment,” he says. It’s not that autonomous carmakers aren’t doing simulations. Most or even all of them are using game engines such as Unity or Unreal to run the car AI systems though complex environments. (Imagine if your driving instructor took you to Grand Theft Auto’s Vice City.) “My point is they probably started a little late, and they’re probably not doing enough of it,” says Lange. Automakers freely acknowledge that they can’t cover nearly as much mileage in real life as they can in virtual environments. But not only are road miles limited, much of that time is useless, says Lange. “When an Uber vehicle drives down the road, 98 to 99 percent of the data is irrelevant,” he says, “because it’s really just following the car in front of it.” Real-life driving just isn’t all that dangerous, which is fortunate for us humans, but not much help for robots that are trying to learn. In a virtual environment, an AI driver could be bombarded with darting pedestrians, running dogs, falling trees, cars going the wrong way–anything imaginable. “You can experience the most adversarial situations, and not a single human life would be endangered,” says Lange. Real-life training and testing is still needed, but simulations could make the AI into much better drivers before they face life-and-death situations. Related: Machine Learning Is Making Video Game Characters Smarter And Robots More Competent It wouldn’t just be up to humans to imagine virtual testing scenarios. Lange points to recent improvements in adversarial network and reinforcement learning AI. “Imagine taking machine learning to the next level, where you use machine learning to generate those episodes of traffic that challenge the self-driving car,” says Lange. The two AIs would battle it out, one throwing every possible obstacle in the way of the car, and the other trying to steer the car around them. Reinforcement learning rewards the mayhem-creating AI whenever it causes an accident, encouraging it to dream up ever more harrowing scenarios. But such training also encourages the driver AI to become ever more nimble at avoiding accidents. There’s already precedent for such large-scale systems, says Lange. Last year, Google’s AlphaGo Zero system (the successor to AlphaGo) mastered the ancient Chinese game of Go in three days, learning as much as humans had needed thousands of years to do. With massive cloud-computing resources, that’s a pretty doable scenario. It would be possible, says Lange, to reserve servers on Amazon’s AWS cloud service to run 100,000 driving simulations at the same time, at four times the speed of real life. “If you really do this at scale, you can end up driving more than humanity ever has driven,” he says. Even the best driver imaginable is still subject to physics, though. A car of a certain weight, traveling at a certain speed, with certain brakes, needs a certain amount of time and distance to stop. Sometimes that’s just not soon enough. “I don’t know anything about the specific case,” says Lange about this week’s accident. “But I can imagine situations, and we did try that at Uber, where there is absolutely nothing that the vehicle can do.”","Using video game engines, car AI can get better than any human by driving billions of miles through the most harrowing conditions imaginable.

Minwoo Park,"ILSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - A city in South Korea, which has the world’s highest smartphone penetration rate, has installed flickering lights and laser beams at a road crossing to warn “smartphone zombies” to look up and drivers to slow down, in the hope of preventing accidents. 
The designers of the system were prompted by growing worry that more pedestrians glued to their phones will become casualties in a country that already has some of the highest road fatality and injury rates among developed countries. 
State-run Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (KICT) believes its system of flickering lights at zebra crossings can warn both pedestrians and drivers. 
In addition to red, yellow and blue LED lights on the pavement, “smombies” - smartphone zombies - will be warned by laser beam projected from power poles and an alert sent to the phones by an app that they are about to step into traffic. 
“Increasing number of smombie accidents have occurred in pedestrian crossings, so these zombie lights are essential to prevent these pedestrian accidents,” said KICT senior researcher Kim Jong-hoon. 
The multi-dimensional warning system is operated by radar sensors and thermal cameras and comes with a price tag of 15 million won ($13,250) per crossing. 
Drivers are alerted by the flashing lights, which have shown to be effective 83.4 percent of the time in the institute’s tests involving about 1,000 vehicles. 
In 2017, more than 1,600 pedestrians were killed in auto related accidents, which is about 40 percent of total traffic fatalities, according to data from the Traffic Accident Analysis System. 
South Korea has the world’s highest smartphone penetration rate, according to Pew Research Center, with about 94 percent of adults owning the devices in 2017, compared with 77 percent in the United States and 59 percent in Japan. 
For now, the smombie warning system is installed only in Ilsan, a suburban city about 30 km northwest of the capital, Seoul, but is expected to go nationwide, according to the institute. 
Kim Dan-hee, a 23-year-old resident of Ilsan, welcomed the system, saying she was often too engrossed in her phone to remember to look at traffic. 
“This flickering light makes me feel safe as it makes me look around again, and I hope that we can have more of these in town,” she said.

Russ Mitchell,"A woman walking across an Arizona road was hit and killed by a self-driving car from Uber Technologies Inc. on Sunday — probably the first pedestrian fatality for the fast-growing movement toward driverless vehicles. Tempe police said Elaine Herzberg, 49, was struck by an Uber test vehicle operating in autonomous mode. In response, Uber halted its driverless operations in San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Toronto and the Phoenix area and said it is assisting in the investigation. ""Our hearts go out to the victim's family,"" the company said in a statement. The death is likely to slow the deployment of driverless vehicles in Arizona, one of the most welcoming states for the industry, and elsewhere as policymakers monitor the investigation and assess public reaction. Driverless vehicle regulations have been passed by the U.S. House of Representative but are stalled in the Senate over safety concerns. ""This is going to focus a lot of attention on how companies are approaching their systems, their technologies, and their management of tragedies,"" said Bryant Walker Smith, a driverless vehicle expert at the University of South Carolina School of Law. John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog in Santa Monica, a longtime critic of liberal driverless vehicle regulations, called for a national moratorium on robot car testing on public roads until the accident is analyzed. ""Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place,"" Simpson said in a statement. ""That's why Uber and Waymo test there. When there's no sheriff in town, people get killed."" Arizona has few laws restricting the use of driverless vehicles. It doesn't require remote operators for the vehicles, for instance, and allows driverless trucks on the road. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey greeted Uber to his state with great enthusiasm in late 2016. At the time, California's Department of Motor Vehicles had just revoked Uber car registrations after the company refused to apply for required state permits for its driverless cars. Uber loaded its driverless-equipped Volvos onto trailer trucks bound for Arizona. ""Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide-open roads. While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses,"" Ducey said at the time. On Monday, the governor's office expressed condolences for Herzberg's family and said ""public safety is our top priority."" In February, California issued a set of revised regulations that will allow robot cars with no human driver to operate on public roads through a permit systems that begins April 2. The regulations also pave the way for driverless ride-hailing companies to begin picking up paying passengers. In a prepared statement Monday, the California DMV said it ""takes the safe operation of our autonomous vehicle permit holders very seriously. We are aware of the Uber crash in Arizona, but we have not been briefed on the details of the crash at this time. We plan to follow up with Uber to get more information."" As self-driving cars roll out in pilot programs around the world, the chance of a pedestrian death has become more likely. Experts have wondered what effect deadly crashes would have on the industry. ""We're within the phase of autonomous vehicles where we're still learning how good they are. Whenever you release a new technology, there's a whole bunch of unanticipated situations,"" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's business school. Driverless cars are supposed to eliminate some of the risks of human error, particularly because their sensors are always paying attention to their surroundings. They don't drink, do drugs, check text messages, get tired or get distracted by misbehaving children. Annual traffic fatalities in the U.S. are fast approaching 40,000, with driver error to blame in more than 90% of them. But there isn't enough experience with driverless vehicles yet to know all their weaknesses and whether they're safer than human drivers and if so by how much. Nidhi Kalra, co-director of the Center for Decision Making Under Uncertainty at the research group Rand Corp., recently told The Times that robot cars have proved less likely to get into minor crashes than human drivers. But ""when it comes to injuries and fatalities, we won't be able to know until we've had hundreds of millions or billions of miles"" of driving history. Whether policymakers allow enough robot cars on the road to accumulate that kind of experience depends in part on how Uber and other driverless vehicle companies handle fatalities, Smith said. ""Today there are going to be 100 people who are going to die on the roads in the United States, principally caused by human error,"" he said. The general public is ""going to connect with the issue through stories, not through hard evidence."" Uber's prime ride-hailing competitor in the U.S., Lyft, has said it plans to seek permits to operate robot taxis in San Francisco, although no date has been set. Lyft did not return requests for comment on Sunday's fatality. Waymo, the driverless vehicle technology arm of Google's Alphabet, in January received permits to begin offering robot taxi service in Arizona. Waymo has been running driverless vehicle tests in and around Phoenix for months and had planned to begin a full-scale robot taxi service within the next several weeks. Waymo did not respond to a request for comment. Uber has had minor incidents in the past. A self-driving Uber car ran a red light in San Francisco while the company operated in the city without regulatory approval. The California DMV eventually forced Uber to pull the cars from the road. The most widely reported fatality involving self-drive technology occurred in 2016, when a man driving a Tesla Model S in Florida was decapitated when his Autopilot system failed to detect a semi-truck crossing in front of it. Tesla's Autopilot system, however, is not yet considered fully driverless. After the Florida crash, the company updated Autopilot to shorten the time a driver could go hands-free before grabbing the steering wheel again. Tesla plans to issue software to enable driverless operation later this year. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The National Transportation Safety Board is opening an investigation into the Uber death and is sending a small team of investigators to Tempe, spokesman Eric Weiss said.

Alana Abramson,"A climber died after falling at least 700 feet on Oregon’s Mount Hood Tuesday, and seven others who were stranded have been rescued and are making their way down the mountain ahead of frigid weather at nightfall, according to authorities with the Clackamas County Sheriff’s office. “Our search and rescue partners are still up on the mountain working to reach the other approximate seven people that are still hunkered down, still on the mountain,” Sergeant Brian Jensen told the media Tuesday afternoon. The immediate Tuesday night forecast for Mount Hood, according to the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration, is 18 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind chill factor of -1 and a high chance of snow. “We are fighting against time as the heavy weather is supposed to be rolling in this evening, and they are trying to get there as quickly and safely as possible to get the folks out,” Jensen said. The climber who died was airlifted from via helicopter the mountain earlier Tuesday afternoon, but was pronounced dead on arrival upon reaching the hospital. Authorities have not released the identity. Jensen said one of the climbers who is still stranded was injured, but the injury is not believed to be life threatening. He did not know how close the rescuers were to the climbers, but noted that conditions on the mountain were “treacherous.” Helicopters have not been deployed to airlift the remaining climbers who were stranded, he said. Earlier on Tuesday, the Clackamas County Sheriff’s office said one group of four hikers was stranded, one of the climbers had been injured, and another climber had fallen. According to data compiled by The Oregonian, there have been at least 100 fatalities on Mount Hood since 1883.

Joel Stocksdale,"While it may seem a bit obvious to most of us that teen drivers driving around with teen passengers is a more dangerous proposition than them driving solo or with parents, what's not as obvious is how huge a difference that really makes. AAA conducted a study of traffic collisions involving teen drivers, and the organization discovered that the rate of fatal injuries increased by a whopping 51 percent when the teen driver had teenage passengers versus when teen drivers were driving solo. Even more shocking, that fatality rate was an increase for all people involved, including the teenage occupants, occupants in other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. Breaking down that overall 51 percent rating, we find that the people most at risk of teens driving with teens are other motorists, who are 56 percent more likely to be killed than if they were hit by a solo teen. The teen driver is 45 percent more likely to be killed, and pedestrians and cyclists are 17 percent more likely to be killed. Furthermore, the AAA study discovered that the fatality rate in teen collisions increases by a factor of nearly four when at night or when speeding is a factor. AAA does suggest a number of ways to help prevent teen drivers from being in these risky situations. The main key is to just keep your teen from driving with other teenage drivers for as long as possible. The organization recommends getting at least 100 hours of driving time with a parent onboard before letting a teen drive solo, and not having more than one teen as a passenger for at least 6 months. As it so happens, many states have requirements similar to these recommendations as part of getting a driver's permit or license. Further incentive for keeping only experienced drivers in the passenger seat early on is that AAA found the fatality rate in collisions drops 8 percent when there's a passenger over 35 instead of a teen driving solo. And of course, AAA recommends spending lots of time practicing driving with your teenage driver, starting with easy situations to get used to the car, and gradually ramping up.

Nate Raymond,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Thursday asked an appellate court to overturn his conviction and death penalty sentence for helping carry out the 2013 attack, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. 
Lawyers for Tsarnaev, 25, argued in a brief filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston that a lower-court judge’s refusal to move the case to another city not traumatized by the bombings deprived him of a fair trial. 
Lawyers for Tsarnaev acknowledged that their client along with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, carried out the attack. But they argued that wall-to-wall media coverage of the bombings meant that nearly the entire jury pool was exposed to news about the attacks, which included “heart-wrenching stories about the homicide victims, the wounded and their families.” 
“The pre-trial publicity was damning: the more a prospective juror had seen, the more likely she was to believe that Tsarnaev was guilty and deserved the death penalty,” Tsarnaev’s lawyers wrote in a 500-page brief. 
The appeal came after a federal jury in 2015 found Tsarnaev guilty of placing a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the world-renowned race on April 15, 2013, as well as fatally shooting a policeman three days later. 
The same jury later found that Tsarnaev deserved execution for six of the 17 capital charges of which he was found guilty, which were related to the bomb he personally placed at the marathon’s finish line. 
That bomb killed 8-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest fatality, and 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu. The bombing was one of the highest-profile attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. 
Tsarnaev’s attorneys admitted his involvement in the attack from the start of his trial, but argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, was a junior partner in a scheme hatched and run by his older brother. 
The brother, Tamerlan, who was 26 at the time, died after a gunfight with police four days after the bombing, which ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ran him over with a stolen car.

Jonathan M. Gitlin,"reader comments 2 Does Tesla's Autopilot software have something against the emergency services? That's a flippant question, but there's something underneath it. On Tuesday, a Model S electric vehicle—with Autopilot engaged, according to the driver —crashed into a police car in Laguna Beach, California. The police car was unoccupied at the time, but the Tesla driver sustained minor injuries. Last month, another Model S, also under Autopilot, slammed into the back of a stationary fire truck in South Jordan, Utah, resulting in a broken ankle for the Tesla driver. And in January, a third Autopiloted Model S plowed into the back of another fire engine, this time in Culver City, California. Probably best to forget the conspiracy theories though. It's not some bug with Autopilot's sensors and flashing lights—more like inattentive drivers who should be paying attention to the road. As we learned last year, automatic emergency braking is only trained to work in a relatively narrow set of cases, typically a moving vehicle directly ahead of the car. So a stationary emergency vehicle on the shoulder of the road, particularly one at an angle, might not get classified properly and trigger the function. It has been a rough couple of weeks for Autopilot. The suite of advanced driver assistance systems, which includes adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, has also been blamed for destroying a Model 3 in Greece last week. In this case, the facts are even murkier—the car was on an unsupported road trip at the time, and Tesla had warned the owner this before he set off. ""While we appreciate You You Xue's effort to spread the word about Model 3, he was informed that Tesla does not yet have a presence in Eastern Europe and that there is no connectivity or service available for vehicles there,"" a Tesla spokesperson told Ars. ""In addition, Model 3 has not yet been approved and homologated for driving outside of the U.S. and Canada. Although we haven’t been able to retrieve any data from the vehicle given that the accident occurred in an unsupported area, Tesla has always been clear that the driver must remain responsible for the car at all times when using Autopilot. We’re sorry to hear that this accident occurred, and we’re glad You You is safe."" Last week also saw Tesla settle a class-action lawsuit, filed last year by owners claiming the company misrepresented the capabilities of Enhanced Autopilot, a $5,000 option on the EVs. One has to feel some sympathy for Tesla, for it is often their most loyal ""superusers"" who keep getting them into trouble by pushing the bounds of the system—familiarity breeds contempt, and all that. Once again I feel the need to stress the following: Autopilot is not a self-driving system, and was never designed to allow the driver to cede situational awareness to the car. If you drive a Tesla and use Autopilot—or any car with adaptive cruise control—it's always your job to be paying attention to the road ahead. Are Tesla’s safety claims backed up by the data? It is reasonable to ask why crashes involving Teslas get covered when the overwhelming majority of the 40,000-odd road deaths in the US each year receive no such scrutiny. There are a couple of factors at play. The first is Autopilot, which through operational design allows cars to travel for long intervals without human interaction, or any form of driver monitoring beyond a torque sensor in the steering wheel. (By contrast, the industry standard for other adaptive cruise control and lane keeping systems is just 15 seconds hands-free before deactivation.) Hence, every time there is a crash involving a Tesla, the first question anyone asks is ""was Autopilot driving?"" Then there's the fact that Tesla itself repeatedly talks up the safety of its cars, thereby inviting media attention. At various times it has claimed they're either four times safer than average, or sometimes that they're the safest cars on the road. And it is true, Tesla EVs score very well in crash testing—even if IIHS did not include the Model S in among the three safest full-size sedans in 2017, nor either Model S or Model X in its list of top safety picks for 2018. But there's also reason to be skeptical of its claims. For instance, Tesla repeatedly cites a National Highway Transportation Safety Administration statistic that the introduction of Autosteer to Autopilot reduced crashes by 40 percent. But last month NHTSA told us that it was a ""cursory comparison"" and that the agency ""did not assess the effectiveness of this technology."" It's reasonable to expect that a luxury car like a Tesla would have a higher-than-average safety record, based both on owner demographics and the average age of the vehicles. On the other hand, the Model S did not appear on IIHS's list of 11 vehicles that recorded zero occupant deaths between 2012 and 2015, a list that included several other luxury cars and SUVs. And in just the past few weeks, there has been a spate of fatal Tesla crashes, both here in the US as well as Norway and Switzerland. ""In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident,"" Tesla told us. ""Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents—such a standard would be impossible—but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists."" (We should note that Autopilot is not believed to be a factor in any of the recent fatal crashes.) The Model S is now the most expensive car to insure Regardless of whether or not Autopilot is involved, the insurance industry—a dispassionate industry if ever there was one—has looked at the Model S and found it wanting. According to data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, analyzed by 24/7 Wall Street, the US' best-selling EV is also the nation's most expensive car to insure. The average annual insurance premium for a Model S sedan is now $1,789.48, with an average collision insurance claim of $1,310. Insurance for the next-most expensive car on the list—Mercedes-Benz's flagship S-Class sedan—will set you back $1,540.63, with an average collision claim of just $803.40. Last year, AAA raised rates on both Model S and Model X EVs, citing abnormally high claim frequencies and high costs of insurance claims compared to other luxury vehicles. Tesla was not pleased, and disputed AAA's claims, stating that its cars were not being compared appropriately. To combat the problem of sky-high insurance rates, Tesla has partnered with Liberty Mutual to underwrite insurance plans specifically for its EVs, and according to Electrek the company recently hired a former Liberty Mutual executive to run the InsureMyTesla program here in the US. A Tesla spokesperson told us that ""Tesla guarantees that there will always be an insurance provider that will charge less for a Model S or X than any other car with a similar driver, price and vehicle category,"" adding that the Model 3 is now also part of the scheme.",The high cost of repairs has made the Model S the most expensive car to insure.,2018-05-31T13:16:23Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Autopilot blamed for more crashes, Tesla insurance rates skyrocket",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/autopilot-blamed-for-more-crashes-tesla-insurance-rates-skyrocket/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tesla-crash-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,fatality,1
Madeline Farber,"A man in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, has died after he was bitten by a shark around noon local time on Saturday. The man, who has not yet been identified, was swimming off the coast of Newcomb Hollow Beach when “he was bitten by what is believed to be a shark,” the Wellfleet Police Department said in a statement posted to Facebook. WOMAN IN TEXAS CATCHES 8-FOOT 'DREAM' TIGER SHARK, WILD PHOTOS SHOW Emergency officials performed CPR on the victim, in his mid-20s, according to police. Shortly after, he was rushed to the Cape Cod Hospital by officials with Wellfleet Fire Department but succumbed to his injuries. The Wellfleet Police Department, which is working with the National Park Service and the State Police on the case, said it is withholding the man’s name until he is properly identified. “Further information will be released by the District Attorney’s Office,” the police department said.

Kieran Corcoran,"A composite image showing Lindsay Gottlieb with her son Jordan, and a stock image of a Southwest Airlines plane. AP Southwest Airlines has apologized to a woman for trying to stop her getting on a plane because they didn't believe that her mixed-race son was really hers. Lindsay Gottlieb, who coaches the University of California women's basketball team, was stopped by an airline employee at Denver airport on Sunday. She said that the employee asked her to ""prove"" that her one-year-old son, Jordan, really belongs to her. Gottlieb is white, and her fiancé, Patrick Martin, is black. Gottlieb had her son's passport. They don't have the same surname, but there is no rule which obliges airlines to make sure that guardians and children have the same name. Gottlieb said in a tweet that she suspects racism was behind the questioning. She wrote: ""I'm appalled that after approx 50 times flying with my 1 year old son, ticket counter personnel told me I had to 'prove' that he was my son, despite having his passport. She said because we have different last name. My guess is because he has a different skin color."" After she landed, she tweeted again about the incident, saying: ""It was wild, but, I fear, much more common for people that don't look like me."" Southwest apologized to Gottleib, and described the incident as a ""coaching opportunity"" for the employee. A statement said: ""We have reached out to Ms. Gottlieb directly to address her concerns and will utilize the situation as a coaching opportunity for our Employee. ""We apologize if our interaction made this family uncomfortable — that is never our intention."" Gottlieb gave a statement to the The Associated Press about the encounter, saying she felt it was her responsibility to highlight what was happening. She said: ""I hope the coverage this has received can serve as a learning opportunity and that all families — regardless of how 'traditional' they may or may not look — are treated with dignity and respect.""

Rachel England,"According to The Information, Robbie Miller, a manager in the testing-operations group, sent a cautionary email to a number of Uber's executive and lawyers, warning that the vehicles were ""routinely in accidents resulting in damage. This is usually the result of poor behavior of the operator or the AV technology."" It appears the email was prompted by an incident in Pittsburgh, where just a few days before Miller sent the message an Uber prototype swerved completely off the road and onto the sidewalk, where it continued to drive. According to Miller's email, the episode was ""essentially ignored"" for days, until Miller raised it with other managers. He also noted that towards the end of 2017, it took two weeks for engineers to investigate the logs of a separate Arizona incident, in which an Uber vehicle almost collided with another car. ""This is not how we should be operating,"" Miller wrote in the email, the assertions of which have been backed up by interviews with current and former Uber employees. Miller said the group has to ""work on establishing a culture rooted in safety,"" and offered a range of suggestions for improving matters, including reducing the size of the autonomous fleet, having multiple backup drivers per vehicle and giving authority to lower-level employees to shut down testing if they suspect the software is unsafe. According to a colleague of Miller's at Uber, none of the executives responded to the email, and Miller left the company three days after sending it. The Information reports that Uber has declined to comment on the email, but has released a more general statement that says, ""The entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in self-driving mode. We have every confidence in the work that the team is doing to get us there."" Indeed, the company has just hired a former National highway Traffic Safety Administration official for its autonomous vehicle team. Of course, with all eyes on the company given the incident that occurred in March, Uber must publicly demonstrate that it's taking steps to prevent a similar reoccurrence. But as Miller's email demonstrates, the company may have to improve how it handles allegedly limitations in its self-driving technology before expanding its tests wider.","Just days after Uber announced its plans to resume testing of its self-driving taxis, new information reveals that a whistleblower had made the company aware of the technology's safety failures before the incident in Arizona last March, which saw a p...",2018-12-11T12:22:00Z,"{'id': 'engadget', 'name': 'Engadget'}",Uber allegedly ignored safety warnings before self-driving fatality,https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/11/uber-ignored-safety-warnings-before-self-driving-fatal/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D2882%252C1896%252C1922%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1052%26image_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fs.yimg.com%252Fos%252Fcreatr-images%252F2018-12%252Fe9397560-fd2e-11e8-9bfc-87737c0e7132%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3Dcb132a2585291a83a69434ee98df5904ef8e11c9&client=amp-blogside-v2&signature=0a953acd2dcc8cd9764d22c784d30790a2a5cf2d,engadget,Engadget,fatality,1

Zack Zwiezen,"This weekend the newest DC superhero film, Shazam, was released. Critics enjoyed it. I liked it a lot too. Though while the action and jokes are strong in Shazam, there are some weird video game references that caught me off guard. 
To be very clear, I dont have screenshots of most this stuff because of the fact that movie just came out. But take my word for it! You can find these video game related things in Shazam! 
No specific spoilers below, but if you want to be surprised by what games are mentioned, stop now. 
A kid using a PS3 Sharpshooter and PS3 Move Controller as a weapon.
Someone shooting lighting out of their hands and yelling Hadouken!!
A scene where Shazam and his friend play Mortal Kombat X. 
Some hacker referencing all the hours of Watch Dogs theyve played. 
After a finisher, a character yells out Fatality! like the announcer from Mortal Kombat. 
A reference to early 2000's PC game Uplink, from the same hacker who loves Watch Dogs.
Some of these are obvious and most folks will get them right away. The Mortal Kombat ones, in particular, had my theater laughing loudly. Though I have to wonder how many folks got the Watch Dogs reference. Or the Uplink name drop. 
Also, there was one dude in my showing of Shazam who YELLED very loudly when the Haudoken scene happened. Like REALLY loudly. I even looked back to see if I could spot the dude, I assumed he was standing honestly. 
I cant help but overthink the Mortal Kombat X scene. Does that mean Injustice 2 exists in that universe and was the predecessor to that MKX? Is Shazam in that Injustice 2? 
Im not going to think about this anymore.","This weekend the newest DC superhero film, Shazam, was released. Critics enjoyed it. I liked it a lot too.

Chris Kerr,"NoClip has posted a short but sweet video interview with NetherRealm Studios creative director Ed Boon that looks at how the studio creates Mortal Kombat's famously bloody fatalities. 
According to Boon, the process begins the same way for each game in the franchise. The dev team gets the ball rolling by creating one fatality that showcases new tech to the player in an interesting (and incredibly violent) way. 
Boon will usually lead the charge on that first fatality, drawing up the move himself before heading to the motion capture studio to see how it translates on-screen.
""The very start of the process is always a fatality that's going to set the tone for the rest of them. I'm usually the one who draws up that fatality, and says okay 'this is going to happen, that's going to happen, this is going to let us demonstrate our new blood tech, this is going to let us exploit this type of animation or particle system,"" he explained.
""So I'll draw something up, and go into the motion capture studio and capture the animations. It's usually an animatic without the final effects so we can get a sense of the pacing and where the cool moments are going to be. So, by the time that's one is completely we have a whole bunch of other ones that are in the queue. But that one leads the charge and sets the tone for the rest of them.""
After that, the entire team will spend weeks and months in meetings hashing out different ideas, before sending their picks to concept artists and animators. Curiously, they sometimes find that some of the best ideas on paper just don't feel right in-game, and often need a fair bit of tweaking to get the desired result.

James Rogers,"With the eyes of the world on Hawaii’s devastating Kilauea volcano, experts are weighing the human toll of volcanic eruptions. Thankfully, there have been no fatalities as a result of the current Kilauea eruption, although experts note that, on a global basis, lives are regularly lost as a result of volcanic activity. Fatalities, for example, have been recorded in 18 of the last 20 years, according to the Volcanic Fatalities Database, compiled by the U.K.'s University of Bristol. DRAMATIC VOLCANO DEATH: HUGE FLYING STONE CRUSHED MAN IN POMPEII, ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER The latest version of the database, which was produced in September 2017, notes that about a tenth of the world’s population lives within the potential footprint of volcanic hazards. Compiled from academic data, media reports and official statements, the database spans the period 1500 AD to 2017. During that period, 635 fatal incidents were recorded, accounting for 278,368 deaths. Each record in the database contains information on the number of fatalities, fatal cause, incident date and the fatality location in terms of distance from the volcano. Nearly half of the fatal incidents are were recorded within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the volcanic activity. HAWAII VOLCANO: WHY KILAUEA'S LAVA IS CAUSING EERIE BLUE FLAMES “Local residents are the most frequently killed, but tourists, volcanologists and members of the media are also identified as common victims,” explained the researchers. In a BBC column, Dr. Sarah Brown of the University of Bristol’s School of Earth Sciences, explained that, since 1500, about 170,000 people have been killed in just six eruptions. Volcanoes can produce a host of lethal hazards, including lava flows, tsunamis, volcanic mudflows, avalanches, flying rocks and pyroclastic flow – a mix of hot lava fragments, ash pumice and volcanic ash. Potentially harmful gases such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide can also be emitted. HAWAII VOLCANO: WHAT'S THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR KILAUEA? Brown, who updates the volcanic fatality database, noted that the largest loss of life to volcanic gas was in Cameroon in 1986 when more than 1,500 people died. The deaths occurred when carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos flowed into surrounding villages, she explained. While no one has died as a result of the current Kilauea eruption, a man on the Big Island was recently hit by a flying piece of lava and said the molten rock nearly sheared his leg in half.

"Mary Schlangenstein, Julie Johnsson","Southwest Airlines Co. is stepping up engine inspections as the discount carrier known for its quirky cheerfulness and strong safety record grapples with the aftermath of its first accident to kill a passenger. Ultrasonic examinations of the fan blades on its CFM56 engines will be completed within 30 days, Southwest said. The airline, which operates the world’s largest fleet of Boeing Co. 737 jetliners, relies on the turbofan to power its more than 700 planes. The National Transportation Safety Board found indications of metal fatigue, an area of weakness caused by repeated bending, where a fan blade on the engine was missing, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said in a briefing late Tuesday. One woman died after shrapnel from the blast tore through a window about 20 minutes into the flight from New York to Dallas. “This is a very sad day, and on behalf of the entire Southwest family I want to extend deepest sympathies for the family and loved ones of the deceased customer,” Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly told reporters, speaking in an auditorium called Freedom Hall at Southwest’s headquarters in Dallas. “We will do all we can to support them during this very difficult time and in the difficult days ahead.” Gary Kelly The death was the first in-flight fatality due to an accident in the 47-year history of Southwest. That doesn’t include a 2005 episode when one of the carrier’s jets skidded off a snowy runway onto a Chicago road and killed a six-year-old boy in a car. Accident Probe Federal investigators along with teams of technical experts from Boeing and engine maker CFM International, a venture of General Electric Co. and France‘s Safran SA, are gathering clues about what caused the accident. The engine on a Southwest Airlines plane. The CFM turbofan, one of the most widely used jet engines, has amassed more than 350 million flight hours on 6,700 aircraft since entering the market in 1997. There have been “only a handful” of failures with the engine, Kelly said. It would be “premature to even link it to other engine failures that have occurred.” Southwest has more than 500 of Boeing’s 737-700 jets, the aircraft variant that was involved in the incident. While Southwest’s average flights have been getting longer as the company has grown into the No. 4 U.S. carrier, the carrier is still known for doing more of the shorter hauls than full-service airlines with flights that cross oceans. The relatively high number of takeoffs and landings puts added stress on the planes and engines. “Anytime you run an engine like that to maximum power and hold it there for a couple of minutes on takeoff, you are putting maximum stress on all the rotating parts,” said John Nance, a former airline and military pilot. “You can’t deny that the more you run an engine up to full power on takeoff, the more you stress those blades.” The stress those operations put on the aluminum frames of Southwest’s 737 jetliners has been raised before, notably after a hole ripped the fuselage skin roof of an aircraft in mid-flight in 2011. The metal fatigue was later linked to the technique Boeing workers used to assemble the aircraft family, which Southwest retired last year. Earlier Incident Investigators will also want to know if there is any relation between Tuesday’s engine blowout and an uncontained engine failure that spewed shrapnel on a Southwest airplane cruising above the Gulf of Mexico in 2016, Sumwalt said. On that plane, also a 737-700, a fan blade on a jet engine snapped off and sent debris slamming into the fuselage, NTSB investigators determined. They found evidence of a crack “consistent” with metal fatigue in the titanium-alloy blade. The jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after parts of the left engine broke apart, damaging the fuselage, wing and tail. The plane lost cabin pressure and passengers tweeted pictures of themselves with oxygen masks on. Modern jet engines contain a series of spinning fans and if one of them breaks apart it can eject blades and other metal debris at high speeds. Engine manufacturers and airlines conduct periodic inspections on planes designed to spot any evidence of cracks or weakening of the metal due to fatigue. After the latest accident, Kelly said Southwest would work “with the NTSB to make sure we understand the root cause, and any further actions we need to take in terms of maintenance or inspections we’ll want to add to our program.” The airline’s shares fell 1.1 percent to $54.27 at the close in New York, after falling as much as 3.1 percent after the NTSB announced the fatality. ‘Close-Knit Company’ “Southwest is a close-knit and attentive company,” said David Greenberg, founder of Compass Group Aviation Consulting. “They’ll first focus on the needs of the survivors, both the uninjured and those that lost a family member. The internal people take that very, very seriously. They will support each other as they go through the investigation.” The latest incident marks a tragic milestone for an airline that has had a strong track record of safety, said Bob Mann, a former airline executive who now heads aviation consultant R.W. Mann &amp; Co. While the situation may not have a long-term impact on Southwest’s business, the company faces a critical test with its handling of the situation, he said. “They’ve responded to it very well,” Mann said, citing Kelly’s initial comments. “I think they’ve approached it very professionally -- not clinically, but with an eye toward the sort of personalized relationship they’d like to have with their customers.” — With assistance by Rick Clough",Bloomberg Southwest Rushes Engine Checks Amid First-of-Its-Kind Crisis Bloomberg Southwest Airlines Co. is stepping up engine inspections as the discount carrier known for its quirky cheerfulness and strong safety record grapples with the aftermath of its fir…,2018-04-18T14:57:00Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Southwest Rushes Engine Checks Amid First-of-Its-Kind Crisis - Bloomberg,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/southwest-ceo-faces-test-as-deadly-accident-mars-safety-record,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixVfWSXm2jqY/v0/1200x801.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,fatality,1
Elliot Williams,"Self-driving cars have been in the news a lot in the past two weeks. Uber’s self-driving taxi hit and killed a pedestrian on March 18, and just a few days later a Tesla running in “autopilot” mode slammed into a road barrier at full speed, killing the driver. In both cases, there was a human driver who was supposed to be watching over the shoulder of the machine, but in the Uber case the driver appears to have been distracted and in the Tesla case, the driver had hands off the steering wheel for six seconds prior to the crash. How safe are self-driving cars? Trick question! Neither of these cars were “self-driving” in at least one sense: both had a person behind the wheel who was ultimately responsible for piloting the vehicle. The Uber and Tesla driving systems aren’t even comparable. The Uber taxi does routing and planning, knows the speed limit, and should be able to see red traffic lights and stop at them (more on this below!). The Tesla “Autopilot” system is really just the combination of adaptive cruise control and lane-holding subsystems, which isn’t even enough to get it classified as autonomous in the state of California. Indeed, it’s a failure of the people behind the wheels, and the failure to properly train those people, that make the pilot-and-self-driving-car combination more dangerous than a human driver alone would be. A self-driving Uber Volvo XC90, San Francisco. You could still imagine wanting to dig into the numbers for self-driving cars’ safety records, even though they’re heterogeneous and have people playing the mechanical turk. If you did, you’d be sorely disappointed. None of the manufacturers publish any of their data publicly when they don’t have to. Indeed, our glimpses into data on autonomous vehicles from these companies come from two sources: internal documents that get leaked to the press and carefully selected statistics from the firms’ PR departments. The state of California, which requires the most rigorous documentation of autonomous vehicles anywhere, is another source, but because Tesla’s car isn’t autonomous, and because Uber refused to admit that its car is autonomous to the California DMV, we have no extra insight into these two vehicle platforms. Nonetheless, Tesla’s Autopilot has three fatalities now, and all have one thing in common — all three drivers trusted the lane-holding feature well enough to not take control of the wheel in the last few seconds of their lives. With Uber, there’s very little autonomous vehicle performance history, but there are leaked documents and a pattern that makes Uber look like a risk-taking scofflaw with sub-par technology that has a vested interest to make it look better than it is. That these vehicles are being let loose on public roads, without extra oversight and with other traffic participants as safety guinea pigs, is giving the self-driving car industry and ideal a black eye. If Tesla’s and Uber’s car technologies are very dissimilar, the companies have something in common. They are both “disruptive” companies with mavericks at the helm that see their fates hinging on getting to a widespread deployment of self-driving technology. But what differentiates Uber and Tesla from Google and GM most is, ironically, their use of essentially untrained test pilots in their vehicles: Tesla’s in the form of consumers, and Uber’s in the form of taxi drivers with very little specific autonomous-vehicle training. What caused the Tesla and Uber accidents may have a lot more to do with human factors than self-driving technology per se. You can see we’ve got a lot of ground to cover. Read on! The Red Herrings But first, here are some irrelevant statistics you’ll hear bantered around after the accidents. First is that “more than 90% of accidents are caused by human drivers”. This is unsurprising, given that all car drivers are human. When only self-driving cars are allowed on the road, they’ll be responsible for 100% of accidents. The only thing that matters is the relative safety of humans and machines, expressed per mile or per trip or per hour. So let’s talk about that. From phenominal RAND report on self-driving cars. Humans are reportedly terrible drivers because 35,000 died on US highways last year. This actually demonstrates that people are fantastically good at driving, despite their flaws. US drivers also drove three trillion miles in the process. Three relevant statistics to keep in your mind as a baseline are 90 million miles per fatality, a million miles per injury, and half a million miles per accident of any kind. When autonomous vehicles can beat these numbers, which include drunk drivers, snowy and rainy weather conditions, and cell phones, you can say that humans are “bad” drivers. (Source: US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration. ) Finally, I’m certain that you’ve heard that autonomous vehicles “will” be safer than human drivers, and that some fatal accidents now are just an uncomfortable hump that we have to get over to save millions of lives in the future. This is an “ ends justify the means ” argument, which puts it on sketchy ethical footing to start with. Moreover, in medical trials, patients are required to give informed consent to be treated, and the treatment under consideration has to be shown to be not significantly worse than a treatment already in use. Tests of self-driving technology aren’t that dissimilar, and we’ve not signed consent forms to share the road with non-human drivers. Worse, it looks very much like the machines are less good than we are. The fig leaf is that a human driver is ultimately in control, so it’s probably no worse than letting them drive without the machine, right? Let’s take a look. Tesla: Autopilot, but not Autonomous [Image: Electrek ] I reviewed Tesla’s “Autopilot” safety record just after the second fatal accident ; nothing’s really changed. Tesla added a third fatality but could have also racked up another hundred million miles under Autopilot (they’re not saying, so we presume their average hasn’t improved dramatically). It’s likely that Tesla’s Autopilot has about the same average fatality rate, around 90 million miles per fatality, as the general US population, but we won’t be able to establish statistical confidence until they have a few billion running miles on them. This is not great. Autopilot is supposed to only be engaged on good sections of road, in good weather conditions, and kept under strict supervision. If one considers how humans drive in these optimal conditions, they would do significantly better than average as well. Something like 30% of fatal accidents occur at intersections which should make Autopilot’s traditional cruising-down-the-highway use case look a lot better. An educated guess, based on these factors, is that Autopilot isn’t all that much worse than an average human driver under the same circumstances, but it certainly isn’t demonstrably better either. Perhaps the public perception of “hand-on” driving technology needs adjustment But Autopilot isn’t autonomous. According to the SAE definitions of automation, the current Autopilot software is level 2, partial automation, and that’s dangerous. Because the system works so well most of the time, users can forget that they’re intended to be in control at all times. This is part of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)’s conclusion on the accident in 2016, and it’s the common thread between all three Autopilot-related deaths. The drivers didn’t have their hands on the wheel, ready to take over, when the system failed to see an obstacle. They over-relied on the system to work. It’s hard to blame them. After thousands of experiences when the car did the right thing, it would be hard to second-guess it on the 4,023rd time. Ironically, this would become even harder if the system had a large number of close calls. If the system frequently makes the right choice shortly after you would have, you learn to suppress your distrust. You practice not intervening with every near miss. And this is also the reason that Consumer Reports called on Tesla to remove the steering function and the Autopilot name — it just promises too much. Uber: Scofflaws and Shambles You might say that it’s mean-spirited to pile on Uber right now. After all, they have just experienced one tragedy and it was perhaps unavoidable. But whereas Tesla is taking baby steps toward automation and maybe promoting them too hard, Uber seems to be taking gigantic leaps, breaking laws, pushing their drivers, and hoping for the best. In December 2016, Uber announced that it was going to test its vehicles in California. There was just one hitch: they weren’t allowed to. The California DMV classified their vehicles as autonomous, which subjected them to reporting requirements (more later!) that Uber were unwilling to subject themselves to, so Uber argued that their cars weren’t autonomous under California law, and they drove anyway. After just a few days, the City of San Francisco shut them down. Within the one week that they were on the streets of San Francisco, their cars had reportedly run five or six red lights, with at least one getting filmed by the police (and posted on YouTube, naturally). Uber claims that the driver was at fault for not overriding the car, which apparently didn’t see the light at all. In a publicity stunt made in heaven, Uber loaded up their cars onto a big “Otto” branded trucks and drove south to Arizona. Take that, California! Only the Otto trucks drove with human drivers behind the wheel, in stark contrast to that famous video of self-driving Otto trucks (YouTube) which was filmed in the state of Nevada. (During which they also didn’t have the proper permits to operate autonomously, and were thus operating illegally while filming.) Uber picked Arizona, as have many autonomous vehicle companies, for the combination of good weather, wide highways, and lax regulation. Arizona’s governor, Douglas Ducey, made sure that the state was “open for business” and imposed minimal constraints on self-drivers as long as they follow the rules of the road. Notably, there are no reporting requirements in Arizona and no oversight once a permit is approved. How were their cars doing in Arizona before the accident? Not well. According to leaked internal documents, they averaged thirteen miles between “interventions” when the driver needed to take over. With Autopilot, we speculated about the dangers of being lulled into complacency by an almost-too-good experience, but this is the opposite. We don’t know how many of the interventions were serious issues, like failing to notice a pedestrian or red traffic light, or how many were minor, like swerving slightly out of a lane on an empty road or just failing to brake smoothly. But we do know that an Uber driver had to be on his or her toes. And in this high-demand environment, they reduced the number of drivers from two to one to cut costs. This guy will take the heat. Uber and Arizona are responsible. Then the accident. At the time, Uber cars had a combined three million miles under their belt. Remember the US average of in excess of 90 million miles per fatality? Maybe Uber got unlucky, but given their background, I’m not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. To tally even these three million fatality-free miles to the autonomous car is pushing it, though. Three million miles at thirteen miles per intervention means that a human took control around 230,000 times. We have no idea how many of these include situations where the driver prevented a serious accident before the one time that a driver didn’t. This is not what better-than-human driving looks like. Takeaway Other self-driving car technologies have significantly better performance records, no fatalities, or have subjected themselves to even the lightest public scrutiny by testing their vehicles in California, the only state with disclosure requirements for autonomous vehicles. As a California rule comes into effect (today!) that enables full deployment of autonomous vehicles, rather than just testing, in the state, we expect to see more data in the future. I’ll write up the good side of self-drivers in another article. But for now, we’re left with two important counterexamples. The industry cannot be counted on to regulate itself if there’s no (enforced) transparency into the performance of their vehicles — both Tesla and Uber think they are in a winner-takes-all race to autonomous driving, and are cutting corners. Because no self-driving cars, even the best of the best, are able to drive more than a few thousand miles without human intervention, the humans are the weak link. But this is not for the commonly stated reason that people are bad drivers — we’re talking about human-guided self-driving cars failing to meet the safety standards of unassisted humans after all. Instead, we need to publicly recognize that piloting a “self-driving” car is its own unique and dangerous task. Airplane pilots receive extensive training on the use and limitations of (real) autopilot. Maybe it’s time to make this mandatory for self-driving pilots as well. Either way, the public deserves more data. From all evidence, the current state of technology in self-driving cars is nowhere near safer than human drivers, by any standards, and yet potentially lethal experiments are being undertaken on the streets. Obtaining informed consent of all drivers to participate in this experiment is perhaps asking too much. But at least we should be informed.","Self-driving cars have been in the news a lot in the past two weeks.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"Mr. Crouch engaged the cornice. It snapped. He fell out of sight. “Avalanche, avalanche!” shouted Cam Fitzpatrick, a fellow snowboarder, who had been standing nearer to Mr. Crouch than the others. The group swung into action, setting off a mountainside rescue that had to be accomplished within minutes to beat the odds of death from trauma or suffocation. Mr. Crouch did not die. He was released on Friday from Vancouver General Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, after being treated for broken vertebrae, a torn pancreas and other injuries. Nature had just taught him that extreme sports can quickly turn from thrill to peril. Mr. Crouch said on Instagram that the cornice “pulled me backward into a slide.” “It took me through about 1,000 feet and over several rock bands before I ended up at the bottom, buried with no oxygen for almost 5 minutes,” he wrote, thanking the group for saving him. The online community of board sports, both snow and surf, showed camaraderie. “Pray for Gold Medal U.S.A. Surf Team member and professional snowboarder, Brock Crouch!” U.S.A. Surfing, the sports governing body, wrote. Mr. Crouch, who has also competed in International Ski Federation snowboard events, and the others were in the Pemberton Ice Cap region of British Columbia to work with Absinthe Films, which makes snowboarding films. Weeks before they arrived, there had been an avalanche with a fatality in the region, and on Friday Shin Campos, a safety coordinator with Whistler Creek Productions in Canada, which was working with the group, said the group was aware. He said they carefully assessed the risks, such as taking into account temperature and winds, which can whip up snow and move it around to create destabilized patches that have not bonded. Photo The mountain in the Whistler backcountry area of Canada on April 22, where Brock Crouch, a snowboarder, was swept off the ridge in an avalanche. Credit John Jackson The group surveyed the mountains from a helicopter, chose their routes and then set down the aircraft to plan descents. “Most people look at these guys and say, ‘They just hike up and snowboard down,” he said. “It is much more involved.” John Jackson, 34, a professional backcountry rider from Nevada, said the group had airbags, shovels and other equipment. When Mr. Crouch dropped out of sight, they switched their radios to search mode. Mr. Campos flagged the pilot, who started up the helicopter. The riders knew they had to give chase, but first they had to navigate a safe route, cutting across debris and other hazards without putting themselves in danger or dropping more snow on the area where Mr. Crouch might be buried. With the help of the pilot, they maneuvered to the bottom where the avalanche had stalled, hoping Mr. Crouch had ended up that far. “When we were going down, in the back of our mind you are thinking, ‘Wow, we might be pulling out our dead friend,’” Mr. Jackson said. The pilot spied something in the mound — the tip of a snowboard. Hopes rose, but avalanches are so violent that they can rip away equipment — a glove, a pole, a backpack. It was around 2:15 p.m. The temperature, at 6,500 feet above sea level, was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, as Mr. Jackson recalled. The men started to dig through packed snow. Within minutes, Mr. Jackson said, they exposed a boot, and then tried to gauge where Mr. Crouch’s head might be. As the snow was cleared, he was found folded up, his head near his feet, Mr. Jackson said. “He was taco’ed,” he said. “Because he was not directly upside down, his head was only two feet under the snow.” The bluish tint vanished from his face as they cleared snow from his airway. He moaned. They extracted his body, supporting his neck and back. Mr. Crouch was responsive, biting Mr. Jackson’s fingers. He had been buried for about five minutes. He had told his friends of trying to create an air pocket with his arms. “That is incredibly rare you have this success story,” Mr. Campos said. “The chance of survival goes down rapidly after two minutes.” In the hospital, Mr. Crouch shared photographs of his battered face. “I love snowboarding more today than I ever have and I can’t wait to get back on my board and shred with everyone again!” he wrote.

Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. The world is watching with bated breath as divers and rescue crews work to free 12 boys and their coach from a flooded cave in northern Thailand, where they've been trapped for more than two weeks. So far, five boys have been rescued. Yesterday, four boys were carried to safety. Rescue operations resumed this morning, and as of 6 a.m. ET, a fifth boy has been successfully brought out through the complex tunnels of the cave system. While the rescue process is long and treacherous, Thai authorities seem optimistic. The local governor praised yesterday's ""very smooth operation,"" and local officials said the condition of first four rescued boys is ""not that bad."" In addition to Thai forces, the team of rescuers includes experts and volunteer divers from Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as 36 US Pacific Command military personnel. 2. UK nerve agent poisoning A UK woman mysteriously poisoned by a Soviet-era nerve agent has died, and authorities are now treating her death as a murder. Dawn Sturgess and Charles Rowley fell ill in the town of Amesbury at the end of June. It was determined the pair had somehow been exposed to Novichok, a powerful nerve agent that was allegedly used in the March 2018 poisoning of a Russian double agent and his daughter. Authorities still don't know how, when or why the British pair were exposed to the same chemical, but Sturgess' death is a tragic complication. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by the death, and UK government officials have called on Russia to provide an explanation for the incident. White House attorney Rudy Giuliani had a lot to say yesterday about the ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling. He told CNN's Dana Bash that the White House contested a request from special counsel Robert Mueller to interview White House chief of staff John Kelly. Giuliani acknowledged the White House not agreeing to an interview with a member of Trump's staff was new, given that other key staffers, including Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, have spoken with investigators. On ABC's ""This Week,"" the former New York City mayor said President Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to drop the probe into ex-White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, and appeared to claim the president asked Comey to give Flynn ""a break."" This is in direct opposition to Trump's own version of events, since he has denied ever speaking with Comey about Flynn. A US soldier was killed Saturday in what US military officials are calling an ""apparent insider attack"" in Afghanistan. Army Cpl. Joseph Maciel of South Gate, California, died and two other American service members were wounded in the attack, which occurred while they were advising local forces at an Afghan military facility. The incident is currently under investigation. This is the third combat fatality in Afghanistan this year. The Trump Administration has taken a step forward in complying with a federal court order to unite the thousands of children who have been separated from their families at the southern US border. On Saturday, the administration released the names of all of the children under the age of 5 who have been separated from their families; more than 100 in all. A US District Court Judge in California ordered the list to be handed over by Saturday evening as he considers whether to extend the Tuesday deadline to reunify the families.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity Tuesday because the fatality has not been announced publicly.
The person says a filly trained by Hall of Famer Ron McAnally was pulled up during morning training on the dirt track and was taken off by van. The filly was later euthanized because of her injury.
A total of 21 horses have died since the racetrack's winter meet began on Dec. 26.
Track officials had already announced that Thursday's racing was canceled and racing won't resume until Friday, although the track is open daily for training.

SERGE F. KOVALESKI,"“I am trying to follow the Bible, which says you should not let the sun set on your anger because anger only makes it worse,” Mr. Pomeroy said. He is attempting to live by the advice he typically gives to parishioners in mourning. Good versus evil. God’s plan. The importance of faith. Photo Annabelle Pomeroy, the pastor’s 14-year-old daughter, was killed. Credit Seguin Independent School District, via Associated Press “We are supposed to find that peaceful place and to pray about it and accept what it is,” he said. But finding that spiritual refuge has hardly been easy. The carnage that Devin P. Kelley wreaked in what became the worst mass shooting in Texas history left 25 people dead, including a pregnant woman whose fetus was declared fatality No. 26, and 20 others injured. The trauma affected thousands more, certainly everyone in the tiny rural community of Sutherland Springs. Amid the collective grieving, Mr. Pomeroy, 51, has found himself in an unfamiliar situation for a pastor. While presiding over funerals and counseling bereaved families are cornerstones of his calling, he now requires consoling himself. “What is different here is that the comforting is mutual,” he said through his cellphone this week from outside a hospital where he was visiting a wounded survivor of the shooting. “We are all leaning on each other because this is surreal and beyond the scope of anything we have had to deal with. We are a tightknit group anyway. If nothing else, this has made us closer.” Mr. Pomeroy’s own pain and the suffering of his wife of three decades, Sherri, have not hindered him from carrying out his pastoral duties — as grim as they have been. When he is not attending funerals or making hospital visits, he has spent hours in meetings with insurance companies, lawyers and a committee put together to make decisions on the future of the church. “In a word, life has been tumultuous and it feels like the days are running together because they have been extremely busy,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “I feel that I am not grieving as adequately as I should. I feel pretty weak right now, a bit shaky.” Photo One week after the shooting, First Baptist Church was reopened to the public as a memorial. Credit Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times He added: “It is hard to be strong for everyone else when I have my own heartache. But each day I am able to function a little better.” He said that news reports stating he had decided to demolish the church because it would be too painful to continue using it were inaccurate, and that a decision on what to do with the small house of worship had not yet been made. “Those reports hurt a lot of people who needed the church to grieve,” Mr. Pomeroy said. For the time being, he added, the sanctuary where the attack occurred will no longer be used for services and will remain a memorial to the victims. Mr. Pomeroy had met Mr. Kelley, 26, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Over the past three years or so, Mr. Kelley came to the church once or twice a year and sat in the back, out of sight from the camera that recorded the services for wider online viewing, Mr. Pomeroy said. “I tried to talk to him a few times but he wouldn’t listen or engage,” he recounted. “He acted entitled and spoke often in a harsh and ugly way. He seemed like an angry person who had never been taught to treat people the right way.” Mr. Kelley made it clear to him that he “despised” the church, the pastor said, and that he wanted him to know he was an atheist. “He would throw these snide remarks in there when I was talking to his wife,” the pastor said of Danielle Shields, Mr. Kelley’s second wife. He added that after Mr. Kelley married Ms. Shields, she too was rarely seen at the church. “Once Danielle got married to him, she was pretty much gone,” Mr. Pomeroy said. Photo A graveside service in Sutherland Springs last week for members of one family who died in the shooting. Credit Eric Gay/Associated Press By the time of the attack, the couple was estranged, and law enforcement authorities have said that the shooting may have stemmed from a dispute between Mr. Kelley and his mother-in-law. She and several others from that side of the family were regulars at the church. As Mr. Pomeroy put it, “Pretty much every time the church door was open, the mother-in-law was there.” But on the morning of the shooting, Mr. Kelley’s mother-in-law was at home with her grandson. Once she realized that she was late for church, the pastor said, she opted not to go. Among the dead though was Lula Woicinski White, the grandmother of the gunman’s estranged wife and one of Ms. Pomeroy’s closest friends. “My opinion is that he was going to the church to find the mother-in-law and was planning to shoot everybody on that side of the family,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “I think he came there for them but intended to do something much bigger.” The pastor saw Mr. Kelley at the church’s fall festival on Oct. 31, just days before the shooting. “He just seemed like he was glaring at everybody he walked by,” Mr. Pomeroy recalled. The pastor said that even though Mr. Kelley had such an unsettling presence, he never imagined that he would have “the guts or courage” to kill and wound so many innocent people. “He was a mean and hateful person, but I would not have dreamed that he had this magnitude of darkness in him,” Mr. Pomeroy said. Law enforcement officials and friends of Mr. Kelley’s mother-in-law have said that he had been sending her threatening text messages. Mr. Pomeroy said he was not aware of the texts, but knew that she and others on that side of the family clashed with Mr. Kelley. Photo A memorial to the shooting victims in First Baptist Church. Credit Drew Anthony Smith for The New York Times On the morning of the shooting, Mr. Pomeroy was taking a gun class so that he could get licensed to give instruction at a youth camp next summer on handling old-fashioned single-shot rifles and pistols. The pastor, who said he carries a concealed firearm when he preaches, does not believe that anyone in the church was armed that morning. Outside the church, Mr. Kelley was injured by a bystander who shot him twice after the attack. “In a way, I think that if I were there I could have done more,” he said. “But who is to say?” After learning that his adopted daughter had been killed in the rampage, he struggled to tell his wife. Ms. Pomeroy was in Florida at the time doing contract work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I didn’t want her to be alone when she heard that,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “I ended up having to tell her over the phone.” He said that she was “coping but having a hard time” dealing with a shooting in which she lost her two closest friends. “There is so much sadness that not only do you not know how to function in society, you just don’t even know what to say to God anymore,” Ms. Pomeroy said. The couple has one other adopted child, as well as one they have helped raise without formally adopting. They also have four biological children. The outpouring of support the couple has received from around the world has left them feeling uplifted. “It is encouraging that although there was one bad guy who tried to steal the day,” Mr. Pomeroy said, “thousands of good people have stood up in support.” Continue reading the main story","Frank Pomeroy and his wife, Sherri, at a memorial service for the victims of the mass shooting at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Tex.",2017-11-22T10:00:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Day the Pastor Was Away and Evil Came Barging Into His Church,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/us/pastor-frank-pomeroy-sutherland-springs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/22/us/23pomeroy/23pomeroy-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fatality,1
Melissa Daniels,"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended Uber's self-driving vehicle testing privileges Monday in the wake of a pedestrian fatality in a Phoenix suburb last week. Ducey said in a letter to CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that video footage of the crash raised concerns about the San Francisco-based company's ability to safely test its technology in Arizona. He said he expects public safety to be the top priority for those who operate self-driving cars. ""The incident that took place on March 18 is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation,"" Ducey said. The move by the Republican governor marks a major step back from his embrace of self-driving vehicles. He previously welcomed Uber and other autonomous vehicle companies to use Arizona as a place for testing under few, if any, regulations. In early March, he authorized self-driving vehicle companies to run tests without a person in the car to act as a safety operator. On March 21, police in Tempe released a 22-second video showing a woman walking from a darkened area onto a street just before an Uber SUV strikes her. The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, police said. The human backup driver appears to be looking down until just before the time of the impact. The fatal crash in Tempe was the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle in the United States. Uber immediately suspended its self-driving vehicle testing in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. If Uber resumes its self-driving vehicle testing, the governor's decision means the company will still be prevented from doing so in Arizona, said Ducey's spokesman Daniel Scarpinato. Uber released a statement that said it will ""continue to help investigators in any way we can, and we'll keep a dialogue open with the Governor's office to address any concerns they have."" The crash is being investigated by Tempe police, the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Experts who viewed the video told The Associated Press that the SUV's sensors should have seen the woman pushing a bicycle and braked before the impact even though it was at night. On Friday, The New York Time s reported that the company's own documents showed the testing program was rife with issues. They included trouble driving through construction zones and requiring far more human intervention than competing companies. In Arizona, companies such as Uber only need to carry minimum liability insurance to operate self-driving cars. They are not required to track crashes or report any information to the state. Scarpinato said Monday that Ducey considers self-driving vehicles a way to improve public safety and limit road fatalities. ""We see real long-term benefits to it, and we want to know more about this incident, whether it was an outlier or not,"" he said. But he wouldn't say if the governor regretted not having state reporting requirements that could have given advance warning of the problems with Uber's program reported by the New York Times. California requires added insurance, reports of all accidents regardless of the severity and an annual report showing how many times operators had to take over from the computers. Scarpinato said called Ducey's action ""aggressive"" but declined to say if the governor was reconsidering requiring more oversight. ""I think we have prudent, responsible regulation,"" Scarpinato said. ""I think you saw with today's action is that we are all about public safety and accountability and public safety."" ---- Associated Press reporter Bob Christie contributed to this report. ---- The Associated Press",Uber's self-driving vehicle tests have been halted since the accident.,2018-03-27T14:57:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Uber Loses Self-Driving Testing Privileges in Arizona After Fatal Crash,https://www.inc.com/associated-press/uber-self-driving-car-suspended-arizona-after-fatal-crash-phoenix-pedestrian-doug-ducey-dara-khosrowshahi.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_545393960_200013332000928014_350967.jpg,,Inc.com,fatality,1
Kevin Daum,"On Sunday night, Uber’s driverless car testing program suffered its first major safety setback : a pedestrian was killed in a collision with a driverless Volvo in Uber’s testing program in Arizona. Now there is debate as to whether it was Uber’s fault. Still there are those who think one death is one too many and want to halt progress. I’ve written before on why Uber’s work with Volvo is brilliant marketing. There have been accidents before, and just because there’s been a fatality doesn’t mean Uber and Volvo should abandon the work altogether. No one knows what the future will hold, but it still appears that driverless vehicles are the way of the future. By all accounts, the testing has been largely successful and productive, and Uber and Volvo are moving towards their plan of introducing driverless cars into their fleet in the near future. So as tragic as the death is, Uber shouldn’t abandon testing its pioneering technology over one fatality. While not every business will encounter something as grave as a civilian death, the situation in general is applicable to other businesses. In the event of a major setback, tragedy, or public relations nightmare that impacts a long-term plan for the future, how does a business leader know when to stay the course and when to abandon ship ? Here are tips on navigating the stormy seas of long-term innovation: 1. Have a Plan Beforehand If you’re not pre-prepared for a crisis, you’ve dug a hole for yourself before you’ve even begun. Anticipate what problems could arise during your research and plan for each of them. Think through as much as you can before anything happens. 2. Be Objective Remove your personal feelings from the calculation. The decision needs to be dispassionate, not emotional. Don’t reveal your anger, and don’t let your passion for the project blind your view. Consider all sides of the argument and all viewpoints of your constituents and that of the public. 3. Maintain the Long View Remember why you made this investment in the first place. Don’t allow the short-term public outcry to overwhelm your vision of the future. If the problem was unanticipated, consider whether and how this issue could arise again and how it would impact your prospects. If you knew the problem could arise, compare the reality with what you anticipated, and evaluate your plan going forward. 4. Don’t Play the Blame Game One of the worst things any leader can do is to deflect responsibility. Acknowledge the impact of the situation and your company’s role in it. Have a plan for public outreach and demonstrate how your company will move forward. 5. Use the Opportunity There’s a saying in public relations that all press is good press. Businesses should take the same view. If you have the public’s attention, even if it was initially for a bad reason, embrace it. Show the public what a great company you are.",Is one death too many in the advancement of technology?

The Thunderbirds pilot, whose identity has not yet been released, was killed after his F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed over the Nevada Testa and Training Range during a routine aerial demonstration training flight, the U.S. Air Force said in a statement. Officials are investigating the cause of the crash, according to the Air Force. The incident marked the third U.S. military aircraft crash this week and the fifth fatality. Four Marines were killed in a helicopter crash while practicing desert landings in Southern California on Tuesday, officials said. Earlier that day, a Marine AV-8B Harrier attack jet crashed after taking off from the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport. The pilot is reported to be in stable condition, according to Stars and Stripes.

Julia Naftulin,"The National Safety Council analyzed fatality statistics and found that, for the first time, people are more likely to die from an opioid overdose than from a car accident, CNN reported. 
 More specifically, the National Safety Council found that the odds of dying from an opioid overdose are 1 in 96 in the United States, while the odds of death from a car accident are 1 in 103. They also analyzed the likelihood of death from other preventable injuries and determined the rates of death from falls was 1 in 114 and death from suicide was 1 in 88, making it the most likely reason for death from preventable injury. 
 ""The increases in home and public deaths were largely driven by a 11% increase in poisoning deaths (including opioid overdoses),"" the National Safety Council explained on its website. 
 Synthetic drugs have worsened the United States opioid epidemic 
 Increased access to synthetic opioids is one reason the opioid epidemic has gotten increasingly worse over the years, INSIDER previously reported. One synthetic opioid, fentanyl, was specifically called out in a December 2018 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
 In fact, the CDC said synthetic opioid-related deaths increased 45.2% between 2016 and 2017, while death rates from non-synthetic opioids such as prescription opioids and heroin stayed stable between 2016 to 2017.

While these drugs are meant to help relieve pain, synthetic opioids ""tend to be highly potent"" and are often illegally manufactured, the CDC warned on its website. 
 The epidemic has contributed to a decrease in US life expectancy 
 Opioid-related overdoses and deaths have gotten so bad they have contributed to a decrease in United States life expectancy for the second year in a row, INSIDER previously reported. 
 ""Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the Nation's overall health and these sobering statistics are a wakeup call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable,"" CDC director Dr. Robert R. Redfield said in a statement. 
 In fact, there were 70,237 deaths from drug overdoses in 2017 alone, which was a 9.6% increase from the year prior, the CDC said.

Dan Whitcomb,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Cooler temperatures will bring some relief to firefighters battling California wildfires, but not until later in the week, the National Weather Service said. “No luck today, but starting Monday, we’re going to see a gradual cool down, as we shave just a few degrees off each day until about midweek it gets to something like normal, in the mid-90s (Fahrenheit) inland and 80s at the coast,” said Jim Hayes of the NWS Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “Today it’s going to be another miserable, hot, dry day,” he said early Sunday, noting that temperatures in some areas inland will hit triple digits. Santa Barbara County officials declared a local emergency on Saturday as a fast-moving wildfire destroyed 20 homes and other structures and forced thousands of residents to evacuate. The Holiday Fire, one of more than three dozen major blazes burning across the U.S. West, broke out on Friday evening near the beach community of Goleta, California, South of Santa Barbara, and raced through the seaside foothills. The flames forced more than 2,000 people to flee their homes, and left thousands more without power, prompting the emergency declaration which frees additional funds for the firefighting effort. As of early Sunday, the Holiday Fire burned through more than 100 acres and was 80 percent contained, officials posted on the Internet. Dozens of blazes have broken out across the western United States, fanned by scorching heat, winds and low humidity in a particularly intense fire season. This year’s fires had burned more than 2.9 million acres (1.17 million hectares) through Friday, already more than the annual average of about 2.4 million acres (971,000 hectares) over the last 10 years, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. On Friday, the remains of an unidentified person were found near a home burned to the ground by the Klamathon fire, which broke out on Thursday near California’s border with Oregon. It marked the first fatality of the fire season in California. The Klamathon, which has destroyed 15 structures and blackened nearly 22,000 acres (8,900 hectares), was 20 percent contained as of early Sunday, a spokeswoman said. Elsewhere in Northern California, the County Fire has charred 88,375 acres (35,764 hectares) in sparsely populated wooded areas of Napa and Yolo Counties. Some 3,660 firefighters faced with inaccessible terrain, high temperatures and low humidity, were battling the fire, which was only 48 percent contained. It has destroyed 10 structures, damaged two and threatened 110. In Colorado, officials said fire crews had made “much progress” battling the Spring Creek fire, which broke out on June 27 and has consumed 106,985 acres (43,295 hectares). It was 43 percent contained on Saturday, the officials said.

Associated Press,"A bus carrying Texas high school band members home from Disney World plunged into a ravine before dawn Tuesday in Alabama, killing one person and injuring many others. First responders used ropes to rappel down the 50-foot ravine in the middle of Interstate 10 to reach them, and then had to cut some of the victims free from the wreckage, said Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Hoss Mack, who confirmed the fatality. About 45 people were on board, and were brought to 10 hospitals in Alabama and Florida, either by helicopter or ambulance, he said. The sheriff said it wasn't immediately clear what caused the bus to enter the grassy median, which abruptly ends at a steep embankment where the interstate passes over Cowpen Creek. The crash happened at about 5:30 a.m., crunching the bus and leaving the passengers exposed to chilly temperatures. Rescuers used every piece of equipment on every truck to reach them, Mack said: ""This is what we call an all-out."" An image of the wreckage shows the crumpled bus landed on its side, far below the pavement. The interstate was closed down in both directions as the injured were flown to hospitals including emergency rooms in Mobile and Pensacola, Florida, plus a free-standing emergency room in rural Baldwin County, said Chris Elliott, a Baldwin County commissioner who helped out at the county emergency management center following the crash. ""Everybody is being transferred to a hospital to at least be checked out,"" said Elliott. A second bus on the spring break trip, driving ahead of the one that crashed, is continuing on to Texas, the sheriff said. Channelview Independent School District spokesman Mark Kramer confirmed that the charter bus was carrying Channelview High School band members. Kramer's statement said the district had only limited details in the immediate aftermath and was in contact with law enforcement in Alabama to get more information. An official with the bus charter company, First Class Tours of Houston, said the company was working on a statement. One image posted on the band's Facebook page hours before the crash showed a large group posing outside Disney World.","Chicago Tribune One dead, many injured after bus carrying Texas high school students plunges into ravine Chicago Tribune This photo provided by Jesus Tejada shows first responders searching around a bus that plunged into a ravine on March 13, 2018, in Loxley,…",2018-03-13T15:00:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Chicagotribune.com'}","One dead, many injured after bus carrying Texas high school students plunges into ravine - Chicago Tribune",http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-texas-school-bus-crash-20180313-story.html,http://www.trbimg.com/img-5aa7e767/turbine/ct-texas-school-bus-crash-20180313,,Chicagotribune.com,fatality,1
Associated Press,"(TRURO, Mass.) — A man swimming off Cape Cod was attacked by a shark on Wednesday and was airlifted to a hospital. It was the first shark attack on a human at the popular summer tourist destination since 2012. The victim was a 61-year-old man, who suffered puncture wounds to his torso and legs, said Gary Sharpless, assistant harbormaster in Truro. The attack happened around 4 p.m. at Long Nook Beach in Truro, on the Atlantic Ocean side of the peninsula, he told The Associated Press. The man was taken by a medical flight to a hospital for treatment. Truro fire chief Timothy Collins said the victim was “conscious and talking.” “We’re hoping for the best,” he told the Cape Cod Times. Truro police described the shark attack as unconfirmed and did not release the victim’s name or hometown. But Truro’s website said the beach was closed until further notice, and workers put up signs that read, “Danger, No Swimming.” Numerous shark sightings have been reported in the area this summer, including several involving great whites, the species immortalized in the “Jaws” movies. There was no confirmation that Wednesday’s attack involved a great white shark. The newspaper said witnesses noticed the man swimming far off the beach. The area is a feeding ground for seals, which draw sharks. Witnesses said at least 10 seals were seen in the area before the attack. An organization that studies sharks, the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, said shark encounters in which people are injured are as “terrifying as they are rare.” “While we still don’t know all of the details of this particular bite, sharks are not known to target people specifically and when they do bite people it’s usually a case of mistaken identity,” the group said in a statement. “Sharks ‘test the waters’ with their teeth, much like we use our hands. It’s how they determine if what they encounter is prey or something to avoid.” Truro was the site of the last shark attack on Cape Cod, in July 2012, when a Colorado man on Ballston Beach suffered a bite that required 47 stitches.

Aric Jenkins,"The death of an Arizona woman who was struck by one of Uber’s self-driving cars appears to be the first ever pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous vehicle. An Uber spokesperson confirmed to TIME that the incident occurred Sunday night in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe and that no passengers were in the backseat. Uber said there was one vehicle operator in the front seat at the time of the collision. The company says it’s suspending its self-driving operations in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto as a result. In a statement, the Tempe Police Department confirmed the vehicle involved was one of Uber’s driverless cars and that it was in autonomous mode at the time of the accident. “The vehicle was traveling northbound just south of Curry Rd. when a female walking outside of the crosswalk crossed the road from west to east when she was struck by the Uber vehicle,” the statement read. “She was transported to a local area hospital where she passed away from her injuries.” Uber has been testing its self-driving program for years, notably in Pittsburgh, where it rolled out its first driverless fleet in 2016. Autonomous vehicles generated controversy that same year when a passenger operating a Tesla Model S in “autopilot mode” died in a crash in Florida, but Uber’s incident is likely the first time a bystander not driving the car was killed by the technology. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed the incident in a tweet Monday afternoon. “Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,” he wrote. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.” Authorities have not yet released the victim’s identity and her next of kin has not yet been notified, the Temple PD said.",The ride-sharing giant says it's suspending its driverless car programs in multiple cities,2018-03-19T19:00:48Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Arizona Woman Hit by Uber’s Self-Driving Car Could Be First Pedestrian Killed by an Autonomous Vehicle,http://time.com/5205767/uber-autonomous-car-crash-arizona/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/uber-autonomous-vehicle-crash-arizona.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,fatality,1

Steven Musil,"Wichita Police Department bodycam image of the officer-involved shooting Thursday. Wichita Police Department The police and FBI are investigating whether an argument between two players of the online game Call of Duty may have lead to the death of an unarmed man in Kansas on Thursday. A ""prankster"" called 911 on Thursday and made a false report of a shooting and kidnapping, leading to the officer-involved fatal shooting of a 28-year-old Wichita father of two, Wichita Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston said during a news conference Friday. Livingston didn't discuss the online game but said investigators were tracking online leads. ""We believe this incident is a case of 'swatting,' which is the act of deceiving emergency services into sending a police response to another person's address,"" Livingston said. Tyler Barriss, 25, was arrested Friday in connection to the hoax call to 911 that lead to the death of an Wichita man on Thursday. Glendale (Calif.) Police Department The Los Angeles Police Department arrested 25-year-old Tyler Barriss on Friday in connection with the call, LAPD spokesman Mike Lopez said Saturday. Barriss has been previously arrested for allegedly phoning in bomb threats. Barriss couldn't be reached for comment, and it wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Wichita police responded to a 911 call (see video below) Thursday indicating that an armed man was holding his family hostage. There was no hostage situation, but police say they shot and killed a man who answered the door after he reached for his waistband several times. The deceased man, who was unarmed, has been identified as 28-year-old Andrew Finch. According to Finch's family, he didn't play video games and was uninvolved in the dispute. The phenomenon of swatting, anonymous reports of fake hostage situations, shootings and other violent crimes, has grown in recent years, particularly among online gamers and hackers. The FBI estimates that roughly 400 cases of swatting occur annually. The hoax call was made after a dispute over a wager in a game of Call of Duty, according to Dexerto, an online news service focused on gaming. Security researcher Brian Krebs, himself a former swatting victim, tracked down the alleged parties to the dispute on Twitter. According to Krebs, a Twitter user with the handle @SWauTistic threatened to swat another user who goes by the name @7aLeNT. After the fatality was reported by the news media, @SWauTistic denied responsibility, according to tweets obtained by Krebs.

AppleInsider,"Following the death late Sunday of a woman who was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber car in Arizona, we now know more about the circumstances of the tragedy, which has a chance to shake public trust in autonomous car technology. The deceased has been identified as Elaine Herzberg, 49, and according to police at a press conference Monday, she was walking her bicycle outside of the crosswalk while crossing the street in Temple, Ariz. According to a San Francisco Chronicle report Tuesday, the collision took place after Herzberg ""abruptly walked from a center median into a lane of traffic"". Sylvia Moir, Temple's police chief, told the Chronicle that, having viewed videos from the car's cameras, ""it's very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway."" Moir went on to predict that for that reason, Uber would be unlikely to be found at fault for the crash, although she wouldn't rule out charges against the car's test driver. Uber, however, announced Monday that it was pulling testing of self-driving cars, effective immediately. The tragedy is the first known pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving car, although a test driver for Tesla's autopilot technology was killed in June of 2016. Uber's self-driving cars had driven 2 million miles of testing, as of December, and one million of those had been driven in the previous 100 days, Forbes reported at the time. So Uber's self-driving cars have now recorded one fatality in around 3 million miles, whereas the current U.S. rate is 1.16 people for every 100 million miles driven, according to figures reported by Wired. Apple is ramping up its own self-driving car initiative, with up to 45 such cars on the road in California, the Financial Times reported Tuesday. It's unclear whether the fatality in Arizona will impact those plans in any way.","Following the death late Sunday of a woman who was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber car in Arizona, we now know more about the circumstances of the tragedy, which has a chance to shake public trust in autonomous car technology.",2018-03-20T16:46:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Appleinsider.com'}","Uber unlikely to blame for self-driving car fatality, says police chief",https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/20/uber-unlikely-to-blame-for-self-driving-car-fatality-says-police-chief,https://apple.insidercdn.com/gallery/25328-34214-uberself-xl.jpg,,Appleinsider.com,fatality,1
Hilary Brueck and Peter Kotecki,"Earthquakes kill, on average, about 20,000 people every year. 
 When a quake strikes, there's very little time to prepare, and survival has a lot to do with luck: Building codes, the time of day, and even the weather (which can trigger avalanches and mudslides) can play a role in how much destruction an earthquake causes. 
 It has generally been tough to determine where in the world people are most at risk, since there was no standardized, comprehensive way to compare the consequences of shaking around the world. 
 But now, a new mapping project led by the Global Earthquake Model Foundation (GEM) has done just that. 
 ""No one's ever created a global earthquake risk map at this level of detail before, and certainly not for the public,"" GEM Secretary General John Schneider told Business Insider. 
 GEM scientists pinpointed which parts of the world are most at risk of earthquakes and where people can expect these disasters to do the most damage. They factored in the latest earthquake science, like ground-shake potential, as well as the human element: how exposed and vulnerable people are to earthquakes in different areas of the world. They took into account how fragile people's homes, schools and workplaces are; how densely populated earthquake-prone regions are; and, to some extent, what previous fatality numbers have been. The effort included hundreds of collaborators from public, private, and academic institutions around the world who worked together on what's now an open-source collection of maps. 
 ""This allows one to get much more detailed information about the types of buildings, the population density, the potential for fatalities, the potential for damage, and economic loss essentially anywhere in the world,"" Schneider said. 
 After working on the maps for many years, the scientists realized that 15 countries account for most of the death and destruction wrought by earthquakes. They calculated that quakes cost us about $93.7 million globally, when expenses are normalized on a per-meter-squared basis (the researchers accounted for differences in construction costs across countries ). 
 Of that $93.7 million, the following 15 countries rack up nearly all the damage: more than $71.5 million, the researchers estimate. Here's who's most at risk of a coming quake, according to the experts, in order from highest potential for loss to lowest.","Earthquakes kill roughly 20,000 people each year, on average.

George Dvorsky,"A 68-year-old Seattle woman who died after contracting a rare brain-eating amoeba used regular tap water to rinse her sinuses, according to new research. As noted in a new International Journal of Infectious Diseases case study, the infection was initially misdiagnosed as a brain tumor. During surgery to remove the suspected tumor, the lead neurosurgeon, Charles Cobbs from Seattles Swedish Medical Center, was taken aback by the extent of the brain damage. So he extracted a sample for further testing. When I operated on this lady, a section of her brain about the size of a golf ball was bloody mush, Cobbs told the Seattle Times. There were these amoeba all over the place just eating brain cells. We didnt have any clue what was going on, but when we got the actual tissue we could see it was the amoeba. Indeed, the ensuing biopsy report showed that the woman had been infected with a rare brain-eating amoeba called Balamuthia mandrillaris. These sorts of infections are quite rare, but whats unique about this incident is that its the first case of Balamuthia mandrillaris brain infection suspected from nasal lavage, according to the case study, which was authored by Swedish scientists and the doctors who worked on the case, Cobbs included. By nasal lavage the researchers are referring to the use of a neti pota teapot-shaped device that relieves sinus pressure by flushing water through the nasal cavity. The researchers said the patient used tap water filtered through a store-bought water filter, instead of the recommended boiled or saline water. As a user of neti pots, this comes as a shock to me. I admittedly did not know that boiled or saline water is supposed to be used instead of tap waterand I suspect this comes as a surprise to a lot of other people, as well. Its July, and, like clockwork, brain-eating amoebas are back in the news. Last week, the deadly Read more Read B. mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that lives in soil and freshwater. This single-celled organism is not to be confused with Naegleria fowleri, another brain-eating amoeba that also lives in freshwater. Unlike N. fowleri, however, which kills its human victims in a matter of days, the B. mandrillaris amoeba requires more time to inflict its damage. In this case, the woman lived for about a year after becoming infected, according to the report. These amoebas traditionally live in the warm climates of South and Central America, but climate change may be opening up new habitatsincluding in northern U.S. states like Washington. B. mandrillaris was first detected in 1986 in a mandrill monkey kept at San Diego Zoo. It was declared a distinct species in 1993, according to the report. Globally, only 200 infections have ever been recorded, of which 70 occurred in the United States. Alarmingly, the fatality rate if practically 100 percent. Normally, an extra effort is required to bring on an infection; it cannot be contracted by drinking contaminated water. In cases involving N. fowleri, for example, people have contracted the amoeba by jumping into a lake and having water shoot up their noses. In this case, however, it was the neti rinse device that delivered the amoebas, via infected tap water, into her nasal passages and into her olfactory nerves, the scientists said. For this poor woman, who died from the brain infection this past February, the condition had first manifested as a skin rash on her nose. Not suspecting anything particularly unusual, her doctors diagnosed it as a rosacea, a common skin condition, with treatments lasting for about a year. It wasnt until the woman suffered a stroke, and had CT scans done of her brain, that the brain tumor was diagnosedor more accurately, misdiagnosed. The womans brain surgery and subsequent biopsy finally revealed the true nature of her condition. Despite aggressive anti-amoebic therapy, the patients condition continued to deteriorate, noted the authors of the report. Within one week she was more somnolent [sleepy] and then became comatose. Repeat CT imaging demonstrated further hemorrhage into the original resection cavity. At this point, the family decided to withdraw support. The patient died about a month after finally receiving the correct diagnosis. Indeed, the incident shows how notoriously difficult it is to correctly diagnose this kind of infection. As the researchers noted in the case study, theres still much to learn about the mode of and reasons for these infections, such as the influence of compromised immune systems, environmental factors, and genetics. In the meantime, the scientists recommend that doctors conduct amoeba testing in cases of nasal sores and ring-enhancing brain lesions. Importantly, the scientists said we should not give up on neti pots, as the devices present a good way of getting nasal relief. As long as we wash the containers properly and use either boiled or saline water we should be okay.

Laignee Barron,"Two sisters bled to death in Somalia after they were forced to undergo female genital mutilation earlier this week, the latest tragic death in a country where most women and girls are subjected to the procedure, CNN reports. Aasiyo Abdi Warsame, 10 and her sister, Khadijo, 11, were cut in a remote village in Puntland State in the northeast on Sept. 11. They continued to bleed 24 hours after the procedure, according Aden Mohamed, director of the Somalia’s women’s rights group Galkayo Education Center for Peace and Development. As their mother tried to take them to a health center, both girls died. “Unfortunately, they never made it to the hospital,” Aden Mohamed said. In Somalia, 98% of women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 have been cut, the highest rate anywhere in the world, according to the UN Children’s Fund. For most girls in Somalia, a severe form of the circumcision is performed when they are between the ages of four and eleven. The operation is often done by untrained midwives using knives, razors or glass. Around 200 million women and girls around the world are survivors of female genital mutilation (FGM), which can cause lifelong health problems, including dangerous complications in childbirth. Most countries recognize FGM as a violation of women’s rights, yet it continues to be widely practiced. The girls’ deaths this week come as Somalia pursues its first FGM-related prosecution. The case was prompted by the death of 10-year-old girl two months ago. In response to the fatality, Somalia’s Deputy Prime Minister Mahdi Mohamed Gulaid spoke out against the practice. “It is not acceptable that in the 21st century FGM is continuing in Somalia. It should not be part of our culture. It is definitely not part of the Islamic religion,” he said. In 2012, the country’s new constitution aimed to ban the practice, but made little headway. More than half of Somalian women believe FGM should be abolished, according to the UN.","The sisters, ages 10 and 11, bled to death after they were forced to undergo female genital mutilation",2018-09-14T08:31:40Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Two Sisters Bled to Death in Somalia After a Female Genital Mutilation Procedure,http://time.com/5396125/somalia-female-genital-mutilation-death/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-914907094.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,fatality,1

"Ryan Jenkins, Jesse Kirkpatrick, Ryan Jenkins, Jesse Kirkpatrick","Autonomous vehicles are supposed to be safer than human drivers. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. On Sunday night, a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. This appears to be the first fatality in which a self-driving car was involved. The facts of the case remain unclear, and interpretation of the events will likely change as the local authorities and the National Transportation Safety Board investigate. And while a tremendous amount of ink had already been spilled about the looming ethical challenges of autonomous vehicles—both in academia and public fora —this case ultimately might not help us settle the burning issues that surround this new technology. Here’s what we know. The pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg, was struck by Uber’s Volvo XC90 SUV as she attempted to cross a street in Tempe, Arizona. While the Tempe police have made no conclusions about who is at fault, video footage of the crash shows Herzberg attempting to cross the street with a bike, outside of a protected crosswalk, about 10 p.m. The Uber vehicle had a “safety driver”—a human in the driver seat—who is supposed to take control in the event of an emergency. It appears the driver was looking down and only realized what was happening when she heard the sound of the impact. Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir stated, “It’s very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode.” Nevertheless, Uber has suspended its testing of self-driving cars throughout North America—in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Toronto. So what does this mean for the testing and rollout of self-driving vehicles? Will states like Arizona, which serves as the anarchic frontier of self-driving regulations since the governor issued an executive order on the testing of self-driving cars, apply the brakes and tighten regulations? Is self-driving technology, even in beta mode, not yet ready for prime time? Many discussing the Uber crash have reiterated familiar worries about the safety of self-driving vehicles. That’s an important topic, one that needs debate. But an even greater risk is that, when considering these questions, we might lose sight of one of the major projected benefits of self-driving cars: that they are expected to ultimately save lives of tens of thousands of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Perhaps a better question than “Are self-driving cars safe?” is “Should we blame an autonomous vehicle more than we would a human driver in a similar case?” Autonomous vehicles are supposed to be safer than human drivers—this has been sold to us as their principal benefit. Given that, isn’t it only fair to hold AVs to higher standards than humans? If that were true, we might think this crash is actually worse than if it had been the result of a human driver. For example, imagine you are walking along a sidewalk when you see a stranger clutch his chest and keel over. You stoop down to perform CPR. Now, in this situation, if you are a trained physician, a bystander would reasonably demand more of you, precisely because of your greater capacities. If you fail to revive this person, you have done something that is less easily excused than if someone else with no medical training had failed in the same task. What it is reasonable to blame someone for is proportionate to what we could have expected of her, and what we can expect of someone is proportionate to her capacities. The manufacturers of autonomous vehicles may find themselves in an analogous situation: Because they have trumpeted the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles, they have dramatically raised the public’s expectations. While autonomous vehicles can be expected to lower the number of traffic fatalities greatly, we might also view the harms and deaths they will inevitably cause as worse than those caused by human drivers. How much worse will be a matter of debate. But we are stuck in a Catch-22 for the time being, and the public seems to want it both ways: Autonomous vehicles will be superior to human drivers, despite the deaths they may cause, at the same time that each particular self-driving car crash is worse. How good is “good enough” when bringing autonomous vehicles onto the road? However, the Uber fatality probably cannot help us answer the most urgent and compelling ethical questions that have haunted discussions of autonomous vehicles: the question of responsibility for harms or deaths. Similar worries confound the development of all systems that act so autonomously that they take a human out of the loop for decisions that could cause harm. In legal circles, they say that “bad facts make bad law”: A precedent built on facts that are not favorable to begin with is not going to be useful. This particular crash provides an imperfect test case. Judging from early reports, with the caveat that the investigation is still ongoing, it seems that the pedestrian was at fault and that it would have been nearly impossible for any driver—human or machine—to prevent this accident. (Some things are simply ruled out by the laws of physics.) Finally, there was a human in the car monitoring the car’s activity, so the blame would not fall to the machine itself or the creators of its algorithmic programming. Manufacturers, the public, and regulators still await what would be the true test case of the ethics of autonomous vehicles: an empty car in full autonomous mode striking a pedestrian who is in no way at fault, especially if a human driver could have been expected to avoid causing that harm. The slim solace that this tragic accident brings is that it presents the opportunity to have a full and open debate about the appropriate standards for blame in the event of such accidents. Doing so can help us shed some light on just how good is good enough when bringing autonomous vehicles onto the road. Unfortunately, this may turn out to be a case of what the Uber crash doesn’t tell us.","On Sunday night, a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.

Ford F, +1.00% said the death happened on July 1 in West Virginia and was reported to the auto maker on Dec. 22. Ford inspectors confirmed days later that a faulty Takata air bag inflater ruptured, “resulting in a driver fatality,” the company said in a statement. The fatality brings the death toll from defective Takata air bags to 15 in the U.S. and 21 globally, along with hundreds of injuries. Defective inflaters cause the air bags to rupture with too much force, spraying shrapnel inside the vehicle. The faulty part has triggered the largest recall in history, covering 46 million vehicles in the U.S. and millions more globally. Less than half of the affected U.S. vehicles have been fixed, according to federal data.

Bruce Brown,"KTVU Fox 2 On Friday, March 23rd, a Tesla Model X crashed into a concrete divider on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, California. The driver died in a hospital after the crash, Reuters reported. In Tesla’s initial report following the accident, the company included photos of a crash attenuator at the accident site before retrieving the car’s computer logs. One photo shows the safety device appearing in proper condition on an unstated date. The second image, taken on March 22 by a dash cam in a car driven by a witness to the accident, shows the same barrier crushed from an earlier crash. According to Tesla, “The reason this crash was so severe is that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had either been removed or crushed in a prior accident without being replaced.” In a follow-up report after Tesla retrieved the car’s logs, the company stated, “In the moments before the collision, which occurred at 9:27 a.m. on Friday, March 23rd, Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.” Reacting to criticism that Tesla lacks empathy for crash tragedy when it quotes the relative statistical safety of driving in Telsa vehicles, the company stated, “Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer’s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss.” Tesla’s Autopilot warnings, and the company’s admonitions about not using the system without keeping hands on the wheel and eyes on the road, do not mean the system is safe from misuse. Following the first Tesla fatality in 2016, the National Traffic Safety Board reported the driver was at fault for not paying attention and for “overreliance on vehicle automation.” The NTSB also reported at the time that Tesla “could have taken further steps the prevent the system’s misuse,” Reuters reported. The NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are both investigating this month’s accident. Human error is widely considered at least partially responsible for more than 90 percent of fatal accidents each year, as documented by a study published by Stanford Law School. Tesla states there is one automobile fatality for all vehicles for every 86 million miles, but one fatality for every 320 million miles with Teslas equipped with Autopilot hardware. According to Tesla’s figures, Tesla drivers with Autopilot hardware are 3.7 times less likely to be in a fatal accident.","Tesla reported that repeated Autopilot warnings were ignored prior to a fatal crash in a Tesla Model X in Mountain View, California.

They were gleaned from NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, and from an analysis of all passenger vehicle crashes that involved a fatality. And the conclusion, as found by NHTSA, is this: ""Using the most recent fatal crash data, this analysis supports previous research in finding that a higher proportion of the occupants of older MY vehicles suffered a fatal injury. In addition, the proportion of vehicle occupants who were fatally injured increases with the age of the vehicle."" In a statement, NHTSA Deputy Administrator Heidi King added, ""We encourage car buyers to select vehicles that meet their individual lifestyle, budget and transportation needs with the added assurance that they are making an investment in safety.""

Reuters,"WASHINGTON — U.S. traffic deaths fell 3.1 percent in the first six months of 2018, according to preliminary figures released on Wednesday. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also reported that for all of 2017 traffic deaths fell by 1.8 percent to 37,133 after traffic deaths rose sharply in the previous two years, according to final figures. The U.S. traffic fatality rate fell to 1.08 deaths per 100 million miles traveled for the first half of 2018. The fatality rate in 2017 was 1.16 million deaths per 100 million miles traveled — the second highest rate since 2008. The Governors Highway Safety Association noted that a strong economy usually correlates with an increase in traffic deaths ""so this drop, while small, is encouraging news."" NHTSA Deputy Administrator Heidi King said the agency is looking at a variety of factors to explain the reduction. Automakers are adding more crash avoidance features to vehicles to help warn motorists of a potential crash or slow a vehicle ""and we're very hopeful that will continue to be part of a trend,"" King said. The agency said over the last four decades the general downward trend in vehicle deaths is attributed to a variety of factors including increased seat belt use, reduced impaired driving and features like air bags and electronic stability control. The only increase in traffic death categories in 2017 was a 9 percent jump in deaths involving large trucks, including tractor-trailers. Deaths among truck drivers increased 16 percent. Officials noted that a growing U.S. economy means more freight is traveling on U.S. roads, one factor in the increase. Deaths involving the largest trucks above 26,000 pounds rose by 3.8 percent in 2017. Reporting by David Shepardson Related Video:","Filed under: Etc., Safety They fell for 2017, too.

dispensaries.com,"February 21, 2018 4 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. Driving while high has not risen to the level of havoc caused by drunken driving but it has become enough of a problem that government officials in Colorado and the state’s marijuana industry have teamed up to address it. In 2016 alone, the state had 77 fatal wrecks that involved drivers with THC in their bloodstream, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. THC is the chemical ingredient in cannabis that is psychoactive - in other words, it’s what causes the high feeling. Officials in the Rocky Mountain State have partnered with the marijuana industry to launch a new project that offers state residents the chance to participate in a “Cannabis Conversation” by taking an online survey. The survey is designed to gather the opinions of state residents regarding the drugged driving issue and collect information on their habits and behavior regarding marijuana use and driving. That information will, in turn, guide public officials and the marijuana industry on practical ways to reduce drugged driving. It’s a multi-year effort. It’s also needed because both law enforcement officials and businesses involved with legal marijuana recognize past efforts have not worked. Related: Cannabis Industry Likely to Employ More Than 400,000 By 2021, Study Projects Complicated and controversial Driving under the influence of cannabis is a complicated, and even controversial, topic for many reasons. State police, academic researchers and private companies are still looking for ways to accurately determine whether a driver is impaired. There is continued debate over what even constitutes driving while impaired by cannabis. The issue also has been politicized. Fatality figures such as the one from 2016 in Colorado are used by marijuana opponents to argue against legalization. Industry advocates point out such numbers have not been treated as a litmus test for legalization of products. Our own federal government reports that more than 16 million Americans live with diseases caused by cigarette smoking. Also, excessive use of alcohol led to about 88,000 deaths every year between 2006 and 2010. That offers perspective, but no one argues drugged driving is an issue that can be ignored. Related: The Business of Cannabis (Infographic) The Colorado Approach Both Colorado officials and marijuana industry leaders have led public education efforts in the past to educate against drugged driving. The state Department of Transportation reports that those efforts have reached 90 percent of those who use marijuana in the state. They now understand they can get a DUI for drugged driving. However, more than 50 percent of marijuana users “consistently” report they drove while high in the last 30 days. What gives? State officials suspect that people have a different view of drugged driving than they do drunk driving. They hope the “Colorado Conversation” will provide insight into people’s attitudes on the issue, as well as more information on how often they do it and under what circumstances. Sam Cole, safety communications manager at Colorado Department of Transportation, told the CBS affiliate in Denver that the initiative is about “hearing from many different voices on the topic of driving high and understanding how we can more effectively connect with people about the dangers of doing so.” Cole also noted that while drunk driving has been a topic in the national conversation for decades ”we aren’t having the same conversations about driving high.” Kristi Kelly, executive director of Colorado’s Marijuana Industry Group, said cannabis businesses are partnering with the state on the program because “responsible consumption and reducing marijuana-impaired driving is a shared priority.” Follow dispensaries.com on Twitter to stay up to date on the latest cannabis news.","More than half of marijuana users surveyed said they ""consistently"" drove while high in the last 30 days.",2018-02-21T19:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}",Colorado Starts a 'Cannabis Conversation' On Driving While High,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/309261,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20180220202135-GettyImages-485849816.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,fatality,1
ABC News,"Coal mining deaths in the U.S. nearly doubled last year, after a record low in 2016, according to data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. There were 15 people killed in coal mining jobs in 2017 versus eight in 2016. Despite the increase, mining deaths have been steadily declining for several years. Since the turn of the century, MSHA's fatality reports peaked at 42 fatalities in 2001 and generally declined since. Fatalities have not exceeded 20 since an explosion at a West Virginia mine killed 38 people in 2010. The rise comes as President Trump has sold himself and his administration as champions for coal, promising a revival for the industry. In September, the president nominated, and the senate barely passed, David Zatezalo as the new chief of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Zatezalo is a former coal industry executive. In surface mining, trucks haul dirt and stones, called overburden, from one part to another as other haul trucks move the coal found directly below. A Charleston-Gazette Mail analysis of regulatory filings turned up three mining deaths in which Zatezalo was a manager or general manager at the time of the accident. Zatezalo said during confirmation hearings that he replaced local managers in those cases and plans to make safety a priority. ""Inspections in the mines in the United States are a necessity,"" he said, calling it one of the primary tasks of the agency he now leads. Most of last year's deaths came before Zatezalo took leadership at MSHA in September. A spokesperson for Zatezalo released a new statement on Wednesday, after the report was released. ""President Trump is strongly committed to the health and safety of America’s miners. At MSHA, our focus is on ensuring that every miner is able to return safely to their loved ones at the end of every shift,"" Zatezalo said in the statement. ""To ensure the health and safety of miners, MSHA will continue to vigorously emphasize safety enforcement, technology, education and training, and compliance and technical assistance."" A plume of steam billows from the coal-fired Merrimack Station in Bow, N.H., Jan. 20, 2015. MSHA has previously credited low mining fatality numbers to fewer people working in the field and tougher safety enforcement. At least seven of the mining fatalities in 2017 involved workers with one year or less experience at the mine. According to agency data, miners with less than 12 months experience at a mine or in a particular job have a higher injury rate than more experienced miners. In June, MSHA began an evaluation and training program focused on those hired or in their current role for less than 12 months. In 2011, about 92,000 miners were actively working in the field, according to MSHA, compared with about 52,000 in 2016. Employment numbers for 2017 are not yet available.","Coal mining deaths in the U.S. nearly doubled last year, after a record low in 2016, according to data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Reuters,"A Tesla Model 3 at the company's retail store at Westfield Century City. Bryan Logan/Business Insider (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is aiming to ramp up production to 6,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June to reach its weekly goal of 5,000 and allow for a margin of error, automotive news website Electrek reported on Tuesday, citing a letter to employees from Chief Executive Elon Musk. Underscoring Tesla's need to roll out cars quickly to customers and collect needed revenue, the company will also begin working around the clock on the Model 3 sedan, adding another shift within general assembly, and both the body and paint shops, Electrek quoted Musk as saying. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The news comes a day after Tesla temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line in what the company said was a planned pause, its second since February, to improve automation and address bottlenecks that have delayed production. ""We will be stopping for three to five days to do a comprehensive set of upgrades. This should set us up for Model 3 production of 3,000 to 4,000 per week next month,"" Electrek quoted Musk as saying. ""Another set of upgrades starting in late May should be enough to unlock production capacity of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June,"" he added. Investors are closely watching to see if Tesla is able to meet long-delayed targets and quickly ramp up the Model 3, on which the company's future profitability rests. Tesla is pressured on a host of fronts after a fatality in one of its vehicles using its Autopilot system, a downgrade by Moody's, and a public spat between Musk and safety regulators. Tesla's use of robots to assemble Model 3s has led to more complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged last week in a tweet: ""Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."" ""Tesla's been trying to run full tilt,"" said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors, before Musk's letter was published. ""He's sleeping overnight on the production floor. I don't think there is any way they'd purposely want to slow production. It tells me something's not quite right."" In the letter to employees cited by Electrek, Musk said Tesla had built over 2000 Model 3s per week for three weeks, with 2250 made last week. Tesla had previously targeted 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 by the end of the second quarter. Missed deadlines threaten the money-losing company's credibility with the market and its ability to raise cash. Musk has said no new funds are needed this year, although many analysts dispute that. Musk rallied employees in the letter, while warning departments or suppliers who missed the mark, saying they would need a ""very good explanation"" and a plan for fixing the problem presented directly to him. Shares of Tesla, which ended 1.2 percent lower on Tuesday, rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading.

Ed Cara,"Ebola has once again resurfaced. On Friday, the World Health Organization reported that there have been at least 34 suspected cases of the viral disease and 18 deaths since early April in the Bikoro District of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). But Ebola’s resurgence, hardly unexpected, can’t help but bring a question to mind: Why haven’t we found a surefire way to cure or prevent it yet? The short answer is that, for the majority of Ebola’s known existence, governments and pharmaceutical companies didn’t allocate the sort of resources needed to find and develop treatments, both for practical and economical reasons. But following the major outbreak of Ebola in 2014, that trend is changing. Sufferers of Ebola initially develop a flu-like illness. Oftentimes, though, the virus tears through the immune system with ease, causing it to spiral out of control and attack the body in a desperate bid to kill the virus. Ebola also infects the cells that line our blood vessels and organs, hampering their ability to properly clot, which helps trigger the telltale widespread hemorrhaging. The first known outbreak of Ebola occurred in the DRC, then called Zaire, in 1976. It was there that the disease, named after a nearby river, became synonymous with death. It killed 280 of the 318 people known to have been infected. But while Ebola (and its cousin the Marburg virus) justifiably earned a frightening reputation over the next few decades, it never became the worst-case scenario some journalists and Hollywood screenwriters pumped it up to be—a pandemic killer that jumps from person to person with ease. And that sputtering out made the prospect of finding a cure or vaccine much less of a priority. Humans, for one, aren’t the main host of Ebola, though it’s still a bit of mystery as to what is (the smart money right now is on fruit bats). Whichever animal is the primary host, they only seem to live in select parts of West Africa and don’t come into contact with people enough to constantly transmit the disease, unlike, say, mosquitos. Even once it infects people, Ebola’s potential to spread pales in comparison to the flu or even a typical stomach bug. Person-to-person transmission requires close, prolonged contact with contaminated bodily fluids like blood and semen. Because of these factors, Ebola didn’t sicken that many people for the longest time. Prior to the outbreak of 2014, it’s estimated that there were under 2,500 reported cases of Ebola worldwide. For context, malaria killed almost a half million people in 2016 alone. In some cases, the lethality of a particular Ebola strain kept outbreaks from having enough time to spread far (there are five known types of the virus, one of which doesn’t sicken humans, and their fatality rates range from 25 percent to 90 percent). Public health organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO did devote time to studying viruses like Ebola, of course, especially given the potential for them to be weaponized as a bioterrorism threat. And researchers, often government-funded, did try to develop experimental treatments and vaccines, though these either failed or very slowly progressed. But pharmaceutical companies and even affected governments didn’t think it was worth putting too much money toward finding a way to combat something that was seen as more of a morbid curiosity than an urgent public health threat. A 2016 study, for instance, found that from 1997 to 2013, a total of about $600 million (in 2015 dollars) was spent across the US and the Europe on Ebola and Marburg research, primarily by government and nonprofit sources. That might sound like a lot, but the US spent over $500 billion on public and private R&amp;D in 2015 alone. There’s some justification for this research lag. From 1979 to 1994, for example, there were exactly zero cases of Ebola reported at all. But there’s also the fact that outbreaks tended to happen among people living in isolated and impoverished areas of Africa, making it even less of an interest for profit-minded pharma companies. Of course, things changed in 2014, when the largest outbreak of Ebola yet scorched through West Africa and even reached Dallas and New York City. By the time the outbreak was declared over in 2016, there were nearly 30,000 suspected cases of Ebola and 11,000 deaths. That outbreak set off a wave of outsized panic in the US, as well as discrimination against people perceived to be African. As illogical as that reaction was, given the minuscule threat posed by Ebola in America, it did lead to an outpouring of resources into Ebola research across the US and elsewhere, particularly in trying to create a vaccine. The experimental vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV was originally developed by publicly funded Canadian researchers starting in 2003. But by the time the 2014 outbreak began spreading widely, it was in the hands of biopharmaceutical company NewLink Genetics Corporation. It then sold the rights to Merck later that year. And in 2015, Merck, working together with the WHO and other public health organizations, tested rVSV-ZEBOV in over 5,000 people living in Guinea, where cases of the disease were still popping up. By the end of 2016, researchers reported that the vaccine had seemingly been a success. No one who took the vaccine became sick 10 days or more after they got the shot, compared to 23 people who went unvaccinated and became ill. There has been debate about whether the vaccine is 100 percent effective, given earlier studies that found a lower effectiveness, but a study published in the Lancet this April suggested that the vaccine provides at least two years of protection against infection. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is still experimental and only protects against the Ebola Zaire virus, though that is the most common type of Ebola in humans and was responsible for the 2014 outbreak. Health officials have already deployed the vaccine in smaller-scale outbreaks, and they’re similarly planning to use it in the current outbreak. There are also potential antiviral treatments for Ebola in development, though it may take a long time for any to become widely available even if they work, since the typically low number of cases in an outbreak makes clinical research difficult to perform. Other pharmaceutical companies are testing out their vaccines in early clinical trials, while researchers elsewhere are trying to find a way to create a vaccine that can protect against multiple, if not all, types of Ebola. And from 2014 to 2015, upwards of $400 million in Ebola and Marburg research funding was spent throughout the US and Europe. As great as a foolproof treatment for Ebola would be, it’s only part of what’s needed to keep the virus from causing harm. Just as important is a well-funded health care infrastructure that can identify cases quickly, prevent further transmission, and provide something as simple as treatment beds for the sick.","Ebola has once again resurfaced.

Mike Fahey,"Its got advanced character customization options, some new fight mechanics. time travel and an MMA fighter as Sonya Blade, but so far, Mortal Kombat 11 looks like more Mortal Kombat with the gore dialed up a notch. 
Great fountains of blood punctuated our first look at NetherRealm Studios latest in action. Mortal Kombat is known for how its fighters open up to each other as they battle, and the first gameplay trailers got plenty of that. Heads, hearts, brains and other bits pop out, accompanied by strands of glistening viscera and waterfalls of crimson goo.
I am not normally squeamish in the face of Mortal Kombats exposed body parts and such, but something about this latest round had my stomach doing cartwheels. 
In case you cant get enough of this stuff, heres the fatality trailer, which is so squelchy. 
Visitors to the special reveal event, which include Kotakus own Nathan Grayson, will get hands-on time with seven new and returning kombatants. Mainstays Sonya Blade, Baraka, Sub-Zero, Raiden and Scorpion are joined by returning MK9 DLC fighter Skarlet, as well as a brand-new character named Geras, who seems pretty bad-ass.
Taking a cue from NetherRealms Injustice 2, players will be able to load up their Mortal Kombat 11 characters with different weapons, skins, costume pieces, intros and more. 
Mechanics-wise, we were given a look at a couple of new features in the game. In the bottom corners of the screen, players now have two meters: one for offensive moves and one for defensive. Like the super moves in Injustice 2, players will build meter to unleash gory Fatal Blows. They generally arent fatal, but should beSonyas involves shooting her opponent through the head. Also, players who perform a Perfect Block will break out of an attack directly into a combo, which sounds fancy. 
Other than those few features, nothing much else was discussed, aside from a glimpse at the new games story. Picking up after Mortal Kombat 9, the story prologue trailer shows a more brutal version of Raiden removing Shinooks head. Then, a mysterious new character named Kronika appears. She apparently will use her time manipulation powers to pit Mortal Kombatants against different versions of themselvesyoung, old, customized, et cetera.
Mortal Kombat 11 launches a worldwide on April 21, with a multiplayer beta kicking off on March 28. We should have more on the game after Nathan has gotten his dirty little paws on it later today.","It’s got advanced character customization options, some new fight mechanics. time travel and an MMA fighter as Sonya Blade, but so far, Mortal Kombat 11 looks like more Mortal Kombat with the gore dialed up a notch.

"Morten Wendelbo/The Conversation, Morten Wendelbo/The Conversation","Leer en español. Last September, President Donald Trump told Puerto Ricans they should be grateful Hurricane Maria had not caused a “real catastrophe like Katrina.” However, mounting evidence now reveals the death toll for Maria far surpasses initial estimates. New research puts the number close to 3,000, adjusted up from just a few dozen when the president made his now infamous remark. This is an estimate, but it is virtually certain that the number is in the thousands. The president has denied these numbers, but without offering any evidence to support his claims. The devastating truth is that most of the deaths in Puerto Rico were avoidable. The majority of fatalities were not caused by the hurricane’s force, but by the failure of the U.S. disaster response system. Many people died in the days and months after Maria because they lacked access to basic lifesaving goods and services. The president’s comparison between the Katrina disaster and Puerto Rico’s plight after Maria highlights a major underlying problem. Using fatalities to gauge the magnitude of disaster assumes that all disasters are made the same. The disaster following Hurricane Maria shows us that this is fundamentally untrue. Understanding this fact is necessary to grapple with how such a disaster was allowed to unfold on U.S. soil, despite one of the biggest and most well-prepared disaster response forces in the world. Fatality counts are virtually useless More than 3.3 million Americans were caught in Hurricane Maria’s path. Almost all of the deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. Compare that to Katrina, when a large proportion of the fatalities occurred immediately during the hurricane. Failing levies caused many to drown as their homes were engulfed in water. If judged only by the official and known death toll during the first few days or weeks, Puerto Rico appeared to have escaped a catastrophe. In reality, the early declaration that Puerto Rico had escaped catastrophe and that the federal government had already done its job may have been deadlier than the hurricane itself. While the initial death toll was low, virtually every other indicator suggested Puerto Rico would be reeling from the disaster for years and that lives were still in danger. Basic lifesaving services were inoperational, power was down on the whole island, and people were stranded around the island with no access to clean water or any kind of help. Disasters can be particularly devastating for those with poor access to government services, lower incomes, or living further from population centers. Many Puerto Ricans fit all three conditions, and most fit at least one or two. Even if the death toll had not yet grown by the time the president made his remarks, it was already clear in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane that the death toll would grow immensely in the days and weeks to follow. Maria’s long-term consequences Even then, the fatality count alone is woefully inadequate for understanding the depth of the disaster still unfolding in Puerto Rico. Considering disaster in terms of fatalities does not capture the hardship experienced by survivors. Although survivors did not pay with their lives, many lives were still changed in devastating and often permanent ways. Some of these ways are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Increased levels of disability, either directly because of a storm injury or because other conditions were not cared for properly while hospitals were shut, higher incidence of malnutrition, homelessness and lower school participation are good examples. Others are much less tangible. For example, the mental health consequences of disaster can stay with survivors for a lifetime. But all of these consequences leave both the individuals and their communities worse off, slowing recovery. Disaster responders know that these damages occur in virtually every disaster, and they are consequences not captured or foreshadowed by the fatality count. Even if the true fatality count had been a mere 64, as the original death count indicated, a strong response would have been necessary nonetheless to prevent people’s lives from being irreparably upended. The inadequate response not only caused more fatalities – it also made virtually every surviving Puerto Rican worse off. Puerto Rico may not have appeared to be a catastrophe at the time, looking only at the death toll, but the slow and inadequate response all but ensured that it would be.

Marisa Kendall,"CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device REDDING — When the smoke clears and the last hot spots have been snuffed out, they will mourn their fallen brothers. But right now, they have fires to fight. As 17 wildfires rage across California, stretching Cal Fire resources, the men and women battling the flames are doing so while also reckoning with their own grief and unease as the firefighter fatality count ticks up to an alarming height. Inmate firefighters battle the Carr Fire southwest of Redding, Calif., Sunday, July 29, 2018. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) Four firefighters have been killed in the Carr and Ferguson fires in the past two and a half weeks. That’s more than were killed in all of 2017 — and this year’s fire season has only just begun. It’s unprecedented to have this many fire line fatalities in such a short amount of time, this early in the fire season, said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox. And it’s taking a toll on the firefighters. “We’re battling two fronts — we’re battling the fire, but we’re also kind of battling this mourning that we’re as firefighters processing as well,” Cox said. “It’s not easy. It’s by no means easy. But we do what we do in everybody’s honor who put their lives out there for us.” Four Redding residents, including someone found in an evacuated home Sunday and a 70-year-old woman and her two great-grandchildren — also perished in the flames On Monday, cooler, less windy and more humid conditions were helping more than 3,000 firefighters battle the Carr Fire that in one week had become one of the top 10 most destructive wildfires in state history. Nearly 100,000 acres had been burned and 966 homes and structures have been destroyed, according to Cal Fire. By Monday morning, the fire was 20 percent contained. The milder conditions were welcome news on the front lines. “It means that hopefully the fire activity will be not as great as it was in the first few days of the fire, where you saw the fire tornado,” Cal Fire public information officer Daniel Potter said in an interview after the briefing, “because the winds won’t be there so it will be a less productive fire, so we can get more containment done faster.” Firefighters hang their heads during a morning briefing at the Carr Fire in Redding, Calif., Monday, July 29, 2018, for their four colleagues killed this year battling blazes across California. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) Firefighters on Monday were focused on keeping the blaze out of the towns of Lewiston to the northwest and Igo to the south. Another incentive to keep the fire from moving south — winds tend to pick up in that region, and can routinely reach speeds of 30 mph. Cal Fire planned to send aircraft to do water drops Monday, including 14 helicopters. The Monday morning briefing started with a moment of silence for firefighter Brian Hughes, the second firefighter killed battling the Ferguson Fire in Yosemite. Fire officials wore black bands of mourning over their badges. Many of the firefighters eating breakfast after returning from 24-hour shifts either knew or knew someone who knew someone killed in the fires this year. “It’s very sobering,” Captain Chris Auby of the Redwood City Fire Department said, “and it makes you realize that this is a dangerous job and that there’s a lot of risks.” Hughes, 33, of Hawaii, was struck and killed by a falling tree while fighting the Ferguson Fire on Sunday. Don Smith, an 81-year-old bulldozer operator from Pollock Pines, was killed Friday in the Carr Fire. Also on Friday, 37-year-old Jeremy Stoke, a fire inspector with the Redding Fire Department, was killed in the Carr Fire. Braden Varney, a 36-year-old bulldozer operator, was killed July 14 in a bulldozer rollover outside of Yosemite National Park while fighting the Ferguson fire. “It’s alarming,” Cox said of this year’s fatality count. He says the death toll is growing partly because this year’s fires have been larger, more destructive and more frequent. That’s caused by the merging of several factors, he said, extreme weather — hotter days and hotter nights — and increased development in rural areas, coupled with a heat wave and wind. Firefighters take in a morning briefing at the Carr Fire incident command in Anderson, Calif., Monday, July 29, 2018.(Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) In the midst of weeks-long stretches of 24-hour shifts, firefighters don’t have much time to reflect on the risks, or to grieve. Stoke’s funeral will be postponed until some of the fire activity dies down, freeing up his Redding firefighter colleagues to attend the service, said Cliff Allen, president of Cal Fire Local 2881, the union that represents Cal Fire employees. In the meantime, firefighters are battling more than a dozen fires throughout the state with limited resources. Cal Fire had 3,388 first responders fighting the Carr Fire on Monday, with more crews on the way — some coming from as far as Florida. The intense need for personnel has forced Cal Fire to rethink its typical strategies, said Alameda County Fire Captain Sam Lobese. Typically he responds to fires with a team of firefighters from his county. But on Sunday, he found himself working with people from St. Helena, Forestville and American Canyon. “What’s unique about what you see here — they call it a rainbow strike team because we’re from different counties,” he said. “And when you see that, that means things are stretched really thin in California. They’re just trying to get rigs from any fire department, put them together, go. Homes are burning, go.” That means everyone is working long, demanding shifts. In honor of the four firefighters killed in California this month, black bands cover the badges of firefighters at the Carr Fire in Redding, Calif., Monday, July 29, 2018. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) Auby’s day started at 5:30 a.m. Sunday, when he woke up in a trailer on the command center grounds. He and his crew headed up Quartz Hill Road in Redding to put out hot spots and prepare the neighborhood for residents to return. During the 24 hour shift, they took about three 30-minute breaks. “It is tiring,” he said. “It’s very exhausting.” Auby, who lives in Danville, expects to be in the Redding area for two weeks — but it could be longer. In the meantime his life and the lives of everyone on his team have been put on hold. That’s been hard for Jeff Kirkish, also a Redwood City firefighter, who left his six-month-old baby behind in Aptos to fight the Carr Fire. “It’s just tough,” he said. In Shasta County, dozens of roadways remain closed, including large portions of state Highway 299 and Highway 273. Another 5,012 structures remained in harm’s way, Cal Fire said. At the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, burning for more than two weeks, has burned 56,659 acres and is 30 percent contained, according to Cal Fire. The Ranch and River fires, dubbed the Mendocino Complex fires, began in Mendocino County and have since crossed into Lake County. Together, the two fires have scorched 56,000 acres.","The Mercury News Two huge fires, four firefighters dead — and the fire season just started. Why?

Kelly McLaughlin,"Shark attacks are one of the most notoriously feared dangers to beach-going humans — but how likely is it that you'd actually get bitten? Despite the mass fear surrounding the deadly animals, the chances of being attacked and killed by a shark are 1 in 3.75 million, according to the International Wildlife Museum. The chances are lower than the possibility of dying by a lightning strike, a firework accident, or excessive cold. In the wake of two shark attacks on New York's Fire Island on Wednesday, INSIDER has examined the data behind shark attacks in the US and around the world. The US has had 1,400 recorded shark attacks in the last 171 years Between 1837 and 2017, there were 1,400 recorded unprovoked shark attacks in the US, according to data obtained by the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File. The most common place to be attacked in the US is Florida, with 812 attacks since 1847. Hawaii, California and South Carolina have all had between 100 and 200 attacks since the same year. It appears that Wednesday's attacks on Fire Island were uncommon, with only 10 attacks recorded in New York since 1847. The two children in the Wednesday shark attacks, aged 12 and 13, were bitten in the legs and are expected to make full recoveries. Officials are examining a tooth found lodged in one of the teen's legs to determine what species of shark was involved. The US had the most recorded shark attacks in 2017 Around the world, there have been more than 3,000 shark attacks recorded in the last half a century. In 2017, the US had the most recorded shark attacks in the world with 53, but the country saw zero fatalities. Australia, meanwhile, ranked second in most shark attacks with 14, but had one fatality. Oceans off of Australia are known for being the habitat for deadly sharks including the Great White, Bull and Tiger sharks. Most shark attacks occur near the shore, typically in sandbars or between sandbars were sharks can become trapped during low-tide. In deeper areas, like spots with steep drop-offs, sharks congregate because creatures they feed on also congregate there. Shark attacks in the US Humans are causing more shark attacks to occur The number of shark attacks is increasing each year as more sunbathers head to the beach. Coastal development, tourism, and pollution are all partly to blame for an increase in shark attacks in recent years, as humans continue to interfere with sharks' habitats. Researchers at Bond University in Queensland, Australia found in 2016 that human interference with sharks' habitat and the rise in climate change are causing more shark attacks worldwide, according to The Independent. The destruction of their habitat has forced sharks closer to land, thus closer to humans, the researchers said. ""Coastal development and infrastructure can have major environmental implications on the distribution of sharks, and this can flow on to the number of unprovoked shark bites,"" they said in their research. Their research found that 84% of attacks occur in just six territories: the US, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, the Bahamas, and Reunion island. But the shark population is ultimately in decline because of over-fishing — approximately 100 million sharks are killed every year by fisheries.

Ed Cara,"A panel of the nation’s top public health experts is pushing for a sweeping set of policy changes and laws aimed at accomplishing an audacious goal—an end to deaths caused by drunk driving. But the recommendation touted as having the largest potential impact on deaths might also be the hardest to sell: lowering the amount of alcohol you need to drink before you legally shouldn’t get behind the wheel. On Wednesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, a mostly government-funded, but independently run organization that offers advice on national health policy, released a new consensus study report, billed as a “comprehensive approach” to the persistent problem of drunk driving. The report is the work of a committee of 13 experts sourced from places like Yale University, UCLA, and Johns Hopkins, and summarizes the existing evidence surrounding policies that attempt to reduce drunk driving deaths. It highlighted the overall success the US has had in lowering deaths caused by drunk driving since the 1980s—when laws like those that increased the legal drinking age to 21 were first implemented—but also found that the number has stayed stagnant in recent years. From 2009 to 2015, for instance, the annual reported toll has been around 10,000 deaths. The only way to substantially lower drunk driving deaths in the near future (long before, say, smart cars are in every driveway), the report concluded, is through drastic steps like banning alcohol sales from gas stations or drive-through stores; an expansion of specialized courts that provide counseling and support to repeat offenders; and the wide-scale development and implementation of interlock technologies that prevent drunk people from starting a vehicle. But chief among the recommended changes is that all states should modify the laws that dictate when someone is too drunk to drive. Currently, someone can be charged with drinking while intoxicated if they have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of.08 or higher (in many states, though, impaired drivers can still be charged with a lesser crime of driving under the influence at lower BAC levels). The report recommends the limit should be.05 instead. As most anyone well knows, lots of factors can influence someone’s potential drunkenness, including weight, gender, and how much you’ve eaten before, but very roughly speaking, it can take anywhere from two to five drinks within a hour to reach a BAC of.08. For 0.5, it might take one to three. “The plateauing fatality rates indicate that what has been done to decrease deaths from alcohol-impaired driving has been working but is no longer sufficient to reverse this growing public health problem,” report author and committee chair Steven Teutsch, a researcher at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, said in a statement. “Our report offers a comprehensive blueprint to reinvigorate commitment and calls for systematic implementation of policies, programs, and systems changes to renew progress and save lives.” This isn’t the first major push to lower the legal limit. Since 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has routinely recommended a universal decrease to at least.05 BAC or even lower. And the.05 limit seems to be a wholly uncontroversial idea among experts in the field. “There is strong empirical evidence, both from the US and from other countries, that a lower BAC limit would contribute to a safer driving environment,” Diane Silver, an associate professor of public health policy at NYU’s College of Global Public Health, tells me over email. In countries that have embraced a.05 limit, like Australia, the results have been dramatic. “A number of Australian states lowered their allowable BACs from 0.08 to 0.05 in the 1980s and studies consistently found reductions in crashes and fatalities of between 7 percent and 13 percent. This is supported by various studies from European countries that conducted similar policy changes from the 1970s onwards,” explains Michael Livingston, a senior research fellow at the Center for Alcohol Policy Research in Melbourne, Australia. “There are few downsides to the 0.05 limits that I’m aware of—they’re pretty unequivocally a life-saving measure.” Some places like Sweden have even gone with a.02 limit and seen further drops in car accidents and fatalities. Politically, though, there’s been pushback. In response to the NTSB’s initial proposal in 2013, the founder of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), Candace Lightner, said it was an impractical, unrealistic idea. Lightner left the organization in 1985 and was similarly unenthused about the idea of a.08 limit, which became the US standard in 2004. But the current iteration of MADD hasn’t backed the idea either, even as they are supportive of the new report in general. “MADD applauds this report’s recommendations, which affirm the key components of MADD’s Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving: the importance of law enforcement and sobriety checkpoints, all offender ignition interlock laws in every state, and the promise of advanced alcohol detection technologies like the Driver Alcohol System for Safety (DADSS) program,” a spokesperson with the organization’s New York chapter said in an email. “Regarding lowering the legal threshold for impairment, MADD supports the current.08 BAC laws and always says the best choice is to never drink and drive, period. If you’re going to drink, plan ahead for a designated driver, public transportation, taxis, or take an Uber.” Silver notes that other opponents have a vested interest of keeping the status quo. “Of course, efforts to lower the BAC limit have run into resistance from the hospitality industry (restaurants, hotels, bars), which contend that it will have a negative effect on their bottom line, and the alcohol industry,” she said. Critics have also argued that a lower limit would only prevent an insignificant amount of deaths, especially without the sort of aggressive enforcement of drunk driving laws found in countries with a.05 limit. (A 2017 study found that a 0.5 limit here would save at least an extra 1,750 lives a year.) As both the authors of the report and those I spoke to make clear, a lower limit in of itself wouldn’t really change things dramatically—the culture has to change, too. In Australia, Livingston said, drivers have been cowed into compliance by the country’s practice of allowing cops to issue random breathalyzer road tests, which the US and many countries don’t do. Police in the US have traditionally only been allowed to pull people over and test them if they suspect drunk driving. Over the past few decades, though, some states have cleared the use of sobriety checkpoints where police can freely screen for drunk drivers. The report highlights the expansion of these programs as a less blunt and constitutionally safe way to encourage similar deterrence, along with approaches like making rideshare programs more accessible and affordable, especially in rural areas. A.05 BAC limit might not be as unpopular as it would appear at first glance, though. An annual poll conducted by AAA of licensed drivers has consistently found that two-thirds of respondents support a lower limit. And in 2017, Utah became the first state to approve a hard.05 limit, which is expected to come into effect by December 30th, 2018. The new law, still facing opposition from the restaurant and alcohol industry, might be modified to resemble a model seen in Colorado. There, drivers found with a BAC level between.05 to.08 who are found to be driving while drunk are punished less severely than drivers with a.08 or higher BAC. If Utah’s natural experiment pans out, then.05 might indeed someday be the new number we keep in mind next time we head to the bar.",A panel of the nation’s top public health experts is pushing for a sweeping set of policy changes and laws aimed at accomplishing an audacious goal—an end to deaths caused by drunk driving.

Joel Stocksdale,"Like many drivers, we car enthusiasts love freeways with higher speed limits. But according to IIHS, going faster has consequences: more traffic fatalities.The organization analyzed traffic fatality data from 1993, when no state had a speed limit higher than 65, to 2017 when states have speed limits as high as 80 or 85 mph. After accounting for other contributing factors to the fatality rate, IIHS found that if the speed limits hadn't changed from 1993, there would have been 36,760 fewer traffic fatalities. And in 2017 alone, having had lower speed limits could have saved 1,934 people. Breaking down the statistics farther, the IIHS found that every 5-mph increase in speed limits led to an 8.5% increase in fatalities on interstates and freeways, and a 2.8% increase in fatalities on other roads.
The IIHS also highlighted historical research that supports the idea that higher speeds lead to more deaths. In the study, the organization notes that a National Research Council Committee found that 3,000 to 5,000 traffic deaths were prevented in 1974 as a result of the national 55-mph speed limit replacing state limits around 60 to 70 mph. That council also found that in 1983, the speed limit was responsible for preventing 2,000 to 4,000 deaths. Additionally, when states were allowed to raise limits up to 65 in 1987, NHTSA found that there were 2,000 more fatalities from 1987 to 1990.
The statistics certainly suggest that speed limits should be lowered. But that might be a hard sell to the American people. The IIHS paper notes that the national speed limit was raised, and eventually removed because Americans were fed up with driving so slow. And now that we're starting to drive even faster, it would probably be pretty hard to get people to give that up.","Filed under: Government/Legal, Safety IIHS looks at the effects of increasing speed limits from 1993 to 2017 Continue reading IIHS study: higher speed limits led to 36,000 extra deaths IIHS study: higher speed limits led to 36,000 extra deaths originally appe…",2019-04-04T18:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Autoblog.com'}","IIHS study: higher speed limits led to 36,000 extra deaths",https://www.autoblog.com/2019/04/04/iihs-speed-limit-deaths-study/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/4021x2263+467+604/resize/800x450!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/fbe101e0-56fe-11e9-bdef-75af9b2943c1,,Autoblog.com,fatality,1
Jack Stewart,"More than a month after a self-driving Uber struck and killed a pedestrian crossing the street in Arizona, it’s still not clear what sort of failure might explain the crash—or how to prevent it happening again. While the National Transportation Safety Board investigates, Uber’s engineers are sitting on their hands, their cars are parked. The crash and its inconclusive aftermath reflect poorly on a newborn industry predicated on the idea that letting computers take the wheel can save lives, ease congestion, and make travel more pleasant. An industry dashing toward adulthood—Google sister company Waymo plans to launch a robo-taxi service this year, General Motors is aiming for 2019—and now, suddenly, on the verge of being rejected by a public that hasn’t even experienced it yet. In other words, AV makers are clearing the technological hurdles and tripping over the psychological ones. And it’s important to recognize there are lots of stakeholders here. If these vehicles are to proliferate and change the world for the better, they’ll need support: from the public, politicians, and from regulators. In defending their technology, the self-driving promoters always resort to the same set of facts. Every year, 40,000 people die on American roads. Worldwide, it’s about 1.25 million. Millions more are left with serious injuries. Robot drivers, who don’t get tired, distracted, or drunk, could stop the bleeding. It’s a compelling and worthy objective, but one that’s almost impossible for regular drivers to relate to. Road deaths are a problem for society, not for the vast majority of people who aren’t personally affected. Driving is such a quotidian and often necessary task, it’s easy to ignore the risk that comes with every moment behind the wheel. At the same time, crashes are so common, they become background noise—and they get tuned out. Moreover, putting a serious dent in road death numbers would take decades, since robots could have to gradually replace more than a billion vehicles worldwide. Knocked onto its heels by the Uber crash and the death of a Tesla driver using Autopilot a week later, the robo-car industry needs a win—and a new playbook. “Trying to boil the oceans, and solve the complete problem all at once, has a high failure rate,” says Timothy Carone, a business professor at Notre Dame and author of Future Automation—Changes to Lives and Businesses. “One key reason that project leaders lose stakeholder support is because they don’t see the benefits clearly.” Rather than promising to save millions, the developers in Silicon Valley, Detroit, and elsewhere should offer immediate, tangible proof of their value. And no, Waymo, launching a real-deal robo-taxi service doesn’t cut it. “All they’ve proven is that a car can drive itself around Phoenix,” says Carone. “So what? They haven’t demonstrated the value.” Community Service Even if Waymo’s service does make roads safer, the problem is that people are no good at recognizing the upsides of things that don’t happen. If it wants to win over a population rattled by Uber’s crash—which surely hurt the reputation of this technology as a whole—it should offer not just a high-tech taxi, but a solution to a discrete, noticeable problem. Take teenage drunk driving: Why not offer a free service for people aged 16 to 25, between 10 pm and 2 am? You’re giving parents peace of mind, knowing their kids have an easy, convenient, way to get home if they’ve been drinking. And maybe collecting some positive statistics in the process. If the goal is specific, targeted, and it resonates with your customers, they buy into it. Here’s another idea for Waymo, Uber, Cruise, and everyone else working on computer driving: Start a shuttle service for people in suburban towns, taking them home from the local train station. It’s an easy to way to solve the last mile issue, especially for people who don’t have cars—and will make the people in neighboring towns eager to have the tech, too. “If the goal is specific, targeted, and it resonates with your customers or important stakeholders, then they buy into it,” says Stephanos Zenios at Stanford’s Center for Entrepreneurial studies, who teaches successful launch techniques at a “Startup Garage” MBA course. “It has to solve a real problem that someone has, and which is a pain for them.” The small, driverless, pod-like shuttles which companies like May Mobility are trialing are a sensible solution to mobility in downtown cores. They can pootle around at a safe 25 mph. But to a car driver, used to speed, and flexibility to choose a route, they’re hardly irresistable. What if they made their services more attractive by negotiating with cities to use bus and HOV lanes to save riders time? The results don’t have to be glorious—just tangible and relatable. If commuters save 20, even 10 minutes a day because they get to make part of their trip in an autonomous shuttle, they’re likely to think better of the tech—and vote for the politicians and regulators who support it. Rocket Science Carone cites the the SpaceX Falcon rocket program as an example of where this step-by-step tactic has worked to build support. Elon Musk’s company now has launched 53 Falcon rockets, with 51 full mission successes (including one Falcon 9 Heavy), one partial failure, and one total loss of spacecraft. It has booked more than 100 future launches, signaling that confidence in its tech is strong. That’s because each launch slowly but surely demonstrated the benefits of the SpaceX approach to improve the cost and reliability of access to space. When failures did happen, there were previous successes to confirming the benefits of the approach. Uber has also seen the benefits of a phased approach in its core business, ridesharing. The app started in 2009 as a way for people to book rides in fancy black cars. It evolved into a peer-to-peer service, a useful alternative to lacking public transit and expensive, hard-to-find taxis. Over the years, it added special features for large groups, kids, people with pets, and riders in wheelchairs. And so when London threatened to withdraw Uber’s licence to operate in the city, more than 850,000 people signed a petition to keep the company around. That’s the kind of support Uber could use now, for its autonomous driving program. Same goes for Tesla, and other automakers offering semi-autonomous systems that take over the driving task, with human supervision. Last month, a Model X driver using Autopilot hit a highway barrier and died. In response, Tesla wrote a blog post that said, “If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident.” It added that there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles. In cars with Autopilot, it claims, that plunges to one every 320 million miles. Those are impressive numbers, sure, but they’re also hard to comprehend. Hardly anyone drives a million miles in their life, so the difference between 86 million and 320 million feels academic. But if Tesla could break down the stats, and told you hey, on this road you drive everyday, cars with Autopilot crashed, say, 20 percent less often than those without, the tech seems a lot more relevant—and more worth the extra $5,000. Even if it won’t save your life, it could keep you out of a fender bender that makes you miss that meeting and sees your insurance premium skyrocket. “If you do that, it provides policy makers with information and data that says we’re going in the right direction and we’ve saved 50 or 100 lives this year,” Carone says. Writing in the journal Nature Human Behavior, researchers from UC Irvine say “as with airplane crashes, the more disproportionate—and disproportionately sensational—the coverage that autonomous vehicle accidents receive, the more exaggerated people will perceive the risk and dangers of these cars in comparison to those of traditional human-driven ones.” You don’t win those people back with lofty promises of crash-free roads and millions of lives saved. You do it by making their lives better, one helpful ride at a time.

Prosecutors say Fields killed Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old Charlottesville paralegal, and injured others who were demonstrating against the ""Unite the Right"" rally. The event drew white nationalists and other far right organizations who opposed the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park. Fields, who initially was charged with second-degree murder and other offenses, now faces a charge of first-degree murder. A Charlottesville district court Judge announced the upgraded charge at the court hearing attended by Fields and about two dozen of Heyer's family members and supporters. Prosecutors played the surveillance video from a Charlottesville restaurant in addition to a video from a Virginia State Police helicopter monitoring the events. Authorities say the footage captures Fields' Challenger stopping about a block and a half away from protesters, reversing, then driving into the crowd and speeding away in reverse. Fields was apprehended about four minutes after the collision, about a mile away. Fields could not be seen driving the car in either video, but the aerial shot showed Fields getting out of the car and on the ground after the collision. Charlottesville Det. Steven Young, a prosecution witness, testified he was patrolling Emancipation Park on foot when he heard the radio traffic reporting an incident near Fourth and Water streets that day. He and three other officers jumped into a van and responded to the location where the Challenger had stopped. Young said he arrived on the scene shortly after police pulled the Challenger over. By then, Fields was already on the ground in handcuffs, Young said. The detective said he saw blood and flesh on the front of the car. The front fender was torn off and the windshield was cracked, Young said. People had tried to stop Fields from driving away, creating two holes in the back window, said Young, who is investigating the case. Young said he knows of 36 victims including Heyer. Fields' attorney, Denise Lunsford, tried to paint her client as a sympathetic character as she cross-examined Young. The detective acknowledged that Fields said, ""I'm sorry"" several times and asked if people were okay after he was apprehended. Fields was shocked, and cried and sobbed, when he later learned of the fatality, Young said. Young said Fields told others he went to Charlottesville by himself and wanted to hear a speaker at the rally. Exclusive photographs obtained by CNN appear to show Fields marching alongside neo-Nazis and other white supremacists at the rally in Charlottesville. Fields' wrists and feet were shackled during the hearing. He sat not far from Heyer's mother, Susan Bro. Heyer's favorite color was purple, and two women in the courtroom room wore purple shirts emblazoned with Heyer's photo. On the shirts was an anonymous quote Heyer believed in, and once posted on Facebook: ""If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention."" Fields' case will go before a grand jury on Monday. CNN's Matthew Hoye, Eric Levenson and Amanda Watts contributed reporting.","STLtoday.com Charge upgraded against suspect in Charlottesville rally killing STLtoday.com The Dodge Challenger crept up, reversed, then accelerated toward the crowd.

The Conversation UK,"A woman stands in front of a mural supporting the Yes vote located inside the Bernard Shaw pub on May 13, 2018 in Dublin, Ireland. Charles McQuillan/Getty Images The 8th amendment became part of the Irish Constitution in 1983. It recognises the right to life of ""the unborn"" and says the state will ""defend and vindicate"" that right with due regard to the equal right to life of ""the mother."" As a result, abortion is legal in Ireland only if the woman's life is at real and substantial risk; only if she will die without it. The 8th was intended to prevent abortion in Ireland. It has failed. Around 5,000 women in Ireland have abortions every year, either in England or by importing and using abortion pills (a serious criminal offence). Instead of stopping abortion, what the 8th actually prevents is doctors intervening to protect the health of their patients if that would jeopardise fetal life. It prevents elected and accountable politicians from making laws to respond to real-life need. It says that as long as a woman is still alive when her child is born the state has done its duty to her and, more importantly, to her child. A better law is possible: a law that strikes a more workable, and more compassionate balance between two common goods of protecting fetal life and protecting the life and health of pregnant women. But this can only be achieved if Ireland votes to repeal the 8th amendment in the referendum being held on May 25. Ireland's government has already said it intends to propose a restricted, highly regulated system for abortion care in Ireland if the people decide to repeal the 8th. The plan is to allow a woman to access abortion up to 12 weeks into her pregnancy without having to justify her decision. This is not abortion on demand. A woman will not be able to simply walk into a pharmacy and buy abortion pills without a prescription. She will always have to engage with a doctor, who will have to certify that it is less than 12 weeks since the first day of her last period. The woman will also have to take a three-day waiting period. In that time she will have the legal certainty she needs to focus on making her decision without having to worry about negotiating the practical challenges and isolation of illegality. She can speak with her doctor, partner, family, support network or counsellors to make the decision at hand, knowing that if it is still right for her she can access abortion in three days' time. That's better for women than the 8th amendment. It marks a shift from using the law to compel pregnancy, to using it to support decisions about whether to remain pregnant. It's also the only practical way to make abortion available to survivors of rape who wish to end their pregnancies and for that reason no ""rape clause"" is proposed. ""Rape clauses"" are extremely problematic. In countries where they exist they require women more or less to prove — sometimes to doctors, sometimes to police officers, sometimes to judges — that they were raped. They re-traumatise women. They sometimes jeopardise criminal trials against an assailant. They rely on women reporting rape, even though we know the vast majority of women are unable or unwilling to do so. Any attempt to make abortion generally illegal but to carve out an exception for rape simply won't work. Ireland has had 35 years of a law on abortion that does not work; the government must not introduce another one. Under the proposed law, the Irish state will step in and severely restrict abortion after 12 weeks. Despite what posters all over the country suggest, it's categorically untrue that there will be abortion without effective restriction up to six months. Once a fetus is viable it will be a crime to provide abortion; only emergency care, where there is an immediate risk to a woman's life or immediate serious risk to her health and abortion is immediately necessary will be exempted from that general rule. After 12 weeks, and until viability, abortion will only be lawful where two doctors, one of whom is an obstetrician, certify that there is a risk to life or a serious risk to the health of the pregnant woman. That is not some so-called vague mental health ground; it is the application of clinical assessment to the health of a pregnant woman. It is allowing doctors to practice medicine: providing the legal environment in which they can support a patient in understanding the risks to her health or life and deciding whether these are risks she is willing to bear. This is completely different to the law in England, which is so often called in aid by those opposed to repealing the 8th amendment, presented as a spectre of an abortion regime to come. The 1967 Abortion Act allows for abortion in England up to 24 weeks where there is any risk to the health of a pregnant woman (physical or mental), and after that without time limit where there is a serious risk to health, a risk to life, or a diagnosis that means the fetus would be ""severely handicapped"". Ireland's law would not only have far shorter time limits, more restrictive grounds, and a more rigorous process of medical certification, but it would also categorically not allow for abortion on the grounds of disability. Vitally, it would allow for termination where a woman has received a fatal diagnosis for her foetus — that is, a diagnosis that means it will die before or shortly after birth. Under the 8th amendment, women in this situation cannot access termination in Ireland; they must either continue their pregnancy until the foetus dies inside them, regardless of the impact of that on their mental and physical health and that of their other children, or they must travel abroad for care. An average of two families every week find themselves in this situation, and their doctors must also bear the emotional and ethical burden of abandoning them to the medical care of another country. If people feel the 8th amendment does cruelty to women who have survived rape and incest, who are at risk of catastrophic harm to their health, or who have received a fatal diagnosis for their foetus, then the only possible answer is to repeal the 8th amendment. As long as it remains in the constitution, Ireland cannot show compassion for these women. Without it, they can finally be cared for at home, in Ireland.",Charles McQuillan/Getty Images A vote taking place this Friday will determine whether Ireland will repeal the 8th amendment and legalize abortion.

Aileen Kwun,"This week, as members of the design industry packed into Chicago’s Merchandise Mart for the 50th annual NeoCon trade show and convention —the largest national fair dedicated to commercial and contract design–one attendee suffered fatal head injuries after a fall on the show floor, the Chicago Tribune reports. Jacqueline Albertine, 57, was pronounced dead the following afternoon, as her family removed her from life support at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. After attempted surgery, medical professionals determined her condition too severe to remedy; an autopsy performed on Wednesday determined the death an accident, by way of blunt force injuries to her head. The shocking news of her unexpected death has called into question the medical and safety procedures administered by the trade show, which is held at Merchandise Mart each year. Visiting from Miami Beach, Florida, Albertine had been hanging on a swing-seat installation by the luxury design manufacturer David Edwards at the company’s third-floor showroom when she fell backward. According to colleagues who were present, the fall occurred at around noon on Monday, but officials from the Chicago Fire Department did not arrive to the scene until about 12:30pm. Speaking with the Tribune, Shawn MacMullin, president of Corporate Design Choice in Miami, where Albertine had been employed for 14 years, questioned the event’s safety practices, suggesting prompt attention may have saved her life. Adding to the confusion and chaos amid the packed convention, authorities had initially indicated that the incident had occurred on Tuesday. A representative from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed to the Tribune that it has begun an investigation into the fatality, but noted that a conclusion could take months.","Jacqueline Albertine, 57, was pronounced dead after falling from a showroom installation.

Kevin Loria,"Perez was infected with flesh-eating vibrio bacteria while wading in the brackish waters of the Maurice River. Shutterstock/dreikim Angel Perez went crabbing in New Jersey's Maurice River on July 2, as he did frequently, according to his daughter, Dilena Perez-Dilan, who spoke to local ABC News station WPVI. But a few hours after he got out of the water, Perez's leg started to blister, swell, and change to a ""brown, blackish color,"" his daughter told the news station. Perez was infected with bacteria that can cause flesh-eating disease, known as necrotizing fasciitis. A number of different bacteria can cause the infection, which causes soft tissue like skin, muscle, ligaments, blood vessels, and fat to die. The disease kills up to 30% of those infected if it's not stopped. The infection spread to Perez's other leg and both arms. Doctors at Cooper University Hospital are treating him with antibiotics and trying to save his life. The only two treatment options are antibiotics or amputation, but it's still unknown whether any or all of his limbs will have to be amputated. In this case, doctors say Perez was infected with Vibrio bacteria, which can be found in water that's brackish (meaning partially salty), especially in warm summer months. There are approximately a dozen types of Vibrio bacteria. Most cause an unpleasant condition called vibriosis that can resolve within a few days, but one rare type of Vibrio bacteria can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Anyone exposed to the bacteria can get infected, especially if they have open cuts or wounds. Perez reportedly has Parkinson's, which puts him at even higher risk of infection. Skin lesions caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria after Hurricane Katrina. CDC Vibrio, flesh-eating bacteria, and brackish water One specific form of Vibrio bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus, is especially dangerous. This infection can cause blistering skin lesions, bloodstream infections, and necrotizing fasciitis if a wound gets infected. But it's rare: the CDC estimates that there are about 205 cases in the US every year, with just a few of those in New Jersey. Vibrio is more commonly a risk for people wading through floodwaters. After Hurricane Harvey, a flesh-eating bacteria infection resulted in at least one fatality, and there were several Vibrio deaths after Hurricane Katrina. Most of the 80,000 vibriosis infections that occur in the US every year are less serious, according to the CDC. Estimates suggest 52,000 of those cases are likely the result of eating contaminated food, especially raw seafood. About 80% of those infections occur between May and October, when water is particularly warm — an ideal condition for colonies of bacteria to grow and thrive. Contaminated floodwaters can host Vibrio bacteria. Thomson Reuters Signs of the disease Necrotizing fasciitis is most often caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria and some other types. But flesh-eating disease caused by Vibrio is treated differently from other bacteria that can cause the same condition, so identifying it is important. Flesh-eating disease is one of the most common signs of Vibrio vulnificus, according to one study. People are more susceptible to necrotizing fasciitis if they have a condition or illness that weakens their immune system, as Perez does. But the bacteria usually causes infection at the site of a cut or wound regardless. Normally, the condition is accompanied by extreme pain that may start as soreness, like the feeling of a pulled muscle, but quickly becomes more severe. Spreading areas of discolored skin are a sign of the condition as well. If any of these symptoms are present after a wound appears, or if you have fever, chills, or vomiting, the CDC advises seeing a doctor for treatment immediately. In Perez's case, the family hopes he sought out treatment in time to save his limbs or his life, his daughter told NJ Advance Media.","A New Jersey man was infected with bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating disease, while wading in brackish river water.

Associated Press,"(YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif.) — A man died after falling into a river at Yosemite National Park on Christmas Day, the National Park Service said Friday.
The man apparently slipped down Silver Apron, a large, sloping granite area above Nevada Fall, and suffered a head injury, government spokesman Andrew Munoz said in a statement. The ongoing investigation is taking longer than usual because of the partial government shutdown, he said.
Munoz said rangers responding to a 911 call arrived on scene in less than an hour and pulled the man, who has not been identified, from the water.
“Medical attention was provided to the visitor, but he died from his injuries,” Munoz said.
The man’s death was first reported by Outside Magazine, which noted that at least 10 people died in the park last year, including another man who slipped and fell to his death near Nevada Fall.
No further details on the Dec. 25 fatality were released.
Munoz said the park didn’t issue a press release about the death because of the shutdown, which began two weeks ago and forced furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal government employees.
Yosemite remains open to visitors during the shutdown, and crowds of visitors have been driving into the park to take advantage of free admission. This week, the park announced new access limitations and several closed areas within the park because of problems with human waste, damage to resources and other public safety concerns during the shutdown.
Under the park service’s shutdown plan, law enforcement staff remains on duty.
Munoz said the visitor was not in a closed area when he fell.

Caroline Praderio,"A third case of the rare illness monkeypox has been diagnosed in England. Officials at Public Health England (PHE) announced the case in a statement on Wednesday, Reuters reported. Earlier this month, two other individuals were diagnosed with monkeypox, though the cases weren't linked within the UK, according to PHE. The first was a resident of Nigeria. Officials believe this person contracted monkeypox there before traveling to the UK. The second patient also appears to have picked up the infection in Nigeria after traveling there. ""We know that in September 2017 Nigeria experienced a large sustained outbreak of monkeypox and since then sporadic cases have continued to be reported,"" Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director of PHE's National Infection Service, said in a statement on September 11, when the second case was announced. ""It is likely that monkeypox continues to circulate in Nigeria and could, therefore, affect travelers who are returning from this part of the world."" But the third person to contract the infection isn't a traveler: It's a healthcare worker. The worker was involved in the care of the second patient before that person was diagnosed with monkeypox, according to PHE. ""This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced,"" Phin said in the PHE's latest statement. Here's what to know about the illness. Monkeypox is rare and is primarily passed from animals to humans This graphic from the CDC shows a closeup of skin symptoms caused by monkeypox. CDC/Getty Images Monkeypox is a rare viral illness that occurs mainly in parts of central and West Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It's spread primarily from animals to people and has ""limited"" spread between humans, the WHO explains. The US experienced an outbreak of monkeypox in 2003 with a total of 37 confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Investigators eventually traced the outbreak back to a shipment of animals from Ghana. It was the first time human monkeypox had ever been reported outside of Africa. The initial case reported by PHE was also the first ever diagnosed in the UK. It can be serious, but most cases are mild and improve on their own Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, back pain, aching muscles, and lack of energy, followed by a rash that often begins on the face and spreads to other parts of the body, according to the WHO. The rash evolves to form small, fluid-filled blisters, or lesions, that eventually crust over. There are no treatments or vaccines, but most cases go away on their own. "" Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person's health,"" Dr. Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said in a PHE statement. ""Most people recover within several weeks."" In some cases, particularly among young children, the infection can be serious or even fatal, according to the WHO. (In previous outbreaks, the fatality rate has been between 1 and 10%, the organization adds.) But English health officials stressed that the three new cases in the UK don't pose a dire threat. ""It is important to emphasize that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low,"" Phin said in a PHE statement.

Aric Jenkins,"The death toll in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria was severely underestimated, according to a new report, prompting the U.S. territory’s governor to order an official recount. According to the report from the Center for Investigative Journalism, the actual death toll on the island in the wake of the storm exceeded 1,000 people, in contrast to the previously reported 64. Other news outlets published similar findings in recent weeks, including the New York Times, which found that 1,052 people Puerto Ricans lost their lives from Maria, according to mortality data from Puerto Rico’s statistics bureau. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló told the Washington Post last week that his government did not intentionally misstate its estimate in order to conceal a higher death toll. “We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody,” Rosselló said in a statement Monday, according to the Post. In Puerto Rico’s official recount, Rosselló is calling on all of the island’s government agencies to reopen their books and examine certified deaths using medical records, interviews with family members and doctors, and more, in order to reclassify the actual death toll. One of the keys is to determine whether deaths categorized as “natural” were actually caused by the storm. Almost three months have passed since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. Thousands remain without power and vital supplies, including the sick and elderly who rely on medical equipment to stay alive. The 64 people who were counted as part of the official death toll include people who drowned in floods, were trapped in mudslides, died of heart attacks and other medical conditions, and suffered injuries from falling debris. Rosselló in his statement said that while he welcomes analyses from news organizations, the government “cannot base any official fatality related to the hurricane count on statistical analysis.” “Every life is more than a number, and every death must have a name and vital information attached to it, as well as an accurate accounting of the facts related to their passing,” he said in the statement.",The governor of Puerto Rico has ordered an official recount as a result,2017-12-19T01:47:17Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Puerto Rico Said 64 People Died in Hurricane Maria.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Confusion reins at some Toronto intersections Cyclists in Toronto are raising concerns about the risks of riding bikes following a rash of deaths this summer. How dangerous is it to saddle up in Canada's largest city? Henry Gold has cycled in over 80 countries. That experience has led the 66-year-old biking enthusiast to a controversial opinion - that Toronto is the most perilous city in the world to be a cyclist. ""If you have to have to - for any length of time - cycle on any of the major arteries in Toronto, it's more dangerous than anywhere else in the world,"" he says. That claim may have people raising a sceptical eyebrow, though a string of cycling and pedestrian deaths over a short period of time in Toronto has raised road safety concerns in Canada's largest city. Three cyclists died in a month-long span on the city's streets in May and June. A fourth cyclist died in March in a collision with a parked car. Image caption Geoffrey Bercarich paints and maintains ghost bike memorials in the city Cycling advocates in the city have organised so-called ""ghost bike rides"" and have set up memorials to mark the spot a cyclist was killed with white painted bike frames. ""I see them as lighthouses depicting dangerous waters around the streets,"" Geoffrey Bercarich, who helps maintain the memorials, told the BBC. In late June, city council responded to concerns by approving an additional C$22m ($16.7m; £12.6m) for the Vision Zero programme, a five-year plan with the goal of reducing traffic-related deaths and injuries to nil. Vision Zero has so far been panned as a failure. Mr Gold, who founded a company that runs cycling tours around the world, says the city's speed limits - between 50 km/h to 60km/h (31mph to 37mph) on most major roads and arteries - are to blame for the danger. People don't die when cars move at a crawl, he contends. ""The wonderful thing about traffic jams is no one gets killed."" Image caption Cyclists gather in Toronto for a ghost bike ride But traffic jams are what many Toronto commuters dread. The fourth largest North American city's population is having a growth spurt, which has left drivers, streetcars, cyclists, and pedestrians competing for street space. In June, Expert Market, a UK-based business solutions firm, released a report suggesting Toronto had the worst commute times in North America. It ranked globally slightly above Istanbul and slightly below London, based on factors like average commute times and distances. The crowded roads and long commutes have created political tension between avid cyclists who feel threatened by cars and drivers who have expressed frustration at cyclists. Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford helped heat up the debate when he made ending the ""war on the car"" in Toronto a campaign catchphrase in 2010. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Late Toronto mayor Rob Ford said there was a 'war on cars' in the city He found support from a number of city councillors, especially those representing suburban wards whose voter base were made up of car commuters. During his time in office, Toronto removed some of the city's bike lanes. Opponents to bike infrastructure feared increased traffic congestion and reduced parking spaces. Merchants fretted over possible lost business. Some criticised spending money on permanent separated cycle lanes in a city where only the hardiest cyclists venture out on their bikes during winter months. Toronto is far from the only city where the car versus bike debate has raged - it's cropped up in places like London, Seattle, Los Angeles, Vancouver, New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. It's been an issue in Montreal, which is considered one of the most bike-friendly cities in North America. Kay Teschke, a University of British Columbia professor who studies urban cycling, says a good cycling city is one that includes space for people on bikes on the road, like a comprehensive network of cycling paths on major roads and arteries that physically separate cars and bikes. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Commuter riding a bicycle on a city cycle lane or path across white painted bike symbol ""It just makes no sense for vehicles with such different masses and velocities to be put together,"" she says. ""Anyone who makes any kind of mistake is waiting for a catastrophe to happen."" Toronto has turned a corner since the height of Rob Ford's ""war on car"" days, and has been adding to the city cycling infrastructure. In 2017, city council approved a permanent separated bike lane on one of the major east-west connections with little opposition. City bureaucrats found the Bloor bike lane both encouraged ridership and reduced collisions between cars and bikes, though it did slow commute times for cars by just over four minutes in some cases. A recent poll indicated that almost half of Torontonians supported more separated cycle lanes being added. Ms Teschke says drivers and cyclists alike appreciate the security and consistency of separated bike paths. Separated lanes also keep cyclists away from Toronto's metal streetcar tracks, which can be slippery and are the perfect size to catch an errant tire. One study found that a third of cycling accidents were directly linked to the tracks. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Streetcars are traditional vehicles typical of Toronto Ms Teschke says that while Toronto has made strides towards becoming a cycling city, like a number of places it suffers from having ""a huge jumble"" of different ways that transportation for bikes, cars, pedestrians and public transit are managed across the city. ""If a city has a consistent treatment of where cyclists ride, everyone understands better what's going on - it's more intuitive what to do,"" she says. ""But in North America at the moment we have every combination for cyclists."" So how does Toronto objectively compare to other cities around the world for bike safety? There's no clear answer, since it can be difficult to get a perfect comparison between cities, which compile statistics in different ways. In 2015, the Pembina Institute published a report that looked at the crash rate per 100,000 cycling trips. Toronto had five, the highest of five Canadian cities. Montreal and Vancouver tied as the safest cities, with two collisions per 100,000 trips. Statistics compiled by Toronto suggest that compared to the top 10 largest North American cities, the city's road fatality rate - including drivers, cyclists and pedestrians - is among the lowest, higher than Chicago and New York but lower than Phoenix, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.",A rash of recent cyclist and pedestrian deaths has brought fresh scrutiny to safety in the city.,2018-07-15T23:41:17Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",How dangerous are Toronto streets for the city's cyclists?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44746889,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B660/production/_102488664_gettyimages-985395900.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fatality,1
lgardner@politico.com (Lauren Gardner),"The engine on a Southwest Airlines plane is inspected as it sits on the runway at the Philadelphia International Airport after it made an emergency landing in Philadelphia on Tuesday. | Amanda Bourman/AP Photo A passenger died Tuesday during the terrifying emergency landing of a Southwest Airlines flight in Philadelphia — the first fatal U.S. airline accident since a 2009 crash that sparked years of activism for aviation safety reforms. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt confirmed the death, which occurred after an engine failure on the Boeing 737 and passengers' reports of an explosion that left a window shattered. He offered no details about who the deceased passenger was or how he or she died. Story Continued Below One passenger, Marty Martinez, told news organizations that one woman's ""arms and body were sucked toward the opening in the plane"" after the window smashed, while ""passengers right next to her were holding onto her."" Martinez posted frantic videos on Facebook as the plane came in for a landing with oxygen masks dangling. ""I literally bought WiFi as the plane was going down because I wanted to be able to reach the people I loved...thinking these were my final moments,"" he posted on Twitter. Passenger Matt Tranchin told reporters that he spent 15 to 20 minutes ""texting my wife, my family that I love them, saying goodbye... trying to articulate what my final words would be,"" The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Flight 1380 had taken off from LaGuardia Airport in New York when the Boeing 737-700 experienced an apparent ""in-flight engine failure of the left engine"" on its way to Dallas' Love Field, Sumwalt said. Sumwalt stopped short of describing that failure as ""uncontained,"" saying investigators need to examine what's left of the engine when they get to Philadelphia. Uncontained engine failure, in which pieces exit an engine, is more serious than ""contained"" failure, when a component separates but remains inside the engine or exits via the tail pipe. The board sees ""about three or four [uncontained failures] a year,"" not all of which involve U.S. airlines, he said. The death marks the first fatality on a U.S. commercial airliner since a February 2009 crash in which a turboprop plane operated by regional carrier Colgan Air struck a house near Buffalo, killing 50 people. The last fatal U.S. accident involving a foreign carrier was a July 2013 crash in San Francisco, which killed three people after a Boeing 777 operated by South Korea's Asiana Airlines struck a wall while landing and pinwheeled on the runway.

Katherine Fan,"Air Niugini confirmed Monday that the body of a missing passenger had been found by divers in the lagoon next to Micronesia’s Chuuk International Airport (TKK), where Flight 73 crashed last Friday. The statement read: It is with deep sadness I confirm that the body of a male passenger was discovered by divers today as they conducted a further search of P2-PXE and the surrounding area in the Chuuk Lagoon. This is the unaccounted passenger from the aircraft. Our outreach team is in touch with the mans family and we are making arrangements to repatriate his body. The circumstances surrounding this accident are now a matter for relevant authorities as they begin their task of investigating the events that led to the incident and the actions which followed. We are committing all required resources to ascertain the factors that led to this accident. We express our deepest sympathy to his family. We are and will continue to provide support to his family in this time of loss. Tahawar Durrani Chief Executive Officer Air Niugini Limited The flagship carrier of Papua New Guinea has never before had a fatality in 45 years of operation. The small airline provides “crucial links between isolated Melanesian outposts in the Pacific and the rest of the world,” according to the Associated Press. Image courtesy of Chuuk International Airport. Chuuk Island is one of 607 islands that make up the Federated States of Micronesia, a tiny island nation in the South Pacific. The runway was originally built during World War II in 1942 and is only 6,006 feet in length, surrounded by water on both sides. On Friday, the Boeing 737-800 registered P2-PXE was landing from nearby island Pohnpei under “very poor” weather conditions including sudden heavy rain and extremely reduced visibility. Locals nearby used small fishing boats to rescue survivors from the plane before it sank in the 100-foot lagoon, while bystanders uploaded live footage of the event to social media. Over the weekend, Air Niugini flew in its top executives as well as the company doctor to assist passengers from Friday’s crash. The initial report stated that all passengers had been safely rescued. Several were taken to a nearby hospital after sustaining injuries from the crash, including some bone fractures. Featured photo courtesy of Bill Davis.

Gabe Gurwin,"NetherRealms is one of the best fighting game studios on the planet, with Mortal Kombat X among its most polished and engaging titles. Its no surprise, then, that the studio is working on a follow-up, and it looks to be even gorier and more intense than its predecessors. Mortal Kombat 11 features brutal fatalities, a cast of memorable characters old and new, and a wild, time-hopping story.
Returning Characters in MK11
Mortal Kombat 11s full character roster has not been unveiled yet, but several of the biggest characters appeared during the games official announcement stream in January and a few have been revealed here and there as we get closer to the game’s release.
Raiden
Classic Mortal Kombat character Raiden returns to the lineup in Mortal Kombat 11, and he’ll have his powerful magical bolt abilities, as well as acrobatic dodges and a spear weapon. His “dark” character will be central to the main story.
Sub-Zero
Sub-Zero returns with his icy attacks in tow, and he has a deservedly flashy fatality move. After freezing an enemy, he decapitates them with his axe, then shatters their frozen head.
Scorpion
Sub-Zero’s doppelgänger Scorpion is also getting in on the fun with his signature chain-and-spear combination weapon. One of Scorpion’s fatalities involves the fighter throwing his spear through an enemy’s chest before decapitating them and impaling the severed head.
Sonya Blade
Sonya Blade is back in the series for Mortal Kombat 11, and she’s voiced by former UFC fighter and current WWE wrestler Ronda Rousey. Using a combination of martial arts and weaponry, she’s a deadly force, and her fatality involves launching a target into the air with her guns so they’re cut to bits by a helicopter blade.
Baraka
The teeth of the Mortal Kombat series, Baraka, is ready to chew some faces in Mortal Kombat 11. Shown in the announcement footage, Baraka’s fatality has him rip the face and skull off of his opponent before pulling out their brain and taking a healthy bite out of it.
Skarlet
The blood-bending Skarlet is capable of using her enemies’ blood against them. Combined with quick knife strikes, she can pull enemies in for a follow-up blow by using their own blood. Her fatality involves draining an enemy of blood, forming airborne crystal spears out of them, and then driving them back into their corpse.
Liu Kang
Liu Kang has been confirmed to make an appearance in Mortal Kombat 11, however, information on the character’s attacks and fatalities are being kept under wraps for now. In the past, he has relied heavily on kicking moves which we’re positive will make a return in MK11.
Kano
Kano was confirmed prior to the launch of Mortal Kombat 11 during a Brazilian community event. He will feature a cyborg eye as well as a knife. Gameplay information for the character hasn’t been revealed yet, but in Mortal Kombat X he could disembowel enemies before frying a hole in their head.
Kabal
Kabal kind of returns in Mortal Kombat 11. He’s been resurrected as an evil incarnation of himself. The lightning-fast fighter uses his dual blades and spin attacks to catch opponents off-guard, as well as ranged blade wheels for longer distances. For his fatality, he carries a target by their legs until their face peels off, then leaps ahead and slices them lengthwise.
D’Vorah
Ed Boon announced D’Vorah to Inside Xbox during the official Mortal Kombat 11 reveal stream. Introduced in Mortal Kombat X, she’s an insect humanoid with beady black eyes and control over winged creatures in combat. Thus far, her fatalities for the new game have not been revealed.
Jade
Jade is back in Mortal Kombat 11, and was given her own reveal trailer to show off her moves. The staff-wielding fighter can teleport from one side of her enemy to the other, throw bladed weapons to keep a combo string together, or leap onto someone’s back to stab them in the skull. For her fatality, she pops out an enemy’s eyeball and slices them in half at the waist.
Shao Kahn
Shao Kahn will be available to those who pre-order Mortal Kombat 11. He just briefly appeared in the game’s initial announcement trailer, chuckling as he took a seat on a metal throne. His moves and fatalities for the game have not been revealed, and he has often served as an antagonist.
New Characters in MK11
While we’re still waiting to hear confirmation about Todd McFarlane’s Spawn, there are a few new characters coming to MK11 that have been confirmed, with some being featured in gameplay and others in story teasers. These are the ones we know so far:
Kronika
Kronika will play a major role in the games story mode, acting as an antagonist who is revealed to have been involved in the series since the events of the very first game. Kronika has time manipulation powers, but it isnt clear quite yet how these will manifest themselves in combat.
Geras
Geras, meanwhile, is capable of changing the environment around him at will. He has been shown in gameplay footage, and is capable of erecting a barrier in the middle of a stage, or turning sand into a giant hammer in mere seconds. According to IGN, Geras is a minion of Kronika and is also able to control time, including changing the round timer or rewinding to restore his health.
Other characters, including Johnny Cage, Shinnok, and Cassie Cage, appear to also be coming to the game, as theyve been shown off in menus and cinematics, but they have not been officially confirmed as playable yet. As we approach the April release date, more light will likely be shed on them.
MK11 Story
Picking up after the events of the rebooted Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat X, Mortal Kombat 11 heavily features Raiden, who is still in his “Dark” form after he went back in time to change the events of the original three games. Events from the past will fold into present timeline events, according to an interview director Ed Boon gave to the PlayStation Blog.
Characters will meet different versions of themselves, including Liu Kang, and there will be unintended consequences of the time manipulation. As mentioned previously, Kronika plays a key role in the story and joins the head of Shinnok after he is brutally decapitated by Raiden. Boon referred to her as the boss of bosses, secretly working to direct the events of every game up to this point.
Sonya Blade will also play a role in the story, and shes joined by former UFC and current WWE fighter Ronda Rousey. Details on the specific plot points are being kept secret, however, with Rousey only knowing about scenes that directly involve her character.
Gameplay
The moment-to-moment gameplay of Mortal Kombat 11 will be familiar to fans of the most recent games and the Injustice series, with a focus on characters special abilities, including Scorpions famous spear and Barakas razor-sharp teeth. However, rather than having players string together lengthy attack combinations, the individual moves are more brutal, and theres a greater focus on resource management than there was in Mortal Kombat X. 
New to the series is the Death Blow move, which is similar to the X-Ray attacks weve seen in Mortal Kombat X. These attacks are tied to your health, and will only become available once youre at less than 30 percent of your total. Despite the name, these arent instant kills, but can sway the course of a battle if you and your enemy are both whittling down each others bars.
Also new is a perfect block system, which allows you to deal extra damage after timing your block correctly, and the offensive and defensive meters have been moved to separate bars so you have more freedom in how you want to use your resources. Speaking to Game Informer, Ed Boon explained that the offensive meter will allow you to enhance existing attacks, while the defensive meter will let you escape from an enemys combo.
Pre-orders, special editions, and beta access
You can pre-order Mortal Kombat 11 for access to the bonus character Shao Kahn, who was announced during the reveal livestream event in January. Youll also get access to the closed beta on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, which will take place in March.
The Premium Edition of the game will also include six new DLC characters, and one week early access to them, as well as seven skins and gear sets. The Kollectors Edition, meanwhile, is a GameStop exclusive. It includes everything in the Premium Edition, as well as a magnet, life-size Scorpion mask, and a collectors box.
The Kollectors Edition is only available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while the Premium Edition is also available on PC.
When can we play it, and on what platforms?
Mortal Kombat 11 will be available on April 23 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.","Mortal Kombat 11 releases April 23 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

Justin T. Westbrook,"Uber is back on the roads with its self-driving tech after one of its cars killed a person earlier this year, Amtrak is kind of screwed, Nissans Carlos Ghosn is also probably screwed, and more await you in The Morning Shift for Thursday, Dec. 20, 2018.
1st Gear: Ubers Computers Are Back Behind The Wheel
Today will be the first day Uber sends out a self-driving car on public roads for testing since the death of Elaine Herzberg, who died after a self-driving Volvo XC90 owned by Uber and equipped with self-driving sensors and computers hit her while she crossed the street at the night. 
From Bloomberg:
Uber said it received the all-clear from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation this week. The self-driving car program has been suspended as the National Transportation Safety Board investigated the pedestrian fatality in Tempe, Arizona, and as state officials reviewed Ubers authorization.
This is the first time Uber is returning autonomous vehicles to public roads since the accident. In order to collect data, Uber had previously deployed some autonomous vehicles in manual mode, meaning that human drivers were operating them at all times. On Thursday, Uber will also deploy cars in San Francisco and Toronto in the manual, human-driven mode.
While the self-driving program was halted, Uber continued to test its cars in manual mode with a person in full control and collected driving data to apply to its programs and algorithms. The company will continue to do so in San Francisco and Toronto, Bloomberg reports.
Heres hoping Ubers technology has come a long way in the last nine months.

2nd Gear: Amtrak Is Literally Sinking
Jokes about Amtraks reputation not being the greatest aside, climate change is real and its coming straight for the the train lines Northeast corridor route. 
According to Amtrak, the Northeast corridor line running from Washington D.C. up to Boston is at high risk of being washed out by rising water levels in the next 30 years, mostly due to the proximity of two rivers, the Delaware and Christina. Heres more from the Bloomberg report:
By the middle of this century, climate change is likely to punch a hole through the busiest stretch of rail in North America. Parts of Amtraks Northeast Corridor route, which carries 12million people each year between Boston and Washington, face continual inundation. Flooding, rising seas, and storm surge threaten to erode the track bed and knock out the signals that direct train traffic. The poles that provide electricity for trains are at risk of collapse, even as power substations succumb to floodwaters. If one of the segments of track shuts down, it will shut down this segment of the NEC, warned members of Amtraks planning staff. There is not an alternate route that can be used as a detour.
One particular section of the track in Wilmington, Delaware sits right next to the Delaware River, and is already suffering from frequent flooding. The flooding is projected to occur at least twice a month going forward, and will only get worse. The proposed solution is to put walls costing $24 million per mile of track through the section, which would take about a month to construct.
The study was completed last year and Bloomberg reports that Amtrak has since backed away from publicly pushing the threat of climate change to its railways. And that has to do with money, according to Amtrak themselves:
Christina Leeds, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said in an email: Elevation or relocation of the infrastructure is likely to be expensive, disruptive, or impractical, and given the current levels of federal and state funding for Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor, well beyond our means. She added that the company already faces $40billion worth of pressinglargely still unfundedbasic state-of-good-repair risks.
The increased flooding over the coming decades would not only disrupt transit for an approximate 12 million travelers, but also risk wiping out Amtraks National Operations Center, a training center, and a major train maintenance yard. What are they going to do, launch a GoFundMe for $100 billion?
3rd Gear: Documents Show Nissan and Renault Were Indeed Trying to Pay Carlos Ghosn Off The Books
As Tokyo prosecutors appeal a judges decision to release Carlos Ghosn pending a trial for allegedly misreporting his incomes, Reuters is reporting its seen documents outlining ways in which both Renault and Nissan, which were joined in an alliance under Ghosn, attempted to find ways of compensating him beyond his standard income off the books. 
Heres more from Reuters:
Executives, including Renaults general secretary Mouna Sepehri, worked on a proposed 2010 plan to create an additional source of compensation for Ghosn through the alliances Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) Dutch holding, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.
In the April 22, 2010, email to Sepehri and one other recipient identified only as Scott, Kelly wrote: I greatly appreciate the work you have done to analyze whether part of the CEOs compensation can be paid by RNBV without disclosing it publicly.
In Renaults statement to Reuters concerning the email, the automakers spokesperson claimed the additional compensation would have ultimately still been reported publicly in France if it had gone through. Heres the other attempt from 2017:
Renault-Nissan bankers developed plans to pay millions of euros in undisclosed bonuses to Ghosn and other alliance managers via a Dutch service company. On June 13, 2017, Reuters reported details of the plan contained in an eight-page document. Two days later at Renaults shareholder meeting, Ghosn denied that such a plan existed.
There is no truth in any of this, Ghosn told shareholders at the meeting, as Renault deputy CEO Thierry Bollore and Sepehri looked on. I can tell you that every week we get proposals from consultants and banks at my level.
The plan was scrapped soon after that, invoices and emails show.
The discussions and emails were discovered through Nissans internal investigation of its Chairman, and while neither plan seems to have come to fruition, its a thick cloud of smoke signaling the allegations of misconduct elsewhere could be true. 
Can you imagine typing out thank you for not disclosing this shady money talk publicly to someone? Its just begging to be framed and displayed in a court room. 
4th Gear: Daimler and BMW Are Looking To Share
Daimler and BMW, two of the biggest German automakers, are looking to shack up for shared parts, Automotive News reports, as both companies have seemed either flustered or slightly indifferent to fully committing to electric cars and self-driving technology. 
Heres more detail from AutoNews:
The German manufacturers are exploring options such as joint vehicle platforms, batteries and autonomous-car technology, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Collaboration would be restricted to technology thats not brand-specific, but deliberations are in their early stages and the timing of any decisions are unclear, the people said. Daimler and BMW declined to comment.
AutoNews also cites increasing trade tensions, as both companies have scaled back profit targets for this year. The two companies have already both invested in a digital mapping company alongside fellow German automaker Volkswagen, and recently combined the car-sharing platforms they own. 
Pretty soon half of the luxury car market is going to have Mercedes buttons littered throughout. 
5th Gear: The Founder of StreetScooter Is Going For Tesla With a New EV
Guenther Schuh, who successfully sold the electric van company StreetScooter he started to Deutsche Post AG back in 2014, is now turning to selling regular electric cars to regular people, Bloomberg reports:
While Tesla is focusing on upscale buyers and offering sports car-like performance, e.GO is taking a utilitarian tack. Its first model, the Life, is a simple urban runabout that looks like a boxy version of the Fiat 500. The four-seater boasts a cheap price for an electric car, but not much else. So far, e.GO has 3,200 pre-orders and isnt taking more. Deliveries will begin in April, and the plan is to produce 100,000 vehicles annually by 2022 on par with Teslas output last year.
The e.GO life is targeting a starting price of $18,000 with a range of 75 miles and top speed of 72 mph, or a more expensive model at $22,500 which can go up to 114 miles with a top speed of 94 mph. 
The only problem is nobody is really sure the novelty of being a super cheap EV will pay off. Not even Schuh:
Despite the grand ambitions, e.GOs success ultimately depends on making money on an electric car cheap enough to offset the drawbacks of limited driving ranges and long charging times (as much as 9.8 hours for the Life). Schuh is aware that hes entering uncharted waters.
I dont know any carmaker that makes money in this vehicle category, the lanky, bespectacled professor said. Especially not if theyre electric.

PHILIP MARCELO / AP,"(BOSTON) — The seaside destination that gave the world Jaws is going through its own, real-life shark crisis.
Two shark attacks, including the nation’s lone human fatality so far this year, have sparked months of debate on Cape Cod about how to respond before the start of the next beach season.
The question promises to be among the most closely watched of 2019 in Massachusetts. The region south of Boston where the 1975 blockbuster was filmed hosts about 4 million visitors a year and represents more than $1 billion in tourism spending, not to mention thousands of local jobs.
“Many of these solutions might sound good, but the devil’s in the details,” says Gregory Skomal, a state marine biologist who has been studying the region’s great whites for years and has been involved in the local debates. “It’s ultimately going to come down to what’s feasible.”
A primer on where things stand:
The Attacks
On Sept. 15, 26-year-old Revere resident Arthur Medici was attacked by a shark while boogie boarding off of a beach in Wellfleet. His death was the state’s first human shark fatality since 1936.
Weeks earlier, 61-year-old New York resident Bill Lytton survived a shark attack while swimming off a beach in nearby Truro by punching the powerful predator in the gills. He spent months recovering in a Boston hospital from the Aug. 15 attack, which was the state’s first since 2012.
A Growing Debate
The attacks have sparked spirited forums drawing out a colorful slice of the Cape Cod community, from surfers and environmental activists to marine biologists, commercial fisherman, lifelong residents and shop owners. Those gatherings aren’t expected to diminish next year. Among the first will be a “Shark Conversation” with state officials, business leaders, scientists and others that the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce is organizing. Wendy Northcross, the chamber’s CEO, says the hope is to brainstorm ways to “maintain confidence in Cape Cod as a destination and to keep people safe.”
Better Communication
Making sure visitors at some of the peninsula’s most remote beaches can quickly alert emergency officials is among the early priorities identified by town officials. Some communities are looking into installing emergency call boxes or pay phones near beach entrances. Others have also suggested appealing to mobile carriers to boost cell coverage that can be spotty at best in places.
Improved Emergency Response
Placing “trauma kits” stocked with tourniquets, gloves and other medical supplies at beaches is another measure local officials are planning to introduce in 2019. Leslie Reynolds, chief ranger for the Cape Cod National Seashore, says it has already purchased kits for its six, federally-managed beaches. She says they’ll be strategically placed where the public can quickly access them when lifeguards aren’t on duty. Local police and fire departments, meanwhile, have been hosting public trainings on how to tie a proper tourniquet, and some officials have discussed possibly extending lifeguard service beyond the traditional season’s end on Labor Day.
Eyes in the Sky
Detecting sharks through underwater sonar or aerial drones has emerged as another popular talking point at local meetings. Communities in Australia and California have been using drones in recent years. Some are even equipped with sophisticated software that discerns sharks from dolphins, whales and other marine life. But local officials have voiced concerns about cost and effectiveness. Daniel Hoort, the town administrator in Wellfleet, the site of this year’s fatal attack, also worries early warning systems might give swimmers a “false sense of security.”
Barriers and Nets
Constructing ocean barriers to enclose popular swimming beaches has been discussed by officials in recent years as the shark population has surged. The netted barriers are used in parts of Australia, South Africa and Hong Kong. But among the persistent concerns is that the netting could be harmful to other marine life. The Cape’s rough waters and abundance of seaweed and other debris could also make them costly to maintain.
Culling Seals and Sharks
Some local surfers and fishermen have formed a group to pursue perhaps the most controversial solution: reducing the Cape’s seal and shark populations outright. The “Atlantic Human Conservancy” is a riff on the region’s prominent shark research and education organization, the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy. Founder Karl Hoefer didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. But he’s said the group will push for an amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act so seals can once again be hunted. Great white sharks are also federally protected.

Justin T. Westbrook,"As the automotive industry continues to throw all of its weight behind developing self-driving technologies for the near-future, looking back on 2018which included lawsuits, wake-up calls about limitations and the first known pedestrian fatality from a self-driving cardoes anything but sell the promise of having feasible self-driving cars on the road anytime soon.
Contrary to what our tech overlords in Silicon Valley (and, to be fair, Detroit too) have been saying, we will not have fully driverless cars in a couple years. Or even several years. If anything, this last year has only proven that self-driving cars wont be viable on a massive scale for decades. 
So many of this years stories involved technology failing in everyday circumstances, companies delaying their development programs, governments that are clueless about what to do with the emerging tech, and even the success stories show just how limited the technology still is from being ready for prime time.
Elon Musk himself once had to come to the conclusion that humans are underrated. It turns out thats true behind the wheel too.
Lets break down what did and didnt work out in the biggest year ever for self-driving cars.
The Technology Isnt Even Near Being Ready
By far the biggest story of this year for the entire automotive industry was the death of Elaine Herzberg in March, who was struck and killed crossing the street at night by an Uber-owned self-driving Volvo XC90 test car while the safety driver watched a show on their phone. Further investigation showed the car detected Herzberg in the road and had up to six seconds to respond, but failed to do so. 
At the time, Uber was one of the only companies to require only a single safety driver in its self-driving test cars, where most other companies had two occupants in the car during testing. Since the car had no other way of actively tracking driver awareness, both the safety driver and the cars computer failed to avoid killing Herzberg, despite clear weather, street lights, and vehicles sensors that should have been capable of braking before impact. 
Uber has concluded the likely reason why one of its self-driving cars fatally struck a pedestrian

Not only did the incident lead Uber to completely back out of its Arizona test operations and lay off hundreds of workers, it proved that the cars suite of sensors and computers were clearly not prepared to be making life and death decisions on public roads. 
It also tested the publics acceptance to the presence of self-driving vehicles taking over the roads, with Arizona Governor Doug Ducey rescinding Ubers license to test despite championing his own governments lack of oversight and regulations for Ubers program just a couple of years before. 
But Uber wasnt the only company that ran into setbacks for its self-driving program. Volvo delayed its autonomous car program by four years, which would have put Swedish families in allegedly self-driving capable cars in 2018 as part of a pilot program. The automaker admitted that the sensor technology required would likely be more capable and easier to implement closer to 2021.
Tesla delayed its highly publicized goal to perform a fully-autonomous demo in one of its cars from coast to coast. Originally pitched in January of 2017, it was moved to maybe happen by the end of this year, and now its unclear when it will happen. While itd ultimately be more of a marketing gimmick, the continual delay of such an ambitious demonstration proves that Autopilotwhich uses machine learning based on the data of its customer cars to improve its self-driving capabilitiesmay still be far off from truly safe self-driving capability. 
In an unusually tame call with investors Wednesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dialed back a long-running

Tesla also had a brief issue with some owners losing all Autopilot functionality after an over-the-air update to their cars back in September. The fix took a day to implement, and while it only meant that Tesla owners had to actually pay full attention during their highway commutes, what happens when an update bricks someones car in the future?
Googles Waymo also had its fair share of rough headlines this year, despite being one of the few companies to actually get its pilot program of public self-driving car-sharing off the ground on schedule. 
In August, a big report from The Information cited five unnamed sources who claimed that Waymos self-driving cars struggled with basic infrastructure comprehension and driving tasks, like making an unprotected left turn or stopping at traffic signals designed to control the flow of traffic from a ramp onto a road.
Despite a few issues this year with crashes and reports indicating its cars struggle with certain aspects of everyday driving, Waymo managed to get its self-driving ride-sharing program up and running earlier this month. 
Conditions Need to be Perfect
The commercial service operates as a fleet of self-driving taxis for riders who have participated in the companys previous free pilot programs in the Phoneix area. Now participants pay a fare to ride in a self-driving car, with access to a region of about 100 square miles covering Chandler, Tempe, Mesa, and Gilbert, and it operates essentially just like Uber or Lyft. 
The cars still come with a safety driver in the drivers seat, but an early demonstration to Reuters proved to be successful, with the driver never having to intervene.
However, its clear that Waymo has cherry-picked this area of Arizona due to the near-perfect conditions for testing a new self-driving car without having to worry about inclement weather. Take Waymos car somewhere that isnt sunny and dry almost every day out of the year, and it likely would not be able to perform at the same level of safety. In these perfect conditions, as we tested for ourselves in Vegas earlier this year in a self-driving Lyft test car, the technology is undisputedly impressive.
(This is also one reason, along with Carnegie Mellon being nearby, that Pittsburgh is becoming a hotbed of autonomous car testing. The cars will have to learn to handle potholes, hills and brutal snow to be viable.)
Even the head of Googles self-driving car unit, former Hyundai exec John Krafcik, has publicly doubted self-driving cars will ever be able to perform in all conditions. He also believes we still have decades to go before the average person even has access to a self-driving car.
Its a Business of Egos
Perhaps the clearest narrative this year was just how messy the companies behind the biggest self-driving programs are, and how far theyre willing to go to protect their trade secrets.
The high-profile lawsuit where Waymo accused former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski of stealing its self-driving truck technology when he left to go work for Uber was settled in just a week. The settlement ruled that Uber could not incorporate any of the technology Google claimed was stolen into its vehicles and pay a settlement of about $245 million.
Well, that was fast. Not even a week into a high-profile trial between Googles self-driving car

All of this shook out right after Uber replaced its scandal-marred CEO Travis Kalanick, and Faraday Future and Apple had issues with employees over allegedly attempting to take trade secrets to other companies. Even Disneys plans to outfit its parks with self-driving shuttles ended in a major lawsuit. 
Speaking of that Levandowski guy, it turns out he was the epitome of Silicon Valley ego. In his time at Google, he reportedly believed that there was nothing to learn from history, safety could not be a number one priority in the development of new technology, believed he deserved a minimum of a billion dollars for his work.
If you think thats a little crazy, keep in mind this guy was extremely influential over what became Waymo.
One extremely alarming story from an article in the New Yorker alleges that Levandowski once tried to convince a coworker that their technology was more capable, and was being held back by the testing program. So he modified one of the cars to go off-route on an untested part of the freeway, where it ran another car off the road and into the median. 
Levandowski kept on driving, never alerted the authorities or reported the incident, and later presented video of the incident to Waymo employees as an invaluable resource of information for further development.

And hes a dude who once said this:
The only thing that matters is the future, he told me after the civil trial was settled. I dont even know why we study history. Its entertaining, I guessthe dinosaurs and the Neanderthals and the Industrial Revolution, and stuff like that. But what already happened doesnt really matter. You dont need to know that history to build on what they made. In technology, all that matters is tomorrow.
Ugh.
The future of automotive safety and security boils down to the egos of these companies and their leadership, and if 2018 has proven one thing, its that theyre anything but reliable.
Governments Arent Prepared
Unfortunately, these are the people that many government official want to trust to keep consumers safe without much oversight, as the year has proven. 
General Motors and its Cruise self-driving test operation announced earlier this year that it had a permit from the state of New York to begin testing its self-driving vehicles on the crazy streets of Manhattanlikely a much tougher test than what Waymos cars are subject to down in the Southwest. 
But Cruises cars still arent on city streets, as it would appear the company still doesnt have the permit necessary according to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, as we reported back in September. When the project was announced by the governors office in October of last year, the Mayors office of New York City had not been consulted. GM now says the holdup is due to a complex regulatory environment.
So its not only the companies developing self-driving cars that are having problems getting along. 
Whats even more alarming is the approach by some lawmakers to legally stay out of the way of self-driving car development. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said such companies should be given the benefit of the doubt, as he thinks theyre working to make cars safer. This comment came after the Uber test car killed someone on a public street. 
The federal government isnt much better, as its major self-driving car legislation, the AV START Act, had to be overhauled after critics claimed it didnt go far enough in establishing safety standards for the new technology. Even the revised version of the bill was criticized by the Center for Automotive Safety as being a lot of hot air which has no substantial safety improvements but will likely inflate car and tech company stock prices.
The outlook for self-driving cars going into next year is essentially the same as it was going into this year, except with more companies jumping inbut no clear path on how these things will be viable. 
Were still unclear on how to legislate for cars that drive themselves, we cant be confident that the companies rushing to get cars on public roads are doing enough to ensure theyre ready, and we still dont know if there will ever be a substantial market demanding them when they are ready. And theres more doubt in the minds of the public than ever. 
But we do know it will be decades before the technology is ready to go mainstream, though theyll likely never be prepared for every driving condition. And we know that currently, they arent good enough to avoid a woman walking a bicycle across the street at night. 
And then theres the root question of it all: How do we begin to define what good enough even is?","As the automotive industry continues to throw all of its weight behind developing self-driving technologies for the near-future, looking back on 2018—which included lawsuits, wake-up calls about limitations and the first known pedestrian fatality from a self-…",2018-12-19T16:08:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Jalopnik.com'}",2018 Was a Hard Reality Check For Autonomous Cars,https://jalopnik.com/2018-was-a-hard-reality-check-for-autonomous-cars-1831182272,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--yS0tRLVU--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/eve2yshy5fzj6mwvouhj.jpg",,Jalopnik.com,fatality,1

Bethesda denies that Fallout 76 is going free-to-play!
The Uncharted movie that won't ever happen has a new director!
Mortal Kombat 11 is a thing and more!
In all my years of following games media, I don't think I've ever witnessed a publisher have such a downright terrible year as EA did in 2017. Now in 2019, I genuinely believe one of Disney's biggest mistakes with the Star Wars brand was making an exclusive deal with EA in the first place. There used to be numerous Star Wars games that would release on a year-to-year basis, sometimes even multiple. Sure, some weren't that great, but plenty were fantastic. 
Now, EA has had the exclusive license to create Star Wars video games for roughly six years now. In that time we've gotten two Battlefront games, a lootbox gambling controversy that broke into mainstream news across the world, and a bunch of canceled projects that even resulted in a studio closure. I'm shocked Disney has yet to scrap that exclusive deal and let other studios and publishers take a crack at that franchise.

He said they were all in good spirits and were incredibly happy to see someone from the school showing up to show support. “That was the best feeling I’ve ever had. In a tough situation like this, seeing the student light up, seeing the parents light up, the family light up. It was a good feeling, just to lend a hand of support, to let them know that we are here,"" Wilson said. And that support, he said, extends to all students at Woodson. The district told ABC Action News they brought in extra resources. “We had several guidance counselors from all over. And onslaught of support came in to help our students, help our parents, help our faculty and staff get through this situation,"" Wilson said. Tampa Police say the cause of the crash remains under investigation. ""At this time it does not appear that the crash was intentional and it does not appear that the driver was impaired. It is unclear whether the driver was speeding at the time of the crash, though a witness said he believed the car was traveling at a high rate of speed,"" Tampa Police said in a press release. Police say that charges are pending. Because of the speeding concerns, ABC Action News took a closer look at the data. This year, Tampa Police have not issued any speeding or reckless driving citations on Bougainvillea, on the stretch of road they examined near the crash. Breaking down overall crash numbers from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, ABC Action News zeroed in on a 1.5-mile stretch of E. Bougainvillea between Nebraska Avenue and N. 3th St. In the state database, we found 32 crashes documented in 2016, 28 in 2017 and 20 so far this year. As for the 2017 number, the department says it is in the process of reconciling the crash fatality data, so the numbers may fluctuate periodically. Story Developing.

halani@postandcourier.com","The death of an Air Force Thunderbirds pilot in a training crash Wednesday leaves open the question whether the service's top precision performance team will appear at the Charleston base's air show in three weeks. Maj. Stephen Del Bagno, 34, was killed when his F-16 Fighting Falcon crashed over the Nevada Test and Training Range during a routine training flight. Charleston base officials said the Air and Space Expo will go forward, with or without the Thunderbirds on the bill. ""A lot of hard work and dedication from Charleston and community members put together what we believe is one of the finest air shows in the Department of Defense,"" Joint Base Charleston spokesman Marvin Krause said of the April 28 event. ""We are honored to provide a close up and personal look at the outstanding men and women of your military and its exceptional capabilities."" This is the Lowcountry's first military expo since 2011. Multiple other flying groups and ground displays of aircraft are planned. The Thunderbirds canceled their scheduled performance at this weekend's Air Reserve Base in California. The investigation into Wednesday's fatal crash is still ongoing. Nellis Air Force Base Sgt. Kristin High told The Post and Courier that details were unlikely to surface for some time. The Air Force formed the Thunderbirds in 1953 and the team is based at Nellis, in Nevada. According to The Associated Press, the team's worst accident was the ""Diamond Crash"" in 1982. Four pilots were flying over Thunderbird Lake in a diamond formation. A malfunction in the leader's plane led him and the three others to crash in the desert. All four pilots perished in the crash. +1 Thunderbirds pilot Maj. Stephen Del Bagno was killed Wednesday when his F-16 crashed. Provided Del Bagno was a native of Valencia, Calif., and graduated from Utah Valley State University in 2005, according to the Thunderbirds' website. Del Bagno was in his first year with the Thunderbirds when he died. Before joining the Thunderbirds, he served as an F-35A Evaluator Pilot at the Elgin Air Force Base in Florida. Before joining the Air Force, Del Bagno was a civilian flight instructor, corporate pilot, skywriter and a banner tow pilot. All said, he had logged more than 3,500 total flight hours in more than 30 different airplanes, with 1,400 hours as an Air Force pilot. Wednesday's fatality is not the only one in recent years among military flying performance teams. About a decade ago, a Navy Blue Angels fighter pilot died during an air show in Beaufort. Toward the end of the segment, Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Davis skidded into a residential neighborhood in a fiery blast. Investigators later said Davis accelerated and turned the plane sharply to catch up to the team as it banked into formation. Reach Hannah Alani at 843-937-5428.

Alison Fox,"Two young children were killed and three others were injured — including one child’s pregnant mother — after being struck by a car in Park Slope Monday afternoon, police and fire officials said. All of the victims were pedestrians, officials said, in a crash that happened near the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street around 12:40 p.m. The children, 1-year-old Josh Lew and 4-year-old Abigail Blumenstein, were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The girl’s mother was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, according to the FDNY. She and another woman, both in their 30s, were in stable condition, police said. A man, 46, cops said, was also treated for minor injuries. The boy was in a stroller, which was dragged with the car, a white Volvo, about halfway down the block, between Fourth and Fifth avenues. The car, headed west on Ninth Street, had been stopped at a red light. The driver began to inch into the intersection, then started to speed up as people were crossing the street, police said. The female driver, 44, believed she’d had a medical episode and was being evaluated, the NYPD said. “There’s a full investigation underway,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at an unrelated news conference on Monday. “This loss of life is tragic and painful for all of us, especially parents.” NYC, in your inbox. Sign up for NYC news plus the scoop on things to do, see and eat. June Clark-Smith, 60, was standing by the intersection when the crash occurred and ran over to the visibly pregnant mother who, she said, was lying on the ground and bleeding badly. The mother kept calling for “my baby.” “She got up on one knee,” Clark-Smith said. “I said, ‘please, the ambulance is here, they’re taking care of the baby.’ I was just so scared. I was just praying.” Dan Brady, 30, said he was working nearby when he heard “a pretty distinctive sound, like a thud.” He said he ran outside and saw a group surrounding one of the children in the middle of the street. “I kinda turned away,” Brady said. “You don’t expect something like this.” Transit advocates began planning a rally for safer streets, to be held Tuesday outside of the Park Slope YMCA, which the mayor frequents and isn’t far from the site of the crash. Paul Steely White, the executive director for Transportation Alternatives, said he’d be at the mayor’s gym in the morning. White plans on following up with another Transportation Alternatives-planned rally outside of City Council offices on Broadway at noon on Tuesday, where the group will call on lawmakers to explore legislation to create comprehensive street design standards under Vision Zero for more protected space for pedestrians and cyclists while slowing vehicular speeds. “Like all New Yorkers, we’re horrified by this,” White said of the crash. “We as a city must come together to grieve but to take action to prevent this from happening again.” The intersection was the scene of one pedestrian fatality in 2016 and 10 traffic injuries since 2014, according to city data as of January 2018.

Reuters,"TEMPE, Ariz., March 28 (Reuters) - The family of a woman killed by an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle in Arizona has reached a settlement with the ride services company, ending a potential legal battle over the first fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle. Cristina Perez Hesano, attorney with the firm of Bellah Perez in Glendale, Arizona, said ""the matter has been resolved"" between Uber and the daughter and husband of Elaine Herzberg, 49, who died after being hit by an Uber self-driving SUV in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe earlier this month. The terms of the settlement were not given. The law firm representing Herzberg's daughter and husband, whose names were not disclosed, said they would have no further comment on the matter as they considered it resolved. An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment. The fallout from the accident could stall the development and testing of self-driving vehicles, designed to eventually perform far better than human drivers and to sharply reduce the number of motor vehicle fatalities that occur each year. Uber has suspended its testing in the wake of the incident. Toyota Motor Corp and chipmaker Nvidia Corp have also suspended self-driving car testing on public roads, as they and other companies await the results of an investigation into the Tempe incident, believed to be the first death of a pedestrian struck by a self-driving vehicle. Uber does not use the self-driving platform architecture of Nvidia, the chipmaker's Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on Wednesday. The March 18 fatality near downtown Tempe also presents an unprecedented liability challenge because self-driving vehicles, which are still in the development stage, involve a complex system of hardware and software often made by outside suppliers. Herzberg was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road when she was struck. Video footage from a dash-mounted camera inside the vehicle, released by Tempe police, showed the SUV traveling along a dark street when the headlights suddenly illuminated Herzberg in front of the SUV. Other footage showed that in the seconds before the accident, the human driver who was behind the wheel was mostly looking down and not at the road.

Julia Naftulin,"A man died two days after his e-cigarette exploded in his face, Time recently reported. William Eric Brown of Fort Worth, Texas was using his e-cigarette in the parking lot of a local vape shop on January 27 when the store's manager saw him having issues in the parking lot and called an ambulance. 
 After Brown was taken to the hospital, he was put into a medically induced coma and died two days later. In records obtained by INSIDER, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner lists Brown's death as ""cerebral infarction and herniation"" that resulted from parts of the exploded e-cigarette piercing his carotid artery. 
 In a CBS 11 interview, Brown's family said doctors did not operate on Brown to remove the e-cigarette fragments from his throat after he was put in a coma. 
 ""That three-piece thing went into his throat and stayed there, and that's what [doctors] should have taken out as soon as they got to the hospital, and they decided to wait until Monday or Tuesday,"" Brown's grandmother Alice Brown told CBS 11. 
 JPS Health Network has yet to comment on Brown's death, but in a statement to Time said, ""we hold ourselves to the highest standards in providing high-quality healthcare and will take family concerns seriously as we review all that transpired."" 
 JPS Health Network did not immediately reply to INSIDER's request for comment. 
 Some e-cigarettes have caused fires and explosions in the past due to defective batteries 
""Most explosions happened when the e-cigarette batteries were being charged,"" the CDC wrote on its website.
 Ben Gilbert/Business Insider 
On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that defective e-cigarette batteries have caused fires and explosions in the past, most of which occurred when the e-cigarette batteries were being charged.

 Between 2009 and 2019, the United States Fire Administration reported 195 different e-cigarette explosion or fire incidents. In 68% of the incidents, acute injuries like smoke inhalation, burns, and lacerations were reported. 
 The first reported death from an e-cigarette explosion happened in May 2018 
 Brown isn't the first person to die from an e-cigarette explosion. In May 2018, a man in St. Petersburg, Florida died after his e-cigarette exploded, causing a ""projectile wound to the head"" and burns on 80% of his body, The New York Times reported. According to a report from the United States Fire Administration, this was the first fatality from an e-cigarette explosion. 
 To address this safety issue, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asks people to report any e-cigarette explosions or other health and safety issues associated with the devices through an online form. In addition, the FDA offers e-cigarette safety tips to users, like only using the charger the device came with, replacing damaged or wet batteries, and abstaining from charging an e-cigarette overnight.

Mary Schlangenstein,"Southwest Airlines Co. warned that bookings have decreased after its first passenger fatality. Revenue from each seat flown a mile, a proxy for pricing power, will drop 1 percent to 3 percent in the current quarter, the discount carrier said in a statement Thursday. Southwest blamed as much as two percentage points of the decline on a drop in sales after an accident April 17 in which an engine exploded, killing a passenger. The sober outlook contrasted with those of rival airlines, which are predicting increases in the pricing-power gauge of as much as 5 percent. Southwest is also facing a drag from aircraft retirements and fare battles with rivals. United Continental Holdings Inc. has been boosting seating capacity in some domestic markets where it faces off against Southwest. Southwest also said it has exercised options to acquire 40 more Boeing Co. 737 Max 8 aircraft, adding 10 planes to those the airline has already scheduled to take each year 2019 through 2022. The airline’s adjusted first-quarter profit rose to 75 cents a share from a year earlier, compared with the 74-cent average from analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 1.9 percent to $4.9 billion, just short of the $5 billion expected by analysts. The shares slipped 1.5 percent to $53 ahead of regular trading in New York. Southwest tumbled 18 percent this year through Wednesday, the biggest decline on a Standard &amp; Poor’s index of major U.S. airlines. The Dallas-based carrier is still working through the aftermath of the first passenger fatality in its 47-year history. U.S. regulators ordered emergency inspections of certain CFM International Inc. engines after a fan blade broke loose during a Southwest flight from New York to Dallas on a Boeing 737-700. The engine explosion hurled shrapnel against the plane’s fuselage and blew out a window. A woman was partially sucked out of the opening and killed. Southwest said Wednesday it had completed inspections of all 265 engines in its fleet covered by a Federal Aviation Administration emergency order.

Bill Murphy Jr.,"Things went kind of nuts recently when we shared a list of the 50 U.S. states ranked by how polite their people are. If there's one thing that might be even more controversial, it's this: The 50 U.S. states, ranked by how bad their drivers are. The insurance quote site QuoteWizard compiled it. Methodology: they took 2 million data points derived from their consumers, and ""juxtaposed it to Federal Highway Administration fatality data."" Sounds pretty official, right? Among the things they looked at: accidents, speeding tickets, DUIs, traffic citations, and fatalities. Here are the highs and lows. 1. Rhode Island (best drivers in the U.S) So, Rhode Island has the best drivers in the country, huh? Having grown up there, I was skeptical. However, the reason the state ranks so high is that it's so small. Trips are short, so there's less opportunity to make trouble on the road. We're also the fourth-most polite state, so we've got that going for us. 2. Florida A fair number of people die in traffic accidents in Florida, but for whatever reason, they did well in all the other categories. Educated guess: the relative population of older people, who either don't drive, who or drive so slowly that they can't possibly hurt anyone. (I can say that because they're probably not even on the Internet.) 3. Mississippi It's about time Mississippi ranked near that top of any list for something good. I say that with love, but the state always seems to rank dead last on things like education, health, and the like. Congrats Mississippi, you got this one. 4. Michigan Given the fact that the U.S. auto industry is still based here, you'd hope it has some of the best drivers. The only reason they're not ranked even better is that they have a lot of DUIs for a state their size. 5. Arkansas I'll defer to QuoteWizard on this one: ""The Natural State's beauty extends from the outdoors to the roadways. Arkansas scored extremely well in accidents, speeding, DUIs, and citations. The only thing preventing them from earning a better ranking is their high fatality rate."" Those were the best. Now, the five states doing the ""drive of shame"" at the bottom of the list: 5th worst: Washington State Washington dropped form ninth-worst to fifth-worst between 2016 and 2017, so people will be looking for scapegoats. The leading culprit, according to QuoteWizard? All the out-of-state transplants. Maybe that's why their accident rate went dropped 19 places. 4th worst: South Carolina The Palmetto State is near the bottom of the list. Quantitatively, it has a lot to do with how many DUIs the state had in the past year. The folks at QuoteWizard cited this insane video as anecdotal proof. (It's 30 minutes, but really just a minute or two will give you the flavor): 3rd worst: Utah Utah also tied for the least-polite state in America, so I feel sorry for you guys. The only thing we can say for you is that last year you were dead-last, so at least you've improved a bit. 2nd worst: Minnesota Things are getting pretty bad in Minnesota, which went from 11th worst state in the country to 2nd worst in one year. QuoteWizard thinks it's because of bad weather, and the idea that ""Minnesota Nice"" leads to passive aggressive driving. At least they tied for 10th in politeness. The absolute worst: California What kills California on this list? All the cities: five of the 10 worst driving cities in the country are located in the Golden State. The worst of the worst is technically Sacramento, but having lived in Los Angeles, I'm really wondering how that wasn't the worst (it came in 6th worst). It's also the worst state for DUIs. At least they have all the sunshine. There are 40 other states, of course. To see where they landed on the list, check out QuoteWizard.","I was skeptical about where my home state was listed--at least, until I saw why.",2018-01-28T01:46:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","Here Are All 50 States Ranked By How Bad Their Drivers Are, According to an Insurance Site",https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/an-insurance-company-ranked-all-50-states-by-how-bad-their-drivers-are-pretty-much-everyone-is-stunned.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_535454613_342677.jpg,,Inc.com,fatality,1

"Jonathan L. Fischer, Jonathan L. Fischer","Autopilot might not be the selling point Tesla’s made it out to be. Friday night’s admission by Tesla that its autopilot mode was activated during a deadly crash by a Model X SUV earlier this month is bad for Tesla, bad for the cause of self-driving cars, and certainly bad for anyone who rides in semiautonomous or autonomous vehicles or shares the road with them. On March 23, the vehicle hit a barrier on Highway 101 near Mountain View, California, then caught fire and was hit by two other vehicles. The driver died. In an earlier statemenAt about the incident, before Tesla had been able to retrieve the SUV’s logs, the electric-vehicle company was preemptively defensive of its technology, stressing that while autopilot can’t prevent all accidents, it makes them “less likely to occur.” The Friday-evening update offers a fuller, but by no means complete, picture of what happened: In the moments before the collision, which occurred at 9:27 a.m. on Friday, March 23rd, Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken. The reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced. We have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash. According to the Wall Street Journal, the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident. The crash took place five days after a self-driving Uber being tested in Arizona killed a pedestrian at night—leading Uber to suspend its tests of the vehicles everywhere, and Arizona to suspend testing in the state by Uber. The first fatality caused by a self-driving car, it has inspired louder calls for the nascent technology to be strictly regulated as companies race to perfect it. Tesla’s autopilot is a less sophisticated technology than the fully autonomous systems that Uber, Google sister company Waymo, and others are developing, one that’s not meant to be used without an alert driver. But that hasn’t stopped Tesla owners from occasionally behaving recklessly with the feature. That’s another key difference between Tesla’s tech and Uber’s: Anyone who can afford to buy a Tesla can use it. The March 23 crash is the second known fatal incident involving Tesla’s autopilot, following a 2016 collision between a Model S and a tractor-trailer that killed the former’s driver. In that crash, as in the one last week, the driver appears not to have had his hands on the wheel, and the NTSB split blame for the fatality between shortcomings of Tesla’s technology and the driver of the tractor-trailer. We still don’t know all the details of the crash on Highway 101—like what the driver was doing and whether the autopilot failed in any way—though it will certainly receive a great deal of scrutiny at a time when many aspects of Tesla’s business are being prodded for weaknesses. The company’s stock got pummeled all week as bad news continued to pile up for the manufacturer. On Thursday it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles—almost half of the cars it’s ever sold—over an issue with power-steering bolts that it will retrofit. Perhaps most worryingly for the business, it is still struggling with manufacturing delays for the Model 3, Tesla’s mass-market electric car, whose production timeline has been consistently overestimated by CEO Elon Musk. And there’s reason to believe the company is running out of cash. All of which might help explain why Tesla’s latest update on the March 23 crash, while stressing regret for the lost life, contains more than a hint of exasperation over yet another instance in which the company must defend a technology that it believes, probably rightly, will improve road safety once perfected: In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer’s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss. But it’s also possible to believe in the promise of self-driving cars while worrying about the ways in which the technology is currently being deployed—particularly the notion that a human driver and a self-driving vehicle might account for each other’s shortcomings. The latter is still inexperienced, while the former is too easily lulled to inattention. And it’s becoming more apparent that the combination of the two can sometimes be deadly.","Friday night’s admission by Tesla that its autopilot mode was activated during a deadly crash by a Model X SUV earlier this month is bad for Tesla, bad for the cause of self-driving cars, and certainly bad for anyone who rides in semiautonomous or autonomous …",2018-03-31T16:02:45Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Another Driver Died in a Tesla That Was on Autopilot,https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/another-driver-died-in-a-tesla-that-was-on-autopilot.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/2a15e5c9-1217-45d5-a508-b93a597e6d84.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=3500x2333&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,fatality,1
