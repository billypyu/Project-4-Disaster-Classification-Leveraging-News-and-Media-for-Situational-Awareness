Ed Cara,"A comprehensive report published this week in JAMA finds that the US has overall become a safer place to live over the past 25 years. But the report also reveals that in several states and among certain age groups, it’s only become deadlier. Researchers used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, an annual research program that tracks how many people are killed and disabled by various ailments across 127 countries. They specifically looked, on a state by state level, at the mortality rate of Americans from 1990 all the way up to 2016. Between that time period, deaths dropped significantly. In 1990, the overall annual death rate was estimated to be 745.2 deaths per every 100,000 people; by 2016, the rate had dropped to 578 deaths per every 100,000 people. The average life expectancy increased as well, from 71.9 years in 1990 to 76.5 in 2016. Death and injury rates of major chronic disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, declined as well. Behind the general rosy picture, though, they also found profound differences—and worse outcomes—depending on where people lived. While someone born in Hawaii in 2016 could be expected to live 81.3 years, for instance, someone else born that same year in Mississippi had a life expectancy of 74.7 years. And though people between the ages of 50 to 99 as well as people under the age of 20 were less likely to die in 2016 in every state than they were in 1990, the same wasn’t entirely true for adults between the ages of 20 to 55. The probability of someone dying between those ages declined in 31 states and Washington DC. But in five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of death had increased by 10 percent or more from 1990 to 2016. “The US has witnessed some improvements among youth under 20 and seniors over 55, but overall the nation and some of our states are falling behind other, less developed countries,” said co-author Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in a statement.“The strain on America’s health resources is getting worse, and the need for prevention services and greater access to and quality of medical care is increasing.” As for what’s killing these adults, Mokdad and his team point to factors like the ongoing opioid crisis and mental health disorders. In 1990, they noted, opioid use disorder was the 11th leading cause of accumulated “Disability-Adjusted Life Years,” or DALYs, a measure that’s used to calculate the loss of one healthy year to disability. By 2016, it became the 7th leading cause. States such as West Virginia have tellingly reported some of the highest rates of opioid overdose deaths in recent years. DALYs attributed to major depression and anxiety disorders also increased by 17.32 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively. “These findings point to an urgent need to address mental health and drug use disorders in the United States,” the authors wrote. “There is a need for improved access to quality mental health care and screening to improve outcomes, as well as programs to prevent mental disorders and promote mental health.” These programs, as well as those that address other chronic risk factors like a poor diet or sedentary behavior, should ideally be focused at reaching out to the public though their local doctors, the authors advocate. “Primary care is our health system’s front line of defense, detection, and treatment,” Mokdad said. “Local, state, and federal dollars need to be targeted more effectively for primary care, especially for those millions of Americans not on Medicare.” [ JAMA ]","A comprehensive report published this week in JAMA finds that the US has overall become a safer place to live over the past 25 years.

Heather Alexandra,"PlayerUnknown ’s Battlegrounds has slowly expanded with new weapons and an additional, somewhat controversial desert map. A new blog post by PlayerUnknown today outlines numerous upcoming changes to the game, the most interesting of which is a sneak peek at a chaotic-looking new map. In a blog post today, game director Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene outlined a series of features coming to the game throughout 2018. Tweaks like new building textures and game stability should create a more distinct world that’s also less laggy, while the addition of emotes will be perfect for pissing off enemies. One of the largest updates in the post is a new map that is considerably smaller than anything the game’s had before. The unnamed island is 4x4 squares, half the size of the forest-heavy Erangel or the sprawling desert Miramar. While the game’s scale previously offered plenty of options for dropping into a map or finding loot, the size started to become a problem once Miramar was added in December. The massive map had numerous open fields and cities were spread far apart. It led some players to wonder if the map was too large, and many others deleted the maps files from their game to play on the slightly more dense map of Erangel. This new map’s small scale seems focused on offering a faster experience. “It’s a much smaller map and should give you all a much more intense and faster paced Battle Royale experience,” Greene wrote in the blog post. “It will offer a higher player density and shorter matches and we want to get it into your hands early this time around so we can use your input to make it a great experience for everyone.” The smaller map size also offers an experience closer to the game’s chief competitor Fortnite Battle Royale, which features a slightly more cramped map that brings players together faster. Players will be able to test the new map some time next month.","PlayerUnknown ’s Battlegrounds has slowly expanded with new weapons and an additional, somewhat controversial desert map.

Ryan Pickrell,"Marine rifle squads are getting their hands on upgraded night vision goggles, which are expected to offer ""exponential"" increases in lethality, the Marine Corps revealed in a statement. 
 The new helmet-mounted night vision system the Marines are receiving is the Squad Binocular Night Vision Goggles. 
 ""It's a little bit lighter than the current system, and gives Marines better depth perception when they are performing movements,"" Joe Blackstone, the head of the Optics team at Marine Corps Systems Command explained. 
 Marines first began taking delivery of the new equipment at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina last month. The infantry has been training with the goggles, learning how to operate and maintain the new night vision devices.

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","The Category 3 storm is expected to make landfall on Wednesday afternoon with winds up to 125 mph. USA TODAY Map shows areas along the coast of Florida that are under storm surge warnings and a storm surge watch as of 6:30 p.m. ET, Oct. 9. (Photo: Frank Pompa, USA TODAY) Hurricane Michael reached wind speeds up to 120 mph on Tuesday afternoon, coming within 10 mph of Category 4 status and increasing fear of greater devastation. Could it make landfall as a Category 4? If the storm's strength does not dissipate as the hurricane center predicts, Michael will be one of the strongest storms to make landfall in Florida. Only six storms in the new century hit landfall on the Florida coasts as Category 3 or better, and only one, Charley, had winds above 120 mph. The most recent Category 3 hurricane or stronger to hit the state was Hurricane Irma (115 mph) in September 2017. While wind speeds are expected to continue to intensify and could flirt with Category 4 status, Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told USA TODAY that Michael will be a significant threat, regardless. More: Hurricane Michael could rival worst storms on record to hit Florida Panhandle Related: Did 'downgraded' Florence contribute to a false sense of security? Whether Hurricane Michael makes landfall as a high Category 3 or a low Category 4 storm ""doesn't matter a ton,"" he said. The hurricane won't slow it down until it hits the coast, Klotzbach said. The wind shear has weakened, allowing wind speeds to intensify. However, wind accounts for one of the three primary factors that determine a hurricane's impact, Klotzbach said. Storm surge and rain are the the others. The potential for storm surge and inland flooding pose deadlier risks than Hurricane Michael's wind speed, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center told USA TODAY. No correlation exists between wind speed and storm surge, Feltgen said. Ninety percent of people who die in hurricanes are because of the water. 49 percent are due to the storm surge, with 25 percent due to inland flooding. The danger isn't limited the coast, as inland flooding is expected. As of the 5 p.m. Tuesday, Michael officially reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. With the eye clearing out and recon and satellite observations of a nearly closed eyewall, Michael may not be done strengthening and is as likely as not to reach Category 4 intensity in the next 12 hours, reported WeatherTigers Ryan Truchelut. While most hurricanes approaching the northern Gulf in Florida weaken on approach, Michael appears poised to defy that precedent, Truchelut said. There remains more warm water with depth that is typical in the northeastern Gulf, and the dry continental airmass that often wraps into eastern Gulf storms is unlikely to significantly disrupt the core prior to landfall, Truchelut said.

Tom McKay,"Police in Texarkana, Texas arrested 24-year-old Ricky Jared Rankin for allegedly posting a photo of an AR-15—that model of semi-automatic rifle that keeps on being used in mass slaughters across the country—to Instagram accompanied by the caption, “I’m thinking about finally going back to school,” KTBS reported. According to KTBS, the post almost immediately resulted in a police investigation, which is unsurprising given one of those rifles was allegedly used to kill at least 17 people a massacre at a high school in Broward County, Florida last week. Per the report, they haven’t determined whether the post was intended as a joke, but they have not found the firearm in question either: Detectives immediately initiated an investigation and obtained an arrest warrant for Rankin this morning. As a precautionary step, local school districts were notified of the threats and the ongoing investigation. Officers and FBI agents arrested Rankin outside his home on Park Lane without incident and then served a search warrant of the property. The weapon in the post has not been located, but weapons belonging to other family members in the home have been secured. Rankin is just one of a few people who have had visits from the cops after brandishing photos of their weapons on social media lately. Yesterday, WCTV reported the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office in Tallahassee, Florida arrested 18-year-old Kane Watson for allegedly sending a Snapchat video of himself loading a rifle with the caption “Don’t go to school.” At least three students have landed in custody in Chattanooga, Tennessee alone for threats or poorly received hoaxes on social media, per the Times Free Press, while MTN News reported the same of at least one Darby, Montana high school senior. Two other individuals were taken into custody for alleged threats to Escambia County, Florida schools last week, per the Pensacola News Journal, and another three were taken into custody in Greater Cincinnati, Ohio. In other words, various reports of these threats or very ill-advised hoaxes on social media are coming in across the US. It’s likely that the pattern is a mix of people inspired to make copycat threats or hit send on hoaxes after a high-profile mass shooting, but also increased reporting and official action taken on those threats and hoaxes. Given that one of the disputes over the US’ mass shooting crisis right now is whether they are getting dramatically more common or merely dramatically deadlier, it seems pretty likely that law enforcement scrutiny of potential online threats will continue to get more intense.","Police in Texarkana, Texas arrested 24-year-old Ricky Jared Rankin for allegedly posting a photo of an AR-15—that model of semi-automatic rifle that keeps on being used in mass slaughters across the country—to Instagram accompanied by the caption, “I’m thinki…",2018-02-21T05:10:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Man Arrested For Instagram Post of AR-15 Captioned 'Thinking About Finally Going Back to School',https://gizmodo.com/man-arrested-for-instagram-photo-of-ar-15-captioned-thi-1823179856,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--RE8M4fQP--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/ildig49r5oipxnh7sr6y.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,deadlier,1
Jim Carlton,"FRENCH MEADOWS RESERVOIR, Calif.Obscured amid the chaos of Californias latest wildfire outbreak is a striking sign of change that may help curtail future devastating infernos. After decades of butting heads, some environmentalists and logging supporters have largely come to agreement that forests need to be logged to be saved. The current fires are hitting populated areas along the edges of forests and brush lands, including the 142,000-acre Camp Fire in Northern Californias Butte County. That now ranks as the most deadly and destructive in state history, killing at least 63 people, leaving hundreds missing and destroying more than 9,800 homes. The Camp Fire and the 98,400-acre Woolsey Fire in Southern California were fueled by fierce winds in unusually dry weather, which turned much of the state into a tinder box. Another dangerous factor, land-management experts say, is that forests have become dangerously overgrown with trees and underbrush due to a mix of human influences, including a past federal policy of putting out fires, rather than letting them burn. Washington has also sharply reduced logging under pressure from environmentalists. Now, the unlikely coalition is pushing new programs to thin out forests and clear underbrush. In 2017, California joined with the U.S. Forest Service and other groups in creating the Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative, which aims to thin millions of trees from about 2.4 million acres of forestbelieved to be the largest such state-federal project in the country. The current fires have trained a spotlight on the strategy: Parts of the forest burned in the Camp Fire in and around Paradise, for example, were overgrown with small, young trees, according to a 2017 forest health plan by the Butte County Fire Safe Council, which had planned to thin a thousand acres of land there over the next decade. We need to try new things because what weve done in the past hasnt worked, said David Edelson, Sierra Nevada project director of the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit that is part of the new thinning partnership. Says Rich Gordon, president and chief executive officer of the California Forestry Association, an industry group based in Sacramento: We absolutely have to thin our forests. Through a long period of fire suppression and lack of timber production, we have allowed our forests to become overgrown. The Tahoe-Central Sierra initiatives work to log and carry out prescribed burns on national forests is expected to pick up next year. Early stages of the project had wound down for the season before the current fires. How the thinning program works to manage pine and fir forests. Thinned forest After thinning, a wildfire would burn low to the ground, with less fuel, and not destroy larger trees, which have fire-resistant bark. Fires would be more easily contained, the forest would recover more quickly and have less soil runoff. Thinning involves cutting smaller trees and other flammable brush, and also using small controlled burns. Overgrown forest A wildfire would burn more intensely and high into the tops of mature trees, which can kill them. Completely burned forests take years to regrow, greatly reducing wildlife habitat and increasing soil erosion into the water supply. The forest has thick growth with large and small trees in proximity, and dense vegetation and debris on the floor.

Graphic by Dylan Moriarty Source: The Nature Conservancy The chief aim is to better safeguard the more than 12 million acres of forest in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, roughly a third of the states total, and the source of nearly two-thirds of the water Californians depend on. Communities housing nearly a million people would also get better protection, while lessons learned could lead to more aggressive thinning projects in more populated parts of the state, supporters of the initiative say. Having the fuel loads in forests and wild lands reduced is definitely helpful in modifying fire behavior, but it needs to occur at a much greater scale than we are currently doing, said Jim Branham, executive officer of the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, a state agency that helped broker the partnership. Wildfires in forests with widely spaced trees are more likely to stay on the ground and burn themselves out, while the brush and small trees in more overgrown forests act as a ladder to carry fire higher and spread, according to a 2015 forest-health plan devised in part by the state of Washington. Thinning isnt seen as a cure-all. More than anything, climate change is making California more fire prone, according to many scientists and state officials. Six of the states 10 most destructive fires have taken place since 2015. Even if we are successful on that [thinning] front, there will undoubtedly be events that simply overwhelm us, Mr. Branham said. It is a scary future. Some environmentalists oppose even the small-scale logging of the California project. The group is removing mainly small-diameter trees as opposed to the big ones favored in the past by commercial timber operations on federal land. Tim Hermach, executive director of the Native Forest Council in Eugene, Ore., blames logging for the buildup of flammable brush and younger trees. Every time they take a tree out of a forest, theyre making it hotter, drier and more flammable, Mr. Hermach said. Others say the state isnt doing enough to better protect communities themselves from fire, such as by not allowing development in fire-prone areas and requiring prevention measures such as rooftop vents to capture flying embers. The thinning coalition represents a new front. The Nature Conservancys Mr. Edelson used to sue to block logging plans in national forests as an attorney for another green group. Now he said he sees the need for limited logging because of the dramatic rise in wildfires. That puts him in agreement not only with timber industry officials, but also U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has earned the ire of conservationists including on efforts to reduce the size of national monuments and open more areas to drilling. On Wednesday, Mr. Zinke said priority needs to be given to reducing the density of overgrown woodlands to reduce more catastrophic blazes. The bottom line is theres just too much dead and dying material, he said after touring the Camp Fire destruction. President Trump, who plans to tour the area Saturday, has blamed mismanagement for the fires. California Gov. Jerry Brown, while citing climate change and other factors for the current problems, has spoken glowingly of the Tahoe initiative. The governor on Sept. 21 signed bills authorizing a $1 billion, five-year plan to thin forests, including by easing rules on logging. A month earlier, the Trump administration announced a plan to increase the amount of thinning and controlled burns on federal lands. Forestry experts say the number of acres thinned annually needs to be more than quadrupled from the approximate one million that are done now. Eli Ilano, supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest, said the federal government has wanted to do thinning work in the past, but that the growing cost of fighting wildfires have siphoned off much of the agencys funds. The Forest Services firefighting costs soared to a record $2.4 billion in 2017 from an average of $1.1 billion a year over the prior decade. A measure contained in a spending bill signed by Mr. Trump in March will provide a dedicated fund for thinning and other forest restoration work beginning in 2020. U.S. wildfires, mostly in the West, have scorched more than 8.5 million acres so far this year as of Friday, and an average of 6.3 million acres during each of the past five years, far above a 10-year average of 3.7 million a year in the 1990s, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The threat is considered by many experts to be gravest in California, because it recently went through a five-year drought and has so many people living in wild areas. One of Californias most serious fire threats is in the national forests that blanket the Sierra Nevada, the location of the state-federal thinning project, where the U.S. Forest Service estimates 129 million trees have died due to drought and bark beetle infestations. The initiatives project covers seven counties of state, private and federal lands around Lake Tahoeone of the mountain Wests biggest tourism draws. On an afternoon in September, before the latest round of fires, the sound of logging equipment pierced the mountain air near the mile-high French Meadows Reservoir as crews cut trees in a forest owned by the American River Conservancy, another environmental group whose work is being coordinated under the partnership. Operator Brian Chamberlain wiped his brow as he took a break from a machine called a masticator, which chopped and ground small fir and cypress trees into tiny pieces. They work me like a rented mule, the 58-year-old joked as fellow lumberjacks nearby sawed and cut other larger trees and stacked the trunks in neat piles. In thinning projects, old, diseased or too small trees are individually marked for removal. Loggers move inoften operating in pairswith chain saws or heavy machinery to take down the trees, which are then stripped of limbs by another machine and stacked up. Broad stands of dead trees killed by bark beetle are often clear-cut. The finished logs are then usually hauled by truck to a commercial timber mill or shipped to a biomass plant to be converted into energy, said Mr. Edelson of the Nature Conservancy. Since there is otherwise little profit for cutters, the work usually needs to be subsidized by governments. The past acrimony over forest management is partly rooted in the timber wars of the late 1980s and 1990s, when emotions ran so high activists chained themselves to logging equipment to protect endangered species including the northern spotted owl. Amid ensuing court battles, the federal government in effect closed much of its western forests to logging.

Of particular concern is the growing severity of the infernos, which get so hot they can actually create their own weather systems, causing winds to shift and spread flames in many directions. More than a third of the terrain in some of the recent big fires in the Sierra Nevada has burned so intensely that biologists say the soil may be too damaged to regrow a forest for many years. That threatens the water supply. After the King Fire blackened nearly 100,000 acres of forest east of Sacramento in 2014, the Placer County Water Agency had to spend $5 million dredging hundreds of thousands of tons of topsoil that washed into its Hell Hole Reservoir as a result, said Marie Davis, a geologist with the agency. We want a reliable watershed, Ms. Davis said. We cant keep filling it with sediment. Lack of available labor and infrastructure are hurdles to expanding the thinning work. Many of the mills in the area have closed due to the slowdown in logging, a manager said. Many of the workers, meanwhile, including Mr. Chamberlain, the masticator operator, were at or near retirement age. Despite the challenges, proponents of the thinning said all the work was worth it.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In what is easily one of the weirdest press releases New Zealands National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) has put out, the agency announced it had unearthed a fully functioning USB drive from a mound of frozen leopard seal poop.
 The photos scientists found on it are the only clues of its owner, and the agency is offering to return it to that person for a price.
Look, animals are prone to consuming all sorts of things. They slurp up pee and guzzle bird tears. But in the increasingly dark hellscape of modernity, humans have introduced animals to a wide range of deadlier delicacies, from all sorts of plastics to knives and toxic chemicals. The USB drive is just the latest addition to the oeuvre of dystopian animal meals.
The bizarre case of the USB drive began on Oreti Beach in November 2017, a windswept stretch of sand flanked by dunes on the southern tip of New Zealands South Island. There, NIWA says a vet went to check on a emaciated leopard seal and like any normal person, decided to scoop a pile of poop to send to researchers with leopardseals.org. The group relies on volunteers to send it seal deuces so that they can get a handle on what the seals are eating. They have a whole page on the proper way to collect and send them finds (turns out an ice cream container is the preferred vessel) if rummaging around for seal poop sounds like your idea of a good time.
This particular stool sample was frozen for a year before researchers finally found the time to dismantle it. NIWA offers a helpful description of the process of how one takes apart a seal turd tower from one of the volunteers who unearthed the USB drive:
[W]e basically have to sift it. You put it under the cold tap, get all the gross stuff off, smoosh it around a bit and separate the bones, feathers, seaweed and other stuff.
Frankly, that all sounds like gross stuff. In any case, this sifting process turned up a USB drive that not only worked, but has video and photos of sea lions. The only clues of who the USB owners identity are footage of a blue kayak and the fact that they were at some point likely hanging out with leopard seals. If that sounds like you, well, NIWA is willing to return your precious, excrement-encrusted memories, but the agency says itll only return the drive if you send them more leopard seal dookie, the science equivalent of send nudes.","In what is easily one of the weirdest press releases New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) has put out, the agency announced it had unearthed a fully functioning USB drive from a mound of frozen leopard seal poop.

Adele Peters,"A recent paper in the science journal Marine Policy asks if the current focus on plastic pollution is distracting society from even larger challenges facing the ocean, and if a focus on changing bottles or straws is distracting us from making more fundamental changes to the economy. As humans have pumped greenhouses gases into the atmosphere, almost all of the resulting heat has ended up in the ocean; as water gets hotter, that’s killing fish and coral reefs. The heat also leads to sea level rise and melts polar ice sheets, leading to even more sea level rise. Hurricanes are becoming more intense. Extra carbon dioxide is making oceans more acidic, so it’s harder for marine life to survive. At the same time, large-scale commercial fishing is decimating fish populations.
Plastic pollution may not pose the same critical level of threat to marine ecosystems as climate change or overfishing, argues marine scientist Richard Stafford, a professor at the U.K.’s Bournemouth University and author of the paper. He sees the corporate focus on plastic as a form of greenwashing. An airline can appear more sustainable if it bans plastic straws even if it’s not necessarily taking steps to reduce emissions from jet fuel. Consumers using reusable water bottles might see themselves as greener even as they board a long-haul flight between continents. “Looking at simple solutions [that] are consumer driven won’t really change the economics of the situation, which is probably what we really need to change to address the big issues,” Stafford says.

Of course, it doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game: More attention on ocean plastic doesn’t automatically mean less attention on climate change or the need for broader societal change. Starbucks already buys enough renewable energy to power its stores in the U.S. and Canada, and packaging–long a more visible sign of its environmental footprint–is a logical step to tackle in addition. Plastic production itself uses around 6% of global oil (as much as aviation) and is also a source of emissions; by 2050, it may account for 15% of the total global carbon budget. Moving from single-use plastic to circular economy models, like systems of reusable packaging for food or deodorant, can make a measurable impact on emissions.
Stafford argues that there’s some evidence that people tend to fixate on one environmental issue at the expense of others. But George Leonard, chief scientist for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, says that as the organization has seen more participation in its beach cleanup work and more interest in ocean plastic in general, it has led to an uptick in interest in other ocean issues. “[Plastic] has brought the overall issue of the health of the ocean to a much broader audience,” he says. “Most of the public don’t actually live by the ocean and experience the ocean. The global conversation around plastic has really raised awareness amongst them, but it has also raised this issue amongst decision makers.”
The nonprofit works on the top threats to the ocean, he says. “We don’t just work on plastic, because plastic isn’t the only thing that threatens the ocean. Nor are we institutionally hobbled, if you will, or distracted–our work on plastics doesn’t undermine our work on overfishing or on climate change, for example. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.” The evidence about the severity of plastic pollution continues to grow. We don’t yet understand the health impacts of the fact that microplastics are in fish, whales, tiny organisms, and hundreds of other marine animals–along with bottled water and beer–but a body of research is underway. The effects in nature can be synergistic. In coral reefs, climate change can accelerate disease, but one large 2018 study of coral reefs found that in areas with plastic waste, corals were much more likely to be sick.
Of course, it’s true that governments can theoretically also address multiple major environmental issues simultaneously, and advocates can also push for sweeping changes. But at a time when the environment faces multiple emergency-level threats, do we need to prioritize? We aren’t acting quickly enough on climate change. We aren’t acting quickly enough to stem massive losses of wildlife. Because we have only a short amount of time to act, would the energy spent on plastic activism be better spent more directly on climate change or biodiversity loss? Part of the challenge with an issue like climate is its complexity; littered water bottles on a beach are both more visible and seem easier to address than an overhaul of the entire economy to move to zero emissions.
Stafford argues that fundamental change is necessary–and that plastic also needs to be addressed at a more basic level than some solutions now, which propose swapping in new materials but still selling the same products in the same ways. The focus, he writes in the paper, “needs to be on making the way we live more sustainable by questioning our over-consumptive consumerist lifestyles, rather than a narrower focus on sustainable consumer choices–i.e., reform the way we live rather than tweak the choices we make.”","The ocean is heating up, acidifying, and rising.

Joe Berkowitz,"Although Stormy Daniels allegedly spanked Donald Trump (with a magazine bearing his own grinning mug, no less) a dozen years ago, the real ass-whupping arrived on Sunday night. Daniels, the adult film star whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, braved the threat of a $20M lawsuit to appear on 60 Minutes and discuss her alleged affair with the president. (Interestingly, that figure works out to roughly one dollar per every 1.05 viewers, notching 60 Minutes up to its highest ratings since Obama’s post-election interview in 2008.) The interview segment revealed Daniels to be every bit as savvy as she’s seemed since she began publicly navigating her options after news broke in January that she’d accepted $130K in hush money at the tail end of the 2016 election. Much like B Rabbit’s’s final rap battle in the film 8 Mile, Daniels took away all the ammunition her opponents might use against her by addressing it point by point. Yes, she is capitalizing off this moment somewhat. But a.) who in her position wouldn’t, and b.) it’s not a position she asked to be in. She also made a point to separate herself from the #MeToo movement—a movement that does encompasses several Trump accusers, though—and underscored that the alleged affair was consensual. When she mentioned that Trump raised the prospect of her appearing on Celebrity Apprentice before they first had sex, interviewer Anderson Cooper asked whether Daniels thought he actually wanted her for the show or whether he was using the offer as sexual leverage. With zero hesitation, she answered: “Both.” One question many people have been asking about Daniels since she first came into the public eye is why she has lied about the alleged affair before. Back in January, she even signed a statement claiming, “I am not denying this affair because I was paid ‘hush money’ as has been reported in overseas-owned tabloids. I am denying this affair because it never happened.” Most headlines stemming from the 60 Minutes interview focus on part of Daniels’ explanation for why she has wavered on this point. As she tells Cooper, after making a deal in May 2011 to sell her story for $15,000 to the magazine In Touch —which was allegedly canceled after intervention from Cohen—someone threatened Daniels in front of her young daughter. “Beautiful little girl,” the anonymous goon allegedly said. “Be a shame if something happened to her mom.” As easy as it may be to buy that Trump’s shadiest lawyer would hire somebody who speaks in warmed-over mafia clichés that have long since descended into parody to threaten Daniels, it will be near-impossible to prove. One thing that emerged from the interview that seems beyond the shadow of a doubt is Daniels’ credible account of Trump as Bumbling Seduction Dork. Donald Trump [Photo: Flickr user Gage Skidmore ] As any sentient organism might observe on any day of the week, Donald Trump’s ego is galactic-sized. Just this morning, he tweeted a plug for a janky-looking book written about his massive election victory, with the dubious claim that “everybody is talking about” it. The thing about Trump’s ego, though, is that it hinges on his self-conception as the ultimate alpha male. Who cares that he’s constantly whining about how unfairly he’s treated, takes vacations every weekend and is prone to cancelling foreign trips to countries where he’ll be protested? In his own mind, Trump is like if Rambo, Casanova, and David Beckham formed one guy and that guy had access to the nuclear codes. The portion of Stormy Daniels’ 60 Minutes interview in which she described the alleged affair itself punctures that image at every turn, and leaves Trump without a fig leaf to hide behind. Even worse, she served her story with a snarky smile, relishing each detail, the smaller and more pathetic they made Trump look. It’s basically every straight man’s worst fear of how a woman he once dated might describe her to her friends—only in this instance, she told it to 24 million people on national television. Here are the most devastating moments that surely led to some Sunday night screaming in the West Wing. The Incompetent Seduction Begins Trump and Daniels met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in 2006, after which he invited her to have dinner in his hotel suite. According to Daniels’ interview, he started their conversation by talking all about himself and asking whether she’d seen the magazine whose cover bore his mug that month. Self-absorption is the status quo for Trump, so no surprise there. It’s what happened next that’s interesting. “Does this normally work for you?” Daniels claims she asked, clearly unimpressed. Even worse, Trump apparently did not understand what she meant by calling out his misguided approach. This interaction then allegedly segued into the most salacious section of the interview, which was previously reported—that Daniels then said, “Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it,” and Trump relented. Trump’s Troubling Ivanka Fixation Amazingly, Trump’s boast on The View that if Ivanka weren’t his daughter, perhaps he’d be dating her is only one of many creepy admissions on the topic. The 60 Minutes interview adds another to the canon, with Daniels claiming that Trump told her, mid-seduction: “You’re special. You remind me of my daughter.” The Bed Perch Upon leaving Trump’s bathroom, Daniels found her host presenting himself—”perched”—on the edge of his bed. She demonstrated to Cooper how Trump had arranged himself, arms splayed out on either side in a faux-casual lounge mode that recalls his infamous robe photo. All in all, Trump’s woo-pitching attempts sound like entry-level pickup artist technique. “Bad Things Happen” Trump likely considers himself irresistible to women. While Daniels did ultimately decide to give Trump a try, to hear her tell it, the pleasure was all his. It seems from the interview that the encounter was more a situation where Daniels realized sex was expected, and she made the mental calculus that she was okay with it happening. “I realized what I’d gotten myself into,” she said to Cooper, smiling. “I was like, ‘Uhhh, here we go.’… You put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen. You deserve this.” Fatal Non-Attraction Lest there by any confusion about the nature of the perfunctory sex reported to take place that night, Cooper follows up with some clarifying questions. “You were 27 and he was 60. Were you attracted to him?” he asks. The answer is a point-blank “No.” Ouch. Speaker Phone Continuing the nightmare scenario for any man as terrified of being humiliated by a woman as Trump seems to be, Daniels admitted that when Trump called her in the months that followed, she would sometimes be around company and would put Trump on speaker phone. Daniels is savvy enough not to elaborate on this point, but obviously the only reason to do so would be so she and her friends could later mock Trump together as a group activity. No Second Chances It turns out Daniels was right to be skeptical about Trump’s offer to put her on Celebrity Apprentice. When he eventually told her, a year after their original encounter, that he wanted to discuss such an opportunity, she approached it like a business deal. Daniels reportedly met Trump at his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, where instead of talking business, he wanted them to watch Shark Week together. According to Daniels’ account, when Trump eventually came on to her, she asked about the Apprentice development he’d mentioned on the phone. Trump said he was close to a deal and would know more next month. Daniels then responded that he should call her the following month, grabbed her purse, and left—a mic drop finale to their entire affair. Of course, the following month Trump informed her that she would not be on the show after all. Neither probably predicted how much of a powerhouse ratings combo they’d eventually prove to be on television.",Today’s post-interview headline focus on an alleged threat against Daniels’ life in 2011. But she dealt a deadlier blow to Trump’s ego and Casanova self-image.

Tom McKay,"The Metropolitan Police said on Sunday that 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess, one of two more individuals exposed to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in the UK this week, has died. In a statement to CNN, UK Counter Terrorism official Neil Basu said that “This is shocking and tragic news. Dawn leaves behind her family, including three children, and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this extremely difficult time.” The other individual exposed to the toxin, 45-year-old Charles Rowley, remains hospitalized and in critical condition. Novichok, which the Soviets developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a next-generation nerve agent deadlier than others like VX or sarin, was the chemical authorities identified as the substance behind the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal, his daugher Yulia, and a police officer in Salisbury in March. According to Reuters, the non-profit Nuclear Threat Initiative believes that at one point, Russia had stockpiled “thousands of tonnes” of the nerve agent. While Russia made a point last year of destroying its last remaining stockpiles of publicly declared chemical weapons, Reuters noted that it is “not believed to have ever declared Novichok or its ingredients to the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).” The Skripals, as well as the police officer, have recovered. Authorities are still investigating the incident, which has been widely speculated to be a revenge hit by Russian intelligence services or organized crime— part of a pattern of allegedly suspicious deaths of supposed traitors to the Russian state living abroad in the UK. For its part, Russian government officials have denied all involvement, while at least some British officials have urged caution in attributing blame. Per CNN, authorities currently believe that Sturgess and Rowley came into contact with a contaminated item via their hands, but currently lack the ability to determine whether the poison is from the same batch that the Skripals ingested. The Guardian previously reported that Sturgess and Rowley resided “barely eight miles” from the site of the Skripal poisoning. It is likely that Sturgess and Rowley were unintentionally exposed to Novichok used in the original attack that somehow survived extensive British cleanup efforts. Per the BBC, both counter-terror officials and police are involved in the investigation into Sturgess’ death, while a post-mortem examination (autopsy) is planned: A post-mortem examination of Ms Sturgess, from Durrington, is due to take place and her family has been informed, police said. The investigation is being led by detectives from the Counter-Terrorism Policing Network and about 100 detectives are working on the case alongside Wiltshire Police. The Guardian wrote that while British health officials still say there is no broader threat to the public, they are still advising locals to avoid picking up objects such as “needles, syringes and unusual containers.” [ CNN ]","The Metropolitan Police said on Sunday that 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess, one of two more individuals exposed to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in the UK this week, has died.

Alex Lockie,"Up, Up and Away: An F-35C conducts a catapult take-off from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower the U.S. Navy’s Development Test II. Lockheed Martin/Andrew McMurtrie The US Navy hit a major milestone in its quest to make aircraft carriers a more deadly, potent force by sailing the USS Abraham Lincoln with F-35C stealth fighters training alongside F/A-18s for the first time. The Navy's F-35C represents the most troubled branch of the F-35 family. With the Air Force and Marines Corps F-35s coming online over a year ago, the F-35C sorely lags behind as it struggled to master carrier takeoff and landings. The F-35C's ability to launch off the decks of the US's 11 supercarriers positions it as the replacement to the long-serving F/A-18 Super Hornet, and the first carrier-launched stealth fighter to ever take to the seas. The USNI News reported on Tuesday that the F-35C has trained alongside F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, and E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes early warning planes. Rear Adm. Dale Horan, charged with integrating the F-35C into the Navy, told USNI News that unlike previous tests that merely saw carriers launching and landing the stealth jets, this time they're ""conducting missions they would do in combat, if required."" Additionally, the crew of the carrier will become familiar with maintaining the F-35C while at sea. Since the F-35's inception, boosters have billed it as a revolution in aerial combat. Never before have stealth aircraft launched off aircraft carriers, nor have planes with such advanced sensors and capabilities. The new F-35C prepares to takeoff alongside an F/A-18E/F. USNI News via YouTube. In the future, stealth F-35s could relay targeting information to fighter jets and Navy ships further back from battle to coordinate the destruction of enemy air defenses without firing a shot. The F-35s, with a stealth design and unprecedented situational awareness provided to its pilots, was designed to fight in highly contested air defense environments, which today's decades-old fighter designs would struggle with. The US's move towards stealth platforms meant to challenge the defenses of top-tier militaries like Russia and China represents a broader shift towards strategic competition against great powers, rather than the usual mission of suppressing small non-state actors on the ground.","The US Navy hit a major milestone in its quest to make aircraft carriers a more deadly with F-35Cs training alongside current fighter jets.

Joel Stocksdale,"While it may seem a bit obvious to most of us that teen drivers driving around with teen passengers is a more dangerous proposition than them driving solo or with parents, what's not as obvious is how huge a difference that really makes. AAA conducted a study of traffic collisions involving teen drivers, and the organization discovered that the rate of fatal injuries increased by a whopping 51 percent when the teen driver had teenage passengers versus when teen drivers were driving solo. Even more shocking, that fatality rate was an increase for all people involved, including the teenage occupants, occupants in other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. Breaking down that overall 51 percent rating, we find that the people most at risk of teens driving with teens are other motorists, who are 56 percent more likely to be killed than if they were hit by a solo teen. The teen driver is 45 percent more likely to be killed, and pedestrians and cyclists are 17 percent more likely to be killed. Furthermore, the AAA study discovered that the fatality rate in teen collisions increases by a factor of nearly four when at night or when speeding is a factor. AAA does suggest a number of ways to help prevent teen drivers from being in these risky situations. The main key is to just keep your teen from driving with other teenage drivers for as long as possible. The organization recommends getting at least 100 hours of driving time with a parent onboard before letting a teen drive solo, and not having more than one teen as a passenger for at least 6 months. As it so happens, many states have requirements similar to these recommendations as part of getting a driver's permit or license. Further incentive for keeping only experienced drivers in the passenger seat early on is that AAA found the fatality rate in collisions drops 8 percent when there's a passenger over 35 instead of a teen driving solo. And of course, AAA recommends spending lots of time practicing driving with your teenage driver, starting with easy situations to get used to the car, and gradually ramping up.

Daniel Brown,"Russia says its planning to design its own tilt-rotor aircraft like the US' V-22 Osprey, according to The National Interest, citing Sputnik, a Russian state-owned media outlet. ""A tilt-rotor aircraft, or convertiplane, is planned to be created for Russian Airborne Forces,"" Sputnik reported, citing a Russian defense industry source. ""Before the end of September, it is planned to get the customer specification and start the experimental design work for this aircraft,"" the source told Sputnik. Russian defense contractor Rostec also said in 2017 that it was building an electric tilt-rotor aircraft, which it said would be completed in 2019. Tilt-rotor aircraft are basically a hybrid of a helicopter and fixed-wing plane that has the speed and range of an airplane, but can also take off and land like a helicopter. The V-22 has a max cruising speed of 310 miles per hour. The elite Russian Airborne Forces, or VDV, are often Moscow's first troops on the ground, like in Afghanistan and more recently in Syria. Numbering about 35,000 troops in 2010, VDV paratroopers were also deployed to South Ossetia during the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, and they blocked NATO troops from seizing the Pristina International Airport during the Kosovo War. The VDV are also different than US paratroopers in that they're known to drop in with armored vehicles and self-propelled howitzers. If Russia actually builds this tilt-rotor aircraft — a big if given Moscow's budgetary problems and inability to mass produce other new platforms like the Su-57 stealth jet and the T-14 main battle tank — it could be a deadly addition to the VDV. This is especially true if Moscow heavily arms the prospective tilt-rotor, just as the US is currently doing.

And the number of reported pediatric deaths180was the highest ever caused by a seasonal flu since the current surveillance system was established in 2004 (though the 2009 swine flu pandemic, which is not considered a seasonal flu, killed more children). Because our system of tracking flu-related death and illness has changed over the years, its difficult to know the last time the seasonal flu was as deadly. But we do know the 80,000 deaths dwarf any annual number recorded as far back as the 1976-1977 season. The previous record holder was the 2012-2013 season, which saw 56,000 deaths. Pandemic flu strains have been deadlier, however, particularly the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed an estimated 650,000 Americans. Last year was just a horrible season, Daniel Jernigan, head of the CDCs influenza division, said in a media call on Thursday. It was just a tremendous amount of disease. These figures are preliminary but unlikely to change much by the final tally, the CDC said. Part of the reason why this past season was so horrible has to do with the most predominant strain that was circulating in the country, an influenza A virus called H3N2. H3N2 is known to be more virulent than other seasonal strains, and to make matters worse, vaccines against H3N2 tend to be less effective. According to the CDC data, the vaccine this time around was only 25 percent effective against H3N2. Still, the vaccine certainly saved lives. Overall, it was about 40 percent effective at preventing the flu from all three major strains this past season. And its effectiveness was even better in age groups known to be higher risk of complications, such as the very young. Despite the added media attention (and strongly worded pleas ), the average percentage of Americans who got vaccinated barely budged from previous seasons, the CDC reported. The CDC reports that the majority (80 percent) of children who died from the flu last winter were unvaccinated. And even during the 2012-2013 season (another season when the vaccine wasnt very effective against H3N2), the vaccine still prevented more than 10,000 deaths, according to the CDC. The CDC plans to release its final estimates of how much death and illness the vaccine prevented during the 2017-2018 season later this year. But the take-home message, as always, is clear: Get the flu shot. (The CDC recommends getting it before the end of October this year, though even a later shot can still help). You might just save a life. [ CDC via Washington Post ]","This past winter’s flu season was quickly recognized as one of the worst to come along in a long time.

The U.K. Plan to Undermine Encryption With a Ghost Is Very Spooky
Despite fears that guns made with 3D printers will let criminals and terrorists easily make untraceable, undetectableplasticweapons at home, my own experience with 3D-manufacturing quality control suggests that, at least for now, 3D-printed firearms may pose as much, or maybe even more, of a threat to the people who try to make and use them.
3D-printed guns might only fire five shots [before] blowing up in your hand. A weapon with a design or printing defect might blow up or come apart in its users hand before firing even a single bullet.
As someone who uses 3D printingin his work and researches quality assurance technologies, Ive had the opportunity to see numerous printing defects and analyze what causes them. The problem is not with the concept of 3D printing, but with the exact process followed to create a specific item. Consumer 3D printers dont always create high-quality items, and regular people arent likely to engage in rigorous quality assurance testing before using a 3D-printed firearm.
Many consumer 3D printers experience a variety of glitches, causing defects in the items they make. At times, an object detaches from the platform its on while being made, ending up lopsided, broken or otherwise damaged. Flaws can be much harder to detect when the flow of filamentthe melted plastic material the item is being made fromis too hot or cold or too fast or slow, or stops when it shouldnt. Even with all of the settings right, sometimes 3D-printed objects still have defects.
When a poorly made toy or trinket breaks, it can be hazardous. A child might be left with a part that he or she could choke on, for example. However, when a firearm breaks, the result could be even more seriouseven fatal. In 2013, agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tested 3D-printed guns and found that the quality of materials and manufacturing determined whether a gun would fire multiple rounds successfully, or break apart during or after the first shot.
Home printing also risks that nefarious people might tamper with the design files on a website, publish intentionally defective designs or even create a virus that interferes with the operation of a 3D printer itself. Hackers may deliberately target 3D-printed guns, for ideological or other reasons, or inadvertently cause defects with more general attacks against 3D printing systems.
Commercial manufacturers of guns double-check their designs, test models and perform rigorous examinations to ensure their firearms work properly. Defects still happen, but theyre much less likely than with home-printed weapons.
Home printers are not designed to produce the level of consistent quality required for weapon production. They also dont have systems to detect all of the things that could go wrong and make printed weapons potentially dangerous.
This is not to say that 3D printing itself is unsafe. In fact, many companies use 3D printing to manufacture parts where safety is critical. Printed parts are used in airplanes and for medical devices, patient-specific surgical instruments, customized time-release drugs, prosthetics and hearing aids. Scientists have even proposed printing scaffolding to grow or repair human body parts.
In time, improvements to popularly available 3D printers may allow safe production of reliable parts. For instance, emerging technologies could monitor the process of printing and the filament used. The group I work withand others have developed ways to assess parts, both during printing and afterward.
Other researchers are developing ways to prevent malicious defects from being added to existing printing instructions and secure printing, more generally.
So far, though, these advances are being developed and tested in research laboratories, not incorporated into mass-produced 3D printers. For the moment, most quality control over 3D-printed parts is left to the person operating the printer, or whoever is using the item. Most consumers dont have the technical skills needed to design or perform the appropriate tests, and likely wont ever learn them. Until the machines are more sophisticated, whatever is made with themwhether firearms or other itemsisnt guaranteed to be reliable enough to use safely.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Migration has once again become one of the most important issues in Europe. Italy's decision in June not to accept the rescue vessel Aquarius with more than 600 migrants on board attracted widespread criticism, and the issue of border controls for migrants threatened to break up the German coalition government. So, how many people are arriving now, where are they from and what is happening to those who have arrived in the EU in previous years? Number of arrivals has been greatly reduced The highest number of arrivals - 1,015,078 - was recorded in 2015. More than 800,000 of them were trafficked via the sea from Turkey to Greece, and the majority of them continued to travel through Europe to reach Germany and Sweden. Since 2015, the number of refugees and migrants arriving in Greece has fallen dramatically, after the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to send back to Turkey migrants who do not apply for asylum or whose claim was rejected. While the number of arrivals has dropped in Greece, the number of people arriving in Italy shows little change on the 2015 levels. In 2016 and 2017, 180,000 and 119,000 arrived respectively, smuggled by traffickers from North Africa and rescued at sea. In 2017, Italy received 67% of the EU's migrant arrivals. However, since January this year, the number of arrivals in Italy has greatly reduced, with 17,000 arriving by mid-July 2018. In the same period, Spain received the highest number of migrants and refugees - more than 20,000 - the majority of them by sea and around 2,800 by land to Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says that routes used by human traffickers are constantly changing and are dependent on a number of factors, but the drop in numbers reaching Italy is attributed mainly to its close co-operation with the Libyan coastguard. A total of 14,500 have arrived in Greece so far this year, bringing the total number of arrivals in the EU in 2018 to just over 49,000. Syria is still the most common country of origin of those arriving in Greece. Iraqis, Afghans, Palestinians, Congolese and Iranians make up many of the other arrivals. In Italy and Spain, arrivals from African countries top the list. In Italy, the most common country of origin is Tunisia, followed by Eritrea, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Sudan. Spain received the largest number of migrants and refugees from Syria, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, Ivory Coast and a number of other Sub-Saharan African countries. Crossing the Mediterranean is becoming deadlier The highest estimated number of dead and missing migrants in the Mediterranean - 5,096 - was recorded in 2016, despite a significant drop in migrant crossings compared with the previous year. Since then the number of deaths has fallen. The Mediterranean crossing is becoming deadlier every year, if the number of estimated deaths is viewed as a proportion of the number of people who actually manage to reach the EU. In 2015, there was one death in every 269 arrivals recorded. In 2016, this went up to one death in 72 arrivals and in 2017 to one in 57 arrivals. But based on figures to mid-July 2018, the deadliest year so far has been this year, with one death for every 34 people who arrived in the EU. That's because in 2014 and 2015 the majority of refugees and migrants arriving in the EU entered Greece from Turkey, using a much shorter sea route, while since 2016, that has been replaced by a much longer and more dangerous route - to Italy from Libya. Syrians top asylum seekers list The top countries by origin of asylum seekers in the EU since 2014 are Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan, all countries with recent or ongoing conflicts. Between 2014 and 2017, a total of more than 919,000 Syrians applied for asylum in the EU. Asylum seekers from Eritrea, Bangladesh, Somalia, Iran and a number of Sub-Saharan countries are among the top 10 countries of origin of those who have been applying for asylum in the EU since 2014. Germany took the highest number of asylum seekers Sharing the burden of asylum applications equally between the EU countries is once again the top issue on the EU agenda. The June EU summit, where the leaders agreed that member states should distribute asylum seekers among themselves, has not solved the issue because the redistribution will be only on a voluntary basis. The number of first-time asylum applications reached a record level in 2016 and has fallen since. Germany granted the highest number of asylums Each asylum application is assessed on an individual basis. The process can take many years, during which the countries provide those who applied for asylum with basic housing, food, education and healthcare. At the end of the process, asylum is granted to those who can prove they fled war and persecution, but those who do not meet the criteria are refused asylum. The top country for successful asylum applications is Germany, where more than 60,000 were granted asylum in 2017, followed by France, the UK, Sweden and Austria. Failed asylum seekers The governments of the EU countries have warned that those who do not have a legitimate asylum claim will be returned to their country of origin. The European Commission estimated that there were more than two million people staying in the EU illegally in 2015. Hundreds of thousands of those who do not qualify for asylum have been returned since then, but there are still hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants living in the EU. The European Commission says it does not want its migration policy to be judged on how many returns there have been and that its aim is that everyone who qualifies for asylum gets it, with people who are not eligible not coming in the first place. A note on terminology : The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, whom governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","Who is arriving, where are they going and what is happening to those already in the EU?",2018-07-28T23:59:54Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Migration to Europe in charts,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44660699,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7518/production/_102567992_gettyimagesmumandchild.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,deadlier,1
Gemma Conroy,"Rising ocean temperatures and acidification are known to be altering the way fish grow and reproduce—and now research shows these climate change side-effects may also change how fish think and act. A recent study has found Port Jackson sharks become “right-handed” when incubated at the kind of temperatures projected to prevail by the end of this century, if climate change continues at its current pace. Some scientists think such shifts could lead to behavioral changes that tip marine ecosystems out of balance. “Handedness” is a function of lateralization—the tendency for one side of the brain or the other to take over specific tasks. This delegation of responsibilities is believed to help humans and many other animals free up brain space for other tasks, at least partly by automating some behaviors that can increase survival efficiency. For example, a default preference for swimming in a certain direction helps fish form schools and find food. Although global warming will likely be negative for large numbers of sharks, the cognitive boost offered by lateralization may turn survivors into sharper, fast-learning predators. “Lateralization may enable sharks to process information more efficiently, even if their brains are smaller or less well-developed,” says lead author Catarina Vila Pouca, a behavioral ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney. Vila Pouca and colleagues incubated Port Jackson shark eggs in seawater 3 degrees Celsius above today’s average maximum temperatures in their habitat off eastern Australia. This simulated the upper end of projections for the end of this century, when oceans are expected to be 1 to 3 degrees C warmer if greenhouse gas emissions continue at current levels. One month after these sharks hatched (only about 60 percent of them survived the embryo stage), the researchers placed the survivors into a Y-maze and assessed their turn preferences. Most preferred to turn right. Those in a control group, incubated in the current average maximum temperature of their natural environment, showed no preference. Vila Pouca and colleagues reported the findings in Symmetry earlier this year. Shark embryos can take up to 10 months to develop, making them vulnerable to high water temperatures and other environmental changes—which are known to disrupt physical growth. Hot conditions speed up metabolism, causing embryos to burn through their yolk reserves and hatch too early, Vila Pouca notes. To strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining function, some tissue and body parts may be compromised to save energy. “Brain tissue is metabolically expensive, so if embryos don’t have enough time to develop properly, this is the first thing that will be affected,” she says. Possibly to help cope with this heat-stunting, the surviving embryos’ brains become more strongly lateralized—apparently making some behaviors automatic in order to squeeze more cognitive power out of these smaller brains. This may enable sharks to better watch for threats or learn more about their environment while hunting, for example, or to scan their surroundings for competitors when seeking a mate. Although a cognitive edge may help surviving sharks adapt to warming oceans over the coming decades, the resulting changes could be detrimental to the marine ecosystems the sharks dominate. This is because sharks help maintain balance in ocean habitats by keeping prey populations under control, ensuring a diversity of marine life flourishes. If lateralization shifts the way they catch prey—and perceive their environment—these changes could cascade down the food web. Smarter sharks could make things even worse for smaller or competing fish facing their own climate change problems, such as ocean acidification, which also affects handedness in other fish species. The study is an important first step in understanding how end-of-century temperatures may impact shark cognition, says Leon Green Ekelin, an ecophysiologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who was not involved in the new work. Sharks “are underrepresented in climate change research, despite being important for ecosystem health,” he notes. But in order to gain a better understanding of how lateralization affects shark behavior in different situations he says they need to be tested in competitive scenarios. “The behavioral shift could be a beneficial response to changes in their environment,” he adds, “or it could simply be brain damage.” Vila Pouca believes understanding how climate change shapes animal behavior is important because it can reveal unexpected ways in which they may adapt to their rapidly changing environments. “Looking at lateralization can help us understand brain development and its impact on behavior,” she says. “To build a complete picture, we need to investigate how climate change may affect other behavioral traits such as escape responses and learning abilities.”","New findings reveal how rising ocean temperatures could boost sharks’ thinking, potentially disrupting food chains -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-12-03T11:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}","Warming Waters Could Make Sharks ""Right-Handed""--and Deadlier",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/warming-waters-could-make-sharks-right-handed-and-deadlier/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/497CDF1E-DD0D-48A7-9C6141FA6C11D252.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,deadlier,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Libya's coastguard intercepts more boats carrying migrants Migrants and asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean now face an even deadlier journey then they have in the past, the UN refugee agency has warned. In a report, the agency says that while the number of people arriving in Europe has fallen significantly, the number of deaths has risen sharply. Traffickers are having to take greater risks as there is more surveillance from the Libyan coastguard, it says. More than 1,600 people have died trying to reach Europe so far this year. In the central Mediterranean, one person died or went missing for every 18 people who crossed to Europe between January and July 2018, compared to one death for every 42 people who crossed in the same period in 2017, the report said. Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, the UNHCR said. As the number of those trying to cross falls, Europe should focus less on managing numbers and instead on saving lives, the agency says in its report. Smugglers 'cutting costs' On the central Mediterranean route (from northern Africa to southern Europe) so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died - most after departing from Libya. Libya's coastguard intercepts more and more boats carrying migrants, increasing the likelihood that those on board may die during the Mediterranean journeys, the UN refugee agency says. ""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coastguards,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean. ""They are trying to cut the costs: it costs them more to keep those people here longer in their warehouses, under captivity."" Matt Saltmarsh from the agency said much more needed to be done. ""We are calling for the European authorities in particular to come up with a co-ordinated strategy whereby boats can be systematically disembarked in different parts of Europe and where asylum claiming conditions and reception centres are in place ready to receive those people who arrive,"" he told the BBC. 'Guantanamo' option rejected The EU has stepped up co-operation with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. But people-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's chaos, charging desperate migrants thousands of dollars per head. The EU Commission has proposed ""regional disembarkation platforms"" in North Africa, where the UN and other agencies could screen those who have a genuine claim to asylum in Europe. Those not eligible would be offered help to resettle in their home countries. But processing centres outside the EU must not become a ""Guantanamo Bay"" for migrants, EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos warned. The EU also aims to beef up its Frontex border guard force to 10,000 staff by the end of 2020.","Traffickers are taking greater risks as Libyan coastguards ramp up surveillance, a UN report says.",2018-09-03T11:28:30Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Migrant crisis: Mediterranean crossings deadlier than ever - UNHCR,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45395468,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1407/production/_103272150_gettyimages-688760952.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,deadlier,1
Phil Hornshaw,"Shadow of the Tomb Raider will see Lara Croft raiding tombs and killing bad guys — but this time, she’ll face some serious consequences. The third title in the rebooted Tomb Raider series is advancing her character to the end of what might be considered her origin story. Where the first two games in the series found Lara tapping into her potential and finding a way to survive, Shadow of the Tomb Raider has her actively hunting down the villainous organization Trinity and taking the fight to the bad guys. In doing so, Shadow of the Tomb Raider seems poised to put Lara through harrowing moments as she comes to grips with who she has become. She’s previously faced death, destruction, and torture. This time, though, she must deal with the fallout of her increasingly violent attitude. In the short, 45-minute demo shown to journalists, it’s Lara, not the bad guys, who causes a disaster. The demo starts with Lara and her pal, Jonah, in Cozumel, Mexico. They’re following Trinity’s leader, an archaeologist named Dominguez. Lara’s determined to find out what Dominguez is searching for, so she follows him through a Day of the Dead festival. Players take control of Lara as she moves through the crowd, talking with locals to get information about Dominguez and figure out what he’s after. Before long, Lara finds her way into Trinity’s dig site and overhears that Trinity has located what they’re looking for. That’s when the Tomb Raider fans have come to expect kicks in. Reading inscriptions and looking at murals, Lara determines that a Mayan temple is not far away and climbs down a cliff to find a way into a cave below. Return to form Fans who played the last two games will be at home with Lara’s cliff-hanging skills, which include a new ability that lets her repel straight down. The cliff is ultimately a linear path on which each of Lara’s tools must be used in a specific way — much like in the last games. The harrowing paths across impossible heights make for fun puzzles, and they carry that blockbuster feel of imminent danger. Shadow of the Tomb Raider puts Lara through tough moments as she comes to grips with who she is. When Lara finally finds her way down into the cave below, she discovers a Mayan pyramid secreted away. It’s one of Shadow of the Tomb Raider ‘s new tombs, which carries with it a new approach. Eidos Montreal’s design approach to the game looks to make Shadow ‘s tombs goes beyond intricate and beautiful locations that require brains and skill to solve; the developer also wants to make them terrifying. These tombs are underground and, as in Rise of the Tomb Raider, they’re downright spooky. Shadow is also returning the ability to swim to the Tomb Raider series, with Lara diving down beneath the pyramid and navigating an underwater temple. There’s a certain claustrophobic intensity to the underwater moments, where Lara is forced to fight her way through tight confines as she squirms and struggles, trying not to drown. We’re not sure who among Tomb Raider fans wants a return to these subterranean depths, though. In the Shadow demo, the underwater portions are taught and quick, but sometimes clumsy, and feel like a throwback to a different era. Short environmentally driven scenes like these felt fresh when the first Tomb Raider reboot arrived in 2013, but they’re less inspired today, five years later. The tombs we saw were otherwise filled with puzzles that recombine elements from previous games. The rope arrows are back, in which Lara shoots an arrow with a rope tied to it at a certain kind of piece of wood or object, and then can yank it to pull down a barrier or move something. On her way to the top of the pyramid, Lara was forced to leap between bells, each one slowly lowering from her weight. At one moment, she must use a crank to rotate a mine cart into position, then use another rope and the same crank to lift the cart up a hill. Cutting the rope released the cart to send it careening into one of the bells, creating a new path upward. The sequence felt tight, even clever – but it’s clever in a way that some players might find too familiar. Unforeseen consequences At the top of the pyramid, Lara discovered what Trinity was after – a powerful dagger artifact. Fearing the supernatural shenanigans her enemies would get up to if they secured the dagger, she grabbed it — which immediately triggered a tremor in the Earth and sent her sprinting out of the cave, and back to the dig site, where Trinity soldiers were preparing to murder the Mexican workers they’d hired. Cue a combat sequence, complete with stealth. Moments that force Lara to deal with the consequences of her actions add depth to her character. You probably know what’s next, as Shadow plays exactly like previous games in the rebooted franchise. Lara can sneak up on unknowing bad guys to execute them with stealth kills, slay them with her mostly silent bow and arrow, or take them down with a host of other weapons. Crafting will be back, too, with Lara finding resources like cloth and bottles along the way. Bottles are handy to distract enemies — but combine one with cloth and it turns into a Molotov, offering a less subtle approach. We did notice a new addition to stealth. Lara has learned to weave herself across walls covered in vines, offering more paths through areas, and more places to spring out and assassinate her prey. Eidos Montreal explained that it plans for the jungle to be a major character in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and for Lara to be able to make use of its elements — like vine-covered walls, or trees she can climb — to hunt foes. It’ll also contain hazards, of course, including a few elements that’ll alter the survival-based elements of the experience, such as parasites. Those weren’t in the demo, but they seem…unpleasant. After killing a handful of Trinity soldiers, Lara found herself face to face with Dominguez. He revealed that by taking the key, Lara had meddled with forces she didn’t understand, unleashing a “cleansing” on the world. In the demo, that takes the form of a massive tsunami that thunders through Cozumel, sweeping Lara along with it. The final portion of the demo finds Lara dodging death as the current carries her past hazards like collapsing houses or jagged rebar. She eventually makes it out after diving down through a market littered with floating bodies. Later, climbing on the side of a building, Lara watches a young boy fall to his death below, just out of her reach. That, too, feels familiar. Past Tomb Raider games have reveled in the absurdly lethal challenges Lara must conquer. Placing the blame on Lara is a new twist, however, and the stakes have been dialed up to 11. While the original reboot’s plot implied a larger nefarious evil, it was mostly about the survival of Lara and her friends. Rise took a similar approach, using a struggle over the power of immortality as backdrop for exploring Lara’s past. Shadows, though, immediately puts the whole world in peril, and implies Lara herself is directly responsible for it. In doing so, the game seems ready to question whether her obsession with Trinity is making her the hero she thinks she is, or if she’s out of her depth. Just how that will translate into the rest of the game remains to be seen. Where Shadow seems like it could stand apart is in challenging its protagonist and exploring her character in new and unexpected ways. Dealing with these issues give the franchise a clear – and perhaps predictable – path forward.","The third game in the rebooted ""Tomb Raider"" franchise continues to explore the character of Lara Croft, and this time looks to make her deal with spookier tombs, deadlier locales, and darker personal demons.",2018-04-27T13:16:23Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Digitaltrends.com'}",‘Shadow of the Tomb Raider’ hands-on preview,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review/,https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-6-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg,,Digitaltrends.com,deadlier,1

New crime statistics released Monday, Sept. 24, 2018, by the FBI place Baltimore's homicide rate in 2017 well above that of any other large American metropolis, making it an anomaly in the national crime landscape for U.S. cities with populations over 500,000 people. (Photo: AP) New crime statistics released by the FBI place Baltimores homicide rate last year well above that of any other large American metropolis, making it an anomaly in the national crime landscape for U.S. cities with populations over 500,000 people. The 342 homicides notched last year in Marylands biggest city yielded a punishing homicide rate of 56 per 100,000 people, according to the FBIs annual Crime in the United States report released Monday. Earlier this year, Baltimore had announced 343 slayings for the year, but three deaths were reclassified, eventually bringing the total to 342 in the city of roughly 615,000 inhabitants. The per capita rate was a record high for the city. Among major U.S. cities, Baltimore was followed in the FBIs annual tally by Detroit, which last year recorded a homicide rate of 40 per 100,000 people; Memphis, Tennessee, with a rate of 28 per 100,000; and Chicago, with a rate of 24 per 100,000. But some smaller cities reported a higher homicide rate than Baltimores. St. Louis, with a population slightly over 300,000, had a rate of 66 murders per 100,000 people. Overall, the FBI says the national violent crime rate decreased by 0.2 percent from 2016 to last year, making Baltimores record tally stand out even more for large urban centers. In comparison, Houston, with over 2 million residents, had a rate of 12 homicides per 100,000 people. Boston, with less than 700,000 residents, had eight slayings per 100,000. Violent crime rates in Baltimore have been notoriously high for years. In recent decades, the citys gritty realities helped make it the setting for hard-boiled crime shows such as The Wire, The Corner, and Homicide. But theres been a worrying march of killings since the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a fatal injury in police custody, that eventually set a new per capita high in 2017. Baltimores leaders are hopeful this year could mark somewhat of a turnaround. So far in 2018, crime is declining, with homicides down about 16 percent compared to the same stretch of time last year. Killings are down by over 30 percent in some troubled neighborhoods where authorities are focusing attention, according to City Hall. One murder in Baltimore is one murder too many. But I am convinced that by addressing the root causes that give rise to hopelessness and eventually to criminal activity, we will make Baltimore safer for all residents, said Mayor Catherine Pugh in an email Tuesday. She took office in December 2016. But crime experts note that Baltimores leaders have been failing to get their act together for a long time. David Kennedy, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said that whats distinctive about Baltimore is that its been unable to muster any kind of strategic and lasting response through the course of its violence epidemic. He contrasted it with Chicago, one of the deadliest cities in the country but a place where he believes leaders have a clear focus and a plan. The main reasons for Baltimores violent crime problems are the subject of endless interpretation. Some attribute the increase to the fallout of the opioid epidemic and Baltimores longstanding status as a heroin market, or to systemic failures like segregated neighborhoods, unequal justice and a scarcity of decent opportunities for many citizens. Others have pointed the finger at police, accusing them of taking a hands-off approach to fighting crime since six officers were charged in connection with the 2015 death of Gray, a black man whose mysterious fatal spinal cord injury in police custody triggered the citys worst riots in decades. In addition, theres been serious instability at the top of the police force and scandals and missteps have worsened a trust deficit in city neighborhoods. Baltimore is also struggling to implement a consent decree mandating reforms after federal investigators detailed longstanding patterns of unconstitutional policing and excessive force in the eighth largest municipal police department in the United States. The underlying conditions that produce violence always matter. But on the other side, what matters is whether a city is able to frame up and implement a response to the violence. And one of the fundamental facts about Baltimore is that its really never been able to do that, Kennedy said in a Tuesday phone interview. Theres been persistent political and law enforcement dysfunction in Baltimore going back pretty much as far as anybody can look.

Emily Petsko,"Each year when November rolls around, novice cooks start frantically searching for answers to all their turkey-related questions. When should it be thawed? Is an oven or deep fryer better? Whats the best recipe? Hotlines like Butterballs Turkey Talk-Line get flooded with hundreds of thousands of calls each holiday season. So its no surprise that turkey was the most-Googled Thanksgiving dish across America last November, according to Satelliteinternet.coms new analysis of food-related Google searches. But not every cook was looking for turkey advice last Thanksgiving. There was plenty of regional variation in the recipes people were searching for, as the map below shows. Green bean and corn casseroles were the next most-searched items after turkey last year, having amassed a particularly large fan base in the Midwest. Other searches are more unique. Vermonters seem to love ambrosia salad, while Louisianans can be expected to serve up a lot of cornbread dressing. Meanwhile, residents of Maryland, Virginia, Mississippi, and Illinois wanted to know how to make a copycat version of Popeyes Cajun turkey. (If you happen to be one of them, you can view a recipe here.) Meanwhile, in Idaho and Utah, Jell-O is apparently a very popular dish in the month of November. Perhaps people were whipping up something like Allrecipe.com's Thanksgiving Jell-O Salad, which is made from crushed pineapple, cottage cheese, lime Jell-O, and whipped topping. Previous analyses have found even more variation in what Americans eat on Thanksgiving. Back in 2014, The New York Times looked into the most uniquely popular Thanksgiving dish in each state, excluding common dishes like turkey. Deer jerky, sweet potato dumplings, asparagus casserole, turkey enchiladas, and something called frog eye salad were a few of the top search results. Those dishes arent nearly as weird as some of the Thanksgiving dishes that were served up several decades ago, though. Creamed onions, cranberry salad with mayonnaise, and jellied turkey-vegetable salad are among some of the more off-putting vintage recipes weve dug up.",Dance parties are slightly deadlier than skydiving.,2018-11-16T19:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mentalfloss.com'}",What Are Your Chances of Dying from Everyday Activities?

George Dvorsky,"The Black Death, a plague responsible for killing around a third of the population of Europe during the 14th century, spread to millions of humans by rats that carried infected fleas—right? That’s the story we’ve long been told by historians. A new study upends this conventional thinking, showing that humans, and not rodents, were the primary spreaders of the dreaded disease. The horrific Black Death, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and often referred to simply as “ plague,” was spread by human fleas and body lice, and not similar parasites found on rats, according to research published yesterday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In other words, humans were primarily responsible for spreading the disease to other humans. It seems the rats were innocent, at least according to mathematical models produced by researchers from the University of Oslo and the University of Ferrara. From 1347 to 1353, the Black Death killed an estimated 75 million to 200 million people across Europe and Asia. The disease repeatedly reared its ugly head in ongoing waves that lasted from the 14th to 19th centuries, affecting populations in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. The disease is still around today, spreading to humans from infected fleas on rats, or through the inhalation of infectious droplets in the air. Despite the fact that the Black Death wiped out a sizeable portion of the human population, little is known about the ways in which the disease spread. “While it is commonly assumed that rats and their fleas spread plague during the [Black Death], there is little historical and archaeological support for such a claim,” write the authors in the new study. That said, scientists have been studying recent outbreaks of the disease in Africa ( here, here, and here ), showing that human fleas and lice are responsible for spreading Yersinia pestis among humans. Yes, the disease initially makes the jump from rodents to humans, but from there, human parasites take over. This relatively recent revelation got researchers Katherine Dean, Boris Schmid, and their colleagues to wonder if a similar thing happened during the Black Death. For one, the Black Death had a wider spread and was far deadlier than its predecessor outbreak, the Plague of Justinian (6th to 8th centuries). What’s more, rats actually weren’t that common in Europe during the 14th century ( a claim backed by archaeological evidence ). And then there’s the recent evidence from outbreaks in Africa showing that Yersinia pestis can spread among humans via human parasites. To see if human parasites were indeed responsible for the Black Death, the researchers turned to math. “Mathematical modeling can provide strong insight into mechanisms of plague transmission for past epidemics,” write the authors. Using data collected from nine different plague outbreaks in Europe from the 14th through to the 19th century, the researchers modeled various scenarios to visualize how the disease may have spread. Three different transmission models were tested: through the air (pneumonic), by infected fleas on rats, and via infected fleas and lice on humans and clothing. In several of the nine models, the researchers discovered much greater consistency and similarities with the human-spreading model—an observation that backs the “human ectoparasite hypothesis” of the Black Death. “We have developed a compartmental model that captures the dynamics of human ectoparasite transmission,” conclude the authors in their study. “We have shown that, in seven out of nine localities, the human ectoparasite model was the preferred model to explain the pattern of plague mortality during an outbreak, rather than models of pneumonic and rat–flea plague transmission.” But the study is not without limitations. It’s based almost entirely on mathematical modeling, so it’s showing a simulation of what might have happened, and not the real thing. Also, the models didn’t account for local conditions that can influence an epidemic, such as war, famine, immunity, and public health interventions. And as the authors themselves admit, “we did not model mixed transmission routes, and this makes it difficult to fully assess the contribution of pneumonic plague, which commonly occurs during bubonic outbreaks [i.e. when spread by infected parasites].” Ben Bolker, a mathematician and statistician from McMaster University who wasn’t involved with the study, said he’s unhappy with some of the statistical procedures used by the researchers. “I think the way they analyzed their data means that they are probably overstating the strength of evidence for the difference among models,” Bolker told Gizmodo. So while the new result is interesting, it’s not nearly complete. At best, it stands as a good starting block for further research that could confirm what the mathematical models suggest. Epidemics are influenced by a wide host of factors, and every region, with its own distinct population, is going to be a little different.

Ed Cara,"More people are dying from drug overdoses in the U.S. than ever before, according to a new preliminary report released Wednesday by the federal government. There were an estimated 72,287 drug overdose deaths last year, the report found, with the majority caused by opioids. The toll is yet another record high. The report is only an provisional estimate of reported overdose deaths, since some reported deaths still haven’t been fully investigated. But the final tally is unlikely to be off by much. Compared to the 63,000 overdose-related deaths seen in 2016, there was roughly a 10 percent jump in only one year. Of these 2017 deaths, more than 60,000 involved opioids, though some deaths may have been caused by more than one drug. “These data are devastating, and further underscore the need for an all-hands-on-deck approach from health systems and communities to provide compassionate, evidence based care,” Honora Englander, an assistant professor of medicine at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, told Gizmodo. “This is not a moral failing or a choice. It’s a ruthlessly painful condition.” The new figures aren’t surprising to opioid policy experts such as Leo Beletsky, an associate professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University. “They indicate that, in many places around the U.S., the response continues to miss the mark.” Beletsky told Gizmodo via email. Indeed, the overdose-related death rate increased across most of the country, with states such as New Jersey, Nebraska, and North Carolina reporting the largest increases. Only 11 states, including Vermont, Wyoming, and Montana, reported a lower overdose-related death rate in 2017 than in the year prior. In terms of raw numbers alone, both Florida and California saw more than 5,000 overdose deaths last year. The report seems to confirm the changing shape of the opioid crisis, now driven by potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Nearly 30,000 deaths were attributed to fentanyl in 2017, an astonishingly dramatic rise from the less than 5,000 deaths recorded annually prior to 2014. Fentanyl, which can be up to 50 times more potent than heroin, has become a major source of the illicit opioid supply in the country in the past few years. Usually shipped from overseas, the drug is cheaper to produce and transport than other street opioids. While some users purposefully seek out fentanyl, oftentimes dealers discreetly cut their advertised heroin products with the drug. Users might then overdose because they take more of what they mistakenly believe is a weaker strength opioid. Aside from being deadlier, there’s even some research suggesting the drug can also cause other unique health problems, such as amnesia and cognitive damage. Despite the sobering findings, Englander says there are well-established but often ignored ways to help people struggling with addiction and prevent deaths. “We know that people with opioid use disorder who receive treatment with medications like buprenorphine and methadone have dramatically reduced mortality and yet nationally there remains a massive shortage of treatment providers, payers often don’t cover these life-saving medications, people are denied access to treatment while incarcerated, and there remains tremendous stigma which interferes with people’s well being and interest in treatment,” she said. Englander herself has helped build a novel program at her university’s affiliated hospital that connects willing hospitalized patients living with opioid use disorder to social workers and dedicated specialists. “We need to build systems that include the voices of people who are suffering from opioid use disorder,” she added. “Including them at the policy and treatment level is so important.” While the current Trump administration has called— inconsistently —for greater substance use treatment access, it’s also sought policy changes that many opioid experts and patient advocates have criticized as self-defeating and harmful to chronic pain patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for instance, has pushed for strict prescribing restrictions to be forced onto Medicare patients. These would require insurers to deny payment for opioid doses over a certain daily amount, as well as prevent new patients from being prescribed an initial treatment course longer than seven days. In Oregon, even stricter restrictions are being floated, such as mandating that all long-term opioid therapy be cut off by 2020 for Medicaid patients. Critics have argued that these proposals will not only do little to deter opioid use disorder, since most prescription opioid users do not develop addiction, but may actually cause some otherwise stable pain patients to spiral out of control and seek more dangerous opioids illicitly. Others might become heavily depressed and suicidal. “I think the folks who put this together didn’t do so willy-nilly, but there’s not really evidence supporting it,” said Englander of the Oregon plan. “We really need to be cautious about a blanket approach.” Given the small successes seen driving down the mortality rate in some states, there is room for optimism, Beletsky said. But only if we embrace what works. “Unless we double down on increasing access to the antidote naloxone, rapidly scale-up evidence-based treatment, and address the underlying health and other needs of people who use drugs, the destruction wrought by this crisis is going to continue surging,” he said.

Cheryl Eddy,"We’ve reached the halfway point of The Expanse ’s third season with episode five, “Triple Point,” and the tension has never been higher. The war between Earth and Mars, sparked by a greedy lie, grows ever-deadlier—and the protomolecule has once again done something unexpected and terrifying. First things freakin’ first: after last week’s reveal that Katoa, the kid who’d become more protomolecule than human, was actually communicating with the alien substance (while gruesomely dismembering and reassembling his nurse), Jules-Pierre Mao (François Chau) and Dr. Strickland (Ted Atherton) visit with their prize patient. Things have further deteriorated, but the Katoa-Thing is able to murmur a few chilling words: “You can’t... stop... the work! Soon... work... finish... soon... soooooon !” It’s clearly a reference to whatever’s being constructed on Venus, and if you’ve read the Expanse books, you might have an idea as to what it’s referring to. But there’s no information from Katoa on that front, and none will be coming, since he’s now mutated way beyond the point of no return. “The protomolecule has an objective!” Mao realizes, and he instructs Strickland to get crackin’ on another child to serve as a conduit. Next on the list? The precocious Mei (Leah Madison Jung), daughter of Prax (Terry Chen), of course. Far up above, traffic around Jupiter has gotten worrisomely dense; the Martian fleet has begun congregating around its operations base on Callisto, while the Roci and the UNN Agatha King continue to push toward Io. As usual, Alex (Cas Anvar) has plotted a route that’ll allow the Roci to continue without being detected—but also as usual, the away team has no plan other than to “go in hot, land hard,” and be ready for whatever horrors, human or hybrid, they encounter. Nearby, aboard the MCRN ship Hammurabi, Ensign Sinopoli (Atticus Mitchell)—the most level-headed of the stranded Martian marines the Roci rescued last week—does his very best to pass on the message from Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo) proving that Earth’s UN Undersecretary Errinwright (Shawn Doyle) engineered the Earth-Mars war based on false pretenses. He’s met with skepticism by the captain, but one part of Sinopoli’s strange-sounding story intrigues her: Avasarala’s request to share the missive with Admiral Souther (Martin Roach), who’s aboard the UNN Agatha King. We, the Expanse faithful, already know a) the King is no longer under the command of Souther, now that sinister Admiral Nguyen (Byron Mann) has taken control; and b) it’s en route to Io, where Nguyen plans to secure Errinwright’s child-soldier army of protomolecule hybrids. Io is a destination so weirdly random that the Hammurabi changes course to see what the hell Earth might be hiding there—a move that does not go undetected by those aboard the King, though everyone on that ship who isn’t in cahoots with Nguyen is really starting to hate the guy. In addition to being a total prick, he’s been beaming secret messages to the UN (i.e., Errinwright) and to Io (i.e., Mao) since he came aboard. But the crew that’s loyal to Souther has received a secret message of their own because the Hammurabi has decided to go ahead and transmit Avasarala’s damning evidence against Errinwright. Things get very messy after that. The Earth’s King and Mars’ Hammurabi move ever-closer to each other, and everyone on both ships hustles to their battle stations. The Hammurabi holds steady, under the guidance of a captain who’d rather keep a cool head than rack up a body count. The King, under the tightly-wound Nguyen, prepares to fire, but the Souther loyalists wrest control! Souther’s able to transmit a message to everyone, Earth and Mars, explaining that Nguyen’s a conspirator in an illegal war! But before he’s able to finish his speech (or send the proof), Nguyen wrestles away a gun and shoots him dead! (I screamed... ok, I was screaming throughout this entire scene, to be honest.) Nguyen’s so furious that he starts firing upon Earth ships that refuse to return to his fleet; meanwhile, the Hammurabi sends out a message across the system offering help to any ship that declares its peaceful intentions. Nguyen’s got a retort all planned out for the Martians, but first he’s going to need to retrieve a very special new weapon from Io. Meanwhile, aboard the Roci, Avasarala—who last week convinced Holden (Steven Strait) to let her send that Errinwright message out—tries to use her powers of persuasion for something even bigger. “You can’t nuke Io,” she pleads. “I need the protomolecule.” But she doesn’t want it as a weapon; she’s concerned about WTF it’s been doing on Venus, and she thinks understanding the protomolecule is essential to the survival of the human race. Avasarala’s not wrong, and Holden knows it, but the “nuke ’em if everything goes sideways” option is still in play when Roci reaches Io. Everyone’s prepped for battle—especially Bobbie (Frankie Adams), who’s hungry for protomolecule payback in her fully-charged power armor, and Prax, newly weapons-savvy thanks to his BFF, Amos (Wes Chatham). When we first met Prax, he was a mild-mannered science geek... but after all he’s been through, he’s more than ready to seek violent revenge if he’s too late to rescue his daughter. Yeah, about that. Though the Roci crew sees hybrid pods being launched toward the King as they’re busting into the facility on Io, there’s no certainty that Mei is among them. Because the last we saw of Mei, she was being strapped into place as Katoa’s replacement—presumably still on Io, but hopefully not yet filled with creepy blue goo. Will she be saved in time? Assorted Musings: Season three has been extremely light on Belters beyond Naomi (Dominique Tipper) thus far, and “Triple Point” was no exception. I get it, of course, and surely there’ll be a Nauvoo -centric episode soon—but I still can’t shake the feeling that somewhere, Fred Johnson is tossing fools out of airlocks, and we’re missing it ! Naomi’s reveal to Holden about her past with the OPA and the son that was taken from her was a bit of an info dump—but it was still an important moment for a character who hasn’t gotten to do nearly enough this season. What’s in the hybrid pods, exactly—feral blue soldiers like we saw on Ganymede, failed experiments like Katoa, test-subject kids who haven’t been put through the program yet (like Mei), or something else? The way Nguyen was grinning while he summoned the pods made me think it’s feral blue soldiers who’re gonna rip through the Hammurabi like it’s made of Kleenex. The anti-Earth graffiti on the Hammurabi (featuring defaced portraits of UN bigwigs Sorrento-Gillis, Avasarala, and Errinwright) is proof that, even 200 years in the future, people will still be doodling devil horns and funny mustaches as a form of protest. In an episode filled with references to lost children, Alex’s message from his son was poignant, but it still seems doubtful that our favorite space cowboy will be heading home to Mars for a reunion anytime soon. Lest we forget, there’s still a protomolecule glob lurking below decks on the Roci. Will it make itself known now that the ship has reached Io?","We’ve reached the halfway point of The Expanse ’s third season with episode five, “Triple Point,” and the tension has never been higher.

The Tu-22M, an airframe that first flew in 1969, features a variable wing and a massive payload at around 2.4 tons, rivaling the B-1B Lancer, the US's only supersonic bomber. The upgraded Tu-22M3M focuses on modernizing the avionics, communications, and controls on the Cold War era bomber, according to the report. But the Tu-22M3M's integration with some of Russia's deadlier missiles, and role as a nuclear-capable maritime strike jet pose a serious challenge. Not only can the Tu-22M carry nuclear weapons, it has some formidable anti-ship weapons and even an air-launched ballistic missile. The KH-32, the Diplomat reported, has been purpose-built to take on US Navy aircraft carrier strike groups, the most expensive and powerful ships in the world. With a claimed range of 620 miles and a flight pattern that soars it up into the stratosphere before diving down low to approach a target at speeds up to four times the speed of sound, the KH-32 takes advantage of both high and low altitudes. This varied flight path and incredible speed present a very hard target for US Navy missile defenses to intercept, and the missile's claimed range means Russian Tu-22M3M pilot can fire from a safe distance outside the maximum range of US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, which max out at around 550 miles. Russia has developed over the last few decades long range missiles meant to target US aircraft carriers as a means of neutralizing the US's massive advantage in carriers. Russia's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, is an outdated ship with a host of mechanical issues and will be offline for years during an overhaul. China, the US's other great power competitor, which has in many ways eclipsed Russia, has also worked on a gang of new missiles that combine nontraditional flight paths with supersonic bursts of speed to get through US defenses. US carrier strike groups rely on guided missile destroyers and cruisers to defend the capital ship, the carrier, from incoming enemy missiles. Currently, the US hopes to overcome the Russian and Chinese missile gap with an unmanned refueling tanker aboard aircraft carriers that could extend the range of the jet fighters on deck.","Russia will roll out an upgrade to its Tu-22M supersonic, nuclear-capable bomber on August 16.

Patrick Gill,"Six years after its initial release, The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim ’s ridges and valleys have become as familiar to me as the back of my hand. Seeing familiar the familiar sights with the depth and scale afforded by its new PlayStation VR version is a treat... for the most part. Misbehavior has always been a hallmark of the Elder Scrolls games, but the addition of motion controls, using PlayStation Move controllers, makes a life of crime even more attractive. My first crime was killing these misguided dogs who attacked me on the road. With a fire spell in each hand, I put them down. The sin of canicide. I wouldn’t let their sacrifice be in vain. I cooked those dogs. Waste not, want not. I tried to go on living a peaceful life, but my encounter with the dogs had changed me. I had developed a taste for deadlier prey. The importance of guard rails. My desires grew darker still. No dinner spread was safe from the Dragonborn. Fus! There could be no witnesses... Let me axe you a question.... and no evidence. No one can know. I fled the scene on horseback, but the law was waiting for me. Halt! So the cops put me in jail. I live there now.

Beth Elderkin,"Films like War of the Worlds and Independence Day looked at what would happen when aliens who were smarter, stronger, and deadlier invaded Earth. The first trailer for Captive State, the latest film from Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt, doesn’t bother with the fight. Instead, it asks: What would we do if the aliens won? Captive State stars John Goodman and Moonlight’s Ashton Sanders as survivors of an alien invasion that took place years ago. We don’t ever see the extraterrestrials in the trailer, but that doesn’t mean they’re not around. Humanity has become a conquered species, worshipping the “Legislature” as pockets of resistance continue to survive against the 10-year occupation. Taking place in Chicago, the movie looks at both sides of the fight: People who are fighting back against the occupation of our planet, and those who are collaborating. The trailer looks interesting, but I have to be honest and say I wasn’t too wowed. It reminds me a lot of The Purge, replacing the New Founding Fathers with an alien species. It serves roughly the same purpose, conveying a theme of modern totalitarianism in the United States. Mixed with a bit of A Quiet Place for good measure. Captive State also stars Jonathan Majors, Colson Baker, and Vera Farmiga. It’s set to arrive on March 29, 2019.","Films like War of the Worlds and Independence Day looked at what would happen when aliens who were smarter, stronger, and deadlier invaded Earth.

Alice O'Connor,"World War 2 is all the rage again but for those who favour classic conflicts, not their ‘bigger and deadlier than ever’ sequels, World War 1 games are still kicking. The creators of WW1 Western Front FPS Verdun today launched the Eastern Front standalone expansion Tannenberg into early access. Tannenberg focuses on ‘realistic’ action and ramps it up with a new 64-player mode (Verdun caps out at 40 players). Here, have a peek in the early access launch trailer: So! It’s World War 1 and Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and German soldiers are kicking the heck out of each other. We step into their boots to endlessly continue the simulated kickings. Like Verdun before it, Tannenberg is a relatively realistic FPS more in the vein of Red Orchestra and whatnot rather than your Calls of Duty. Beyond showing the other side of the war, Tannenberg introduces the new 64-player mode Maneuver. That has folks charging around big maps, trying to capture and hold objectives. Made by Blackmill games and M2H, Tannenberg costs £14/€18/$18 on Steam Early Access. It also offers a 20% discount for Verdun owners until December 1st. The full and finished launch is broadly slated for “early 2018.” Features the des are working on during early access include a new user interface, improved performance, better sounds, and a way to switch between Tannenberg and Verdun in-game. The devs say they’re not done with Verdun either, and will carry some of Tannenberg’s improvements back over to it.","World War 2 is all the rage again but for those who favour classic conflicts, not their ‘bigger and deadlier than ever’ sequels, World War 1 games are still kicking.

Dave Irwin,"Sanhok – the newest and tiniest map in Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds, is a very different experience compared to the other maps that are sprawling wastelands where death is a constant peril. In many ways, Sanhok is far deadlier as deep within the lush jungles, ancient ruins, and the extensive river system, there’s plenty of places for enemies to hide and kill you without a second thought! It can be tough to get a footing, but not to worry; help is at hand! In this Sanhok map guide, I will take you through what to look out for and how to survive the onslaught that’s happening all around you. Welcome to Sanhok. This Pacific island inspired territory is crammed full of ruins, military complexes, and agricultural areas. It’s also a deathtrap: at roughly 4km each way, it’s around a quarter of the size of Miramar and the smallest of Plunkbat’s maps by a considerable margin. So in this guide, we’ll be giving you some hints and tips to get started, and not get annihilated as soon as your boots touch the ground. While this guide is going to focus on the new map, there’s a bunch of hints and tips that are universal across the entire list of PUBG’s maps. Go have a gander at our PUBG complete guide for more on how to improve your skills. Where to drop in PUBG’s Sanhok map The short answer is that unlike other Plunkbat maps, there isn’t really a place that’s completely safe. Chances are that wherever you drop, someone else will be there too. Named locations tend to be where the big firefights are, particularly any of the boot camps and the Training Centre, but even the more rural locations can be a hotbed for activity. Generally speaking, dropping in clusters of unnamed buildings of around three or four in total tends to reap the most benefits while at the same time not a popular tourist destination. It’s a general rule of thumb that this works on most maps, but here it’s also important to be aware of those jumping out of the plane at the beginning of the game may end up where you’re going, even if they jumped much earlier than you. One other thing to note is that with the smaller map size, the range at which people can drop from the beginning is much wider. Therefore just because you’re far away from a position, doesn’t mean you can’t make it there, especially if you have the parachute. If you’re playing in Duos or Teams and your teammate jumps seemingly early, it may be that they’re still heading for a position they may have highlighted. The best locations for loot in PUBG’s Sanhok map Sanhok has a lot of named locations for such a small map, but they all contain some fairly decent stuff. The ruins on the south-western island that has multiple floors full of items and other players, while Paradise Resort and the Training Center are also relatively popular for good reason. The Docks towards the south-eastern corner is a little less popular, but can reap some great loot, including the brand new QBZ95 assault rifle tat’s exclusive to this map; provided you can also escape with a degree of haste. As for particularly good places to find loot that are out of the way, the small dock area towards the north-west of Tat Mok tends to have a decent amount of attachments and guns for a small area. It’s far north of the main island, so the only real caveat here is that you’re likely to be outside of the first safe zone and need to move on rather sharpish. Those particularly daring players may consider parachuting into the cave on the southern part of the main island, looting the temple hidden within. Dealing with Sanhok Weather in PUBG Another of Sanhok’s unique traits is its dynamic weather. During the course of every match, the weather has a chance to turn from a sunny paradise, to a damp and dingy day, and even have fog so dense you can’t see more than a couple of feet in front of you. This can be used to your advantage, or perhaps work against you too. By sticking to the trees where possible, you can move around with a reduced chance of giving away your position to any snipers or anyone else moving around. They can still hear your footsteps over the rain though, so dashing should only be reserved for those times where the blue zone is looming on you. If you really want to confuse your enemies, consider throwing a smoke grenade while it’s foggy as a diversion. It may fool them into thinking you’re where the smoke is densest, when in actuality you could be sneaking up on them without them knowing. The importance of not being seen Weather may mask your whereabouts, but there’s things you can do and objects to equip that also help not to be seen or heard. Among the big guns and healing kits scattered around, it’s also worth to be on the lookout for items like flash hiders, silencers, and suppressors for your various guns (you can find out more about the different equipment in our PUBG best weapons guide ). It’ll keep your whereabouts more hidden when engaging far-away players, but also may confuse nearer enemies into thinking you’re further away than you are. Cover is important in all maps in any given shooter, but in such a small map it’s perhaps more vital to be aware of your surroundings. Trees are littered around in abundance, so can provide vital cover. Despite being generally frowned upon as a tactic, going prone on a slope in some foliage and picking off unsuspecting passersby, is a surprisingly effective way to net a few kills. That is of course before the blue wall of impending doom looms behind you. Perhaps the most crucial thing you need is to use your ears. If you hear gunshots in the distance and are absolutely sure they’re not being aimed at you, the person firing that gun has given their position away to an extent. If you’re particularly stealthy, you could get the jump on them instead. Loot with extreme caution In the previous two PUBG maps, you could often loot your fallen enemies in relative safety. Sanhok’s small size means you might want to take more time surveying the land, and perhaps lay a trap for a few pesky vultures. If you’re lucky, you might get a bunch of loot rather than end up dead yourself. Air drops are another big thing to be wary of. Chances are, if you’re nearby and have seen the air drop coming in, so has half the map. Take the opportunity to take a vantage point if need be, then watch as some sap wanders into the open and begins taking stuff. Provided your aim is true and gun powerful enough, they should be defeated before they know what hit them. If your gear isn’t good enough, chances are someone else has them in their sights and will be more than willing to do the job for you. Of course, if that’s the case, you should be on the lookout for where that fateful shot came from, as it’s valuable information to surviving. Who knows, they might come running in, thinking the location is clear, only to find them meeting the same fate, by your hand. Using vehicles in PUBG’s Sanhok map As good as vehicles can be in both Erangel and Miramar, the same can’t really be said for Sanhok. You make far too much noise when driving around that by the time you’re speeding away, half the map know exactly where you are and may have an idea of where you are going. It’s far from ideal, but there are ways of making it work. If you’re feeling particularly adventurous and like an air of subterfuge, drive a vehicle into a complex of a few buildings, making sure that no-one else is there first. Then abandon your vehicle in the middle of it and hide by going prone on a nearby hill. Chances are, some particularly bloodthirsty player heard you cruising by, maybe with a horn blaring as you do so, and will shortly be arriving to investigate. Provided you have a particularly decent aim and a rifle to take that shot, you should have successfully dispatched at least would-be pursuer. On a map this small, it’s certainly viable. However, if you still need some half-decent gear, it’s perhaps best to avoid driving around as you’ll only draw unnecessary attention to yourself and likely end up slumped over the steering wheel and without that delicious chicken dinner. If you follow these tips, you may stand a good chance of surviving until the final moments of the game. From then on, it’s like playing any other PUBG map, so a lot of the general hints apply. Do be sure to check out our guide on PUBG’s Erangel map as well for tips and tricks on that map too.","Sanhok – the newest and tiniest map in Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds, is a very different experience compared to the other maps that are sprawling wastelands where death is a constant peril.

Alex Ward,"Paris burns as Macron’s power increasingly goes up in flames. France is burning. The country is currently in the grip of widespread protests and riots that have led to violent clashes with police, leaving hundreds injured and thousands of dollars’ worth of property damaged. The protests began around November 17, when French drivers sporting yellow vests led a demonstration of 280,000 people across the country to push back against rising taxes on gas and diesel fuel. French President Emmanuel Macron announced the new gas tax earlier this year, as part of a broader plan to minimize France’s reliance on fossil fuels. The tax will increase the price of fuel by about 30 cents per gallon and will continue to rise over the next few years, the French government says. Gas already costs about $7.06 per gallon in France. The protest movement — known as gilets jaunes, French for the “yellow vests” demonstrators wear — has blockaded streets and highways, burned cars, and brawled with police in response to the price hike. In recent days, though, the protesters have begun directing their anger at the state of France’s economy as well, and at Macron’s leadership of the country in general. Saturday saw one of the worst days of unrest yet, with the third large-scale riots in Paris described by some as “urban warfare” and “the worst riots in a generation.” Around 133 people were injured — including law enforcement officials — and about 412 were arrested. France’s Interior Ministry said it had to deploy 37,000 police officers, 30,000 firefighters, and 30,000 gendarmes, members of the ministry’s armed forces, to contend with the protest. But the movement has spread to many parts of the country — and in some cases turned deadly. Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images Protesters during the “Yellow Vest” protest in Paris on December 1, 2018. On Saturday, a protestor in the southern port city of Marseille threw a tear gas canister through the window of a home, killing an 80-year-old woman. Three other people have also been killed since the protests began, according to police. Yellow jackets also blocked access to 11 fuel depots for the French energy company Total, resulting in 75 of the company’s 2,200 gas stations going dry. And Macron’s government estimates shops and restaurants have lost between 20 and 50 percent of their expected revenue since the demonstrations started. The protests have shown no signs of stopping — in fact, they’re escalating. The French government says around 136,000 people participated in a nationwide protest on Sunday. And on Monday, students in 100 schools across the country demonstrated against educational reform. The growing movement has captured the attention of many around the world, including at least one American celebrity with, uh, some anti-Western tendencies : I despise violence...but what is the violence of all these people and burned luxurious cars, compared to the structural violence of the French -and global - elites? — Pamela Anderson (@pamfoundation) December 3, 2018 And it has greatly preoccupied Macron’s government, which has made little progress in stopping the uprising. Macron tweeted on Saturday that he will “always respect the protest” and “will always listen to the opposition,” but added: “I will never accept the violence.” He held a security meeting with his top staff on Monday, and the country’s prime minister plans to meet with representatives for the “yellow vests” movement on Tuesday. But the gas tax or educational changes no longer seem like the main reason French people are protesting — it’s mostly because of Macron himself. Why so many French people are unhappy with Macron Jeff Lightfoot, an expert on France at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, DC, told me last week there are two main reasons Macron has become such an unpopular figure. The first is that he doesn’t really have a political base. He’s a Parisian technocrat who rode a wave of dissatisfaction with traditional French political parties to presidential victory in May 2017. He has yet to gain much support outside of urban areas. So one of Macron’s biggest political liabilities is that he doesn’t have a reliable contingent of support if things get bad. Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images Tear gas surrounds protesters as they clash with riot police during a “Yellow Vest” demonstration in Paris on December 1, 2018. The second reason, unfortunately for Macron, is that things have gotten bad in the country economically. France’s economy is growing, but very slowly. Most of the growth is centered in its major cities, like Paris, and others on the periphery and in rural communities haven’t seen as many gains. What’s more, France’s rural population relies much more on cars than its urban dwellers do, which is why many in those regions seem the most angry with the gas tax. “Ask a Parisian — for him none of this is an issue, because he doesn’t need a car,” Marco Pavan, a truck and cab driver in a small town near the France-Switzerland border, told the Washington Post on Saturday. “We live on the side of a mountain,” he continued, “[t]here’s no bus or train to take us anywhere. We have to have a car.” People’s anger with the elites have risen in recent months, says Lightfoot, in part because Macron can come off as arrogant and out of touch. “He openly mocks people,” Yves Rollet, a French retiree, also told the Post on Saturday. It doesn’t help that Macron, in an effort to reform France’s economy, is cutting longstanding benefits and ending labor protections. For example, he’s made it easier for companies to hire and fire employees and fought unions to end subsidies for certain sectors. That’s why some see Macron as a president of the rich, Lightfoot said: He’s initiating changes that many of the country’s wealthy can muddle through but that the nation’s poorer might not. Veronique de Viguerie/Getty Images Fires burn as protesters clash with riot police during the “Yellow Vest” demonstration in Paris on December 1, 2018. That means Macron will be in protesters’ crosshairs for quite some time, especially since he has given no indication he will bend to their demands. It’s therefore possible that some of his political competitors — like the far-right politician Marine Le Pen, who is stoking tensions by claiming that Macron may fire on protesters — can take advantage of the public’s disaffection and become the premier alternative to Macron. That has France watchers quite nervous about what happens not just in the next few days but well into the future. “It’s going to be a bumpy few years coming up,” Lightfoot told me.",Anti-Macron protests in Parts and others parts of France over a gas tax and economic reforms have turned deadlier.,2018-12-03T19:20:04Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Vox.com'}",France’s anti-Macron protests are turning deadlier,https://www.vox.com/2018/12/3/18123906/france-protest-macron-paris-riots-yellow-vest-arc,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_zvBW7pSdYws4_7RprD9u2I1ftg=/0x734:6000x3875/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13598302/1067241474.jpg.jpg,,Vox.com,deadlier,1
Chris Pereira,"With interest in Destiny 2 seemingly having dropped off greatly since launch, developer Bungie continues to work on revamping the game. Following the first DLC and subsequent updates meant to address fan complaints, another major update is now being rolled out that makes some significant changes--including letting players generally deal more damage and move more quickly. Full patch notes for update 1.1.4, which is out now on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, have been released, and they are quite extensive. As outlined in a recent video (below), Bungie wants players to feel more empowered. To accomplish this, PvE damage for numerous weapon types has been increased, in some cases significantly--shotguns deal 35% more, linear fusion rifles deal 50% more, and sniper rifles deal either 20% more (against yellow bar enemies) or 40% more (against red bar enemies). These buffs coincide with other weapon balance tweaks, like being able to store more ammo and increasing accuracy or aim assist. Specific weapons and perks also see adjustments. Each class has also been touched to varying degrees; Hunter's Arc Staff Super and Warlock's Dawnblade Super should be more effective, and the various Warlock glide abilities have been improved. All players, regardless of class, will now get their Super more frequently, and the so-called melee Supers--Fist of Havoc, Sentinel Shield, and Arc Staff--each enjoy a movement speed boost. It's not just those Supers that see a bump to movement speed, though. Bungie says it's increased the ""output of every increment of the Mobility stat, from 2-10."" Provided you invest in that stat, it allows for ""a significant boost in player speed."" Unique rewards are being introduced for Nightfalls, presenting you with Legendary weapons and Exotic accessories that can be earned only from specific missions. You'll also no longer face the same Nightstrike back-to-back when playing through a Strike playlist. And, in another extremely welcome change, Exotic repetition has been reduced, and you should no longer ever get the same Exotic when decrypting consecutive Exotic Engrams. Crucible has also been updated in a variety of ways. You should see maps repeated less often, and Iron Banner is now 6v6, as was the case with standard Crucible matches in the first Destiny. Quickplay matches now have a 10-minute time limit (with score limit adjustments to match). Power ammo will spawn more quickly in Control, Clash, and Supremacy matches, and you'll be able to obtain Power ammo by killing a player who is carrying it in any mode. Now, when someone with Power ammo dies, they'll lose all of it, and 50% of what they had will drop on the ground for 30 seconds for anyone to pick up. You can see everything that's changed in the full patch notes on Bungie's website.","With interest in Destiny 2 seemingly having dropped off greatly since launch, developer Bungie continues to work on revamping the game.

These topics, among others, saw the greatest increases in online searches this year, according to data from health publisher WebMD. Though the flu, high blood pressure, cold symptoms and diabetes are always the most-searched topics among WebMD’s 79 million monthly visitors, the following issues saw the largest spikes in search traffic relative to 2016: 1. Powassan Virus Searches up 4,400% This rare and potentially life-threatening tick-borne disease was in the news in the spring of 2017, after researchers found the pathogen in Maine ticks, and Connecticut reported its first-ever human case of the virus. Though less common than Lyme disease, the Powassan virus is deadlier, and appears to be transmitted faster. 2. Glioblastoma Searches up 1,400% Following Senator John McCain’s brain cancer diagnosis in July, WebMD saw a spike in searches for brain tumor symptoms and treatments. Glioblastoma affects about 5 people out of 100,000 each year; about half of all cancerous brain tumors are glioblastomas. 3. Popcorn Lung Searches up 790% Inhalation of diacetyl,the artificial butter chemical previously found in popcorn, has been linked to irreversible damage to the lungs’ smallest airways, a disease called bronchiolitis obliterans and known colloquially as “popcorn lung.” The condition was in the news this year amid health concerns over diacetyl found in e-cigarettes. 4. Opioids Searches up 390% The impact of America’s opioid crisis has continued to grow, and President Trump declared a public health emergency in October. Opioid overdoses claimed over 33,000 lives in 2015, a figure that increased in 2016, with more overdose deaths caused by synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, than prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin and Percocet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 5. The Solar Eclipse Searches up 254% A total solar eclipse crossed the country in August, leading many Americans to search for information about potential damage to their eyes. WebMD saw an increase in searches about protective eyewear and the consequences of staring into the sun. 6. Lead in Water Searches up 230% Public concern about the safety of drinking water remained high in 2017, as reports documented excessive lead levels across the U.S. 7. Affordable Care Act Searches up 22% Between repeated attempts to repeal Obamacare and the GOP’s recent removal of the individual mandate in the tax bill, the fate of the Affordable Care Act was in the news all year long.",See which health issues concerned Americans this year,2017-12-22T14:49:45Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Opioids, Popcorn Lung and the Solar Eclipse: Your Health Questions in 2017",http://time.com/5076025/opioids-popcorn-lung-solar-eclipse-webmd/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-6404135672.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,deadlier,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes California's latest catastrophic wildfire, the Camp Fire, was impossible to outrun when it first began burning. Officials say winds caused the blaze to burn through 80 miles (128km) of Northern California's hillside in just one hour. So how can you escape such a blaze, and why is the western US state so susceptible to these deadly fires? What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" H ow do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days Why are California fires so devastating? According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.",Fires have claimed dozens of lives in California.

The red-and-white flag, featuring a silhouette of a maple leaf, was raised for the first time on this day in 1965. Previously, Canada had flown the Union Jack as a member of the British Commonwealth. An unofficial flag known as the Canadian Red Ensign, bearing the Union Jack and the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada, had been used on government buildings. A national maple leaf flag was first suggested in 1895, but it wasn’t until 1964 that the Canadian Parliament approved it. Prime Minister Lester Pearson had proposed a “truly distinctive” flag that represented all the cultures in Canada, not just its French or British colonial identity. A committee evaluated thousands of designs featuring national symbols (a beaver wearing a Mountie hat was among those rejected). The flag was bitterly debated, especially by Mr. Pearson and his predecessor, the opposition leader John Diefenbaker. (Mr. Diefenbaker called the maple leaf motif “a flag without a past” and wept when it was inaugurated.) But even though its tree doesn’t grow nationwide, the maple leaf was considered a neutral symbol. “It was the perfect, perhaps the prototypical, Canadian compromise,” the historian Rick Archbold wrote.

Brianna Sacks,"Mass shootings in the US have gotten deadlier and more frequent, the product of a vicious cycle in which intense media scrutiny inspires others to also kill for their own moment in the grim spotlight, experts say. Last year, the US experienced what researchers say was hopefully an anomaly, with the highest number of active shooter incidents in nearly a decade, according to a new FBI report. From 2014 to 2016, the FBI documented 20 active shooter events per year, 175 people killed as a result. That number, while high, had been holding relatively steady until 2017, when the number spiked to 30 incidents, the highest since the FBI started keeping numbers in 2000. Nearly 140 people died in the 2017 attacks, including 58 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history in Las Vegas. All of the shooters were men and acted alone. Experts told BuzzFeed News the recent uptick is likely due to the amount of attention the attacks get and the fixation on the people behind them, spurring copycats while at the same time desensitizing the public. Inadequate and poorly-enforced laws don't help, they added. ""These shooters get great satisfaction in doing this, and the media attention they get afterwards puts them in a place of history,"" said Greg Shaffer, a 20-year FBI veteran and global security expert who studies domestic terrorism and active shooters. ""We are also trying to use normal rational thoughts to define an irrational act, which is why we focus on them so much. But we will never understand why people like the Las Vegas gunman do what they do."" Jaclyn Schildkraut, an expert on mass shootings research and assistant professor of public justice at the State University of New York, warned that the copycat effect is only getting worse. ""With the amount of coverage Parkland received, you probably will see an uptick,"" she said Jaclyn Schildkraut. ""Copycatters are becoming a public safety issue."" While mass shootings on the scale of those in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Parkland, Florida, and Las Vegas dominate media coverage, experts point out that smaller shootings, often at businesses, are far more prevalent. ""It's insane how common it is for a person to walk into a place of work with a gun these days,"" Shaffer said. Of the 50 active shooting incidents in 2016 and 2017, 17 occurred in areas of commerce, according to the FBI report. ""A lot of these issues are domestic spill over, where a person comes into a workplace to solve a domestic issue,"" Shaffer said. Such was the case in Rothschild, Wisconsin, when a 45-year-old man armed with a rifle marched into Marathon Savings Bank where his estranged wife was working and gunned down two employees before fleeing to a nearby law firm and killing her lawyer. According to the data, virtually every part of the country has been touched by the active shooter phenomena, although the Pacific Northwest has been hit particularly hard. ""It's really fairly random. They happen at a variety of different locations and it's hard to understand or quantify why,"" said Hunter Martaindale, director of research at ALERRT, which compiled the data and has been working with the FBI on producing the annual reports. So far, Martaindale said there have been less recorded active shootings so far tin 2018 than there were during the same period last year. ""[2017] was an anomaly and we are hoping that it stays that way,"" he said. But until lawmakers take substantive action to more tightly control access to guns, experts say the pace of mass shootings is not likely to slow much in a nation that, as Schildkraut put it, ""has accepted these events as part of our fabric."" ""Stable is a reflection of our complacency,"" she said. ""We are putting a lot of Band-aids on issues that need tourniquets to make people feel better, but at the end of the day, this will continue to be our reality until we fix and enforce the laws we already have.""","""It's insane how common it is for a person to walk into a place of work with a gun these days.""

Rachel Nuwer,"Terrorist bombings garner a lot of news coverage—but gun assaults are often more coldly efficient. Although firearms are used in only a small fraction of terror strikes, a recent study found that on a per-attack basis, guns are four times deadlier than other methods in high-income countries. “What was surprising was the lethality of firearm attacks compared with other things like explosions and vehicles,” says lead author Robert Tessler, a senior fellow at the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center in Washington State. Tessler and his colleagues also found that guns are involved in a higher proportion of terror attacks in the U.S. than in other high-income countries. The findings add to an existing body of research that points toward the unique nature of gun violence in the U.S., where overall firearm deaths reached 36,000 in 2015. After the recent terrorism incidents in San Bernardino, Orlando and London, Tessler wondered whether attackers' methods differed by region. He and his colleagues turned to the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database to analyze weapons used and fatalities in each of the 2,817 attacks carried out between 2002 and 2016 in the U.S., Canada, western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Credit: Amanda Montañez; Sources: “Use of Firearms in Terrorist Attacks: Differences between the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand,” by Robert A. Tessler et al., in JAMA Internal Medicine. Published Online October 6, 2017; Global Terrorism Database www.start.umd.edu/gtd Firearms were used in fewer than 10 percent of the attacks but accounted for 55 percent of fatalities, the researchers reported online in October in JAMA Internal Medicine. They found guns to be significantly deadlier than vehicular, explosive, biological, chemical or incendiary methods. The U.S. accounted for the greatest proportion of firearm attacks—20 percent—followed by the Netherlands, with 14 percent. The authors did not factor gun ownership laws into their analysis, but other studies have indicated that tougher regulations are associated with fewer deaths. A 2017 review of nearly 50 years of scientific literature found that firearm homicide rates are lower in U.S. states with stricter gun control, and a 2014 study of a nationwide sample of all inpatient minors sent to hospitals for trauma revealed that children are safer in states with tighter firearm restrictions. “I would encourage policy makers to consider this relationship between terrorism and firearms,” Tessler says, “not only as part of the national security policy agenda but also as part of the public health policy agenda.”",Firearms kill more people per attack in high-income countries than any other method -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2018-01-11T14:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Gun Terrorism Is the Deadliest Kind,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gun-terrorism-is-the-deadliest-kind/,http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/includes/themes/responsive/images/logo400x400.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,deadlier,1
"John Sutter, CNN","Katowice, Poland (CNN) After two weeks of discordant and emotional negotiations, the nations of the world agreed Saturday night on a set of rules meant to help curb global warming. But scientists and even the negotiators themselves know the so-called ""Paris Rulebook"" won't be enough on its own to stop carbon pollution from reaching critical levels. Countries would have to do far more to curb fossil fuel use and deforestation to avoid the droughts, superstorms, deadly heat waves and coastal floods associated with global warming. This rulebook is supposed to put into motion the Paris Agreement on climate change, a landmark 2015 accord that the US Trump administration has promised to abandon. After fraught and much-delayed talks at the COP24 climate change conference here in Polish coal country, more than 190 countries agreed to the rules. They punted, however, on a critical but complicated issue involving how countries trade and account for certain pollution. Brazil nearly blocked the process amid concerns that its proposals would lead to ""double counting"" and, essentially, cheating, according to observers and a senior negotiator involved in the discussions. That issue will have to be taken up at a later date in 2019. Ministers also did not agree to emphatically embrace the latest climate science, which stunned some attendees. Countries reached a ""compromise"" statement in which they welcomed the publication of an alarming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They stopped short, however, of welcoming its actual findings. That ""administrative"" compromise fails to underscore the extreme urgency posed by the climate crisis, said Simon Stiell, Grenada's minister for climate resilience and environment. Vulnerable countries, including small island states that could see their entire territories disappear as seas rise, agreed to the text to ensure the rulebook moved forward, he told CNN. ""We understand the need to consensus-build,"" he said. ""And for small island developing states we have achieved our minimum -- minimum -- asks with regard to key issues."" The IPCC report says the world has only about 12 years to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels, which is one of the goals of the Paris Agreement. That report is an ""ear-splitting wake-up call,"" UN Secretary-General António Guterres said upon its release. The science crunched the timeline for doing something and upped the stakes of inaction. In Poland, Guterres said it would be ""suicidal"" and ""immoral"" to fail at COP24. The United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait, however, stood in the way last week of ""welcoming"" the findings of the scientists. The Trump administration has denied the basic consensus of climate science, which is that humans are causing dangerous warming by burning fossil fuels. President Trump has promised to withdraw the United States, which has done more to cause climate change historically than any other country, from the Paris Agreement. That withdrawal can't fully take place until 2020, however, so the United States did have a presence at these talks -- at times humming along in negotiations and at times promoting coal technology. Observers disagreed about whether the United States aimed to spoil talks here. The talks were supposed to end Friday but were delayed repeatedly over disagreements about the basics of climate science and some aspects of how the rulebook would function, technically. Observers also said there were disputes about how money would be transferred from rich to poorer countries to help with projects meant to blunt the severity of climate impacts like drought -- and to whom it would be transferred. COP24 was met with repeated protests from environmentalists and young people, who have more to lose than adults because they will live longer into the warming future. Inspired by a Swedish 15-year-old who called for a global school walkout to demand climate action, dozens of Polish students left school and marched into the conference center in Katowice on Friday. ""You are not mature enough to tell it like it is,"" Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old activist from Sweden, said in the speech before negotiators. ""Even that burden you leave to us children."" At the walkout, the children held pieces of a sign reading, ""12 years left."" In order to avoid 1.5 degrees of warming, the IPCC says carbon pollution must be cut almost in half by 2030, less than 12 years away, and then reach ""net zero"" by mid-century. That would require a massive reworking of the global energy and transport systems, experts said. The Paris Agreement is meant to help avoid that level of warming by creating a sort of peer pressure system that encourages countries to abandon dirty energy sources like coal, oil and natural gas, which already have contributed to 1 degree of warming. The pledges that countries have made as part of the agreement, however, put the world on track for about 3 degrees of warming by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent research effort. Human-caused climate change has been shown to contribute to rising seas, stronger storms, deadlier heat waves, extinction in the natural world, crop failures and more severe drought. Warnings on global warming are becoming increasingly dire. Despite the fact that the White House has denied the strong consensus on the science of climate change -- and has tried to boost coal extraction and reduce pollution controls -- US federal agencies in November put out a report saying runaway climate change is both dangerous and costly. ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century -- more than the current gross domestic product of many US states,"" the US National Climate Assessment found. In worst-case scenarios, climate change could cost more than 10% of US gross domestic product by the end of the century, the report said, and kill thousands of Americans. Diplomats convene at the end of each year for negotiations that are part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Countries are expected to renegotiate open questions about emissions trading next year. New pollution-cutting pledges are due in 2020.","After two weeks of discordant and emotional negotiations, the nations of the world agreed Saturday night on a set of rules meant to help curb global warming.",2018-12-15T21:45:23Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Climate talks end in agreement, barely",https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/15/health/cop24-climate-change-talks-agreement/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181215121834-cop24-final-session-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,deadlier,1

His arteries, veins and a large piece of bone were destroyed. His right leg wasn't spared either as the round created a massive exit wound and then hit it as well.

Medics on the ground say Israeli forces are shooting at demonstrators with a new type of round, unseen before - known as the ""butterfly bullet"" - which explodes upon impact, pulverizing tissue, arteries and bone, while causing severe internal injuries. All 24 amputees were shot with a single explosive bullet, including journalists Yaser Murtaja and Ahmad Abu Hussein who succumbed to their wounds after taking rounds in the abdomen. ""All of their internal organs were totally destroyed, pulverized,"" said Ashraf al-Qedra, Gaza's health ministry spokesman. The bullets are the deadliest the Israeli army has ever used, according to Qedra. ""Normally, a regular bullet breaks the leg [upon impact]. But these bullets create massive wounds, indicating that an explosion happened inside the body. It's an expanding bullet. It pulverizes the leg and the leg gets cut off [as a result],"" Qedra explained. At least 45 Palestinians have been killed since the March of Great Return movement began a month ago - the vast majority by this new type of explosive bullet, health officials say. About 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded. Gaza's medics have struggled to cope not just with the sheer number of injured demonstrators that rush through the hospital doors every Friday, but also to properly treat these kinds of ghastly wounds. Medical staff from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) operating in Gaza say patients who have been shot with the rounds have sustained fist-sized wounds of an ""unusual severity"" and will have to undergo ""complex surgical operations"". ""Half of the more than 500 patients we have admitted in our clinics have injuries where the bullet has literally destroyed tissue after having pulverized the bone,"" said Marie-Elisabeth Ingres, head of MSF in Palestine, in a report. "" Managing these injuries is very difficult... A lot of patients will keep functional deficiencies for the rest of their life."" Explosive rounds have been banned internationally under the 1899 Hague Convention because of the ""unnecessary injury and suffering caused from large bullet wounds"". Under international law, when use of force is unavoidable, law enforcement officials must make all efforts to minimise injury. ""We know about the kind of wounds that this bullet creates in the body and from the remnants of the bullets, the shrapnel that they take out. We know that this is something that we've never seen before,"" Qedra said, adding the rounds have been fired since the March of Great Return movement began. The spokesperson for the Israeli army did not respond to Al Jazeera for comment by the time of publication. Butterfly bullet is a type of bullets that launched faster than sound and causes severe damage in flesh layers and bone when hitting the human body. It is used by the Israeli army snipers against the armless demonstrators on the borders of gaza. #BDSOurWeapon @basemn63 #Israel70 pic.twitter.com/tNc79jqe4Q — Jamal Naim (@jnaim1) April 24, 2018 Many have documented how Israel has "" turned the occupied territories into a laboratory for refining, testing and showcasing its weapons systems"", which it later sells worldwide with the advertisement that the products have been ""tested in combat"". Israel is smaller than New York, yet it's believed to be the largest per capita weapons exporter in the world. The butterfly bullet, however, isn't the only new weapon featured prominently in the protests in Gaza. Palestinians have also noted an unknown toxic gas launched at demonstrators, which provokes severe convulsions. Yellow-green in colour, many who were exposed to it ended up convulsing, their legs and bodies thrashing violently as they lay on the ground. #Watch | Bizarre symptoms appeared on some protesters who suffered suffocation from gas bombs thrown by Israeli occupation forces on peaceful protesters in the #GreatReturnMarch. pic.twitter.com/v5BpB7DtTQ — Quds News Network | #GreatReturnMarch (@QudsNen) April 21, 2018 Others suffer from asphyxia or experience extreme migraines and rapid heart rates. It's much more dangerous than tear gas and its symptoms are more severe, explained Dr Ashraf Joma'a, a chemistry specialist from Gaza, noting it is difficult to find an appropriate treatment. ""One of the cases is Ahmed Zo'rob, 18, who has lost his consciousness since the first Friday of the march [March 30] and has been transferred to Egypt for treatment,"" Joma'a said. ""We have unexploded gas bombs as samples here, but the scientific potential in Gaza is too weak to properly detect the various advanced gases used by the Israeli occupation,"" Joma'a said. ""These are internationally prohibited weapons and we call on the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the international community to send an investigative committee."" Seventy-five people are currently being hospitalised because of exposure to the gas. Last Friday, Gaza's Ministry of Health reported that Israeli forces launched unidentified gas bombs at medical service centres, east of al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, which resulted in severe vomiting, convulsions and asphyxia for dozens. ""For regular gas, it takes just a few minutes to apply treatment,"" Qedra said. ""But in these cases it often takes patients seven hours in the hospital to recover."" In another first, the Israeli army also experimented with ""crowd control"" methods last March by using drones to drop tear gas on protesters. On Friday Amnesty International issued a report calling for governments worldwide to impose an arms embargo on Israel following the country's ""disproportionate response"" to the demonstrations along the border fence. ""The nature of these injuries shows that Israeli soldiers are using high-velocity military weapons designed to cause maximum harm to Palestinian protesters that do not pose imminent threat to them,"" said Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnesty's deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""These apparently deliberate attempts to kill and main are deeply disturbing, not to mention completely illegal. Some of these cases appear to amount to willful killing, a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime."" For Palestinians in Gaza, there are few options. The situation is dire but protesting for change comes at a huge risk. On the fateful afternoon of April 6, Zaieem had seen a wounded protester, bleeding from the leg, lying on the ground about 70 metres away from the fence and fully exposed to the line of fire. He ran over and quickly dragged the young, wounded man to a safer area behind the nearest sand mound. The Israelis shot several times at first, but they were unscathed. Zaieem waited about 10 minutes for the shooting to calm down - but the Israelis were waiting as well, his cousin recounted to Al Jazeera from the West Bank. The moment Zaieem stood up to run and call the paramedics, he felt the ""electricity"" run through his leg as an explosive bullet hit him. ""Later he said, 'It's okay' and that 'It's God's will; praise be to God'. But he's just pretending,"" his cousin said sadly. ""His disability is a death penalty for him. He lost his future. Deep down, he wishes he died instead. He loved football so much, but now he won't even be able to walk without crutches. What a loss.""

Al Jazeera,"Fighting between farmers and herdsmen in Nigeria has killed more people this year than attacks by the Boko Haram, a new report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) said. At least 1,500 people have been killed in clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers in central states since September last year, the group said. Thursday's report says more than 1,300 Nigerians died from the farmer-herder conflicts between January and June this year, while the death toll from Boko Haram's insurgency was about 250. This is at least six times higher than the number of people estimated by the UN to have been killed by Boko Haram in the same period, the report said. The herders and farmers are fighting over land and water in Nigeria's fertile central region. ""It's a fight for resources. Government needs to make a plan to deal with the resource problem on a long-term basis,"" ICG senior researcher Nnamdi Obasi said. Election threat Worsening violence between farmers and herders could hit Nigeria's general election scheduled for next year and 'destabilise' the country, ICG warned. The report said some progress had been made in tackling the crisis but more needed to be done ahead of elections, which typically heighten the risk of ethnic, religious and political tensions. ""It (the conflict) is exacting an ever deadlier toll and, with elections looming in 2019, could destabilise the country if the government and other actors fail to contain it,"" it added. The researchers said the unrest could affect the ability of people to register to vote and political campaigning. The overstretched police and military were unable to cope and with attacks largely unpunished, communities had taken matters into their own hands. But much of the tit-for-tat violence has become more planned and involved increasingly well-armed and organised militia, the report said. Human cost In the deadliest attack, 11 villages were attacked last month in the Barkin Ladi area of Plateau state, central Nigeria, in which more than 200 people from farming communities were killed. The ICG said the attacks had rendered more than 300,000 people homeless, with the displaced forced to stay with family and friends or in overcrowded, unsanitary camps. Local aid agencies were overwhelmed but there was very little help available elsewhere because of the humanitarian crisis sparked by the nine-year Boko Haram insurgency. ""The government response was very poor, partly because it was overly engaged with the Boko Haram insurgency,"" Obasi said. Mass displacement has had an effect on food production and was likely to drive up prices, as farmers were unable or unwilling to work the land because of fear of fresh attacks, the report added.","At least 1,500 people have been killed in clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers since September",2018-07-26T15:38:01Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Nigeria: Grazing conflict deadlier than Boko Haram,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/nigeria-grazing-conflict-deadlier-boko-haram-180726140510011.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/7/26/537c221d19864f189b6be4f42b88e058_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,deadlier,1

The phrase “Lunar New Year” is sometimes used interchangeably with “Chinese New Year,” but there are variations in how the holiday is celebrated around Asia. In Vietnam, a type of rice cake called banh chung is made specially for the holiday and is deeply intertwined with nationalist myths and ancestor-worship customs. Vietnam’s lunar zodiac cycle also differs slightly from China’s: It has a cat and a water buffalo instead of a rabbit and an ox. Some historians say that’s a linguistic quirk tied to China’s 1,000-year imperial occupation of Vietnam, its southern neighbor. Vietnam’s next Year of the Cat falls in 2023. The last time around, the owner of a “pet hotel” in the capital, Hanoi, told Reuters that the cat was an appropriate cosmic choice because it helps to offset the dog, its natural enemy. “This expresses a balance of yin and yang in the cosmos that is more complete, that better unifies the contradictions, and so it is richer and better to have the cat,” he said. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

German Lopez,"It’s not what much of the public would consider a mass shooting. But overall, it represents a much deadlier form of gun violence. Kimson Green, 17, was a month away from being inducted into the National Honor Society. But on Sunday afternoon, he and three others were caught in a shooting in the Miami neighborhood of Liberty City. Green, a sophomore at Northwestern High School, and former student Rickey Dixon, 18, were killed. Two others were wounded, including a senior from Northwestern High. Police still have not caught the shooter or shooters, and they have not publicly identified a motive, according to the Miami Herald. An investigation is underway. Under some definitions (including the one used by the Gun Violence Archive and Vox ), the event would actually qualify as a mass shooting — since four or more people were shot, even if they weren’t killed. But the event, despite tweets by survivors from the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, hasn’t gotten much attention — certainly not the kind of national media focus that Parkland drew. That’s because this shooting appears to represent a more typical kind of gun violence in America. It wasn’t a lone shooter targeting a public space seemingly at random. It was yet another example of gun violence at Liberty Square, an apartment complex that the Miami Herald described as “crime-plagued.” Several other students at Northwestern High have also been killed in shootings over the past few years, according to the Herald. This was, in other words, a place where this kind of gun violence is sadly typical — normal, even. So it doesn’t draw the kind of attention a shocking, seemingly out-of-nowhere mass shooting at a school, church, or concert does. Yet when we talk about America’s gun problem, these are the kinds of shootings and places — along with suicides, which make up around 60 percent of US gun deaths — that we really should be thinking about. The evidence for gun control, in fact, is actually strongest for stricter gun laws preventing these kinds of tragedies, not necessarily mass shootings. The typical gun violence we often ignore In 2016 (the latest year for which data is available), there were nearly 39,000 gun deaths. More than 14,000 of those were homicides, and almost 23,000 were suicides. Using Mother Jones’s definition of a mass shooting — which uses a narrow framework to try to identify the shootings people usually picture when they hear “mass shooting” — 71 deaths in 2016 were due to mass shootings. That represents less than 1 percent of all gun deaths that year. Based on what we know so far, the Liberty City shooting represents the 99-plus percent. The two teenagers who died in the Miami shooting were also black. This, too, is common: In 2016, for example, more than 52 percent of murder victims ( 73 percent of whom were killed by guns) were black, even though black people only make up about 13 percent of the general population. The racial breakdown may help explain the lack of national attention to more typical gun violence. We know that racial biases make white Americans more likely to perceive black people as less innocent and even as criminals, which may, in some people’s minds, make these victims more deserving of the gun violence in their communities. Even though these everyday shootings rarely come up in the national debate about gun control, the evidence is actually strongest for stricter gun laws preventing the more common shootings, including suicides. In fact, the empirical evidence is weaker for the effect of gun control on the mass shootings that do draw national attention — largely because these tragedies are relatively rare and therefore more difficult to study. A recent review of US-based studies by the RAND Corporation, for example, found no good evidence of gun-related policies affecting mass shootings, deeming the studies in this area “inconclusive.” But RAND did find evidence that some measures — background checks, child access prevention laws, minimum age requirements, and prohibitions associated with mental illness — are all together linked to reductions in injuries and deaths, including the more typical gun homicides and suicides. The RAND review’s conclusions are backed by other research. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives. But those findings were for gun deaths broadly, with mass shootings rarely being the focus of the analyzed studies. One could still infer from this evidence that stricter gun laws will reduce mass shooting deaths, but it’s an inference from the data, not a strong empirical finding. Meanwhile, the research indicates that stricter gun laws really could help prevent more shootings like that in Liberty City over the weekend — even though gun control is rarely brought up nationally after such events. There are also some evidence-based policies that could help reduce everyday gun violence outside the realm of gun control, including more stringent regulations and taxes on alcohol, changes in policing, and behavioral intervention programs. These, too, rarely get national attention after a shooting like Liberty City’s. Some gun control activists are trying to change the dynamic. In the aftermath of the Liberty City shooting, Parkland survivor David Hogg tweeted, “I wish they [pundits] would actually focus on what matters here like the 4 kids shot in #LibertyCity recently or simply the people that die across America everyday due of gun violence.” But so far, the calls for attention have mostly rung hollow — and the tragedy in Liberty City has been by and large contained to local news coverage.","It’s not what much of the public would consider a mass shooting.

Reuters,"Syringes of the opioid painkiller fentanyl are shown in the inpatient pharmacy at the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City. Rick Bowmer/AP (Reuters) - Nebraska plans to carry out its first execution in 21 years on Tuesday by delivering a lethal injection to a man convicted of killing two taxi drivers in 1979. The state is scheduled to put to death Carey Moore, 60, at 10 a.m. local time at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln. It would be the first time any state has used fentanyl in a lethal injection. The drug, 100 times stronger than morphine, has helped fuel the recent national opioid crisis, which has brought a surge in overdose deaths. If the execution goes forward, it would also mark the first time Nebraska has used a lethal injection to kill an inmate since the death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1976. Three executions in the 1990s were by electrocution, state records showed. Moore, the longest serving prisoner on Nebraska's death row, was convicted of robbing and fatally shooting drivers Reuel Van Ness and Maynard Helgeland. He initially received a death sentence under an ""exceptional depravity"" statute on the books at that time that amplified punishment, court records showed. Nebraska death-row inmate Carey Dean Moore. Nebraska Department of Correctional Services via AP, File The other drugs in the lethal injection mix are diazepam, typically know as valium, cisatracurium besylate, a paralytic that can halt breathing and potassium chloride, which can cause cardiac arrest. Court records show Moore has launched no last-minute appeals to spare his life, but the US arm of German drug maker Fresenius Kabi had sued unsuccessfully to prevent the state from using its products in a lethal injection, which it says could harm its reputation. The company claimed the state obtained the drugs through deception. The state argued in a court filing that it obtained the drugs from a licensed US pharmacy, not by ""any fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" For several years, the death penalty has been a political football in the conservative state. In 2015, Nebraska temporarily became the first Republican-dominated state in more than 40 years to abolish capital punishment. At the time, the Republican majority in the unicameral legislature said it was banning executions because of religious reservations, difficulty in obtaining lethal injection drugs, the risk of wrongful convictions and unfair implementation of capital punishment. But Republican Governor Pete Ricketts pushed back and helped place a referendum on the ballot in 2016, which passed and restored capital punishment. Nebraska has 11 inmates on death row, which ranks among the nation's smallest. California has 746 inmates on death row, the most of any state, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Beth Elderkin,"It’s a real jungle out there, even in the suburbs. The debut trailer for The Predator is here, and things aren’t looking too good in this neighborhood. This soft reboot/sequel, which is directed by Shane Black (who played Rick Hawkins in the original Predator ), takes the hunt from the jungle to the city outskirts. Rory McKenna (Jacob Tremblay), a young boy with autism, accidentally triggers the arrival of the Predator. But this isn’t your daddy’s Predator—these bad boys have genetically upgraded themselves with DNA from other species, making themselves stronger and deadlier than ever before.

Asher Madan,"Recently, Square Enix unveiled Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the conclusion to Lara Croft's origin story. In the game, Lara must master a deadly jungle, overcome terrifying tombs, and persevere through her darkest hour. According to the company, as she races to save the world from a Mayan apocalypse, Lara will ultimately be forged into the Tomb Raider she is destined to be. The new Xbox One X gameplay showcases a jungle environment packed with enemies who want to find her. There's a strong emphasis on stealth because even though Lara Croft seems deadlier, the combat appears to be more realistic. You have to sneak around and take out soldiers one at a time. While a ""Rambo"" approach might be possible, it seems like going the other route will lead to more successful combat scenarios. The environments are also much more interactive this time around. Unlike Rise of the Tomb Raider, you can climb trees and do so much more. The visuals are also better, but should be seen as a refinement over the prequel rather than a significant leap. The textures seem to be the highlight of the upgrade, especially at 4K resolution on Xbox One X. Shadow of the Tomb Raider is currently available for preorder at various retailers. The game should launch on Xbox One and other platforms on September 14, 2018, starting at $59.99.

"A.A. Dowd on Games, shared by A.A. Dowd to The A.V. Club","Theres a nifty throwaway feature in Capcoms brand-new remake of the survival-horror classic Resident Evil 2. At any point throughout the campaign, you can go to the settings menu and toggle to the original games audio. Not the exact same audio, of coursetheres no way to make the monsters sound like they did in 1998, nor has anyone painstakingly dubbed the old and famously stilted dialogue (Sorry, but it looks like your party has been canceled) into the new cutscenes. But switching on this sonic way-back machine does revert many of the basic sound effects to their 20-year-old glory. Typewriters log your save game with a familiar clickety clack. Item boxes creakily groan open, just as they did on the PlayStation 1. Rifling through your inventory will emit an old-school, oddly comforting plink plink plink. And then theres the music. For a real Pavlovian rush, switch on the throwback audio right before first stepping into the main hall of the games primary location, the Raccoon City Police Station. The piano, lonely horns, and dinging bells will take you back to a simpler time of hoarding ink ribbons and pushing around statues.
Its a fun option, but not an essential one. Because even without the vintage audio, Resident Evil 2 is destined to inspire déjà vu. Capcom may have updated the sound, along with the graphics, the combat, and the camera system (it hangs over your shoulder, instead of capturing your plight from fixed and often exaggerated angles), but this is still a very faithful remake, arguably even closer to its source material than the 2002 redo of the first Resident Evil. The bifurcated sci-fi melodrama story, following rookie cop Leon Kennedy and motorcycling civilian Claire Redfield through a city overrun by the living dead, plays out as it always has. And the level design, while tweaked slightly, follows the same basic blueprint, replicating the layout of key locations and the design aesthetic of many rooms, down to the position of furniture. More than that, and as our own Sam Barsanti pointed out in his full review, the values of the original have been preserved: All the modern bells and whistles cant disguise the familiarity of the core gameplay, with its focus on conserving supplies, avoiding confrontations, and backtracking constantly through enemy territory.
All of which makes the souped-up, spit-shined new Resident Evil 2 something of a nostalgia trip, at least for those with fond memories of playing through its iconic inspiration. This critic has made the case, pretty recently, that nostalgia is the enemy of true horrorthat the genre, at its most effective, is about discomfort, which is basically the opposite of the warm flood of recognition that fan service provides. Can you really scare someone when youre constantly feeding them what they already know and love? Thing is, this RE2 does more than provoke nostalgia. It weaponizes it, through deviations in gameplaythrough the ways, big and small, it actually breaks with its predecessor. Because everything is so eerily similar, you think you know how to handle it. But that false sense of security can get you into trouble quick.
Take the zombies. Against all odds, Resident Evil 2 makes the most played-out of monsters, dispatched with often-comical ease on televisions reigning but waning cable blockbuster, scary again. Its not just that they move more erratically and unpredictably than any that have shambled their way through a previous Resident Evil installment, or they just sound more fearsome, rasping hungrily as you bolt around a blind corner into their clammy embrace. Its also that the standard RE rulesand indeed, what weve all come to understand as the accepted rules of zombie maintenanceno longer apply. Shoot one of these disgusting ghouls in the noggin and theyre likely to keep coming; the headshot is no longer an instant kill. Get grabbed by one on the ground youve neglected to finish off and you wont take a little damage before getting the job done with a decapitating kickthatd be too easy! And you think running away will save you? The zombies will often follow you up stairs or through closed doors, breaking the established leash this franchise used to attach to them.
This isnt the first time Capcom has diabolically toyed with its audiences presumed experience taking down the undead. The aforementioned Resident Evil remake introduced an ingenious re-reanimation system, wherein zombies you left for dead would rise again, faster and stronger and more ferocious than before. And one could argue that part of the kick of 2005s white-knuckle-intense Resident Evil 4 is how it made you adjust, on the life-or-death fly, to infected hordes that behaved very differently than the kind that the series built its legacy atop.
The new Resident Evil 2 pushes those subversions of gameplay memory further, sometimes cleverly exploiting a fans ingrained understanding of the conventions. You cant reload your weapon in the items menu anymore; its now a real-time action, performed with sometimes agonizingly realistic deliberation, each bullet needing to be locked into its own chamber as some beast draws nearer and nearer. Oh, and what of the assumed safety of the save room? Though some of these strategically dispersed checkpoints will indeed function as they always have, like sanctuaries within a house of horror, theres now no hard guarantee that a room with a typewriter and/or item box will be danger-free. (You can die, in other words, right before saving your progress.) RE2 even expects you to solve puzzles while enemies are afoot. In the most nerve-wracking of these assignments, youre asked to adjust a series of bookcases to reach a new doorand far from pausing itself while you perform the task, the game puts a stomping Tyrant on your tail, forcing you either to multitask and periodically stun him while you finish or to divert him away from the library, throwing him off your scent for long enough to get it done.
Speaking of said Tyrant, the relentless campaign of terror waged by Mr. X is perhaps the scariest way Resident Evil 2 twists its own tropes. A towering, effectively un-killable behemoth in a trench coat, Mr. X was originally conceived as a way to cruelly bend the rules of Resident Evilto add a new edge of urgency to a second play-through of the first sequel. Recalling a previous survival-horror stalker (the persistent Scissorman of Clock Tower) and essentially a dry-run to the titular menace of the third Resident Evil game, Nemesis, Mr. X showed up in the B campaign of the original RE2, sometimes literally bursting through the pre-rendered background, as though he were tearing the very fabric of the games logic. Unlike other bosses, you couldnt fell him, no matter how much firepower you were packing. Unlike other enemies, he would actually follow you across the mapthough, usually, only down a couple hallways at a time.
Without giving the character much of a makeover (he still looks kind of dopey, like the Grey Hulk), 2019s Resident Evil 2 enhances his fear factor. When he first shows upright there in the A campaign, casually tossing aside the debris of a helicopter thats crashed into the side of the stationseasoned Evil players might assume that they can quickly outrun him to safety, getting out of his geographic range of predation by reaching a neutral area like the Great Hall. But this version of Mr. X isnt so easily deterred: Hell just keep following you, tailing you across the whole of the police station. If you manage to get out of his sightline or reach a room he wont enter (there are a few, though theyre not exactly marked on the map), Mr. X will start lumbering around the nearby area, searching for you, like the Xenomorph in Alien: Isolation. In a sense, these unscripted patrols are more frightening than having him right on your heelsthe pounding footsteps and offscreen sound of doors opening and closing create the anxiety of a chance encounter. They also inject a little spontaneity into a series thats traditionally, carefully, and rather cinematically curated its scares, down to the exact placement of the camera for maximum atmosphere and dread. Mr. Xs movements turn most of the play-field into a danger zone; you could die almost anywhere or anytime when hes stomping around.
The first RE (and its corresponding remake) took place in a sprawling Gothic mansion in the woodsthe kind of place youd probably expect to find crawling with monsters. Part of the fun of the sequel is how it relocated those same bump-in-the-dark mechanics to the more mundane, municipal backdrop of a small city police station, with cluttered offices and waiting rooms and, okay, the occasional baroque unicorn sculpture. It really ran with the idea of making the familiar frighteningly unfamiliar. The remake builds on that appeal in a metatextual way, not just sharpening the banal realism of the level designthe police station looks more than ever like a real police station, splattered in both stale coffee and spilled bloodbut also turning your expectations about how Resident Evil should operate against you. The game could have taken that element further, to be sure: Instead of slavishly recreating some of the originals most iconic scares, like one involving a two-way mirror and another involving a blind monstrosity skittering across a window, the designers might have really thrown reverence to the wind by not delivering the most expected shocks. But you still have to admire the tightrope Resident Evil 2 walks as an ideal remake, living up to memories of an ancient game even as it effectively reminds you that knowing Raccoon City by heart wont save you. It might just get you killed, in fact.","There’s a nifty throwaway feature in Capcom’s brand-new remake of the survival-horror classic Resident Evil 2.

"Kyle Mizokami on Foxtrot Alpha, shared by Kyle Mizokami to Jalopnik","The U.S. Army is on the lookout for a new vehicle to replace the M2 Bradley, and it doesnt want a vehicle with firepower the equal of potential adversaries. Instead the service is looking to outdo them, overmatching them with bigger, deadlier, longer range automatic cannon rounds to shred enemy infantry and armored vehicles. The vehicle, tentatively known as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, will enter service in the 2020s. The U.S. Army is famously bad at developing fighting vehicles. The Bradleys development was famously troubled, as the above clip from the movie Pentagon Wars accurately depicts. From 1999 to 2008, the Army spent $18.1 billion trying to create an entire family of vehicles to replace of its fighting vehicles, Bradley included, but the program was cancelled without the service receiving a single vehicle. A second program, the Ground Combat Vehicle, was cancelled in 2010, again without a single vehicle reaching operational status. The GCV was famously so festooned with antennas, guns, and other equipment it looked like the car Homer Simpson built. The Army wants test OMFV vehicles by 2019, with a decision on production by 2023 and the vehicle issued to units in 2026. The M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle (or IFV) entered service in the early 1980s. The Bradley replaced the M113 armored personnel carrier (or APC) and reflected a combat vehicle philosophy pioneered by the Soviet Army: while APCs would dismount an infantry squad to attack on foot, IFVs would allow infantrymen to stay in their vehicles, fighting from within, without dismounting and slowing down a fast-moving mechanized attack. IFVs were more heavily armed than APCs, with a light automatic cannon and long-range anti-tank weapons, and more heavily armed to protect the passengers and crew inside. The Bradley has served well over the past 35 years, despite its early development problems, participating in the 1991 Gulf War and the war in Iraq. The Bradley is equipped with a turret-mounted 25-millimeter autocannon with an effective range of 3,000 meters and two TOW anti-tank missiles with a range of 3,750 meters. While the U.S. Army has relied on the Bradley for nearly four decades, other countries fielded a new generation of IFVs that pack even more firepower and protection. Chinas ZBD-04, for example, sports both a 30-millimeter automatic cannon (thats five more millimeters than the Bradley, youll notice) and a 100-millimeter rifled gun/missile launcher that can destroy armored vehicles at ranges of up to 4,000 meters. Russias T-15 Armata heavy infantry fighting vehicle is equipped with one 30mm 2A42 automatic cannon with roughly the same performance as the Bradleys gun. The T-15 also carries twice as many anti-tank missiles that can range out more than twice as far, killing tanks (and Bradleys) at ranges of up to eight kilometers. The bad news is that the Bradley is outgunned. The good news is that both Russia and China have laid down their cards and probably wont be unveiling new IFVs anytime soon, which means that the United States knows the bar it has to clear. The Army calls the Bradley replacement the OMFV, or Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle. As the name suggests, the Army wants the vehicle to be capable of fighting autonomously or via remote control, in either case without a crew. It also wants a regular crew of no more than two, the ability to carry six soldiers in the rear, and enough protection to keep them safe. It wants the vehicles to fly two at a time into war zones in Air Force C-17 transports and quickly roll out into combat. In terms of lethality, as the Army states, It should apply immediate, precise and decisively lethal extended range medium caliber, directed energy, and missile fires in day/night all-weather conditions, while moving and/or stationary against moving and/or stationary targets. Last weeks Association of the U.S. Army conference in Washington D.C. saw three potential Bradley replacements from the usual suspects of BAE Systems, General Dynamics, and Raytheon/Rheinmetall. Of the three vehicles, according to Breaking Defense, the General Dynamics vehicle, the Griffin III, seems to have a leg up on the competition. Mostly because it packs a big gun. The Griffin III is derived from the British Armys Ajax reconnaissance vehicle. It has a 50-millimeter automatic cannon firing rounds twice the diameter of the Bradleys gun. It can elevate the gun to 85 degrees, allowing crews to engage targets in high-rise buildings. The turret also has room for anti-tank missiles and even nine Switchblade loitering missiles, capable of intercepting enemy drones or striking enemy targets up to 10 kilometers away with precision. The Griffin can also carry up to six troops in the backthe minimum requirement for the U.S. Army. The Griffin is heavily armored for its class and has an active protection system to shoot down incoming missiles, rockets, and shaped charge anti-tank gun rounds. Its also covered in a hexagonal pattern camouflage system designed to reduce the tanks thermal and acoustic signatures but which also looks awfully hard to keep clean. The M2 Bradley does need a replacement: the basic Bradley design is more than forty years old. Although the Army has worked to keep aging platforms current with the latest technology and trends some things, like the 25-millimeter gun, cant be upgraded. You can upgrade a 1981 Camaro to have all of the latest technology found in todays cars, but at some point it just makes sense to just buy a new Camaro. Griffin is a big step in the right direction, but one gripe that dogged the Bradley throughout its career was the smallsix to sevennumber of infantry it could carry. Griffin can carry only six, and no future upgrade will increase that number. Another vehicle in the running, the Raytheon/Rheinmetall KF41 Lynx, carries eight troops, but the problem is that a bigger vehicle is a less mobile vehicle. The Army must now carefully consider the tradeoffs of one quality over another and decide which ones it really, really needs. Will the third time be the charm for the Army or will the Bradley roll on well into the 21st century? Well just have to see.","The U.S. Army is on the lookout for a new vehicle to replace the M2 Bradley, and it doesn’t want a vehicle with firepower the equal of potential adversaries.

Caroline Praderio,"Last year, the US opioid epidemic continued ""to worsen and evolve"" thanks to synthetic drugs like fentanyl, a report published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. 
 In 2017, drug overdoses led to 70,237 deaths, and more than two-thirds involved opioids. That marked an increase from the 63,632 overdose deaths reported in 2016, and one particular type of opioid was linked to this surge. 
 Overdose death rates linked to synthetic opioids — a class of drugs including the potent painkiller fentanyl — jumped by 45.2% between 2016 and 2017. Death rates from heroin and prescription opioids, by contrast, remained high but stable from 216 to 2017. 
 The report also found that synthetic opioid overdoses are expanding geographically. Previously, deaths due to these drugs primarily occurred east of the Mississippi River, a CDC media statement said. But the newest data show that eight states west of the Mississippi (Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Texas, and Washington), have had significant increases in synthetic opioid overdose deaths. 
Synthetic opioids are drugs created to relieve pain by mimicking naturally occurring opioids like morphine and codeine, according to the CDC. The category includes drugs made by pharmaceutical companies, like tramadol and fentanyl, as well as drugs made illegally.

 Fentanyl, one well-known synthetic opioid, is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). It's used legally to treat pain in medical settings, and it can be administered by injection, a skin patch, or lozenges. 
 But in the US, most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdoses, death, and harm are linked to illicitly manufactured fentanyl, or IMF, according to the CDC. 
 In fact, the new CDC report said that IMF was ""likely"" the driver behind the rising rate of synthetic opioid overdoses in 2017. 
 On the street, IMF can be found as powder or pills. It also may be mixed with heroin or disguised as another, less potent opioid painkiller like oxycodone. Fentanyl's potency means it comes with a high risk of overdose, especially if the user doesn't know that a powder or pill contains the drug, according to NIDA. 
Read more:Why fentanyl is deadlier than heroin, in a single photo
 Earlier this month, a separate CDC report ranking the most commonly used drugs involved in overdoses found that fentanyl has surpassed oxycodone to become the deadliest drug in America. 
 ""The drug overdose epidemic continues to evolve, with the involvement of many types of drugs including opioids, cocaine, and psychostimulants,"" Dr. Debra Houry, director of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in the CDC media statement. ""This underscores the urgency for more timely and localized data to inform public health and public safety action.""

,"Surpassing expectations, the young yet talented National University (NU) squad shook the first round of the UAAP Season 81 women’s volleyball tournament as they gave their more experienced opponents a run for their money.
Players from the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) Lady Eagles had nothing but praises for the NU Lady Bulldogs who put up a good fight in the first round despite being a rookie-laden squad.
While the Lady Eagles overpowered NU yesterday in four sets to clinch their sixth consecutive win and end the first round on top of the standings, the game proved to be difficult for the Katipunan squad.
The first set turned out to be a seesaw battle between both teams, with the Lady Bulldogs taking the one-set advantage after a high-reward play from Joni Chavez to Audrey Paran.
While the Lady Eagles responded back with a masterful win in the second set, both teams were back at it again in the deadlock-filled third set, with middle blockers Bea de Leon and Maddie Madayag coming alive to take control of the game two sets to one.
The Katipunan squad never looked back as they started hot in the fourth set, leading early and creating momentum all the way to the end.
De Leon, who finished the game with 13 points, said the Lady Bulldogs proved to be a difficult team to go up against as they play every game without pressure and expectations.
“Rookies sila e, they’re very eager. I remember my first year, all I wanted to do was to get the best shots and enjoy every moment, so ‘yun ‘yung kalaban mo e, ‘yung enthusiasm that they have for the game,” De Leon said.
The team captain further added that their game against NU turned out to be one of their toughest games yet, commending them for putting up a strong fight in the first round.
“I really commend them–despite being rookies, kaya nilang makipagsabayan sa veterans and sa lahat ng teams sa UAAP,” De Leon said.
“Good thing we came out strong, but that was tough–that was one of the toughest yet for me, kasi it’s tougher to play a team that’s very loose, na talagang bahala na, enjoy lang kami,” she added.
Wing spiker Kat Tolentino, who finished with 10 points, echoed the same sentiment as she sees the Lady Bulldogs to become deadlier in the next games to come.
“They did a really good job and that was one of the harder games in the first round. I think the NU team was really strong, just considering their mindset was that for me, they have nothing to lose and they can beat an older team, and it was kind of a wake up call in the first set just seeing how they played,” Tolentino said.
Meanwhile, head coach Oliver Almadro commended his squad for maintaining composure against a more confident NU who came from a huge five-set victory over the University of the Philippines Lady Maroons last Wednesday, further adding that all teams should look out for the talented Lady Bulldogs in the second round.
“NU [came] from a good win last time, and ‘yung momentum is still with them, the energy, the intensity is still there. I already anticipated that, but I told my players to show them your character. They’re really a team to beat–they’re really talented rookies and matatapang maglaro,” Almadro said.

Barbara Goldberg,"A woman holds a sign while marching with the Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America contingent at the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade in San Francisco, California, U.S. June 26, 2016. Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters Volunteers trained by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America are running for office in local seats across the US after years of frustration with Congress' lack of action. Little has been done since the massacre to curb access to certain firearms. At the time of the Sandy Hook shooting, it was the second-deadliest mass shooting in US history. NEW YORK (Reuters) - Five years after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school, advocates who are disappointed with the failure of efforts to limit access to firearms are changing their strategy. Instead of pressuring lawmakers to push new gun-control measures through the U.S. Congress, volunteers from groups including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America are now running for office themselves. Nine of 13 volunteers trained by the group ran for office this year and won seats, ranging from New Hampshire state representative to city council member in West University Place, Texas. Fourteen more have already declared their intentions to run for office in 2018, seeking seats in Congress, state legislatures and local government, all running as Democrats. “The reality is that the work doesn’t really start in Congress. That’s where it ends,” said Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts, who launched her group the day after the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Carlee Soto calls to get information about her sister, Victoria Soto, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., after gunman Adam Lanza killed 26 people inside the school, including 20 children. AP Photo/Jessica Hill The group began training candidates after more than 400 of its 70,000 members said they were interested in running for office. “This is a marathon, not a sprint,” Watts said. “It’s going to take several election cycles.” Even if the next class of candidates, none of whom are running as Republicans, succeed in winning office, they will face an uphill battle against a U.S. Congress controlled by Republicans, who are staunch defenders of the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Sandy Hook was at the time the second-deadliest mass shooting carried out by a single gunman in U.S. history. It sparked new energy among gun-control advocates who pushed for fresh federal restrictions on assault weapons, which were blocked by Republican lawmakers and the powerful National Rifle Association lobby. A steady stream of mass shootings have continued across the United States since Sandy Hook, including two deadlier incidents — the slaughter of 58 people at a Las Vegas concert in October and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub last year. Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was among the 20 first graders killed in Newtown, said he believes grass roots achievements like the new crop of gun-control candidates will lead to more action. “This is a social change and it takes time,” Barden said. “What’s happening in Congress notwithstanding, the change is going to come from the ground up.” Parents of Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting victims made presentations on ways to better address mental health, school safety and gun violence prevention. Jessica Hill/AP In the meantime, Barden is working with Sandy Hook Promise, a volunteer effort to prevent more shooting deaths. The group said that in the past two years it has trained 2.5 million students and families to recognize signs of potential gun violence and report them to authorities. Social change, whether it is about drunk driving or recycling, comes from the ground up, said Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan died in the Sandy Hook attack. “In the gun violence prevention movement, we have not focused on getting behavioral change. It’s all been focused on top-down and that is not how you get change,” she said. Next year’s class of gun-control candidates includes a mother whose son was shot dead and a bystander paralyzed from the middle of her chest down in a drive-by shooting. Lara Kennedy is running for U.S. House of Representatives in the Texas district that encompasses Austin and north of San Antonio. Lucy McBath, whose only child Jordan Davis was shot dead after an argument over music while parked in Florida in 2012, is running for the Georgia House of Representatives. In Arizona, Jennifer Longdon, who was wounded in a random 2004 shooting, also is seeking to become a state representative. In Arkansas, Adrienne Kvello is challenging incumbent Republican state Representative Charlie Collins, who sponsored bills to put more guns on college campuses, in courthouses and the state capitol. Amber Gustafson, a gun-owning Moms Demand Action volunteer and life-long Republican who switched her party registration to Democrat last year, said if she wins her race for an Iowa state Senate seat, she will fight for gun safety laws aimed at preventing another Sandy Hook. “I‘m pro people defending their Second Amendment rights. But I also believe and know that good laws can really protect lives,” Gustafson said.",Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters Volunteers trained by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America are running for office in local seats across the US after years of frustration with Congress' lack of action.

Associated Press,"MOSCOW (AP) — During the Cold War, Soviet scientists at a secret, high-security lab worked frantically to counter the latest U.S. chemical weapons. More than 40 years later, the nerve agent they developed apparently turned up in a quiet English town, where it nearly killed a former Russian spy and his daughter. Vladimir Uglev said he was the scientist who in 1975 first synthesized A-234 — an odorless liquid deadlier than any other chemical weapons that existed at the time. ""Hundreds of thousands could have been killed with what I produced,"" the 71-year-old former researcher told The Associated Press. Uglev detailed his deadly and secretive work, recalling how Kremlin leaders and the military were ambivalent about the chemical weapons program and eventually came to see it as burdensome and costly. And he described how the Soviet Union's collapse could have led to the lethal poisons falling into unscrupulous hands. Britain said that Russia used A-234, which is from a class of nerve agents known as ""Novichok,"" to poison ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, on March 4. Russia vehemently denied it was behind the attack, which touched off a diplomatic war between Moscow and the West. Russia has argued that the U.S., Britain and other Western countries acquired the expertise to make the nerve agent after the Soviet collapse. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an international watchdog group that analyzed samples in the Skripals' poisoning, confirmed British conclusions about the identity of the toxic chemical but not its origin. Uglev and Leonid Rink, another top scientist in the Soviet program interviewed by the AP, had conflicting theories. While Uglev said the nerve agent could have come from Russia, Rink echoed the Kremlin line, alleging British intelligence might have used a less-lethal substance and then faked the evidence to implicate Russia. Britain has denied that. Both scientists agreed, however, that it might never be possible to determine the nerve agent's source. The Skripals' improved health indicates they only got a minuscule dose and might have mitigated its effect by washing their hands, Uglev said. The Soviet program to design a new generation of chemical weapons began in the 1970s to counter the U.S., Uglev said. The Soviets wanted the equivalent of U.S. binary weapons — nerve agents made up of relatively harmless components that turned deadly when mixed. The main research lab was in Shikhany, a town in southwestern Russia that the KGB sealed off to outside visitors. The research was dangerous: Contact with just a few milligrams — the weight of a snowflake — were enough to kill within minutes. Uglev recalled once getting a tiny amount of a Novichok-class agent on his hand. ""I rinsed my hands with sulfuric acid and then put them under tap water,"" he said, adding it was the only way to survive. Another researcher who was contaminated in 1987 died of multiple illnesses five years later. By the end of the 1980s, scientists developed a host of nerve agents and various precursors for binary weapons that the military collectively dubbed ""Novichok,"" which means ""newcomer."" But the effort was only partly successful, Uglev said. While some nerve agents were deadlier than the U.S. equivalents, the main goal of developing feasible binary weapons wasn't achieved, he said. And although Soviet leaders wanted to counter the Americans, they weren't enthusiastic about chemical weapons in general, seeing them as excessive, when compared with Moscow's massive nuclear arsenal. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985, his reforms and closer ties with the West led to cuts in many military programs and arms control agreements. The Novichok-class agents were only made in lab quantities and never entered mass production, Uglev and Rink said. Uglev estimated about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) were made for research and military testing. ""It's hard to imagine that any significant amounts could have been left anywhere, except in researchers' personal safes, where it was allowed to keep no more than 20 grams"" — less than an ounce, he said. Samples were shared with other Soviet labs, and Rink said some could have ended up abroad after the Soviet Union's demise. Russia joined a global treaty banning chemical weapons and said last year it had finished destroying 40,000 metric tons of its Soviet chemical arsenals under close international oversight. Rink, who worked in Shikhany until 1997, said U.S. experts made sure that even small quantities of military-grade nerve agents and their precursors were destroyed. The U.S., however, couldn't prevent the expertise from spreading. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, who directed the Novichok program, went to Syria, where he reportedly helped create a chemical weapons program in the 1990s. He faced criminal charges in Russia in 1995 for helping smuggle toxic chemicals to the Middle East, and Israeli officials reportedly urged Russia to stop the operations. Kuntsevich died in 2002 on a flight from Syria to Russia, and Israeli media suggested he was killed by Israeli intelligence. Syria agreed to dismantle its chemical arsenal in 2013, but Washington alleged that Damascus reneged on its obligations and used chemical weapons on rebels, most recently in Douma on April 7. Despite the U.S. oversight to dismantle Russia's arsenal, Uglev said some of the nerve agents could have fallen into the wrong hands amid the economic and political chaos of the Soviet collapse. In backing Kremlin assertions on the Skripals' poisoning, Rink argued that Russia would have used an untraceable poison, rather than Novichok, which he called ""a brand name of Russian-made horror.""","MOSCOW (AP) — During the Cold War, Soviet scientists at a secret, high-security lab worked frantically to counter the latest U.S. chemical weapons.

Kathryn Howard/Released The United States Marine Corps: 242 years of butt-kicking and tradition. Russian Naval Infantry: A Russian military force with 312 years of victory — and defeat. Which is the deadlier unit in a matchup of the US versus Russia when it comes to naval infantry? In a major crisis, the US would likely send a Marine Expeditionary Brigade. Perhaps the most notable example was its use in 1990 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Using a force of five pre-positioned vessels, the US delivered the gear and supplies needed for the 4th MEB to operate for 30 days as additional heavy forces arrived. It wasn’t anyone’s idea of a slouch: It brought a reinforced regiment of Marines (three battalions of Marine infantry, a battalion of artillery, and companies of AAV-7A1 Amphibious Assault Vehicles, Light Armored Vehicles, and tanks) for ground combat, and also featured three squadrons of AV-8B+ Harriers, two squadrons of F/A-18C Hornets, a squadron of EA-6B Prowlers, and seven squadrons of helicopters. US Marines during a beach-landing exercise. Paul Szoldra/Business Insider A Russian Naval Infantry Brigade is also quite powerful. For the sake of this discussion, let’s look at the forces of Red Banner Northern Fleet, centered on the 61st Kirkinesskaya Red Banner Marine Brigade. The Red Banner Northern Fleet’s naval infantry force has three battalions of naval infantry, one air-assault battalion, one “reconnaissance” battalion, one “armored” battalion, two artillery battalions, and an air-defense battalion. If things were to come to blows in Norway during the Cold War (or today, for that matter), these units would go head-to-head. In fact, ironically, the 4th MEB was diverted from preparations for a deployment exercise to Norway to respond to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. So, who would win that face-off? Russian marines perform during celebrations for the force's annual holiday, November 29, 2014. Marine Infantry Day is celebrated in memory of Peter I's decree creating Russia's first regiment of marine guards, after a battle with the Swedes on November 27, 1705. Stringer./REUTERS With what is effectively four battalions of infantry, a reconnaissance battalion, a tank battalion, two artillery battalions, and the other attachments, the Russians have a slight numerical edge in ground firepower. The air-defense battalion can somewhat negate the air power that a Marine Expeditionary Brigade would bring to a fight. That said, some of the equipment is older, like the PT-76 light tank and the BRDM-2 armored car. The BMP-2 is equipping some units, but many still use BTR-80 and MT-LB armored personnel carriers. Very few BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles or T-90 main battle tanks have arrived. That said, the American Marines have potent firepower of their own. Perhaps the most potent ground firepower would come from the company of M1A1 Abrams tanks. Don’t be fooled by their 1980s lineage — these tanks have been heavily upgraded, and are on par with the M1A2 SEP tanks in Army service. Russian marines prepare to land at Finland Gulf during a military show to celebrate Navy Day in St. Petersburg, July 29, 2012. Alexander Demianchuk/REUTERS Marine Corps LAV-25s and LAV-ATs can also kill the armored vehicles attached to the Red Banner Northern Fleet. This does not include man-portable anti-tank missiles like the FGM-148 Javelin or the BGM-71 TOW. What will really ruin the day for the Russian Naval Infantry is the Marine aviation. Marine aviation specifically trains to support Marines on the ground, and the close-air support — particularly from the AV-8B+ Harrier — will prove to be very decisive. In short, the Marines might be spotting Russian Naval Infantry seven decades of tradition, but they will show the Russians why they were called “devil dogs.”",US Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl.

Marc Lagace,"Fortnite has been blowing up lately. Millions of people have become obsessed with the game, both as players and just watching popular Twitch streamers play the game. You may have also head that the game is currently soft-launching on iOS via an invite-only program, and there are plans to release it for Android in the near future. Interested to learn more? Just keep reading. What is Fortnite? Fortnite is what would happen if you combined two of the most addictive games out there — Minecraft and PUBG. Fortnite offers a free 100-player Player Vs Player (PvP) Battle Royale game mode. Just like PUBG, you're dropped onto the large island map and must arm yourself and outlive your competition. But in Fortnite, you always start out armed with a pickaxe which can be used as a melee weapon or for harvest raw supplies for building walls, ramps, and shelters. It certainly adds extra layers of strategy to the format, creating essentially a perfect storm of addictive gaming action that's as fun to watch as it is to play. Oh, speaking of storms all the action takes place in the eye of a deadly electrical storm meaning you can't just hunker down and hide out the whole game. You got to keep moving. How do you play the game? Just like PUBG, your goal is to be the last man standing — with up to 100 players involved in each match, that's no small task. Each game starts with the players jumping out of the flying ""Battle Bus"" and parachuting down onto a giant island. Once landed, you must loot nearby buildings for items, guns, and ammo to defend yourself and attack other players. You also need to keep an eye on the map, as every few minutes the storm closes in on the play area. If you're caught in the storm, you slowly die so you do not want to forget to regularly check where you are on the map. Eventually, the play constricts to a tiny area for the final showdown between the remaining players — there can only be one winner! Unlike PUBG, you're able to carry more than two guns. Instead, you're limited to the number of weapons and items you can carry at one time. Also, guns are color coded to denote their rarity — from grey (common) to orange (legendary) — and the rarer the gun, the deadlier it is. Then there's the crafting element. Every player starts out with a pickaxe which can be used as a melee weapon or used to break down trees and buildings to harvest the raw resources. You can then use these raw resources to build your own structures, whether it be a defensive wall to provide cover from an advancing enemy, a set of stairs to reach the second floor of a building or your own watchtower to snipe players from across the map. The resources you mine will determine the strength. Steel is stronger than brick, which is stronger than wood. When will it be available for Android? Fortnite has been available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for a few months now, and is currently soft launched on iOS as an invite-only beta. There have been no firm dates set for an Android release by Fortnite's developer, Epic Games, but they have said to expect support for Android to come in the next few months. I suppose they are waiting to see how the rollout and implementation play out on iOS devices first before opening the game up to Android users. Until then, at least we've got PUBG to tide us over. Will it be free to play? Epic Games has so far released the PvP Battle Royale game for free across all platforms including the mobile version for iOS. The console version also has a paid game mode called Save The World that's Player vs Environment (PvE). Save The World plays more like Minecraft, where you're harvesting more resources and stocking up on loot to survive waves of AI enemies in a sort of tower defense-style of gameplay. The PvE mode will not be available in Fortnite Mobile for iOS and, frankly, it's the PvP mode that everyone is crazy for so that's quite alright with us. However, the iOS version offers in-app purchases for cosmetic items to customize your player and people sure have been buying stuff. According to this report from Sensor Tower analtyics, Fortnite Mobile players spent more than $1 million during the first 72 hours of its release on iOS. Wow. So, to answer the question, you have the option to spend money on Fortnite if you want a cool looking character, but the game is free to play and you won't need to pay to win. Will there be support for Bluetooth controls? Epic Games has indicated that Bluetooth controller support will be coming later, but as of right now only touchscreen controls are available. Is it cross-platform? Epic Games have indicated that you will be able to play Fortnite across all platforms. Your Fortnite profile can be connected to all the platforms you play on so you can add to your stats however you connect to the game. Don't be worried about getting mismatched as the one mobile player in a server of PC and console players. If you're playing solo on mobile, you will only be matched up against other mobile players. If you join a squad with friends playing on another platform, then that squad will be matched against a multi-platform population, essentially making cross-platform play opt-in. Are you hyped for Fortnite? We'll be sure to let you know when the game launches for Android. Until then, you can create your Epic Games account and start playing on one of the other platforms to start getting a handle on the game","The hottest game of 2018 will be coming to Android in the coming months.

GENE PALUMBO and AZAM AHMED,"“It’s going to be chaos,” said Bertila Parada, whose son built a life and a family in the United States since immigrating there after the earthquakes under the so-called Temporary Protection Status granted by the United States. “He gave them 19 years of work, and how do they repay him? They tell him, ‘Get out of here.’” Mrs. Parada, speaking in San Salvador, said the country was “in no condition” to take back the 200,000 Salvadorans by the September 2019 deadline. “When they return to the places where they were born, they’ll be unknowns,” she predicted. “They’ve been away for 20 years.” Photo Luis Alberto López, whose brother was kidnapped and vanished while trying to reach the United States in 2001, is the director of the Salvadoran Committee of Relatives of Killed or Disappeared Migrants. Credit Fred Ramos for The New York Times Ángel Hernández, 26, worries that an influx of returning Salvadorans will worsen the unemployment rate, which is about 7 percent. “The lack of jobs currently in El Salvador will be even more critical when all those people come looking for work,” he said. The impact of migrants is felt throughout society, especially in the economy, which is heavily dependent on the diaspora. In 2016, El Salvador received $4.6 billion from abroad, mostly from the United States. “There are fathers who went up and left their children behind, and send back money for their education,” said Luis Alberto López, 37, director of Cofamide, or the Salvadoran Committee of Relatives of Killed or Disappeared Migrants, a nonprofit that works with Salvadorans whose relatives have vanished while trying to reach the United States. The influx of returning Salvadorans would saturate an already dismal job market. But there is danger, too, for those returning. “People think, ‘anyone who comes back from the U.S. has money,’ so they’ll be extorted,” Mr. López said. “If they try to start a small business,” they will be asked for additional extortion payments. He added: “The children who return will suffer cultural shock. Their parents can try to tell them what it will be like here, but it’s one thing to hear about it, and another to actually live it. And even their parents will feel like strangers.” Mr. López lost a brother who was kidnapped and vanished while trying to reach the United States in 2001. He fears that Salvadorans who return “will find it so hard here that they’ll try to get back to the U.S.,” and will meet the same fate. Anita Zelaya, 60, the secretary general of Cofamide, still mourns for a son who disappeared in Mexico in 2002 while trying to enter the United States. She said the Trump administration’s decision had spread fear among Salvadorans in the United States. Photo Shops in San Salvador. If Salvadorans in the United States return en masse, the influx could saturate an already dismal job market. Credit Fred Ramos for The New York Times “Some kids are saying, ‘Will my mom go? Will we be separated?’” she said. “How will the kids manage if they’re left behind? It’s going to generate even more psychological problems.” She added: “I’m afraid there might be a hurricane of violence. It leaves me feeling anguished.” Nonprofit organizations, community groups and scholars have denounced the Trump administration’s decision, calling it cruel and inhumane. Many view the change in policy as a lose-lose, inflicting damage on American businesses, depriving it of labor, while devastating the families the policy was meant to protect. “This policy does something rare: It has a negative impact for everyone concerned,” said Charles T. Call, an associate professor of international peace and conflict resolution at American University. “It will harm the U.S. economy,” he added, “by taking away hard-working immigrants who are incarcerated at 44 percent lower rates than native-born Americans. It will have a sad impact on El Salvador’s economy, as 200,000 people, some of whom don’t speak Spanish, will be seeking nonexistent jobs.” “Young returnees will be fodder for El Salvador’s powerful and deadly criminal gangs,” he said. “And the decision tears apart families, most of whom would be model citizens.” The nation that these Salvadorans will be returning to is far deadlier than the one they left. In the capital, the streets have been converted into urban killing fields that, as recently as 2015, registered a homicide every hour during moments of peak violence. The government itself has also become an agent of violence. Police officers are granted an open license to go after the gangs under the government’s iron-fist policy, sometimes sweeping up innocent people. “With more than 60 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2017, El Salvador has one of the highest murder rates in the world,” said Héctor Lindo-Fuentes, a Salvadoran historian at Fordham University in New York. “This extraordinary violence has a significant made-in-the-U.S. component.” Photo Anita Zelaya, whose son disappeared in Mexico while trying to reach the United States in 2002, is the secretary general of the Salvadoran Committee of Relatives of Killed or Disappeared Migrants. Credit Fred Ramos for The New York Times The violence that today gnaws at the fabric of El Salvador has its origins in the United States. During the country’s civil war, from 1980 to 1992, an American-backed military government waged a scorched-earth campaign against leftist guerrillas. The conflict claimed 75,000 lives. “First, they motivated us in the war with millions of dollars, but as soon as it ended, they abandoned us,” said José Guardado, 47, an artisan in San Salvador. “There were very few reinsertion programs for the ex-combatants.” He added of the Trump administration’s decision, “It’s like yet another slap in the face.” Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled the violence, and many wound up in Los Angeles, which was in the throes of its own crisis battling street gangs. The children of these refugees, consigned to impoverished areas patrolled by other gangs, came together to form other gangs. In the ’90s and still today, United States authorities rounded up these gang members and deported them back to El Salvador. From there, the new seeds of gang culture, imported from the United States, grew into the vicious networks that operate with impunity throughout El Salvador. “The U.S. has such a deep impact on El Salvador for its own foreign policy needs that it bears significant responsibility, not only for the flow of migrants out of El Salvador into the U.S., but also for the current conditions of violence that exist there,” said Erik Ching, a history professor at Furman University in South Carolina. El Salvador has been struggling beneath the weight of these deportees and the turbulent dynamic they brought with them. Prisons are overflowing and have become cesspools of disease and overcrowding. On the outside, joblessness and violence are the broken realities of life. The potential for 200,000 others to return will only exacerbate those problems. And in the meantime, the exodus continues: More than 250 Salvadorans leave the country each day, said Mr. López of Cofamide. Citing survey and medical data released last year that was gathered by its teams working with Salvadoran migrants traveling through Mexico, Doctors Without Borders said 55 percent of Salvadoran refugees and migrants reported being victims of blackmail or extortion. Another 56 percent had a relative lost to violence, and 67 percent said they never felt safe at home. The Border Patrol apprehended more than 27,000 families in the year ending in September 2016, and an additional 17,500 children made the trip alone. And those figures were down from recent years. “Thousands of families will be divided, and those who stay in the U.S. will be desperately worried about the safety of their relatives going back to a poor, unprepared country where their physical safety will be threatened every single day,” said Mr. Lindo-Fuentes of Fordham.

Greg Abbott signed a bill allowing guns on campus and my students were anxious. What if a fellow student threatened them with a gun in the busy parking lot where they vied for too few spaces every morning? What about the roommate who became depressed and withdrawn during finals week — what if he could bring a gun onto campus? We talked about the new campus carry law at the beginning of each class until I worried we would fall behind and steered the conversation back to the day's lecture. But I was anxious, too. I watched a video that said it would prepare me to deal with an active shooter in my classroom. It suggested I throw whatever was in my hands at the gunman. On most days, that was a half-empty bottle of water and a whiteboard marker. PARKLAND, FL - FEBRUARY 14: People are brought out of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school that reportedly killed and injured multiple people on February 14, 2018 in Parkland, Florida. Numerous law enforcement officials continue to investigate the scene. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Nearly a dozen states allow guns on university campuses and at least a dozen more are considering passing legislation to allow campus carry. Mass shootings are becoming deadlier and research on gun violence is limited. Before I was a journalist who covered mass shootings (and a university professor who feared them), I was a public health doctor at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many believe the CDC is banned from studying guns — but that's not exactly true. The CDC studied gun violence from the mid-80s to the mid-90s until a 1993 study it funded angered the National Rifle Association so much that it lobbied Congress to shut down the CDC division that researched gun violence. The study showed that keeping a gun in the home was associated with a higher risk of being killed by a relative or close acquaintance. Three years later, Rep. Jay Dickey, a lifetime member of the NRA and a Republican from Arkansas, added an amendment to the bill that funds the CDC that said ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control"" could be used to study or promote gun control. That same year, Congress stripped the CDC of $2.6 million — exactly the amount the agency had spent studying gun violence the previous year. The message was clear: Study gun violence and risk your career and your agency's funding. CDC researchers who used to study gun violence told me they stayed well clear of guns for fear of jeopardizing their livelihoods. I was stationed in Arizona for the two years I worked at the CDC. In Phoenix, Friday night was ladies' night at the gun range. I would gather my friends and we would empty Berettas and Glocks into zombie-shaped targets before carefully wiping our hands and faces (ammunition contains lead, which is a health hazard) and heading to the local taco joint. I took up shooting when I was a medical student in England and discovered the cool, dark refuge of the gun range. We lay on our bellies with.22 rifles pressed to our shoulders; nothing else could take my mind off anatomy exams in the same way. But that doesn't mean I want guns in my classroom. I can love guns and still want a ban on assault rifles and magazines that fire more than 10 rounds. I can love guns and still want the CDC to study what triggers mass shootings, how we can end gun violence and how we can keep children safe in school. My former colleagues at the CDC felt helpless when it came to gun violence. I felt the same way in my classroom at the University of Texas at Dallas, weighing a bottle of water in one hand and a whiteboard marker in the other, wondering which would be the better missile against a gunman.

Dominic Tarason,"Mummies! They’re like zombies, but easier to clean up once you’re finished with them, at least according to Strange Brigade ‘s new gameplay trailer. The cooperative 1930s-set shooter isn’t far off now – due out at the end of August – but Rebellion have apparently got one last PR blitz in them before E3 swallows all and everything blurs into one nightmare gaming haze. Within, a very pulp serial trailer, featuring one of the most cheerfully bombastic narrators around. I got to play a brief chunk of Strange Brigade at Rezzed previously, and while I didn’t have the chance to play the whole demo due to needing to catch the literal last train home, I did enjoy my brief time with it. It feels like a logical expansion of the formula Rebellion started with their Zombie Army Trilogy games (themselves a spinoff from Sniper Elite 3 ), with its familiar mix of slow moving swarms of undead punctuated with faster or more powerful enemies with more supernatural attacks. Strange Brigade is bringing a few tricks of its own to the table, including puzzles used to protect valuable bonus treasures. While some can be solved at a glance, some require team coordination, like ancient combination-locks that require one player to relay the answer to the person spinning the tumblers. Each character also has access to supernatural smartbomb-like powers, and the map is littered with traps that are far deadlier to slow-moving undead than agile and wary adventurers. It’s good solid fun, although I worry that won’t be enough to stand out from the E3 crowd. If you’re looking to hire the Strange Brigade, maybe you can find them on Steam and Humble. They don’t work cheap, though, with the regular edition of the game priced at £40/$50, and a fancy edition with extra guns and a season pass will set you back £65/$80.

CBSDenver,"(CBS4) – You would think that now that we’ve hit March, we should be winding down, and off the hook for flu.(credit: CBS)
Ah, maybe we all ought to think again on that one.
The CDC says the milder strain of influenza that had been nailing people from just after Thanksgiving through early February is now being replaced by a stronger, nastier strain. It’s one that makes people a lot sicker than the previous circulating bug.
The report from the CDC came out within the past few days, but I think those of us who work in emergency rooms, clinics, or offices have noticed something a little unusual over since mid-February. That is, people who were down for the count with fever, chills, coughing… and just a general position of being laid out on the stretcher or exam table when we went into examine them. Sicker than what we were used to.
And these folks were generally lighting up with a positive Influenza A test.
Now here’s where I’m going with this one— the earlier germ was an Influenza A strain—an H1N1.
And so is this new guy. It’s an “A” and is classified as an H3N2.
The problem is our general testing can’t tell the difference between the two. It can usually only say it’s an “A” or a flu “B”. Yet our patients were toxically sicker, many with pneumonia or dehydration, as well as a sky-high fever that just wouldn’t quit. We are talking easily 103-104 readings here.
The number of people who can’t crawl out of bed has jumped, as has the number of people we have admitted to the hospital. And the story of “onset” is universal: “I was feeling okay one minute, and then like I got hit by a truck the next”.
The main complications: pneumonia, out-of-control diabetes, uncontrolled asthma, heart attacks, and stroke (from the tremendous strain these diseases put on the body).
Now, things get worse.
This year’s flu season, which we were hoping would be mild and be drawing to a close early is now a shown a new, ugly face. It’s worse, and it’s going to be here for a while. The CDC is estimating we will now be dealing with this one until May. And at highest risk are young kids, even though all age groups are susceptible.
In fact, anyone born after 2001 has little or now immunity to this strain or variants of it.
Now the good news: IT’S NOT TOO LATE FOR A FLU SHOT!
Even if the vaccine is not 100% effective at prevention, it will lessen the severity and length of illness.
The people I’ve seen with this new strain who have been immunized are less sick as a general rule.
So be on the lookout. Take care of yourself. Get your rest. Eat well. Don’t booze it up. And get vaccinated if you haven’t rolled up your sleeve yet this season. Please take care, and remember it’s not too late.

We Are The Mighty,"When looking at Iran's 65th Airborne Special Force Brigade, you might notice a few striking similarities — the yellow enlisted chevrons seem a lot like the the yellow chevrons on old Army greens, for example. Before the Iranian Revolution, their unit insignia looked a lot like the De Oppresso Liber crest that signifies the United States Army Special Forces. The distinctive green beret worn by the Iranians may not be the same shade of green worn by today's US Army Special Forces, but Iranian special operators wear green for a reason — they were trained by Americans. In the 1960s, the United States sent four operational detachments of Army Special Forces operators to Iran to train the Shah's Imperial military forces. The Mobile Training Teams spent two years as Military Assistance Advisory Group Iran. Before they could even get to Iran, the soldiers had to pass the Special Forces Officer course at Fort Bragg, then learn Farsi at the Monterey, Calif. Defense Language Institute. Only then would they be shipped to Iran to train Iranian Special Forces. It's been a long time since the 65th was a part of the Imperial Iranian Special Forces. Now called 65th NOHED Brigade (which is just a Farsi acronym for ""airborne special forces""), the unit's mission is very similar to the ones the US Special Forces trained them for in the 1960s. They perform hostage rescue, psychological operations, irregular warfare, and train for counter-terrorism missions both in and outside of the Islamic Republic. Inside the Iranian military, the unit is known as the "" powerful ghosts."" The nickname stems from a mission given to the 65th in the mid-1990s. They were tasked to take buildings around Tehran from the regular military - and were able to do it in under two hours. Since their initial standup with US Special Forces, Iran's 65th Airborne Special Force Brigade survived the 1979 Iranian Revolution, then they survived the brutal Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and now advise the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as they fight for the Iran-dominated Assad regime in Syria against a fractured rebellion. The legacy of the harsh but thorough training with American Green Berets continues in Iran. The current training includes endurance and survival in desert, jungle, and mountain warfare, among other schools, like parachute and freefall training, just like their erstwhile American allies taught so long ago.","Morteza Nikoubazl/Reuters The distinctive green beret worn by Iranian special forces looks strikingly similar to the ones used by US Special forces.

Al Jazeera,"More than 1,600 people have died or gone missing while attempting to reach Europe so far this year, UNCHR's new Desperate Journeys report shows. The report released on Monday reveals that while the number of crossings has fallen, the deaths have risen, making the voyage more deadly in percentage terms for those who venture across. According to the report, people smugglers are taking greaters risks in the journey due to increased surveillance. A total of 2,276 people died last year while trying to cross, this represented one death for every 42 arrivals. This year, it is 1,095 deaths, or one out of every 18 arrivals. In June alone, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals. About 500 people have gone missing. ""This report once again confirms the Mediterranean as one of the world's deadliest sea crossings,"" said UNHCR's Director of the Bureau for Europe, Pascale Moreau. ""With the number of people arriving on European shores falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives,"" she added. People travelling to Europe continue to do so for different reasons. Some continue to flee armed conflict and human rights violations, while others seek international protection on account of religious, ethnic or political persecution or to escape different forms of sexual or gender-based violence, the report revealed. On the Central Mediterranean route so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died - most after departing from Libya. ""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coast guards,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean. Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, UNHCR said. ""This is not new, we have highlighted this for a while now,"" Maria Jesus Vega a spokesperson from UNCHR in Spain told Al Jazeera. ""We need a regional response, this not an exclusive problem from those countries that are in the outer border, such as Italy, Greece or Spain."" And while people risk their lives in the journey, this is not the only time they are at risk. ""People aiming to reach to Europe risk their lives multiple times,"" Vega said. ""They risk their lives when they try to flee conflict in their countries, when they need to cross the borders with no authorisation, and when they fall in the hands of traffickers and mafias that promise to take them,"" she explained. Libyan authorities intercepted or rescued 18,400 people between August last year and July this year - a 38-percent increase from the same period of 2016 and 2017. Arrivals by sea from Libya to Europe plummeted 82 percent in those comparable periods, to 30,800 in the more recent one. UNHCR says a growing worry these days is deaths on land by people trying to get to Libya in the first place, or getting stuck in squalid, overcrowded detention centres. Many are returned there after failing to cross by sea to Europe. The problems after disembarkation (is that) those people are sent back to detention centres, and many disappear,"" Cochetel said. ""Many are sold to militias, and to traffickers, and people employing them without paying them."" He said the drop in departures means that traffickers attempt to ""monetise their investment, which means they have to exploit more people."" ""That results in more cases of slavery, forced labour, prostitution of those people - because they (smugglers) want to make money off those people."" And while this route is deadly, this is not the only one that raises a red alert. ""The route of Morocco or Algeria to Spain has also shown an increase in the death rate,"" Vega said. ""So far this year we have a total of 300 people dead."" ""In the same period last year, we had a total of 200 deaths, this is very worrisome, and a lot of this has to do with the mafias that are operating the route, they are taking greater risks every day,"" she added. Spain is the third busiest point of arrival for all refugees and migrants entering Europe by sea, behind Italy and Greece, accounting for 23 percent of all such arrivals to the EU.","For every 18 arrivals this year, one has died while trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe, UN data shows.",2018-09-03T10:44:52Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Mediterranean refugee numbers drop but crossing is deadlier: UN,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/mediterranean-refugee-numbers-drop-crossing-deadlier-180903075656124.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/9/3/04f2623cb99a456b91aecbcc096f88da_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,deadlier,1
Sara Stewart,"Sara Stewart is a film writer at the New York Post who divides her time between the city and western Pennsylvania, where her husband is a professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) I am a 45-year-old woman who's always been in fairly good health. I practice yoga, run nine miles a week, love kale, avoid red meat, generally get enough sleep and don't smoke cigarettes. I also have stage 3 colon cancer -- I was diagnosed a mere two months after the government's colonoscopy screening age recommendation was lowered from 50 to 45. I was surprised as anyone to find myself among the alarming recent rise in patients under 50 being diagnosed with colon cancer. I got this diagnosis in western Pennsylvania, one of the epicenters of the opioid crisis raging in this country. The state ranks fourth-highest in the nation for drug overdose deaths (with two-thirds of the nationwide toll from prescription opioids fentanyl and oxycontin and from heroin). A new study from the University of Pittsburgh also finds this state to be the highest in the nation in unreported opioid deaths, meaning the statistics may be even higher than previously thought. Fighting an epidemic on this scale is, obviously, incredibly important. But it is also creating a terrifying new reality for patients facing painful medical procedures. When I woke up from laparoscopic surgery at Monroeville, Pennsylvania's Forbes Hospital to remove 6 inches of my colon and a pingpong ball-size tumor from my body, I entered into a medical system so frightened of the specter of addiction (and, I imagine, potential ensuing lawsuits) that treating what I know to be my legitimate pain during recovery became a distant afterthought. Germophobe that I am, I walked into the hospital aspiring to leave the place as soon as humanly possible. When I asked nurses to take my catheter out after two days -- it was uncomfortable and complicated the multiple daily walks the surgeon had recommended -- they immediately also took away the dilaudid pain pump and saline IV I'd been administered post-surgery and put me on a low, 5 milligram-dose of the opioid Percocet instead. I soon found myself sobbing in bed, unable to walk and clutching my husband's hand, the pills not nearly strong enough to counter the crippling pain in my abdomen. The hospital released me two days later with half the dosage of Percocet my nurse told me -- quietly, when no doctors were around -- was reasonable to treat a colon resection. I got into an argument (embarrassingly involving more tears, thanks to the pain) with the hospital doctor who wrote me the prescription. He shrugged and said they were pretty sure I wouldn't abuse the drugs but couldn't be totally sure. He was -- in the most insulting way possible -- enforcing the new anti-opioid mandate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: On March 15, 2016, the CDC introduced new limiting guidelines on the prescribing of opioids, designed to target primary care physicians who gave them out too carelessly and for too long to patients with chronic pain (defined as ""pain lasting longer than three months or past the time of normal tissue healing""). The ensuing media hype around the guidelines, though, has turned ""opioid"" into a dirty word no matter what its context. The guidelines do not include active cancer treatment, but what they meant for me, as someone who had been treated not (yet) by an oncologist but a surgeon, was this: I spent the next two weeks curled in a fetal position on my couch at home, my endlessly patient husband taking care of everything from keeping up our house to trying to get me to eat to responding constantly to emails, texts and calls from my anxious friends and family. When my husband and I asked -- no, let's be honest, begged -- the doctor's office to refill my prescription, I was subjected to multiple interrogations by nurses at the surgeon's office about my pain level. In the language of pain management, it's all about the number on a scale from 1 to 10, which no one bothered to clarify to me beyond the illustrations on a chart displayed in the doctor's office of a face going from happy to miserable. It hardly seemed like enough of a precise diagnosis for what I was feeling. They reluctantly agreed to give me 15 more pills, which amounted to a few more days of treatment, running counter to their prediction that I would need two to six weeks of recovery time at home. I know all about the dangers of opioids; it's hard to miss hearing about them in this part of the world. We have seen opioid addicts stumbling around our small town like the walking dead. We have heard the warnings about the rash of deaths from overdoses, about the way opioid addiction can lead people to turn to cheaper and deadlier heroin. As for me, I took the pills they gave me only when needed -- and can't wait for the day I can get back to being able to walk more than a couple of blocks at a time. I am desperate to return to my job as a journalist. But to do so, I need my post-surgical pain to be treated adequately. When I'm seriously hurting, I cannot walk or eat, two of the main building blocks for recovery. I'm not an addict; I'm a cancer patient. And I am shell-shocked from my experience with the current state of medical pain management thus far. (I have since begun chemotherapy, which will entail longer-term treatment but with less outright pain.) A couple of Advil or Tylenol is not enough to treat post-abdominal surgery pain in the first weeks afterward despite what my doctor's office blithely told me. When I met with my surgeon and his team for my two-week follow-up, I repeatedly mentioned I had been in a lot of pain and that over-the-counter medication was not helping. No one did anything other than shrug and move on to the next subject. (There is, relatedly, a mounting public outcry about women being systematically under-treated for pain and/or written off as neurotic hypochondriacs, but that is a rant for another time.) Eventually, I was advised by an oncology therapist that I ought to contact a pain management clinic immediately. I did, and within two days had a prescription for the less-addictive painkiller Tramadol as well as a couple of other non-opioid meds. I think it bears asking why nobody at my surgeon's office told me about the existence of pain management clinics, or Tramadol. I am nothing if not tenacious (thanks, journalism background) -- and am lucky enough to have a wide network of well-connected friends who doggedly help me find what I need, treatment-wise. What about everyone out there who doesn't have these advantages? What are they going through, if they don't know the right questions to ask? I am getting off relatively easy, with a prognosis that should have me up and around within months; it's patients who struggle with chronic and lifelong pain who are suffering the most. ""Chronic pain patients and the groups that represent them say the escalating government response to opioid addiction ignores their need for the painkillers and doctors who will prescribe them, leaving some out of work, bedridden and even suicidal,"" USA Today reported in a recent story. Out here, and I imagine in many other places around the country, the new treatment mantra for the gravely ill seems to be ""Suck it up and put an ice pack on it."" One editorial in an Allentown, Pennsylvania, newspaper quoted Dr. John Gallagher, chair of the Pennsylvania Medical Society's opioid task force, as icily saying that ""any decrease in prescribing is to be celebrated."" Regardless of the huge potential for needless suffering, the CDC continues to demonize opioid prescription across the board. As one addiction psychiatrist put it in Politico, ""The myth (is) that the epidemic is driven by patients becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed opioids, or painkillers like hydrocodone (e.g., Vicodin) and oxycodone (e.g., Percocet),"" when in reality, the problem is that ""as more prescribed pills are diverted, opportunities arise for nonpatients to obtain them, abuse them, get addicted to them and die."" The psychiatrist pointed out that, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, ""among people who misused prescription pain relievers in 2013 and 2014, about half said that they obtained those pain relievers from a friend or relative, while only 22 percent said they received the drugs from their doctor."" As of right now, there's no end in sight to the current backlash against the humane treatment of pain that exceeds the reach of aspirin or Advil. So please, I urge everyone in your 40s and over, get a preventative colonoscopy. There's never been a good time to get colon cancer, but now might be one of the bleakest.","I am a 45-year-old woman who's always been in fairly good health.

Aubrey Whelan,"Even as health officials around the country struggle to get a handle on an opioid overdose crisis that caused a record-breaking number of deaths last year, doctors and researchers are sounding the alarm on another class of drugs that they say are prescribed far too often -- and which themselves are behind an increasing number of overdoses. Prescriptions for benzodiazepines -- which include the common anti-anxiety drugs Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin -- have skyrocketed over the last 15 years, following the same kind of trend lines that opioid prescribing did before doctors and insurance companies began to seriously curb pain-pill prescriptions. Doctors have long warned about the potential addictive properties of benzos"" -- but an explosion of benzodiazepine prescriptions in the middle of an opioid crisis is particularly concerning. Thats because both drugs become much deadlier when mixed with each other. In 2014, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 30 percent of opioid overdoses also involved benzodiazepines. And since 2012, the vast majority of overdose deaths associated with benzodiazepines in Philadelphia have also involved opioids. The combination was behind more than a third of the citys fatal overdoses last year. Theyre two drugs that are sedating and slow down your central nervous system, said Abigail Kay, a psychiatrist, associate dean at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College, and former medical director of Jefferson Hospitals Narcotic Addiction Rehabilitation Program. If you combine them, they become stronger and more dangerous. Rick Pescatore, director of clinical research in Crozer Keystone Health Systems department of emergency medicine, often sees overdose patients who revive only after multiple doses of Narcan, the overdose-reversing drug. Theres this supposition that its extremely powerful opioids, when more often, its co-ingestion with benzos, he said. A June study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Medicare Part D beneficiaries prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids at the same time were five times more likely to overdose in the three months after they began to use the drugs together, compared with people who used only opioids. And, Kay said, even in a time when doctors have been heavily pressured to stop prescribing opioid pain pills, shes often shocked at how willing her colleagues are to prescribe benzodiazepines. It amazes me how many doctors hand it out like candy, she said. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults who filled a benzodiazepine prescription increased by 67 percent, according to a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2017 study in the British Medical Journal that looked at more than 300,000 Americans with private insurance found that the number of people who were prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines at the same time increased by 80 percent between 2001 and 2013. A Bucks County woman named Jean, whos been using heroin on and off for the last several years and who did not want to give her last name because of concerns about her privacy, said she saw a psychiatrist for anxiety five years ago who prescribed her Klonopin on her second visit. She didnt tell her doctor she was using opioids at the time, she said, but it was immediately clear how powerful the two drugs were when used in combination. I was way more tired and out of it. I would trip down the stairs. I would fall asleep at work, she said. I would go through my prescription in less than a week, and then I would start buying on the street. Eventually, her parents told her doctor she was using heroin, and her prescription was cut off. Even for patients in opioid recovery, benzodiazepines can serve as another temptation. Many of Kays patients on methadone or other opioid-based medication-assisted treatment also test positive for benzodiazepines, sometimes prescribed by another doctor, or purchased on the street. Prescription-drug monitoring programs can help curb the former, Kay said, but the problem persists. Yaya Lifford, 24, of Baltimore, said he started using opioid pain pills at 16, and quickly realized that a Xanax pill would enhance the high. And then I wouldnt do a Percocet until I ate a Xanax, he said. That was his routine until one day eight months ago. His addiction had led him to the streets of Kensington, where he purchased a bag of what he now believes was heroin laced with fentanyl, the powerful synthetic opioid behind most of Philadelphias overdose deaths. I died -- my heart stopped. I was three, four Xanaxes in, and then Im waking up strapped to a chair. They were like, We had to bring you back to life, Lifford said. That was when I knew it wasnt a joke. A few months later, Lifford went to in-patient rehab and began a methadone maintenance program. The drug curbed his craving for opioids, but he found himself unable to stop thinking about Xanax, and the high he might feel if he took it with methadone. There were four people in rehab with me trying to get off methadone and benzos,"" he said. It was another addiction in itself. Experts are careful to note the benefits of both opioid pain pills and benzodiazepines for some patients. Benzos are effective medications when you use them in combination with small procedures, or if you need to treat someone who is acutely agitated, and you can use them in the short term for anxiety, said Jaakko Lappalainen, chief of addiction psychiatry at Crozer. Kay prefers to treat anxiety with anti-depressants -- which dont have the immediate calming effect of benzodiazepines, but are safer to use for longer periods of time. Benzodiazepine withdrawal, Lappalainen said, can be particularly dangerous -- similar to withdrawal from heavy alcohol use. Mild withdrawal symptoms include restlessness and anxiety, muscle shaking and jerks; severe withdrawal can induce seizures, which can be fatal. Lappalainen said people trying to reduce their benzodiazepine use are usually tapered off the medication over a longer period of time or recommended to an in-patient detox because quitting cold-turkey can be so dangerous. Still, Pescatore said, its no surprise that benzos have become so popular, and so prevalent. These are anxious times, and patients who turn to benzodiazepines or opioids are often trying to escape larger underlying problems -- chronic pain, trauma, economic distress and persistent health problems. But, he said, doctors cant repeat the mistakes of the opioid crisis.","Experts say an explosion of benzodiazepine prescriptions in the middle of an opioid crisis is particularly concerning, because both drugs become much deadlier when mixed with each other.",2018-12-11T01:34:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Philly.com'}","Prescriptions, overdoses skyrocketing for anti-anxiety drugs...",http://www2.philly.com/health/benzodiazepines-addiction-philadelphia-opioid-crisis-20181210.html,http://www2.philly.com/resizer/0Q2feTy0IflLhdII3Qj2qFR-nqA=/1200x0/center/middle/www2.philly.com/resizer/oF3gFDCLoyscsCax6ulM3REmgbE=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C2WPL63CMFA33EO3WJD2DKHQBI.jpg,,Philly.com,deadlier,1

Heather Alexandra,"The enemies in Echo copy any action that you perform until they’re highly dangerous walking death machines. Level design and smart enemy placement turn Echo ’s stealth gameplay into something really special. I take a look in this critical video. Echo is a stealth puzzle game where enemies learn new abilities based on what the player does. Echo raises and lowers its difficulty by forcing the player to carry out different actions depending on level design and enemy placement. Ramping up the complexity of scenarios, either by adding more enemies or objectives, helps the designers modulate how hard or easy the game becomes. Echo tells the story on En, a young girl on the run from the dangerous cult who raised her while on a quest to revive her mentor. To accomplish this she must brave the Palace, a massive planet-wide structure of traps. The Palace is populated by creatures En calls ‘echoes,’ strange copies of her that are shaped out of a black muck at the start of the game. Whatever En does while the Palace’s lights are on, from eating fruit to opening doors, the echoes learn how to do as well once. There is a period of darkness between light cycles in which En can perform actions without the echoes copying her. It’s a fun mechanic that the designers play with in numerous ways. One of the first encounters with the echoes involves two rooms filled with water. In the first room, the echoes are on the other side of water while the player crosses a pathway. The echoes can’t reach the player because they don’t know how to cross water. In the second room, the player is forced to cross water on their way across. When they return through the room, the echoes have learned to walk in the water. Guiding the player to use certain hazards or perform key actions is one of the main techniques the game uses to increase difficulty. By forcing the player to cross water or use elevators, the game can create rooms where the echoes will always have certain abilities. This removes any potential crutches the player might have relied on, such as waiting until it’s dark to use an elevator. Echo ’s level design also tempts the player into performing certain actions. Avoiding the echoes by crossing water or leaping over a small wall can keep you out of their path temporarily but will cause trouble later on. There’s another twist though: if you stop performing actions the echoes have learned, they will eventually forget how to do those things after the light cycle resets their memory. Actions become a cost/benefit analysis in which the player must decide if they want to use multiple actions to make things easier now or if they want to take a risk at besting the echoes with minimal actions so they can save them for later. In a late game corridor, for instance, a stretch of stairs leads right to where you need to go, but there are multiple echoes in your path. You can avoid them by opening a door and moving to a side hallway. The player has to choose if they want to risk the enemy-filled hallway or avoid the echoes but teach them how to open doors. They can undo this action by waiting through the light cycles until the echoes forget how to use doors, but remaining still is made difficult by patrolling enemies. Echo adjusts certain variables to encourage this kind of decision making. The simplest way the game does this is by increasing how many things the player must deal with at any given time. You can have a room with three echoes or a room more than a dozen. Some doors will only open if the player collects a certain amount of orbs from around the room. This often means increasing the size of the room as well. The larger space and high number of orbs requires the player to spend more time avoiding echoes and means they have to weigh more actions and their consequences. Funneling the player towards enemies is another tactic the game uses to adjust its difficulty. Small walkways encourage players to sprint or use their gun, useful abilities that the player won’t want the echoes to learn. Orbs can be blocked by enemies that are most easily avoided by performing certain actions like climbing or walking through water. In some instances, there may be less enemies, but there are also fewer options for dealing with them without teaching them new abilities. By adjusting the size of rooms and changing the number of enemies, Echo creates scenarios of varying complexity. Limiting the potential actions a player can take or forcing them to use certain actions to proceed lets the designers make more difficult encounters. In the best cases, players have to carefully decide what actions they will use and whether or not they risk creating deadlier echoes. Little tweaks, like narrowing walkways or adding one extra puddle of water, have drastic repercussions that test the player and keep the game exciting.",The enemies in Echo copy any action that you perform until they’re highly dangerous walking death machines.

"USA TODAY, Jim Michaels, USA TODAY","Army Capt. Joshua Redmond at Fort Belvoir, Va., demonstrates new night vision goggles that allow soldiers to see through smoke, fog and foliage, on May 4, 2018. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) FORT BELVOIR, Va. — The Army has figured out how to lift the fog of war, or at least see through it. Soldiers are on the verge of receiving futuristic devices that replace night vision goggles and allow soldiers to shoot around corners, see through dense vegetation and smoke, plus distinguish friend from foe. “It is no longer just a night vision device,” said Army Col. Christopher Schneider, the project manager for the system that can be worn night and day. “The enemy can’t see we’re targeting him until we pull the trigger.” The groundbreaking goggles are part of a sweeping modernization program to keep the Army ahead of potential rivals, such as China and Russia, which are rushing to revamp their own forces and close the military lead held by the United States for decades. While the United States was deeply committed to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq for the past 17 years, China, Russia and other nations took careful note of American military capabilities. “Our adversaries have been studying our strengths and our vulnerabilities and are developing capabilities to exploit those vulnerabilities,” Gen. Mark Milley, the Army’s chief of staff, warned in a speech last year. “They’ve steadily eroded our competitive advantage and are rapidly closing the capability gap that we have long enjoyed.” With U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down, the Army has embarked on its largest modernization programs since the Vietnam War nearly five decades ago to overhaul its weapons, training and tactics. The post-Vietnam revamping transformed a large draft Army with discipline and other problems into a smaller all-volunteer fighting force equipped with modern weapons and better trained troops. The problems are not as desperate now, but officials are worried about the progress that Russia and China have made. Technological breakthroughs are cheaper and happen faster than decades ago when America could count on its advantages in industry and technology to power the military. “We still maintain overmatch, but they are closing the gap,” Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy said in a recent interview. The Army is setting up a Futures Command headquarters to be based in a city with links to academia and industry. The Army wants a place that “will help us think differently and get more people from the country to help us solve problems,” McCarthy said. A thermal sight on an M4 service rifle is connected wirelessly to the new night vision goggles attached to a soldier's helmet. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) The Army also plans to replace the current M4 service rife and to extend infantry basic training to 22 weeks from 14, adding more marksmanship, physical fitness, land navigation and other war-fighting skills. It is also revamping artillery, vehicles and other equipment, but some of the most dramatic breakthroughs are to make individual soldiers and squads deadlier. Commanders say that’s necessary because American ground forces can no longer fight as in the past, when they gathered overwhelming combat power before an invasion. During the Persian Gulf War in 1990-91 and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, American forces assembled large numbers of troops before invading and overwhelming the enemy. The U.S. military won’t get that opportunity next time. Russia and China have developed long-range weapons, such as artillery and rockets, to prevent the U.S. military from massing large combat formations. More: Physically fit recruits for Army are hard to find. Especially in these states More: Army lags slightly on recruiting goal as search for quality trumps quantity The Army expects to fight in smaller sized units, so they need to be deadlier than in the past. In World War II, less than 25% of infantrymen fired their weapons in battle, according to a famed study by military historian S.L.A. Marshall. Now every bullet needs to count. “We’re saying what you shoot, you hit on the first time you shoot it,” said Army Brig. Gen. Christopher Donahue, commandant of the infantry school at Fort Benning, Ga. “There’s no military in the world that has ever done that.” Mike Moore, a range manager at Fort Belvoir, Va., demonstrates the latest night vision goggles in a special indoor range where soldiers can use a smoke machine to obscure targets. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) One of the crown jewels of the modernization efforts are the new goggles that use thermal technology to see through smoke and darkness. They also utilize augmented reality to feed each soldier real-time information on a heads-up display. The Army demonstrated the device in a special indoor range at Fort Belvoir outside Washington, D.C., where officials can obscure targets using a smoke machine or darken the range to simulate combat conditions. Monitors show what the soldier sees through the goggles, Targets that can'be be seen with the naked eye suddenly appear on the screen. Unlike the current night-vision goggles, a monocle-like device that shows a fuzzy green picture at night, the new goggles are designed like binoculars and are wirelessly linked to the sight on a soldier’s weapon. These googles identify heat sources through thermal technology, revealing the shapes of enemy fighters hiding in foliage or obscured by smoke. Current night-vision goggles operate by expanding ambient light from the stars or moon so soldiers can see shapes at night. A soldier with the new googles can be hiding behind a concrete wall or barrier and still fire a rifle around a corner or above his or her head because of the wireless link on the sight of the weapon. A soldier can still see where the rifle is pointed, even if not looking down the barrel. That ability will be especially useful in densely populated cities where officers expect to fight the next war. “We won’t be able to avoid the dense urban terrain or the megacities in the future,” said Maj. Gen. Maria Gervais, deputy commanding general of the Army's combined arms center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. The device, which has an initial cost of about $23,000, is tied to a network through smartphones issued to soldiers that allow them to see enemy positions and other intelligence. The heads-up display also includes navigation information, such as compass headings and patrol routes. “We’re seeing the time it takes to hit a target decrease both day and night significantly,” Donahue said. “Their lethality is through the roof.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rwBDxx","Soldiers are on the verge of receiving futuristic devices that replace night vision goggles and allow soldiers to shoot around corners, see through dense vegetation and smoke, plus distinguish friend from foe.

AP,"By: AP | Washington | Published: September 16, 2018 8:28:49 am A member of the US Coast Guard walks down Mill Creek Road checking houses after tropical storm Florence hit Newport N.C (AP) Nature expresses its fury in sundry ways. Two deadly storms _ Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut _ roared ashore on the same day, half a world apart, but the way they spread devastation was as different as water and wind. Storms in the western Pacific generally hit with much higher winds and the people who live in their way are often poorer and more vulnerable, Princeton University hurricane and climate scientist Gabriel Vecchi said Saturday. That will likely determine the type of destruction. Mangkhut made landfall Friday on the northeastern tip of Luzon island in the Philippines with top-of-the-scale Category 5 winds of 165 mph. Florence had weakened to a Category 1 storm with 90 mph winds by the time it arrived at North Carolina’s coast. Yet a day after landfall the faster-moving Mangkhut was back out over open water _ weakened, but headed across the South China Sea toward China. Florence, meanwhile, was still plodding across South Carolina at a pace slower than a normal person walks. By Saturday morning, it had already dumped more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain, a record for North Carolina. Experts say Mangkhut may well end up being the deadlier storm. As of Saturday afternoon, the death count in the Philippines was a bit higher, although still far below that of other storms that have hit the disaster-prone island nation. And with Mangkhut now headed toward the densely populated southeast coast of China, it is likely to cause more death and destruction. But watery Florence’s insured loses total will eventually be higher, Ernst Rauch, head of climate research for the world’s largest reinsurer Munich Re, told German media. That’s because of a combination of geography, climatic conditions and human factors. The western Pacific has two-and-a-half times more storms that reach the minimum hurricane strength of 74 mph. It has three-and-a-half times more storms that reach major hurricane strength of 111 mph, and three times more accumulated energy out of those hurricanes, an index that measures not just strength and number of storms but how long they last, according to more than 65 years of storm data. So far this year there have been 23 named storms in the western Pacific and 10 in the Atlantic, both regions more than 30 percent busier than average years. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same type of storm; both are tropical cyclones, but those that occur in the Pacific west of the International Date Line are called typhoons. The water in the western Pacific is warmer, and warm water fuels storms. There are also only a few pieces of land to get in the way and weaken them, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. A woman holds an umbrella in the rain as Typhoon Mangkhut approaches, in Shenzhen, China (Reuters) “If we are ever going to have a Category 6 (a speculated-on level that’s above current measurement tools), the western Pacific is where it’s going to be,” said meteorologist Ryan Maue of weathermodels.com. The Philippines tends to get hit nearly every year, the Carolinas far less frequently though with lots of close calls, Maue said. That shows another big difference in the storms. Mangkhut formed further south and stayed south _ over warmer water. Florence was out of the tropics when it hit land. Because of that, Florence was weakened by the dry air and upper level winds of the higher latitudes. Not so the more southerly Mangkhut, which Maue said, “essentially had a perfect environment to intensify to a Category 5 and stay there.” “Mangkhut and Florence are certainly different animals,” said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. Because Florence is moving so slowly, he said, it will dump more rain than Mangkhut, which is named for the Thai word for the mangosteen fruit. Both storms have lasted a long time, especially Florence which formed all the way over near Africa 15 days before landfall, McNoldy said. Both storms cover a large area, but Mangkut still dwarfs Florence. Mangkhut’s tropical storm force winds stretched more than 325 miles from the center, while Florence’s spread about 195 miles, Klotzbach said. Economics also play a role in a storm’s impact. As a developing country, the Philippines is much poorer than the southeastern United States, which means houses tend to be less sturdy and first responders less well equipped, among other factors. This is one reason why, when disaster does strike, the effects can be devastating. In 2013, one of the most powerful storms on record, Typhoon Haiyan, killed 7,300 people and displaced more than 5 million when it swept across the islands of the central Philippines. Straddling the famous Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is also bedeviled by volcanoes and earthquakes, and while there are considerable patches of poverty in North and South Carolina, it is not the same as the rural area where Mangkhut hit. Munich Re’s Rauch said about 30 to 50 percent of storm damage is usually insured in the United States but often less than 10 percent in developing countries, meaning nine-tenths of the people hit will end up shouldering a bigger economic burden. In the United States, “you can’t move houses, but people can move out of the way,” reflecting mounting damages from storms and often lower losses in life, Vecchi said. As the world warms from the burning of fossil fuels, the globe will see both more extremely intense storms like Mangkhut and wetter storms like Florence, Vecchi said.

90Min,"For most fans, the drawing of Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain in Group C of the UEFA Champions League meant one thing, and one thing only. A final reckoning as to who had the deadlier front three. Sure, we can pretend we still enjoy a good old defensive play, or a nice solid midfield platform, but in this modern age it's all about the frontline. Those vaunted attackers are the ones who capture our attention the most, and we've been lucky enough to witness some of the greatest incarnations in living memory just this decade. In this highly celebrated world of frontlines, you know you've made it when you become known solely by your collective acronym. Think 'MSN' at Barcelona, or 'BBC' at Real Madrid. With both of those now disbanded (RIP), the footballing world was in need of a new collective, preferably a trio, to emerge as the international forebears for this treasured tradition. Right off the bat, it was clear that Liverpool and PSG would be the two frontrunners, and thus, their two-legged battle in this year's group stage would provide the perfect platform to settle it once and for all - or, if not indefinitely, then at least for the time being. In the red corner, we have Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane - or SFM. In the blue corner, it's Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe - or NCM. Ahead of Wednesday night's victory for the Parisians at the Parc des Princes, we conducted a poll for Virgin Media on 90min's Instagram, in which 1,300 people had their say on which trio was deadlier. But, amazingly, the two parties couldn't be separated. So it's now up to me, and the stats recorded in both games, to decipher which trio is the more potent. Obviously, we'll start with the most basic and fundamental of statistics: goals scored. In this category, it is NCM who prevail by two goals to one. Incidentally, it is James Milner who is the top scorer in the fixture, with two dispatched penalties, but that's neither here nor there. Milner is a boring, 'solid' midfielder, so we don't care. In the assists column, it is all square, with only one assist apiece between the six of them. How about chances created in the two fixtures? Well, that comes up rosey for the Parisians as well, with double the total of four that their three-man opposition could muster. Successful take-ons? That one goes to SFM, with seven compared to NCM's six - and at a far better ratio as well. I could go on, but I'm starting to see why these two are at such an impasse. So, how about we settle this the old fashioned way - leaving aside the individual statistics, which trio have given their side greater success in the competition? Well, one glance at the Group C table should suffice. The French outfit are currently two points clear of the English club, with a trip to Red Star Belgrade all that separates them between the knockout stage. As for Liverpool, they now need to beat table toppers Napoli by either one goal to nil, or by two clear goals. Any other result would send them tumbling out, assuming PSG don't lose in Serbia, thanks to their inferior head-to-head record against both the Neapolitans and Parisians. So, after cracking the numbers, it appears that, as it stands, it is NCM who prevail! And they're worthy winners, I think. Of course, it could all change pending the results and performances of the final matchday, but we'll cross that bridge when it comes to it. For now, after two heavyweight clashes, it is Neymar, Cavani and Mbappe who can bask in the glory of frontline supremacy.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","Civil rights movement called ""Our Mumu Don Do"" march and carry banner to protest bloody clashes between herdsmen and farmers in the vast central region that has claimed dozens of lives during a rally in Abuja, on March 14, 2018. (Photo: STRINGER, AFP/Getty Images) LAGOS, Nigeria – Scores are dead after vicious weekend clashes in central Nigeria between mostly Muslim herders and Christian farmers, with one report citing police saying 86 people were killed. The growing conflict by some accounts has become deadlier than Nigeria’s Boko Haram extremist insurgency. Dramatic footage from Jos showed angry people waving machetes and sticks and shouting at passing security forces as they weaved around overturned and burning vehicles. Smoke rose in the distance. Women and children clutching overstuffed bags piled into the back of trucks, seeking a way out. President Muhammadu Buhari warned against reprisal attacks after the “deeply unfortunate killings across a number of communities” in central Plateau State as the military and police tried to end the bloodshed, saying “no efforts will be spared” to find the attackers. Nigeria’s government has not announced a death toll. The independent Channels Television cited a Plateau State police spokesman, Mathias Tyopev, as saying 86 people had been killed, with at least 50 houses destroyed. “Please remain calm,” said the Plateau State governor, Simon Bako Lalong, as a helicopter whirred overhead. “It is very, very, unfortunate that an incident is happening again like this.” The deadly clashes between herders and farmers in central Nigeria are a growing security concern in Africa’s most populous country, which is roughly split between Muslims in the north and Christians in the south. The threat from Boko Haram, which continues to carry out attacks in the northeast, has been cited as one cause of the growing tensions as herders – also feeling the effects of climate change – are forced south into more populated farming communities in search of safe grazing. The widespread security issues pose a major challenge to Buhari, a Muslim former military ruler who won office in a democratic transfer of power in 2015, as elections approach next year. While few details emerged immediately of the latest killings, Nigerians for hours Sunday on social media shared a growing sense that something awful had occurred. Earlier in the day the Plateau State governor announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew after saying had woken up to the “shocking news” of the attacks. He said the curfew affects the communities of Jos South, Riyom and Barkin Ladi “and is in effect until further notice.” “Observe the curfew, observe the curfew and I will still remind them to observe the curfew,” he said. ––– Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP–Africa Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2KfzApX",Dramatic footage from Jos showed angry people waving machetes and sticks and shouting at passing security forces.,2018-06-25T09:51:43Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}","Scores killed in central Nigeria as farmers, herders clash",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/06/25/nigeria-clashes/729873002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/176029fc5136fee8f568640d4713dcc796f1ab7e/c=0-96-3452-2046&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/06/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636655025413313662-AFP-AFP-14X46I-99865159.JPG,usa-today,USA Today,deadlier,1
Ryan Pickrell,"US Air Force B-52 Stratofortress heavy long-range bombers are flying into Europe this week, US Air Forces Europe - Africa announced Thursday, at a time Russia is making threats against the US as a Cold War-era missiles ban collapses. 
 A Bomber Task Force consisting of bombers from the 2nd Bomb Wing out of Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana are deploying to the US European Command area of operations. 
 While USAFE, citing operational security concerns, would not provide the number of bombers heading into this theater, Military.com reports that up to six B-52 bombers will arrive in the United Kingdom before the weekend. An unnamed source told the outlet that this marks the largest deployment of a bomber platform to the Europe since 2003, when EUCOM had 20 bombers at Royal Air Force Fairford station during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
 The deployment is focused on interoperability training with the British Royal Air Force, as well as other allies and partners in the region. At the same time, there is also a deterrence element to this deployment, USAFE told Business Insider.

'Training with joint partners, allied nations and other U.S. Air Force units contributes to our ready and postured forces and enables us to build enduring and strategic relationships necessary to confront a broad range of global challenges,"" USAFE said in a statement. 
 The US has routinely rotated bombers into Europe as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, an apparent response to Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014. That year, the US reportedly sent two B-2 Spirit bombers and three B-52s to Europe, planes that are capable of carrying nuclear weapons. 
 The current deployment comes at a time of increased tension between Washington and Moscow. The collapse of a Cold War-era arms control agreement — the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty — has ignited an arms race and led to threatening rhetoric from Russia.

This week, US Global Strike Command kicked off Global Lightning 2019, a battle staff exercise designed to assess joint operational readiness across all of USSTRATCOM's mission areas, which happens to be EUCOM this year. This exercise will reportedly also include a B-52 mission. 
 US Air Force B-52s are bombers with the ability to carry both conventional and nuclear weapons payloads. As America's longest-serving bomber, these aircraft have been flying for over six decades. They are expected to continue flying as the service continues to upgrade these aircraft to not only keep them in the fight, but make them deadlier than ever before.

Umair Irfan,"Answer: it’s complicated. A historic polar vortex has swept down from the Arctic, funneling brutally low temperatures to Midwestern cities like Chicago and Minneapolis, which dropped to minus 28 degrees Fahrenheit Wednesday. “One of the coldest arctic air mass intrusions in recent memory is surging south into the Upper Midwest before spreading across much of the eastern two-thirds of the country, the National Weather Service said. “Through late week, expect frigid temperatures, bitterly cold and life-threatening wind chills, likely leading to widespread record lows and low maximum temperatures from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.” Chilly temperatures have already proved deadly this winter in the central United States. In Chicago, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office has reported 19 cold-related deaths this season alone. And health officials are bracing for more. Beyond the direct effects like hypothermia and frostbite, cold can worsen heart and lung troubles. Yet as the planet warms, some have been tempted to claim that cold-related deaths will decline overall. That’s the argument Bjørn Lomborg, who has questioned many of the risks of climate change, made in the Wall Street Journal in 2016. He wrote that warming temperatures will “reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.” It sounds plausible. However, it’s surprisingly difficult to figure out which is worse for public health as the climate becomes more unstable: the cold or the heat? “That’s a very controversial issue, actually,” said Patrick Kinney, a professor of public health at Boston University. “As scientists, we haven’t come to an agreement, especially about the future impacts of climate change.” The research breaks down into two broad camps, with one finding that the heat is more deadly and the other finding cold temperatures to be the greater threat. And when it comes to the effects of rising average temperatures around the world, there’s another bifurcation. One group finds that climate change has a silver lining in reduced deaths from the cold, while the other holds that deaths from the cold will barely budge. That’s because it’s not the cold itself that’s most dangerous, but associated factors like increased disease transmission in cold weather. Here’s what we understand about the dangers of high and low temperatures so far. Heat and cold are an underrated danger Most people have dealt with discomfort at both ends of the temperature spectrum, so it’s not hard to believe that extremes in either direction can quickly become dangerous. However, researchers have struggled to figure out just how much temperature is to blame when hospital visits rise during periods of heat and cold. For starters, it’s difficult to link any individual death to a temperature extreme, since fatalities don’t often come from the heat and cold per se, but from worsening underlying conditions like asthma and high blood pressure. Scientists have a good understanding of the temperature limits of the human body, so it stands to reason that as the weather reaches these danger zones, more people will die. The World Meteorological Organization reported that heat-related deaths and illnesses have risen steadily since 1980, and now 30 percent of the world’s population lives in regions vulnerable to heat waves. But the advent of artificial heating and cooling has blunted these effects, and as temperatures rise, air conditioning will likely become more common, allowing people to adapt to warmer climates. That means a projection of warming will not necessarily have an equivalent increase in illnesses and deaths. One estimate reported in a 2015 analysis of deaths in 13 countries in The Lancet attributed about 8 percent of mortality to “non-optimum temperature.” This includes shifts toward both heat and cold, accounting for a larger percentage of deaths than traffic accidents, diarrheal disease, and tuberculosis combined. Yet temperature deaths don’t raise the same amount of alarm as storms and floods since the effects are obscured behind conditions like heart attacks and strokes, so public health officials often invest fewer resources in mitigating temperature effects than they do for preventing influenza and dealing with allergies. And many people in areas vulnerable to temperature swings don’t take it as seriously as they should. “If people turned blue from cold events, and people who died of heat turned red, there would be a hell of a lot more research in this area,” said Adrian Barnett, a professor of public health at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. “It would be a national emergency.” And depending on how you structure your study, heat, or cold, can emerge as the deadlier phenomenon. One calculation from the National Weather Service pegged heat as three times deadlier than cold, while the 2015 Lancet paper found cold was 20 times deadlier than heat. Even moderate shifts in temperature can be deadly When zooming out to study health at the level of cities or countries rather than individuals, temperature swings lead to distinct increases in emergency room visits and deaths. And it’s not just the searing heat and frigid cold; moderate changes in temperature can lead to surges in morbidity and mortality. Barnett has been studying this phenomenon in Brisbane, a city of 1.9 million people on Australia’s east coast. Temperatures there are temperate year-round, usually between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. Extremes rarely dip below 50 degrees Fahrenheit or climb above 84 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, many homes in the city lack insulation and air conditioning, so indoor temperatures are directly linked to outdoor weather, creating a very narrow comfort zone and making Brisbane an ideal laboratory to study how temperature influences health. In a 2012 study in Nature Climate Change, Barnett and his co-authors reported how temperature changes in Brisbane influenced years of life lost, a metric that helps account for age differences at the time of death. A person dying at 84 whose life expectancy is 85 would count as one year of life lost, compared to a 25-year-old’s death with the same life expectancy, which weighs as 60 years of life lost. Using this metric helps illustrate the societal value of the lives lost, according to Barnett. Nature Climate Change The temperature effects on the relative risk of mortality (top row) and years of life lost (bottom row) in Brisbane between 1996 and 2004. The results showed that fatalities increased as soon as temperatures shifted away from 75 degrees Fahrenheit in either direction, and the effect was stronger in women than in men. It also showed that heat is more dangerous than the cold on balance. But the 2015 Lancet paper, which looked at more than 74 million deaths between 1984 and 2012, reported that the cold is deadlier and that people responded to changes in temperature differently depending on the city they’re in. The Lancet Relative risks of temperature changes across four US cities. You can see how below-average temperatures (blue curve) in warm cities are more deadly, and the opposite effect with higher temperatures (red curve) in cooler cities. Hot temperatures are more dangerous in a city that’s cooler year-round like Buffalo, New York, while chilly weather in the warmer climes of Brownsville, Texas, is deadlier. This is likely due to the fact that people acclimate to a certain climate, whether through their physiology or through homes and workplaces that protect them from the average local weather. Both studies showed that temperatures didn’t have to reach extremes before becoming dangerous. In fact, since temperature extremes are rare, moderate shifts outside the norm accounted for the most harm in a given population. We’re not sure how heat and cold harm health across a population Both high and low temperatures have direct effects on the human body, but it’s not clear that’s what’s driving the surge in deaths outside the Goldilocks zone for a city. Cold, for example, stresses the heart and lungs as the body works to maintain its core temperature. Researchers have found that heart-related hospitalizations increase shortly after a snowstorm blankets a region. However, in cold weather, people tend to stay indoors. Spending more hours in an enclosed space with others increases the likelihood of transmitting viruses like influenza, while dry indoor air can increase the susceptibility to these infections. As such, in cold weather the increase in deaths may not come from the temperature per se. Similarly, heat is a health stressor, but most people living in areas prone to heat in the United States have air conditioning. On the other hand, high temperatures worsen air pollutants like ozone, which can damage lungs. Distinguishing whether a hospital visit or a death is due directly to a change in temperature or to a secondary effect is difficult to elucidate from population studies. However, it’s worth figuring out where the actual danger is coming from so public health officials can design interventions that save lives. One thing that’s clear: climate change will make things worse As average temperatures rise, the frequency and duration of heat waves will go up, and so will deaths and illness associated with them. Spikes that occurred once every 20 years will occur every two years by the end of the century, with some parts of the world poised to experience temperature surges that make them uninhabitable for humans. Temperature variability and unseasonal heat events will also become more risky. “Our research has shown that heat waves that occur earlier in the warm season are generally more harmful to health than those that occur later,” said Michelle Bell, a professor of environmental health at Yale University, in an email. “Further, while climate change results in overall warmer temperatures, the variability of temperature is also impacted with more extreme cold and heat, which can impact health.” Variability can be harmful because a sudden increase or decrease in temperature can catch us off guard, leaving us ill-prepared to handle the weather, unlike the slower seasonal changes that allow us to acclimate with heating and cooling. Does that mean global warming will help keep us from freezing to death? If the harm from cold stems from direct exposure to chilly weather, then yes. But if cold-weather fatalities come from infections and the like, then climate change will likely have a negligible impact. And as heat waves become more common, hospitalizations and deaths due to changes in temperatures are poised to increase overall in the coming century. “What we end up gaining in the cold end, we might end up losing at the hot end,” Barnett said.",Answer: it’s complicated.,2019-01-30T15:54:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Vox.com'}",The polar vortex is bringing life-threatening wind chills.

Ben Pearson,"A couple of weeks ago, I trekked over to Beverly Hills to attend the press junket for Marvel Studios’ Black Panther and had the chance to sit down with actor Andy Serkis, who reprises his role as the villainous Ulysses Klaue in Ryan Coogler’s new movie. Klaue is funnier (and deadlier) this time around than he was in his brief appearance in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and I spoke with Serkis about the character’s motivations, being involved in some of the movie’s biggest action scenes, a fascinating tease about the future of his Star Wars character, and his interest in returning to Fox’s Planet of the Apes franchise. Read our full Andy Serkis interview below. (Ever-so-light spoilers ahead, so if you’d rather go into the movie completely fresh, save this article and come back to it.) First thing’s first: aside from “What is Love”, what else do you think is on Ulysses Klaue’s mixtape? Andy Serkis: (laughs) I think he’s probably got a little bit of Janelle Monae, he’s probably got some Burt Bacharach, he’s probably got a little bit of Pink Floyd. I think he’s pretty eclectic. How did that “What is Love?” moment come about? Was it in the script that Klaue would be singing that specific song? There was a scene which preceded that moment, where he’s chained and left alone. He just starts tapping his feet and setting up a riff, and I was just making all these noises and singing, and going to this kind of hip hop beat. And Ryan came in and said, ‘Why don’t we try…’ So we tried a few different songs and then ‘What is Love’ came out of that. How much does Marvel tell you about your character’s backstory? Do you know, for example, if Klaue ever sold Vibranium to Howard Stark? I knew about Klaue from the comics. Klaue from the comics is slightly different to that of the movies, so I didn’t want to get hung up on either version, in a way. It’s a bit of an amalgamation, I suppose. I’ve picked and chosen the things that I wanted to use for me as stimuli for the character. I loved the single shot fight scene in the casino. Walk me through how you filmed that and what that experience was like for you. It was an amazing week. I think it was about a week, or five days of filming, actually. It was choreographed in chunks, in sections. It was thrilling to be a part of. It really was. All the extras there. All the key players there, and the timing was absolutely crucial. Every single set-up obviously took time, and if you cut and it hadn’t gone, it was a big set-up. So we rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed, and then it was just having the confidence of having everyone be in the moment and have freedom with it. I really enjoyed those few days. The rehearsal part, was that built into those five days? Or did it actually take five days of filming to capture it? It was rehearsal and then shoot. What was the most challenging part of that for you? To be honest, for me, I didn’t have the greatest technical challenges. Some of them were – like Danai had obviously that stunt sequence, which is amazing. There’s the shot where I blow up – using the sonic disruptor – I send the Black Panther flying backwards, and the stunt guy who did that, I mean, they did that for real. I don’t know if you really see that in the shot. But it was an amazing stunt to be a part of, because this guy had the wires around him and he literally went from twenty feet up in the air, right across the room. So that was pretty incredible. Was there anything else about that scene that stood out to you? Getting the timing right when Danai’s character kicks that guy off and he lands on the pool table, so getting that timing into starting firing. Getting the bullet shots. For the technical guys, getting the bullet shots to time so that it hits the case. Lots of squibs and practical effects, as well as CG effects. And then the other section for me was up at the top with T’Challa and running away. Oh, that was the first time of using his arm. So it was like [figuring out] in terms of the shot and how that was going to work, and working out the choreography so it was rightly placed in the frame. And what happens to the arm when it fires, where do you feel the recoil, and all of that. The physicality of that. The size of it: how much it expands and extends. And were you really hanging out of the side of moving SUVs in South Korea? What was shooting that chase sequence like? No. The chase sequence, the way it was shot was the last part of it was the first part that we shot. The car doing that big tumble, coming to a screeching halt, and me falling out of it. So that was a night shoot, which kind of went on and on. And then T’Challa catching up and beating up Ulysses Klaue, which we did so, so many times. That was brutal. That was brutal. The rest of it was on a gimbal. The car was on a gimbal so it could be moved in all different directions for the jumps and the flips and all of that sort of stuff. We were strapped into the car and I had to lean out, but that was against – that was a blue screen shoot. Klaue is a villain and does horrendous things, but we know he at least has some kind of moral code. We know he detests hypocrisy, for example. Did you have any conversations with Ryan and Joe about Klaue’s motivations in this movie? We talked about him on the moral spectrum as being someone who is…this film is about isolationism, or it’s about sharing and inclusion, and he represents the world’s greatest taker. He is a consumer and a taker and a thief and steals stuff. He trades. He cares about no one. He has no empathy for anyone else. He’s like a sort of moral vacuum cleaner in a way, and that’s something we discussed. That he’s on the spectrum of characters in this movie, that’s what he represents. I’d like to ask a quick Star Wars question if you don’t mind. Supreme Leader Snoke was seemingly set up as this ultimate galactic villain in The Force Awakens, so what was your reaction when you first read the script for The Last Jedi and discovered that your character would die in that way? Look, it’s Star Wars, so you never know how life, or whether life can be come back to or not. Whether you can be resuscitated or brought back. I was shocked. Dramatically, it felt absolutely right for that moment in the film, so I didn’t question it. I just think it’s a very, very important scene, so I didn’t question it. But I do, I know it’s left fans feeling like, that they were really searching for something there. And what I’m saying is, who knows? Have you spoken to J.J. about returning? I’ve not spoken to him, no. I want to congratulate you on War for the Planet of the Apes and the phenomenal work you did across that entire trilogy. I imagine you’re probably done playing Caesar, but are you interested or have you had any conversations with the people at Fox about the idea of coming back to that franchise in some capacity? Maybe playing another character or directing a movie set in that world? Certainly both of those, in my mind, would be great possibilities. That’s the great thing about performance capture: you can come back and play anything else. And I love the world, I love the metaphor of talking about the human condition through the eyes of apes. I just think it’s really powerful. And there are still so many stories that can be told, and there are still a lot of chapters in the ape mythology that will get you from where we left off back to the 1968 version, the ascension of the apes. So I mean, yeah, if they were to happen, I’d definitely be interested. ***** Black Panther hits theaters on February 16, 2018.

Asher Madan,"One of Ubisoft's most-anticipated new titles is The Division 2, the sequel to the popular first game that launched back in 2016. The Division 2 is a third-person military shooter which tasks you with stopping malicious forces from seizing control of the government in the District of Columbia. It's unclear how the rest of the country is affected at this point, but we should find out soon enough.
Today, the game received its long-awaited launch trailer. The short video focuses on the plot and the chaos that has engulfed the capitol. It seems like the endgame ""Black Tusks"" faction is deadlier than they initially seemed.
Last weekend, an open beta took place for The Division 2. A lot of gamers participated so hopefully the final game will be a polished experience when it launches in a few days.
The Division 2 will receive a lot of free updates in 2019 and if you own the Year 1 Pass, you can play them a few days early. The Year 1 Pass is included in the Gold Edition and Ultimate Edition, but you can also purchase it for $40. The pass grants early access to all additional content, instant access to new Specilizations, more Classified Assignments to reveal more about the city, and some cosmetic items that should help you stand out.

Marc Lagace,"Fortnite has been blowing up lately. Millions of people have become obsessed with the game, both as players and just watching popular Twitch streamers play the game. Interested to learn more about what the heck Fortnite is all about? Just keep reading. What's new with Fortnite? May 18, 2018 — The Android version will be here ""this summer."" Fortnite's iOS version has been out for a hot minute now, and to ensure the experience is as good as can be, Epic outlined a heap of improvements coming to the game — including a customizable HUD, voice chat, improved controls, and more. You can read through all the changes here, but the most exciting news has to do with Fortnite's Android release. Epic notes that the game will be here ""this summer"", and while that's not as specific as we'd like, it's still a step in the right direction. May 4, 2018 — Season 4 has begun, but still no word on Android app release date. While we patiently wait for Epic Games to finish the Android version of the game, the game itself continues to evolve with the start of Season 4. The latest update for the game started out with a bang, with a meteorite crashing into the Dusty Depot on the map and introducing a new upgrade called Hop Rocks that, when consumed, let you jump and float in the air, defying gravity. Other changes have come to the map and you can learn all about it from our friends from iMore. Meanwhile, still no word on a firm release date for Android. We're sure Epic Games is eager to get Android users in on the fun, but until then you can sign up for your Epic Games account and let them know which phone you're planning to play on. Sign up for Fortnite Mobile What is Fortnite? Fortnite is what would happen if you combined two of the most addictive games out there — Minecraft and PUBG. Fortnite offers a free 100-player Player Vs Player (PvP) Battle Royale game mode. Just like PUBG, you're dropped onto the large island map and must arm yourself and outlive your competition. But in Fortnite, you always start out armed with a pickaxe which can be used as a melee weapon or for harvest raw supplies for building walls, ramps, and shelters. It certainly adds extra layers of strategy to the format, creating essentially a perfect storm of addictive gaming action that's as fun to watch as it is to play. Oh, speaking of storms all the action takes place in the eye of a deadly electrical storm meaning you can't just hunker down and hide out the whole game. You got to keep moving. How do you play the game? Just like PUBG, your goal is to be the last man standing — with up to 100 players involved in each match, that's no small task. Each game starts with the players jumping out of the flying ""Battle Bus"" and parachuting down onto a giant island. Once landed, you must loot nearby buildings for items, guns, and ammo to defend yourself and attack other players. You also need to keep an eye on the map, as every few minutes the storm closes in on the play area. If you're caught in the storm, you slowly die so you do not want to forget to regularly check where you are on the map. Eventually, the play constricts to a tiny area for the final showdown between the remaining players — there can only be one winner! Unlike PUBG, you're able to carry more than two guns. Instead, you're limited to the number of weapons and items you can carry at one time. Also, guns are color coded to denote their rarity — from grey (common) to orange (legendary) — and the rarer the gun, the deadlier it is. Then there's the crafting element. Every player starts out with a pickaxe which can be used as a melee weapon or used to break down trees and buildings to harvest the raw resources. You can then use these raw resources to build your own structures, whether it be a defensive wall to provide cover from an advancing enemy, a set of stairs to reach the second floor of a building or your own watchtower to snipe players from across the map. The resources you mine will determine the strength. Steel is stronger than brick, which is stronger than wood. When will it be available for Android? Fortnite has been available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for a few months now, and is now widely available on iOS devices after a brief invite-only beta. There have been no firm dates set for an Android release by Fortnite's developer, Epic Games, but they have said to expect support for Android to come in the next few months. For now, Android users can head on over to Epic Games, log in or create your Fortnite Account, and then let the developers know which device you plan to play on which will also add you to the mailing list to be informed when the game eventually drops. Until then, at least we've got PUBG to tide us over. Will it be free to play? Epic Games has so far released the PvP Battle Royale game for free across all platforms including the mobile version for iOS. The console version also has a paid game mode called Save The World that's Player vs Environment (PvE). Save The World plays more like Minecraft, where you're harvesting more resources and stocking up on loot to survive waves of AI enemies in a sort of tower defense-style of gameplay. The PvE mode will not be available in Fortnite Mobile for iOS and, frankly, it's the PvP mode that everyone is crazy for so that's quite alright with us. However, the iOS version offers in-app purchases for cosmetic items to customize your player and people sure have been buying stuff. According to this report from Sensor Tower analtyics, Fortnite Mobile players spent more than $1 million during the first 72 hours of its release on iOS. Wow. So, to answer the question, you have the option to spend money on Fortnite if you want a cool looking character, but the game is free to play and you won't need to pay to win. Will there be support for Bluetooth controls? Epic Games has indicated that Bluetooth controller support will be coming later, but as of right now only touchscreen controls are available. Is it cross-platform? Epic Games have indicated that you will be able to play Fortnite across all platforms. Your Fortnite profile can be connected to all the platforms you play on so you can add to your stats however you connect to the game. Don't be worried about getting mismatched as the one mobile player in a server of PC and console players. If you're playing solo on mobile, you will only be matched up against other mobile players. If you join a squad with friends playing on another platform, then that squad will be matched against a multi-platform population, essentially making cross-platform play opt-in. Are you hyped for Fortnite? We'll be sure to let you know when the game launches for Android. Until then, you can create your Epic Games account and start playing on one of the other platforms to start getting a handle on the game","The hottest game of 2018 will be coming to Android in the coming months.

Brad Anderson,"For techies out there, it may seem evident that the self-driving car promises unparalleled levels of safety for the 1.2B car commuters out there. We are in dire need of a solution to reduce the &gt; one million deaths that occur on public roads every year. But with seven billion people in the world today (and an estimated nine billion by 2050) this begs the question how then do the other six billion people get around, and how safe is it for them? Over half the employed population of three billion people get from A to B every day on just two wheels, making motorcycling the most popular form of transportation worldwide. This may come as a bit of a surprise unless youve visited any of the one hundred largest metropolises in the world. This is where things get interesting. For every billion passenger miles traveled, there are 237.57 motorcycle-related deaths and 6.53 car-related deaths (and 0.02 aviation-related deaths, in case you were wondering.) This means motorcycling claims 36X more lives than driving, making it the most dangerous form of transportation worldwide. And with greater than 1.5 billion people who depend on motorcycles to get to work every day, it is a necessary but insufficient means of transportation. Whats really staggering is just how wide the gap in safety technology is between cars and motorcycles. Remember the joy of driving through rolling hills at sunset with the top rolled down? Few do. Todays all-powerful millennial consumer didnt grow up in such romantic times. Millennials, who now represent ¼ of the population in the western world, and as much as half in Asia, grew up with helicopter parents in hyper-protective cars chock full of advanced safety features. These are rolling fortresses with in-aisle entertainment systems and built-in headphones for that numbing commute to school they had to do every day. And such a cocooned upbringing doesnt exactly translate to fanaticism for the open road. With standard (ho hum) things like ABS being about the only technology feature you can easily find, Millennials need for technology just isnt represented in the motorcycle category. Do cars need blind spot detection, collision avoidance and the like? If the answer is yes, then we really need to start mapping out far more powerful safety features for a mode of transportation that is far more common and 36 times deadlier. Thankfully, efforts are now underway to close the gap between motorcycle and automotive safety. With BMWs self-driving motorcycle, Skullys smart helmet, and in collaboration with Yamaha, Damons 360º accident prediction system we are starting to see a near-term future where motorcycling is going to be exponentially safer, smarter and easier than it is today. In fact, Damon is working on an entirely new motorcycling experience. One that augments a riders situational awareness tailored to the unique circumstances motorcyclists all too frequently find themselves in. Damon sees a future where everyday motorcycles learn from each other, receiving over the air updates to not just see but even predict accidents before they happen. Longer term, Damonized motorcycles will be able to fully avoid accidents, for those times that riders arent able to react fast enough. Much like the self-driving car, over the next few years well see autonomy levels for motorcycling look like this: L1 Reactive systems: ABS, traction control L2 Dumb blind spot detection, forward collision warning (same as the state of cars today) L3 Networked, self-learning 360º collision detection L4 Collision prediction L5 Collision avoidance (automated braking and steering) under critical circumstances* *Nobody really wants a two-wheel motorcycle to drive itself. The challenge the industry faces is an interesting one: While drivers may be willing to give up control behind the wheel, its harder to imagine motorcycle riders doing the same. Not only because a two-wheel vehicle may be harder to make autonomous, but because motorcycling is flat out fun. Unlike cars, commuting on a motorcycle is the opposite of stressful. Long gone are the romantic days of car ownership. What once was the American dream of freedom on open roads that swept across the world has devolved into the daily grind to get to work that everybody dreads. By contrast, even in the densest cities of the world where riding a motorcycle is the norm, millions of riders frequently get together for group rides with friends who share the same passion for riding. The sport and thrill of winding roads that have long since left the automotive world, still drive the design of motorcycles today. Why? Cars are primarily designed to move families, whereas motorcycles are primarily intended to move just you. And that makes it a sport. Yet heres the irony in all this: On any given day, you can look at traffic and see four out of five cars with just one occupant. Why is that? At less than 500 years since modernization, North America is a very young place. With 9.2 million square miles to traverse, its huge – and for the most part, very unpopulated. The US population density averages 92.2 people per square mile and peaks out at only 1,205 people per square mile (thanks New Jersey!). Compare this to the 37 ancient mega cities each with 10-40 million people. Densities in these cities can exceed 72,000 people per square mile; with windy, narrow streets that have been traveled since before the horse was invented and you start to see why the world buys 160 million motorcycles a year. Billions of people need powered, personal transportation devices that are not much wider than ones shoulders. As youve probably concluded, riding is here to stay, and we have the worlds most exciting motorcycle brands to thank for that. Now lets help them keep pace with the auto industry and make transportation a lot safer for the rest of the world.","For techies out there, it may seem evident that the self-driving car promises unparalleled levels of safety for the 1.2B car commuters out there.

Chris Pereira,"Plants vs. Zombies has been around long enough now that it no longer seems weird. But when you stop and consider it--a tower-defense game where you use sentient plants to fight off waves of zombies--it's a pretty strange concept. So it should perhaps be no surprise that the new game from creator George Fan is also pretty unusual. Developer All Yes Good today announced Octogeddon, a new game where you play as a ""giant mutant octopus bent on world destruction."" The trailer provides a sense of what vibe Fan and All Yes Good are going for--it's all very silly--but we don't yet have a firm grasp on precisely what you do other than generally wreak havoc. The official description states players ""grow more tentacles and evolve each of them into deadlier weapons until they become the ultimate eight-armed sushi avenger."" It also describes this as a spiritual successor to Plants vs. Zombies while highlighting the fact that it's a game devoid of any microtransactions. ""[Octogeddon is] weird, playfully gruesome, and writhing with nearly infinite re-playability while only suctioning money out of your wallet ONCE,"" the press release states. A price was not announced, but it's made clear that this is not a free-to-play game, and that post-release content will be released for free. Octogeddon's release date is set for February 8 on PC through Steam. A closed beta has now begun, but access won't be easy to get. 64 ""golden tickets"" will be given away through ""semi-secret sources--or in some cases by pestering George on Twitter.""

Jesse Schedeen,"Sabretooth needs a few good villains. By Jesse Schedeen Marvel's Weapon X comic is getting a major overhaul later this summer, and today the publisher revealed the new team lineup as Sabretooth takes charge of this team of mutant killers. Check out the newly revealed final cover for Weapon X #22: Weapon X #22 cover by Rahzzah. (Marvel Comics) As this cover shows, Sabretooth, Domino and Lady Deathstrike are sticking around, while Old Man Logan and Warpath are leaving the team and Omega Red and Mystique are stepping in to replace them. This means that, apart from Domino, the entire ""Weapon X-Force"" team consists of characters who are traditionally X-Men villains. This cover also shows off the new look for the team, with all five members sporting color-coordinated black and orange outfits. Weapon X #22 will be written by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente and drawn by Yildiray Cinar. Marvel's official solicitation for the issue reads: They were hunters who became the hunted... They were enemies forced to become allies... They were a ticking time bomb that had no choice but to fall apart... Out of the ashes of Team Weapon X, a new crew is borne! Sabretooth is putting together a team that is willing to do what other X-Men won’t, willing to wade into blood and filth to protect mutantkind! But who will make the cut?

Zack Zweizen,"Red Dead Online didnt have a great launch. The multiplayer mode of Red Dead Redemption 2 was made available to players last year in late November via a staggered release window. Once players had access to RDO, they found overpriced guns, a broken economy, and a lack of content. Some player also encountered griefers and trolls every time they jumped online. Soon after launch, the community began asking for changes to be made. Rockstar quickly improved the economy, lowering prices and raising payouts. But other issues like griefing still exist. Now Rockstar is sharing its plans to fix RDOs biggest problems.
Improving Anti-Griefing Features
In a Newswire post, Rockstar explains that it has plans to lessen how many trolls are running around the online Old West. Players on Reddit, Twitter, and other sites have been sharing stories of random players using the lasso to tie them up and drag them around. Other players have been killed over and over again while just trying to fish. 
Currently, Red Dead Online has a parlay system that is supposed to help with abusive or aggressive players. If a player kills you a few times in a short amount of time, you can parlay with them. This makes it impossible for that troll to hurt you or for you to attack the troll. But the parlay system can be avoided and doesnt always activate. Rockstar is going to make it easier to activate parlay and will make it easier to start feuds with rivals, allowing for revenge in a more structured competition.
Changing How Players Blips Work
Currently, player blips in RDO are always on the map. Even if a player is halfway across the world fishing or hunting, their blip is visible. This has made it easy for trolls to track down players and kill them repeatedly. Fans have been wanting this changed since the first days of RDOs launch and Rockstar has revealed their plans to fix the blips.
A future update will add proximity-based blips. These blips will only show up on the map when you get close to a player. Rockstar hopes this will make it harder for trolls and griefers to track players across long distances. Rockstar also has future plans to make player blips display how dangerous a person might be. If an RDO player has killed a bunch of folks and committed crimes, their blip will be darker in color and easier to spot from a distance. This will hopefully make it easier to avoid aggressive players. GTA Online uses a similar player blip system, with deadlier players having blips that are a bright red.
A New Bounty Hunter System
In Red Dead Online players can commit crimes and eventually get chased down by the local law. Outside of towns, the law is mostly absent. This means players who want to kill or grief others have little punishment waiting for them. This will change in a future update. In the blog post, Rockstar explains that it will be adding a bounty system. If players commit crimes, they will get a bounty on their head and will have to pay it off. If they dont pay, bounty hunters will track them down and kill them. It wasnt made clear in the blog post if these bounty hunters will be players or computer-controlled characters or both, but this bounty system will hopefully make players think twice before randomly shooting someone. 
More Content, Like New Missions and Events
Red Dead Online only has a handful of co-op story missions, some repetitive side missions, and a few PVP modes like racing or deathmatch. There isnt a lot of reason for players to keep coming back every day, because it hasnt changed much nor added anything new for players to see. Rockstar is planning on giving more content to players.
Rockstar confirmed that new story missions will be added in a future update. The current storyline in RDO just abruptly stops after a few missions. These future missions will add new characters and continue your characters story. Rockstar also announced that daily challenges are coming to Red Dead Online, along with new events, new weapons and clothing, and new PVP modes. Today Rockstar added the first of these new PVP modes, Gun Rush.
Rockstar hinted at more new content beyond these new missions and weapons, but said it doesnt feel ready to announce what that stuff is just yet.
Red Dead Online is currently a bit of a barren world, and Ive found myself returning less and less to it with each passing week. These changes and additions sound great and hopefully will give myself and other players more things to do in Red Dead Online, and lessen how often players are killed by trolls. While these updates sound nice on paper, we will have to wait and see how long it takes for these changes to happen and how well they are implemented. Red Dead Online might become a much better experience in 2019.

Dominic Tarason,"Inbetween Games bill their All Walls Must Fall as a “Tech-noir tactics game”. While not untrue, it feels like a coy evasion. Yes, it’s a dark sci-fi game set in an alternate future where the cold war never ended and the Berlin wall still stands. There are cyborg upgrades, and a grim neon-on-concrete aesthetic. True, there is time travel. There are even turn-based gunfights against swarms of human and robotic enemies, and now a greater focus on RPG-style progression mechanics, thanks to a recent major early access update. But I can’t think of any other cyberpunk games set almost exclusively in German gay nightclubs, a facet of the game that has gone largely unmentioned until the most recent trailer, seen after the jump. Hairy, bear-y time-travelling agent Kai fits right in with the setting. Thanks to a conversation system not entirely unlike Deus Ex: Human Revolution, stealth takes on a more social aspect than most games. You can sneak past some guards, but others you’ll have to bluff past, intimidate or just straight-up flirt with. Remember, if anyone grills you about the robot arm, just ask if they’ve ever seen ‘Iron Fister XII’ with a wry wink. Plus, if that doesn’t work out, you can always just roll back time and try another angle. Rugged, manly charms will only get you so far, though, and when a fight breaks out, the game transforms into a bizarre hybrid of XCom and Crypt of the Necrodancer. You and your enemies dart between clearly defined cover, but there are no dice rolls; Kai is a very good shot, and the emphasis is on pinning targets with rapid fire while using slower, deadlier aimed shots to put them down. Enemy bullets travel slower than yours, taking several turns to reach their mark, allowing you to dodge and weave between gunfire, but taking a single hit is costly. Inaction carries a price as well, as you only have a few seconds to plan and commit to each move, or suffer a resource penalty. The best part of any gunfight is after the final shot is fired and no more hostiles remain in your line of sight. Once satisfied with the outcome, you hit a button to drop the beat. Time rewinds to the beginning of the encounter, and replays the entire combat sequence for you in real-time, every shot and move synced to the pulsing electro music. Ideally, you want every fight to play out perfectly, and so long as you have some Time saved up (a resource generated by exploring the map and winning fights, and expended through movement and special actions), you can rewind the clock, undoing damage done. Between missions, you spend your mission completion bounty – speed, efficiency and other factors affecting it – on weapons, cybernetic upgrades or healing, if you took damage during the previous run. Then it’s off to the map to pick another procedurally generated mission to undertake, the difficulty escalating through the course of the (currently) ~2 hour campaign – although the full game will likely be somewhat longer and have more moving parts, a shorter-form campaign does lend itself well to the roguelike elements at play here. All Walls Must Fall is a refreshingly strange game. There are familiar elements here; the cover system from XCOM, Deus Ex’s conversations, and maybe even a dash of Crypt of the NecroDancer, but all combined, it stands out as something new. Maybe Klei’s Invisible Inc. would be the closest point of reference, but this is a much faster, more aggressively paced game, and an interestingly compelling one even in its current, partially complete form. All Walls Must Fall is available now via Steam Early Access and is half-price, down to £5.49/€7.49/$7.49, until Monday, November 13th.","Inbetween Games bill their All Walls Must Fall as a “Tech-noir tactics game”.

Tom Spring,"Researchers say the impact of the VPNFilter malware discovered last month is larger than originally reported. On Wednesday, Cisco Talos researchers said they now believe the malware has infected twice the number of router brands than previously stated. They added that VPNFilter also delivers a more potent punch than they originally thought, and have identified a previously unidentified malicious malware module. Related Posts January 23, 2018, 6:52 pm On May 23, Talos researchers first reported that Russian-speaking threat actors, with links to the BlackEnergy APT group, were behind the VPNFilter malware that infected 500,000 router brands (ranging from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link as well as small office network attached storage (NAS) devices). At the time, known malicious capabilities of VPNFilter included bricking the host device, executing shell commands for further manipulation, creating a ToR configuration for anonymous access to the device, or maliciously configuring the router’s proxy port and proxy URL to manipulate browsing sessions. In updated research, Cisco Talos said the range of targeted routers now includes those made by manufacturers ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, UPVEL and ZTE, bringing the total number of router models targeted by VPNFilter adversaries to 75. “These new discoveries have shown us that the threat from VPNFilter continues to grow,” Talos wrote in a technical breakdown of the malware on Wednesday. A closer examination of VPNFilter also demonstrates that the malware has the capability to infect more than the targeted routers and NAS devices — and can traverse into the networks that those devices support. “If successful, the actor would be able to deploy any desired additional capability into the environment to support their goals, including rootkits, exfiltration capability and destructive malware,” researchers wrote. To boot, Talos said that it has found a new stage-three module capable of injecting malicious content into web traffic as it passes through targeted network devices. Researchers identified the module as “ssler,” or an “endpoint exploitation module — JavaScript injection.” “At the time of our initial posting, we did not have all of the information regarding the suspected stage-three modules. The new module allows the actor to deliver exploits to endpoints via a man-in-the-middle capability (e.g. they can intercept network traffic and inject malicious code into it without the user’s knowledge),” researchers wrote. An additional “dstr” (device destruction module) component to the malware was also identified, which is “used to render an infected device inoperable by deleting files necessary for normal operation,” researchers wrote. “It deletes all files and folders related to its own operation first before deleting the rest of the files on the system, possibly in an attempt to hide its presence during a forensic analysis.” Lastly, researchers discussed new insights into a stage-three packet-sniffer module that they said was targeting industrial control system traffic. The sniffer specifically singled out the SafeStream Gigabit Broadband VPN router TP-LINK R600VPN. “VPNFilter is still in full force, in the wild, infecting a broader set of devices than known previously, which makes it quite concerning still,” wrote Derek Manky, global security strategist with Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, in an email. “This is a good example of how even exposed campaigns can continue to move with velocity.”",Researchers said they now believe the malware has infected twice the number of router brands than previously stated and that the malware packs a much deadlier punch.,2018-06-06T21:21:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Threatpost.com'}",VPNFilter Malware Impact Larger Than Previously Thought,https://threatpost.com/vpnfilter-malware-impact-larger-than-previously-thought/132582/,https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2018/03/10101223/Router_Target_Privacy.jpg,,Threatpost.com,deadlier,1
Germain Lussier,"Jacob Tremblay opening a box was the best thing in the first footage from Shane Black’s The Predator. Fox showed a taste of the highly anticipated next entry in the scifi series at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, and while opinions will obviously be mixed, I was left very underwhelmed. The trailer stars on Halloween in a typical suburb. Kids walking around, trick or treating. Inside one of the houses, a box has been delivered from Mexico. It’s covered in tape and is kind of roughed up. A young boy, played by Tremblay, opens the box and pulls out what looks like a highly chrome version of a Predator mask. There’s also a gauntlet, which he opens, and it gives off a red mist. He detaches a small piece that looks like a spaceship. It lights up and he begins to play with it like any kid would. However, as he’s doing this, there are real world consequences: It seems opening the tech triggered a ship in space. It flies down to Earth, kind of in the same patterns as the boy is playing, and crashes into a field. Was he responsible? Who is he? We don’t know. Next we meet a sniper played by Boyd Holbrook. He’s being interrogated about some kind of crash and claims he doesn’t know anything. But, that’s intercut with him approaching a crashed spaceship, opening it, and seeing, again, that same chrome Predator helmet. We quickly learn this man does know something and what he knows he sent to his son back in America. Probably not a good move. The trailer then kicks into a more montage-y section, with soldiers in the jungle, people working in a lab, and a character played by Olivia Munn somehow knowing about the Predators and saying they have done this on other planets. We learn that the sniper’s team was wiped out, which sounds very much like the team in the original Predator film. A group of soldiers are hunting something... probably a Predator. They’re laughing and cracking jokes. There are shots of a Predator running through the jungle, and another of one killing people in the lab; it ends with a joke about Munn’s character knowing her way around a gun. Where did she learn? “America.” There was no big standout moment in the footage. No hero shot of the Predator or clear idea of what exactly is going on. We assume Holbrook’s character sees a crashed ship, his team is killed, he sends his son evidence, the evidence brings down more Predators. Then, things go wild and soldiers are called in to stop the Predators, with the complication of scientists wanting to study them. Right? Well, along with the footage screening at CinemaCon, Fox released this plot description: From the outer reaches of space to the small-town streets of suburbia, the hunt comes home in Shane Black’s explosive reinvention of the Predator series. Now, the universe’s most lethal hunters are stronger, smarter and deadlier than ever before, having genetically upgraded themselves with DNA from other species. When a young boy accidentally triggers their return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled science teacher can prevent the end of the human race. So yeah, I was kind of right. As always, it’s important to remember the movie isn’t out until September. There’s plenty of time to promote a clearer version of what the film is. And writer-director Black, reteaming with his Monster Squad co-writer Fred Dekker for the first time on the big screen, always inspires confidence. His movies are usually hard to compress or explain in two minutes. So, I’m holding out hope. But, as a first unveiling to the world, I wish this was better. The Predator opens September 14.","Jacob Tremblay opening a box was the best thing in the first footage from Shane Black’s The Predator.

Tomé Morrissy-Swan,"W hich is deadlier, a bottle of shampoo or a car? Cars kill thousands through crashes ( 27,010 in the year ending September 2017 ), and their nasty emissions pollute the air. Shampoo, on the other hand, cleans and nourishes our hair. What's not to like? Well, the truth may be a little more complex. Last week, a study was released highlighting some rather worrying facts: regular household cleaning products, from shampoo and deodorant to oven cleaner and bleach, release harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, contributing to up to half of VOCs found in the atmosphere. The research, conducted in Los Angeles but believed to reflect a general global trend, showed that the compounds break down into a particle known as PM2.5, which contributes to 29,000 deaths in the UK each year due to respiratory problems. Joost de Gouw, a scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder and co-author of the study, said: ""Many of the organic compounds in these products are reactive once in the atmosphere and can contribute to formation of two major air pollutants, ozone and fine particle. In that sense, they contribute to air pollution in a very similar manner as cars. ""One difference is that cars also emit nitrogen oxides, another essential ingredient for formation of ozone and fine particles, and these are not released from household and industrial chemical products.""","Which is deadlier, a bottle of shampoo or a car?",2018-02-21T12:02:31Z,"{'id': 'the-telegraph', 'name': 'The Telegraph'}",Clean bill of health: the household products that won't make you ill,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/clean-bill-health-household-products-wont-make/,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2018/02/21/TELEMMGLPICT000155098273-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqg7KjpOCBmI9KRgM60V9a5PE4kCTl6vZ3MRyJSBxKo8w.jpeg,the-telegraph,The Telegraph,deadlier,1

Eddie Makuch,"Epic Games is updating Fortnite again to make changes to the limited-time Avengers: Infinity War mode that features the mega-powerful Thanos and his gauntlet. Specifically, the update will change his attributes to make him more powerful, but also somewhat easier to kill. Starting off Thanos' Beam is now deadlier; it does 20 damage instead of 12. Additionally, punch damage is increased from 80 to 100. Balancing this out somewhat is the fact that Thanos' health now stands at 500 instead of 800. Regarding these changes, Epic said in a post on Reddit, ""Our goal is to allow more folks to truly experience the power of Thanos, while also making you feel powerful when wielding the gauntlet."" Today's update also addresses loot drops in the Infinity Gauntlet mode. With the update, only Rare, Epic, and Legendary-level weapons will spawn, which in turn should give players more firepower to help take down Thanos. The new Fortnite update also makes some general changes, including lowering the height of the battle bus and a bigger storm circle at the start of matches. Additionally, the spawn rate for med kits, chug jugs, and big shields are increased. You can see the full patch notes below. The new mode, Infinity Gauntlet, launched earlier this week. Thanos was too strong at the start, and Epic nerfed the character right away. Thanos Changes Increased Beam from 12 to 20 damage on players. Increased Punch damage from 80 to 100.

Gillian Flaccus / AP,"(PORTLAND, Ore.) — Just two months after a wildfire wiped out Paradise, California, officials are gearing up for this year’s fire season and fear the government shutdown could make it even more difficult than one of the worst in history.
The winter months are critical for wildfire managers who use the break from the flames to prepare for the next onslaught, but much of that effort has ground to a halt on U.S. land because employees are furloughed. Firefighting training courses are being canceled from Tennessee to Oregon, piles of dead trees are untended in federal forests and controlled burns to thin dry vegetation aren’t getting done.
Although the furloughs only affect federal employees, the collaborative nature of wildland firefighting means the pain of the four-week-long shutdown is having a ripple effect — from firefighters on the ground to federal contractors and top managers who control the firefighting strategy.
State and local crews who need training classes, for example, are scrambling without federal instructors. Conservation groups that work with the U.S. Forest Service to plan wildfire-prevention projects on federal lands are treading water. Annual retreats where local, state and federal firefighting agencies strategize are being called off.
The fire season starts as early as March in the southeastern United States, and by April, fires pop up in the Southwest. Last year’s most devastating fire leveled the Northern California town of Paradise just before Thanksgiving, leaving just a few months to prepare between seasons.
“I think a lot of people don’t understand that while there’s not fire going on out there right now, there’s a lot of really critical work going on for the fire season — and that’s not getting done,” said Michael DeGrosky, chief of the Fire Protection Bureau for the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.
It’s especially important with climate change making wildfire seasons longer, deadlier and more destructive.
DeGrosky was supposed to be teaching a course this week for firefighters who want to qualify for the command staff of a fire management team. But the class was canceled without instructors from federal agencies.
Similar classes were called off in Oregon and Tennessee, and others face the same fate as the shutdown drags on. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats are at odds over funding for a border wall.
A dozen senators from Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Colorado, Nevada, West Virginia and Michigan sent a letter this week to Trump warning that the shutdown would put lives at risk this coming fire season. Classes necessary for fire incident managers, smokejumpers and hotshot crews are in jeopardy in the near future, the senators said.
Smokejumpers parachute into remote forests to battle blazes not inaccessible by firefighters on the ground and hotshot crews are small groups of elite firefighters trained to battle the most ferocious flames.
The winter is also when seasonal firefighters apply for jobs, get the required drug tests and move to where they will train and work. In many cases, there’s no one to answer the phone or process the applications, and some potential recruits may decide to work elsewhere to avoid the hassle.
“Even if the shutdown ends and we start hiring people, we will have missed the cream of the crop,” DeGrosky said.
The U.S. Forest Service said in an email that the agency was committed to hiring for temporary and permanent firefighting positions and would continue critical training “to the extent feasible.”
The first session of an apprenticeship program for wildland firefighters went ahead this week, Forest Service spokeswoman Katie O’Connor said.
“The agency is assessing and prioritizing the activities we are able to maintain while in shutdown status. We are unable to speculate on specific impacts while the government shutdown is ongoing and ever-changing,” O’Connor said in a statement.
Conservationists and fire managers say there are other concerns.
Clearing and thinning projects and planned burns on federal land that could lessen fire danger by weeding out flammable debris also are largely on hold in California, Oregon and elsewhere. Private contractors say they have received letters telling them to stop the work.
There’s already a backlog of such projects in federal forests in Oregon and Northern California, said Michael Wheelock, president of Grayback, a private contractor in Grants Pass, Oregon.
Intentional fires can only be set in a narrow winter window before temperatures and humidity falls — and that is rapidly closing, Wheelock said.
“Every week that goes by, it’s going to start increasing the impact,” he said.
Joyce McLean, who lost her and her husband’s home in Paradise last November, supports Trump’s push for a border wall but worries what will happen if firefighters aren’t prepared for next time.
“I hope there are no more forest fires,” said McLean, 74. “I wouldn’t wish that on nobody.”

"Daniel Oberhaus, Kate Lunau, Emanuel Maiberg","On Tuesday, the US National Institutes of Health, the largest biomedical research agency in the world, announced that it would be ending a three-year moratorium on research funding for projects that involve making pathogens stronger and deadlier than they are in nature. Known as “gain-of-function” studies, this type of research is ostensibly about trying to stay one step ahead of nature. By making super-viruses that are more pathogenic and easily transmissible, scientists are able to study the way these viruses may evolve and how genetic changes affect the way a virus interacts with its host. Using this information, the scientists can try to pre-empt the natural emergence of these traits by developing antiviral medications that are capable of staving off a pandemic. If genetically engineering viruses such as influenza, MERS, or SARS to be even stronger and more easily transmissible sounds like a recipe for some Contagion -inspired future hell, you’re not alone in your fears. Even though the storage and use of deadly pathogens is strictly regulated, there’s always the risk they might fall into the wrong hands. In fact, last year former CIA director John Brennan cited “ bio-threats ” from genetically engineered biological warfare agents as one of the top existential risks facing the United States. There’s also the more banal option that a human error could result in the release of a super-pathogen. In 2014, for instance, several different federal labs came under scrutiny by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after samples containing smallpox, anthrax, and the avian flu were mishandled by lab workers. (It turns out no one had been exposed to the agents, but 75 lab workers were monitored for exposure at the anthrax lab.) Such incidents aren’t uncommon: between 2003 and 2009, there were 395 events reported that could have resulted in exposure to toxic agents, although this resulted in just seven infections. Facing increasing public scrutiny over gain-of-function research, in late 2014 the Obama administration put a halt on NIH funding for this type of work until a more robust assessment of its risks and rewards could be undertaken. In 2016, a draft report was issued by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), which found that most gain-of-function research didn’t pose a serious threat to public health. This assessment was largely made following the release of a massive, 1000-page risk assessment published by an independent contractor, which examined everything from the likelihood of a researcher’s glove being punctured to a criminal breaking into a lab. The NSABB’s report also included a set of guidelines for approving gain-of-function research in the future, which was the basis for the stringent approval guidelines released by the NIH today. After the Department of Health and Human Services has assessed a proposed gain-of-function project for the parameters outlined in the report, it can recommend that it receive funding from the NIH for the research. Beyond that, the project will continue to be the subject of review and oversight by the HHS and the institutional body (such as a university) that is hosting the research. While nobody is disputing that more oversight is a good thing, not everyone is convinced that gain-of-function research is worth the risk. As Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told Nature following the news of the end of the funding embargo, gain-of-function research has “done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemics, yet they risked creating an accidental pandemic.”",The NIH lifted a 3-year funding moratorium on “gain-of-function” research meant to make deadly viruses stronger and more transmissible.,2017-12-19T16:41:20Z,"{'id': 'vice-news', 'name': 'Vice News'}",The US Will Fund Research to Make Pathogens Deadlier Again,https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d34vyj/the-us-will-fund-research-to-make-pathogens-deadlier-again,"https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5a393fc1ec16c90e887679da/lede/1513701316559-shutterstock_691541119.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*",vice-news,Vice News,deadlier,1
Reuters,"By: Reuters | Mexico City | Published: September 20, 2018 8:43:23 am Victims’ relatives hold aloft lit cellphones after pouring rain interrupted plans for a candlelight Catholic Mass at Alvaro Obregon 286, where 49 died when their office building collapsed in last year’s 7.1 magnitude earthquake, in Mexico City, Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2018. (AP Photo) Mexicans held a minute of silence on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of devastating earthquakes that struck the country in September 2017, and the postal service honored three search-and-rescue dogs in a stamp. More than 450 people were killed and tens of thousands of homes were damaged when the quakes hit Mexico 12 days apart. Mexicans stood silently in the street with their fists raised aloft just after 1:14 p.m. (1814 GMT), the precise moment the second, deadlier quake struck the capital city and surrounding states on September 19 last year. Quake rescue workers had used the gesture to request quiet as they listened for signs of life below the rubble of fallen buildings. Specially trained dogs searched through the wreckage for survivors, and became symbols of the rescue efforts. The Mexican postal service said in a statement it issued a 15 peso commemorative stamp for navy rescue dogs Frida, Evil and Ecko, showing them decked out in search goggles. All three worked to find trapped victims of both September quakes. The Mexican navy said in July that Frida, a yellow Labrador, was a veteran of eight years of rescue operations extending from Haiti to Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico. In that time, she had found 12 people alive and 41 bodies, the navy said. After the minute’s silence, authorities triggered quake alarms in Mexico City and office workers began filing out of buildings in a mock emergency evacuation. The timing brought back traumatic memories for many city residents, including children who were at school when the quake struck. “My daughter came out crying last year, and I think she’s going to be worried again today,” said Adriana Guerrero, waiting for her child outside a school in the wealthy Polanco area of Mexico City as pupils and teachers evacuated classrooms. The 7.1 magnitude quake hit central Mexico last year hours after a memorial evacuation drill. It killed 370 people, most of them in the capital. Tens of thousands of buildings were damaged, and dozens died as a school and offices collapsed. It followed a separate, 8.2 magnitude quake off the southwest coast on Sept. 7 that killed about 100 people. Hundreds of people in Mexico City have been unable to return to their homes since the quakes and some staged protests on Wednesday to complain about a lack of government support. Even before the disaster last year, Sept. 19 had been ingrained in the minds of older residents of the capital, who remembered a massive 1985 earthquake that killed thousands of people in the city on that date.

PAULA SPAN,"Still, Dr. Betz sees the document as a way to begin a tough conversation, “ideally, early enough to involve the older adult himself in the decision.” Alternatively, gun owners can establish a firearms trust, which is legally binding. A trustee can use a gun until disability, including dementia, or death triggers a provision transferring possession to the other trustees. In some states, families can also turn to involuntary measures like extreme risk protection orders and so-called “red flag laws.” They allow family members or law enforcement officials to seek a court-ordered surrender of guns from people who’ve been determined to be dangerous. The majority of Americans who don’t own or live with guns might find these dilemmas puzzling. Relinquishing guns at older ages often gets compared to giving up car keys, but that analogy has limitations. In many rural and suburban communities with inadequate public transit, older people who can’t drive may face genuinely constricted lives. Guns, on the other hand, don’t seem essential to quality of life. Given that dreadful accidents do happen, and that thousands of older people kill themselves with guns annually, why all the conflict over giving them up? Many gun enthusiasts argue that while driving is a privilege, the Constitution protects keeping and bearing arms. And they find firearms a crucial part of their identities and sense of security. Overriding those instincts when necessary requires planning and tact. Ms. Herrington and a colleague found themselves outside a client’s home one morning this month, waiting with his daughter, a locksmith and the county sheriffs while the man, 79, drove off for breakfast. His dementia had intensified and he’d made alarming financial decisions; a court had given his daughter temporary guardianship.","Suicide and dementia rates are highest in older people, raising questions about their ownership of guns.

Tom Popomaronis,"You always know what you're putting into your body, right? You might want to think twice before buying those supposedly ' all-natural supplements'. It turns out that many supplement products may not always be the same as advertised. Buyer Beware (Seriously...) For example, a lawsuit in 2015 accused GNC of putting synthetic chemicals in purportedly all-natural products. The suit also alleged that GNC obtained supplies from third-party vendors with possibly unsafe and illegal ingredients. Target, Walgreens, and Walmart also found themselves in hot water the same year. An investigation in New York found that four-fifths of the stores' top supplements didn't contain the herbs listed on the labels. Products had cheap substitutes such as beans, carrots, and rice. But why? We know these retail giants didn't manufacture these products. I guess they just didn't ask for (or didn't want to ask) for the supplement test results. It's incredibly essential that supplement manufacturers create products as advertised. Customers don't want to be ripped off when they discover that they spent money on the wrong thing and the heat falls back on the retailers for selling them. For example, one brand of ginseng pills sold at Walgreens claimed to promote ""physical endurance and vitality."" These pills contained nothing more than rice and powdered garlic. So unless you have a carbon-engine body which runs off carbs and spice, such claims are probably inaccurate. A Scary Dose of Reality What's even more concerning is that the wrong dosages or ingredients can be incredibly deadly. Some of GNC's products had unlisted amounts of soybeans and peanuts, both of which can trigger allergic reactions. A Walmart memory enhancing supplement contained wheat, making it hazardous for people with gluten restrictions. Scary stuff indeed, folks. Melatonin supplements, a sleep aid often used by children, could be even deadlier. A study from last year examined 31 different melatonin products from 16 different brands. Researchers found that the melatonin levels ranged from 83-478% of the amount claimed on the label. That means some products had over four times the amount that was listed -- that's just crazy. Excessive amounts of melatonin can cause nausea, dizziness, and counteract certain types of medication. Pregnant women and people with diabetes or pre-diabetes are particularly at risk. Some of the items also had traces of serotonin, which comes from melatonin degradation. This chemical is even more dangerous as it can cause fever, shivering, and even seizures. One of the main problems is that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't closely monitor these supplements. The government organization has a long history of targeting specific products. But the 2015 New York investigation was the first time the FDA ever threatened a big-name retailer with legal action for falsifying information. The Quest for Transparency and Standardization One rising player, Custom Nutra out of Hong Kong, which currently supplies to some of the top organic supplement brands in the USA, hopes to disrupt the supplement industry by changing how products are made, regulated, and advertised. Their international facility undergoes regular FDA inspection and all shipments through DOA inspection prior to their arrival with the retailer. Such rigorous examination has earned Custom Nutra a higher quality feedback rate from supplement distributors who's consumers surveys show better results than most other U.S. supplement manufacturers. Supplement contents are always verified by independent third-party laboratories. The Custom Nutra B2B experience allows retailers and distributors to seamlessly customize and check out products on their e-commerce catalog platform. Buyers know that what they order is lab-tested and made in an FDA-registered facility and all testing documents are made available. Plus, the company offers personalized private labeling for products requested by third-party clients -- Similar to the Everlane retail model, which shows material, labor, and every other cost breakdown, Custom Nutra will bring this level of transparency to customers which they absolutely want (and deserve). Dr. Eric Huntington, President &amp; Clinical Director of Custom Nutra had this to say on the subject of transparency with regard to ingredients in the supplement manufacturing space: ""The biggest deception within the supplement manufacturing industry is the overuse and non-quantification of supplement 'fillers' used in daily vitamin products. These are simply starch and sugar components which, when mixed with raw ingredients, can legally be stated as the full qty ingredient. Huntington continued, ""This keeps vitamin manufacturing costs low and wholesale costs down. So when checking 'Nutrition Facts' on the back of a bottle, the statement of '50mg of Vitamin C' may only be 5mg of vitamin C and 45mg of starch."" Custom Nutra is one of the few supplement manufacturers which can genuinely show test results to their retailers and distributors. The manufacturer can match product specifications like no other, which will establish a precedent for the rest of the industry to follow. It's far too easy for manufacturers to get away with creating misleading or even dangerous products. Every person has the right to know exactly what's going in their body.","Meet Custom Nutra, the international supplements manufacturer tackling it head on.",2018-03-27T21:03:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",A Surprising [and Absent] Dose of Reality About the Supplement Manufacturing Industry,https://www.inc.com/tom-popomaronis/a-surprising-and-absent-dose-of-reality-about-supplement-manufacturing-industry.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_659325668_351110.jpg,,Inc.com,deadlier,1
Scott Smith and Fabiola Sanchez / AP,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Questions and condemnation of Venezuela’s leadership poured in Tuesday following the suspicious death of an opposition activist who authorities say evaded justice by throwing himself from the 10th floor of a police building. Fernando Alban was arrested Friday at Caracas’ international airport upon arrival from a trip to New York to galvanize world opinion against President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government. The country’s chief prosecutor said that Alban killed himself Monday by leaping from the 10th floor of the state police agency’s headquarters, where he was being held for alleged involvement in an international plot to kill Maduro using explosive-laden drones. But opposition leaders, backed by several foreign governments, have cast doubt on the official version, and accused Maduro’s government of torture and murdering the politician. The U.S. State Department said it condemns what it called a human rights violation, while Spain’s leftist government called for consultations the Venezuelan ambassador in Madrid over the death. Meanwhile, the United Nations urged officials in Caracas to launch an impartial probe to resolve the conflicting versions of how Alban died. “There are so many different reports and quite a lot of speculation on exactly what happened,” said Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N.’s top human rights office in Geneva. “Whether Mr. Alban committed suicide, whether he was thrown, or what exactly happened.” As international criticism of Maduro’s government grew, Alban’s family, fellow politicians and family members of other jailed activists paid a final tribute to him Tuesday in a ceremony at the opposition-controlled Congress. A who’s who of opposition leaders took turns filing past Alban’s casket, draped in the Venezuelan flag, while his grief-stricken sister placed a framed portrait of her deeply religious brother shadowed by an image of Jesus Christ. Hours after his death, a few dozen of Alban’s supporters gathered outside the police building yelling “Maduro killer!” contending that he had been murdered. They later assembled outside Caracas’ morgue to demand his body be handed over as rumors spread he would be cremated to hide evidence of possible torture. “There’s no doubt this was an assassination,” opposition leader Julio Borges said in a video from exile in neighboring Colombia, without providing evidence of his claim. “The only thing left for this government is torture, violence and destruction.” While dozens of youths were killed in violent street battles with security forces last year, the death of government opponents while in state custody came as a shock to many Venezuelans, something akin to the far deadlier, right-wing dictatorships that dominated South America in the 1970s that Maduro frequently denounces. The opposition claims that more than 100 Venezuelans opposed to Maduro are being held as “political prisoners,” some for more than four years, with little access to the outside world and their legal rights routinely trampled on. The government denies they are political prisoners. Borges, who led the delegation to the U.N., said Alban’s wife told him that her husband had been under intense pressure to testify against him in the ongoing probe into the alleged plot in early August to kill Maduro using two drones loaded with explosives. More than two dozen people have been jailed on suspicion of involvement in the plot, which Maduro claims was orchestrated by Borges with the support of Colombia and the U.S. Chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab ordered an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Alban’s death, which he classified as a suicide. In brief comments on state TV, he said Alban was in the waiting room of the headquarters of Venezuela’s intelligence police waiting to be transferred to a courthouse when he asked to use the bathroom. He then threw himself from the 10th floor of the building, officials said. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is in Venezuela for meetings with Maduro and his opponents, called Alban’s death while in the government’s custody “disturbing.” “The government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened,” he said in a message posted on Twitter. Also expressing concern was Venezuela’s Catholic bishops’ conference and Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States and a sharp critic of Venezuela’s socialist government, who called Alban’s death “the direct responsibility of a torturing and homicidal regime.” Borges, who said Alban was a personal friend, said the councilman, who represented a district in the Caracas area, was a family man and devout Catholic who would never kill himself. “Alban is a very Christian person, with deep spiritual convictions that go contrary to a decision to take one’s life,” said lawyer Joel Garcia, who has represented Alban. He said he met with Alban the night before in the tribunal and his client had seemed calm. Garcia said authorities cannot determine that a death is a suicide without an investigation and he would ask to be present at the autopsy.",Questions and condemnation of Venezuela's leadership poured in Tuesday following the suspicious death of Fernando Alban.,2018-10-10T03:04:41Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Venezuela’s Leadership Condemned After Death of Dissident Fernando Alban,http://time.com/5420180/venezuela-fernando-alban-dissident-opposition-maduro/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ap18282678209501.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,deadlier,1

Emily Petsko,"Bad news, party planners: Your balloons are killing birds. A new study spotted by Live Science reveals that these colorful decorations often end up in our oceans, where seabirds mistake them for squid and consume them.
The team of Australian researchers studied more than 1700 seabirds belonging to 51 different species. One in three of the birds had plastic in their systems. Researchers also found that the birds had a 20 percent chance of dying after ingesting a single piece of debris. Though hard plastics were consumed in greater quantities by seabirds, balloons proved to be far deadlier. Eating them is 32 times more likely to result in death than ingesting hard plastic, researchers write in their paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Marine debris ingestion is now a globally recognized threat, Lauren Roman, who led the study, said in a statement. Among the birds we studied, the leading cause of death was blockage of the gastrointestinal tract, followed by infections or other complications caused by gastrointestinal obstructions.
The study also highlighted another startling statistic: 99 percent of all seabird species are predicted to ingest marine debris by 2050. That is of great concern in Australasia, which is home to the world's highest biodiversity of seabirds. Albatross and petrel species are particularly under threat, but the exact role that debris plays in that is not fully known.
Similarly, a survey from last December found microplastics in the guts of all seven sea turtle species that were studied, including the endangered green turtle and critically endangered hawksbill and Kemp's ridley turtles. However, these particles are smaller than balloon bits, and the consequences of ingesting microplastics are still being studied.
According to researchers, the most obvious and immediate solution is to reduce the amount of waste entering oceans.

PTI,"Scientists have uncovered why the venom of some snakes makes them so much deadlier than others.
Snakes are infamous for possessing potent venoms, a fact that makes them deadly predators and also strikes fear into humans and other animals alike, said researchers, including those from the Trinity College Dublin in Ireland.
However, some species, such as cobras, boomslangs and rattlesnakes have far more venom than they apparently need. In a single reserve of venom, they have the potential to kill thousands of their prey animals and several adult humans.
Why venoms vary so much in their ability to kill or incapacitate potential prey animals has long puzzled scientists.
The study, published in the journal Ecology Letters, tackled this puzzle by comparing records of venom potency and quantity for over 100 venomous snake species, ranging from rattlesnakes, cobras and the tree dwelling boomslangs of Africa to sea snakes and burrowing asps.
Role of evolution
The team found strong evidence that venoms have evolved to be more potent against animals that are closely related to the species that the snake commonly eats.
These results make sense from an evolutionary viewpoint as we expect that evolution will have shaped venoms to be more efficient at killing the prey animals they are most often the target of the venom, said Kevin Healy from the University of St Andrews in the UK. You wont find many mice in the sea so we wouldnt expect a sea snake to evolve venom that is more effective at killing mice than fish, said Healy, who is now Lecturer of Zoology at the National University of Ireland Galway.
The research also showed that the amount of venom a snake has depends on both its size and the environment it lives in.
Like all substances venom is dosage-dependent, said Andrew Jackson, Associate Professor at Trinity College Dublin. We found that big terrestrial species have the most venom, while smaller tree-dwelling or aquatic species had the least. This difference may be due to how often a snake encounters its prey in these different environments, with terrestrial species requiring a larger reserve of venom to take advantage of the rarer opportunities to feed.
Understanding human snakebites
The results of the study also have potential to aid in our understanding when it comes to human snakebites. Snakebites are a major health concern worldwide, with 2.7 million cases each year, said Chris Carbone from the Zoological Society of London. Understanding how venom evolves may help us better identify the risks to humans from different snake groups, and also potentially from other venomous animals such as spiders, scorpions, centipedes and jellyfish.",The environment holds the key: study,2019-01-10T07:04:17Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Why some snakes are deadlier than others decoded,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/why-some-snakes-are-deadlier-than-others-decoded/article25957695.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/u2oj78/article25957722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COBRA,the-hindu,The Hindu,deadlier,1

Haider says the study was inspired by Elzerie de Jager, a research fellow from Australia who had joined his team in February. Australia has a ban on semiautomatic weapons, and she was shocked by their presence in the U.S. Haider and Jager started looking for a way to create an apples-to-apples comparison of the lethality of different firearm types.

They found 248 such incidents since 2000. The FBI, however, doesn't track what kind of weapon was used in each incident. So they used court and police documents and media reports to figure out what kind of weapon was used. In many cases, multiple types of weapons were used. Semiautomatic rifles were used in 61, o 24%, of incidents, non-semi-automatic rifles in 15, shotguns in 38, and handguns in 187, or 75% of incidents. Shooters with semiautomatic weapons had another weapon 60% of the time; those who did not have a semiautomatic weapon had a second gun 25% of the time. There were 898 people shot across all of the incidents, and 718 died. In the incidents where a semiautomatic weapon was present, 5.5 people were shot on average, compared to 3 people shot when other types of methods were used. Two out of every five people shot died, regardless of whether a semiautomatic weapon was used or not, a result which surprised Haider, a trauma surgeon who expected the longer range and higher velocity of semiautomatic weapons to do more damage. What mattered, he says, was the number of people that the shooter was able to hit. Can this study say for sure that limiting the sale of semiautomatic weapons would make mass shootings less deadly? No. For one thing, the researchers are using historical data, which means it's impossible to say whether other differences account for the greater number of people shot when semi-automatic weapons are used. For instance, it may be that shooters who have more experience with firearms choose semiautomatic weapons. It's also important that those with semiautomatics were more likely to have a second gun. The researchers also did not conduct an analysis comparing semiautomatics to other rifles, instead pooling those results with handguns, which were by far the most common weapon used.

Sven Gustafson,"Pedestrian deaths in the U.S. are climbing at an alarming rate, jumping 46 percent since reaching a low point in 2009, according to federal data. Now, a new study from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety identifies some trends behind the numbers and offers some recommendations. Among the IIHS ' findings: Pedestrian crashes have become not only more frequent, but deadlier, with deaths per 100 crashes with pedestrians rising 29 percent from 2010, when they reached their lowest point, to 2015. Unsurprisingly, the increase is happening mostly in urban and suburban areas, in the dark, and the fatalities are generally happening away from intersections, on busy main roads or arterial roads. It's the last finding that might be especially stinging for the American buying public: Fatal pedestrian crashes are increasingly likely to involve sport utility vehicles or high-powered vehicles, as measured by the ratio of horsepower to weight. IIHS says while pedestrian crashes still most frequently involve cars, fatal single-vehicle crashes involving SUVs increased 81 percent, more than any other type of vehicle. That's leading IIHS to suggest that automakers rethink how they design the very SUVs American car buyers are snapping up in droves. ""SUVs have higher front ends, and often the design for the vehicle is much more vertical than passenger cars,"" IIHS President David Harkey told the Detroit Free Press. ""We do think that the number of SUVs on the roadways now and the size of the vehicles is playing some role."" For years, IIHS has been highlighting the idea of modifying the front ends of vehicles to make them ""softer"" if they strike a pedestrian — via crushable hoods, fender cushion heads, pedestrian airbags and headlights that break away on impact, among other ideas. Automakers have mostly focused on pedestrian-detection systems that trigger automatic emergency braking, such as Subaru 's EyeSight system, which relies on two cameras mounted to the interior roof behind the windshield. IIHS is also urging automakers to develop better headlights, an area it began evaluating as part of its comprehensive crash-test program in 2016. IIHS is also recommending that officials lower speed limits on busy roads that attract pedestrians and make broader use of speed cameras to enforce existing limits. And it says urban planners should design roads with better accommodations for pedestrians, noting that arterial roads often lack mid-road crossing lanes and instead require pedestrians to walk long distances to reach an intersection. Cities and suburbs should also include features like pedestrian-activated beacons or median crossing islands for mid-block crossings, it said. In Detroit, which had the highest pedestrian death rate of major U.S. cities in 2016, the city saw improvements in pedestrian fatalities after installing 65,000 streetlights, according to the Free Press. The 5,987 pedestrian fatalities in 2016, the latest year for which data are available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, represented 16 percent of all crash fatalities. Overall, the number of annual pedestrian fatalities is still down 20 percent compared to 1975, but the 2016 toll was the highest since 1990.

Matt Wales,"A mere two months after Sea of Thieves went positively volcanic with the introduction of its deadly new Devil's Roar region, the multiplayer pirate adventure's next major content update, Shrouded Spoils, is here. Shrouded Spoils is a bit of an interesting one, all told, and it's exact nature has been tricky to pin down prior to its release, thanks to Rare's uncharacteristic secrecy regarding its contents. As it turns out though, it's a pretty meaty update - although the focus this time around is very firmly on fleshing out the existing experience rather than piling on flagship new features. If anything could be considered the headline act though, it's the addition of fog banks, which billow around the world as a new environmental hazard, restricting visibility - and bolstering the ocean's general spookiness - at the most inopportune of times. That's certainly a welcome new feature, but it's Shrouded Spoils' other tweaks and changes that are likely to prove more meaningful in the long-term. For instance, Sea of Thieves' existing AI hazards - the Kraken and the Megalodon - have both received an overhaul, in order to make encounters with them out on the water much more interesting. The Megalodon, for instance, now emerges in a far wider number of varieties, each visually distinct and with their own personalities. These, variants, says Rare, include the Crested Queen, Shadowmaw, Ancient Terror, and the extremely rare Shrouded Ghost. The Kraken, meanwhile, can now be encountered more often, and has been balanced to accomodate all ship types. That means that sloops, once safe from its tentacular clutches, can no longer sail the waters unimpeded. The Kraken's attacks have also been updated, with a new Kraken Slap move added to mix things up a little. Sadly, it doesn't sound like fans will be getting the head they've been clamouring for just yet though. One of the new look Megalodon variants. Importantly, pirates that manage to defeat either of these random encounters will now receive untold riches once the creatures' lifeless corpses sink beneath the waves. That means they're no longer merely bothersome hazards, and players now have a reason to engage them in combat. In fact, Shrouded Sails makes the seas a substantially more hazardous place. Alongside the fog, Kraken, and Megalodon, the skeleton ships that were introduced in July's Cursed Sails update are now also random encounters. Sail long enough and you might be set-upon by either a Skeleton Galleon or a new Skeleton Sloop. Spawns can be either passive (until fired upon) or bloodthirsty - and woe betide those that stumble into the latter ships unprepared. Notably, the new random skeleton ship encounters don't replace the previous wave-based ship events - these can still be enjoyed by heading toward a ship cloud when it appears in the sky. And for those that prefer fighting it out at Skeleton Forts, there's even better news: Shrouded Sails has now activated another six Skeleton Forts on the map - some of which feature particularly unusual layouts - meaning that a total of nine are now in play. Skeleton Sloops now sail the seas. Elsewhere, Shrouded Sails adds new commendations and cosmetics exclusively for Pirate Legends, and it expands the customisation options available for all ship types. Now, it's possible to customise the wheel, capstan, and cannons, alongside sails, hull, and masthead. These new elements are available for purchase at shipwrights throughout the world, with different options available in different biomes. They're not cheap though, so you'll need to get earning that in-game gold. Thankfully, there are a few more ways to do that as of the new update, with Skeleton Forts now also containing Ancient Bone Dusts crates and powerful Stronghold Gunpowder Kegs that can be sold to the Merchant Alliance. What's more, Mermaid Statues - originally introduced back in July - now reward sellable gem stones when smashed to smithereens. A ship fully decked out with the new customisation options. As is the norm for Sea of Thieves' larger-scale updates, Shrouded Spoils brings a whole heap of new Commendation challenges, all themed around the game's latest features. Completing these will earn Doubloons (up to a total of 355 this time around), which can be spend on a selection of limited-time cosmetics - namely the rather striking Wailing Barnacle sails, hull, figurehead, flag, cannons, wheel, and capstan. Alongside the headline features, there are plenty of other tweaks and additions to be found in Shrouded Spoils. Some are big, such as a difficulty rebalance for the beautiful, but occasionally exhausting, Devil's Roar biome, and some are small - players can now, for instance, raise their grog mugs skyward when equipped. As such, it's well worth reading the full patch notes. FOOOOOOOOOOG. Shrouded Spoils will likely be Sea of Thieves' last major update for 2018, but Rare is launching into the new year with a bang. As announced at Microsoft's recent X018 event, a new, entirely separate game mode for PvP players, known as The Arena, is coming early in 2019. Rare has also suggested that a quest-and-story-heavy update is due later in the year.","A mere two months after Sea of Thieves went positively volcanic with the introduction of its deadly new Devil's Roar region, the multiplayer pirate adventure's next major content update, Shrouded Spoils, is here.

Keith Humphreys,"Slightly less than 1 percent of all Americans who died in 1968 lost their lives while serving in the Vietnam War. Yet even the toll of that conflict’s bloodiest year was less significant than that being caused by the opioid epidemic. According to new research, a staggering 1.5 percent of all American deaths in 2016 were attributable to opioids. Young adults are being particularly hard hit by opioids, which now account for 1 of every 5 deaths of Americans aged 25 to 34. Dr. Tara Gomes of St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, who led the research, emphasized the “immense contribution of opioid deaths to overall mortality among young adults, and the burden that this will have on society today, and into the future.” Because of its disproportionate impact on the young, the opioid epidemic robs Americans of more years of life than do prevalent late-life conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and prostate cancer. According to Gomes's and colleagues’ research, the opioid epidemic resulted in almost 1.7 million years of lost life across the U.S. population in 2016. Gomes’s research relied on Center for Disease Control data, which are known to underestimate opioid overdoses by 20-3 percent% ( Wonkblog coverage here ).

Peter Tieryas,"I learned about survival horror from the first Resident Evil, and loved how Resident Evil 2 took that to the next level with a city full of zombies after your neck. When I loaded up the recent Resident Evil 2 remake on my PlayStation 4, it felt like revisiting an old friend, if that old friend happened to be a festering zombie with its guts spilling out of it. At the same time, itd been so long since I played the original, the experience felt freshor maybe rotten is the better way to describe the zombie-infested evening.
Fearless
I began my RE2 campaign playing as Claire rather than Leon, since that was the order Id played the original. In the opening, a truck driver is eating a hamburger that kind of looks like a disgusting slice of zombie brains stuck between buns. He accidentally runs over a zombie, but thinks hes killed a pedestrian. Wracked by guilt, he steps out, unaware that hes about to become zombified. 
The action cuts to a prelude sequence in the gas station that acts as a warmup and tutorial for players. The game begins proper once you reach the Racoon Police Department Station. Ironically, what should be considered the safest place in the city has become one of the most dangerous, as it has been infiltrated by zombies. That inversion amplifies the sense of vulnerability as police officers, traditionally symbols of authority, are getting chomped up as quickly as the civilians. 
The atmosphere within the station itself is genuinely creepy and the remakes graphics are stunningly realistic. The rain showers down like nails, and many of the hallways have busted lights, drowning them in darkness. The zombies are gorier and more voracious than ever. 
But heres the weird thing. Despite how visually repulsive they appeared (like that one corpse whose necks muscles rip apart) and how much deadlier they were than in the original, the zombies didnt scare me. They were obstacles I had to circumvent or take out, not monsters I genuinely feared. 
To be fair, horror games in general dont affect me the way they used to. Fear is, in many cases, a conditioned response learned through experience, and Ive played so many horror games that Ive been conditioned to shrug off most scares. The only time I felt fear in this current console generation has been the VR component of Resident Evil 7, which really got me in a sweat because I felt like I was actually at the Baker Ranch. Outside of VR, though, almost nothing has instilled the same level of fear the original inspired. 
But I wanted to feel that knot of fear forming like a fist in my stomach when I first played horror games, arms tauts and controllers wet from sweat and anxiety. And it did happen in the RE2 remakejust not because of the zombies.
The Orphanage
The first time I felt something akin to fear while playing the RE2 remake was the first time Mr. X appeared next to the helicopter remains. Mr. X is the invincible Tyrant that chases Claire throughout the police station. The encounter was tense the first two times I confronted him. But after that, I realized I was able to outrun him in most situations and never felt threatened by his appearance again. (I havent confronted Mr. X in Leons playthrough yet, so he may be more deadly there.) A big part of this is also because the more frequently you see something, the less afraid you become of it. This is the case with the Nemesis from Resident Evil 3, the relentless ghosts in what I consider to be one of the most underrated horror games around, Silent Hill 4, and even Scissorman in the original Clock Tower.
The first time I felt palpable fear in the remake was playing as another character, Sherry Birkin. Sherry is a young girl whos trying to get to her parents and is hiding underneath the police station. After Claire sees her, she tries to help them both escape. Unfortunately, theyre stopped by the chief of police, Brian Irons.
In the original RE2, the first time you meet Chief Irons, hes inside his office and has the corpse of the mayors daughter on his desk. A corrupt officer, he has a sadistic obsession with hunting animals that culminates in him targeting humans. Believing that hes been infected with the T-virus, hes doing his best to kill everyone in town, even causing disruptions among the police to ensure their failure. 
In the remake, even before his first actual appearance, we get a sense of who he is in the taxidermy notes we find in his office. He writes about hunting a White-Tailed Deer and states, Im getting tired of working on these puny things. May be time to move on to more challenging animals. Each of his targets gets progressively bigger, and theres an ominous undercurrent to his need for more stimulation, with the final note describing a529-pound Siberian Tiger: I nearly came when I sliced its yellow belly open and its warm guts spilled out. I still smell of wild beast. This is the life. 
In the first encounter with Chief Irons, he threatens to kill Claire at gunpoint. He then orders Sherry to tie Claires hands up and shouts hell shoot Claire if Sherry doesnt comply. He has no compunctions, ruthlessly threatening the young kid to get what he wants. Once Claire is tied up, Irons smashes his pistol into Claires face and takes Sherry away. 
Shortly afterwards, you actually play as Sherry, locked by the chief inside a room in the orphanage. The fact that youre weaponless and just a child means you have no means of fighting back. What makes this sequence so terrifying are the circumstances and the uncertainty of what awaits. Whereas Claire in her worst condition can still fend off zombies, Sherry has no chance. She escapes the room shes locked in after solving a simple block puzzle. 
In the hall, the purple walls have childrens art on them, which is an ominous contrast with all the violence thats surrounding them. Theres even a poster with words written by a child that read Dont run!! This hasdisturbing connotations since all Sherry can do is run. 
She makes her way through the nursery, then down the stairs in the main hall. She finds Toms diary, an orphan who writes about another one of the children, Oliver. Oliver came back in the middle of the night, all messed up, screaming help me and stuff! I didnt even recognize him at first; his face was all peeling and melted off. Whats more messed up is that the adults try to cover it up by calling it a skin thing thatll get better soon. Some type of experimentation was going on using the orphanage kids, and Chief Irons was either in charge of it or helped expedite the process.
The door out of the orphanage is locked so she has to sneak her way to the directors room. There, the corpse of the mayors daughter, Katherine Warren, is lying on the table. Theres no explanation given for how she got there. But as she hasnt turned into a putrefied zombie, chances are good this is Chief Irons doing. The chemicals bottles around her indicate hes going to be doing some dissecting. When Sherry grabs the key, Irons shows up. But he doesnt appear at all perturbed that Sherry has seen the dead body. Instead, he angrily tries to seize Sherry. Sherry, defending herself, grabs a bottle of acid and flings it in his face, causing half of it burn off.
Furious and in pain, Irons chases Sherry. It is a terrifying pursuit as the spaces are tight and Sherry has no way to fight back. Sherry hides in the nursery, but Irons comes in and locks the door. Sherry is trapped inside with him and I found myself extremely stressed. Half his face burned by acid, he looked more monstrous than the zombies. The police chief swings his flashlight around, searching for Sherry. I sucked at this section and kept on getting caught, leading to the game over screen with a YOU ARE TRAPPED. This sequence is the only place I actually died in my playthrough. 
Zombies are deadly, but theyre also just flesh-eating automatons. Monsters like Chief Irons are much more insidious, able to stalk his victims and hunt them down. If Irons wasnt in so much pain from the acid, he could have been getting a kick out of tracking Sherry, which is really unnerving to even consider. 
Eventually, because I sucked, my wife, who was playing with me, snuck around Chief Irons. Irons eventually runs to the restroom to wash his face. We retrieved the key and began running towards the front of the orphanage. Sherry was able to unlock the door, but chains held it together from the outside so she couldnt escape that way. She had to run back to the directors room. Along the way, theres an eerie Shining tribute, with the chief breaking down a door with an axe.
I wondered to myself, why was I much more scared here than at any other part of the game? 
Itll Get Better Soon
A few days after I finished Claires part of Resident Evil 2, I went with my wife and our new baby for a checkup at our local clinic. We checked in and were waiting in the lobby upstairs when I suddenly heard shouting at the front of the clinic. A woman was asking to come inside with her daughter, but security had shut the door and locked it. Im sorry, maam, the guard said, and told her that the whole clinic was on lockdown. They could not let anyone in. The woman begged to be given entry with her daughter and the exchange became more and more tense.
I was confused, wondering what was going on. A nurse came out, called us, and told us we needed to get inside ASAP. Above, we could hear a helicopter patrolling the area. 
It turned out there was a shooting nearby and security had determined the clinic had to go on lockdown to protect it from something like a hostage situation. We were taken to a patients room where we waited to hear news about the shooting. It was tense and I hoped theyd catch the shooter soon. 
A zombie apocalypse is terrifying to countenance, but more in the realm of fantasy than reality. But a human murdering others? Its unfortunately become too much an accepted part of our cultural consciousness, considering almost 40,000 gun deaths were reported in 2017. The idea that there was a shooter nearby our hospital was horrifying. My fear turned into anger as I sat there helplessly with my wife and my daughter, wondering what was going to happen next. I had to start calculating, what do I do if a shooter gets into the hospital? How will I be able to protect my family? Even with a gun of my own, would I really have a chance against someone who might be carrying an automatic machine gun? I have had serious conversations with friends whove told me theyve been doing serious research about bulletproof backpacks for their kids.
We ended up staying for most of the day at the clinic until the police and security gave the all-clear. I dont know if they caught the shooter, or they just got away. But I felt like part of the undead after that, so burnt out from the stress. 
Unlike the zombies, who are relatively dumb, Chief Irons is the human kind of monster preying on Sherry. His threat felt so much more real than anything else in the campaign. When Sherry finally gets caught by the chief, he yells, The game is over. 
The chief gets his comeuppance thanks to Sherrys father, William Birkin, whos become an even deadlier monster. He parasitizes the chief, who dies when the embryo rips its way out of his chest. 
I hope my kid never has to deal with human monsters. But the fear that feels all too real is what made this sequence so terrifying for me.","I learned about survival horror from the first Resident Evil, and loved how Resident Evil 2 took that to the next level with a city full of zombies after your neck.

Caroline Praderio and Leah Rocketto,"On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report ranking the most commonly used drugs involved in overdoses in the United States. The report, which analyzed death certificates for drug overdose deaths between 2011 and 2016, revealed fentanyl to be the deadliest drug in the country. According to the report, drug overdoses from the synthetic opioid have increased exponentially over the last five years. In 2011, fentanyl accounted for 4% of drug overdoses; in 2016, it accounted for 28.8%. The increase is not that surprising, as opioid use has continued to rise in the US, according to a March CDC report. Read more: A deadly drug epidemic sweeping the US has caused ER visits for overdoses to jump 30% This marks the first time in four years that heroin was not the most commonly-used drug involved in overdoses. That said, heroin still ranked high on the list, accounting for 25.1% of overdoses. Other drugs on the list include cocaine, oxycodone, and diazepam. Here is a breakdown of the 10 deadliest drugs in America. Fentanyl Fentanyl is a man-made opioid that's 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Like other opioid drugs, it works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, driving up dopamine levels and leading to euphoria and relaxation. Read more : Why fentanyl is deadlier than heroin, in a single photo Fentanyl is used legally to treat pain in medical settings. It can be administered by injection, a skin patch, or lozenges. But in the US, most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdoses, death, and harm are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the CDC. On the street, it can be found as powder or pills. It also may be mixed with heroin or disguised as another, less potent opioid painkiller like oxycodone. Fentanyl's potency means it comes with a high risk of overdose, especially if the user doesn't know that a powder or pill contains the drug, according to NIDA. Heroin Heroin is an illicit opioid drug that's made from morphine, according to NIDA. It can be a white or brown powder or a sticky black substance that's known as black tar heroin, and it can be injected, snorted, or smoked. Like other opioid drugs, it works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain. In this Feb. 16, 2017, photo, a discarded syringe sits in the dirt with other debris under a highway overpass where drug users are known to congregate in Everett, Wash. Associated Press/Elaine Thompson Just as with other opioids, people who use it can experience fatal overdoses. Cocaine Cocaine is a powerful psychostimulant that, according to the American Addictions Center, is the second most trafficked drug in the United States. Like other stimulants, is works by activating key pleasure centers within the brain to cause a heightened euphoria Cocaine accounted for 17.8% of drug-related deaths in 2016. Spencer Platt/Getty In the early 1900s, a purified cocaine was used as a painkiller and to treat a variety of illnesses. (It was also used as an ingredient in the original Coca-Cola recipe.) It can still be administered by doctors for legitimate medical uses, but those instances are few and far between. Methamphetamine More commonly referred to as meth or crystal, methamphetamine is another stimulant drug that comes in the form of a powder. Users smoke, snort, or inject it, according to MedlinePlus. Read more: This graphic shows how widespread meth is in the United States Continued use of meth can alter the brain, resulting in reduced coordination and impaired verbal learning. Meth use has also been found to affect areas of the brain involved with emotion and memory. In addition to the mental impact, the drug produces many physical side effects — specifically in the mouth. According to the American Dental Association, meth use can result in tooth decay that ranges from discoloration to crumbling of teeth. Alprazolam Alprazolam is classified as a benzodiazepine — a type of drug often used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. Unlike stimulants, these type of drugs work by decreasing extreme levels of excitement in the brain. Xanas is a type of benzodiazepines. Wikimedia Commons Since alprazolam and other benzodiazepines are prescription drugs, many abusers have legitimate uses for them in the beginning. But the addiction-forming chemical properties combined with the side effects can make it easy for people to become addicted over time. In an effort to obtain the drugs, the American Addictions Center notes that people will ""doctor shop"" or turn to friends, family members, or co-workers for a fix. This is comparable to opioid use and abuse. There are many people who need opioids to treat chronic pain. In fact, more than 30% of overdoses involving opioids also involved benzodiazepines. This connection leads one to wonder what more we can be doing to monitor prescription drugs in the US. Oxycodone Oxycodone falls under the opiate classification, and it is used to treat moderate to severe pain. According to the CDC report, oxycodone was deemed the deadliest drug in 2011. Since then, it has been surpassed by other opioids. Oxycodone is safe in small, prescribed doses. John Moore/Getty Images Prescription opioids like oxycodone are generally safe for treating pain when used for a short period of time, but because they can make people feel relaxed or high, some people misuse the medications. They may take the drugs other than way they're prescribed, take someone else's prescription, or take them to just get high. Methadone Methadone is a medication that's long been used to treat opioid addiction in adults. It helps relieve the painful withdrawal symptoms and can block the euphoric effects of opioids like heroin, according to the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). It's taken once a day in either a pill, liquid, or water form. Read more : There's a science-backed treatment for drug addiction that works — but it's nearly impossible to get It's safe and effective when taken as prescribed. In fact, methadone is one of a handful of medications that, in combination with behavioral therapy, are shown to reduce opioid use and overdose deaths. Still, methadone overdose is possible if an individual accidentally or intentionally takes more than recommended or normal amount, according to the NIH. Morphine Morphine is another type of prescription opioid that's used to treat pain. It can be isolated from the opium poppy plant or produced synthetically, according to PubChem, a chemical database run by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). When prescribed by doctors, it comes as a liquid, pill, or capsule, according to the NIH. Today, 21 to 29% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain end up misusing them, while between 8 and 12% develop an opioid use disorder, according to NIDA. People who use morphine can overdose on it, too. Hydrocodone Like morphine and fentanyl, hydrocodone (brand name: Vicodin) is another prescription opioid used to treat pain. It can be prescribed in capsule or tablet form. It may also be misused and lead to overdoses. Diazepam Like alprazolam, diazepam is a type of benzodiazepine used to relieve anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures, according to MedlinePlus. It is also, as the site noted, used to control agitation caused by alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepine is a type of CNS depressants, which NIDA reports is one of the three most misused prescription drugs in the United States. Police have begun monitoring prescriptions in an effort to crack down on abuse.

ABC News,"Thousands of demonstrators are expected to turn out Saturday for March for Our Lives events across the country in support of school safety, spearheaded by the survivors of last month’s Parkland, Florida, school shooting. What many of the participants may not realize is that Saturday is also, coincidentally, the 20th anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings of its time. But for Mitch Wright, whose wife was the middle school teacher shot to death at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, March 24, 1998, the timing of the march is not so much a coincidence as an act of God, he says. The March date caught him off guard, Wright told ABC News, because “no one really outside our area really realizes what the 24th represents.” Back in 1998, the Jonesboro attack was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, with four students and a teacher, 32-year-old Shannon Wright, killed and 10 others injured. Officials examine the scene at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Ark., March 24, 1998, after two boys fired on teachers and students. Now, 20 years later, the numbers have continued to rise. There have been eight deadlier school shootings in the past two decades – including those at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook and Marjory Stoneman Douglas – and there have been three others that have had the same number of fatalities as Jonesboro. “The history behind these in the last 20 years, it’s kind of like this: You get a lot of coverage, you get a lot of lawmakers who are typically really adamant about making changes, making promises, and they typically jump ship kind of quick, as soon as the NRA starts pulling their strings,” Wright, 52, said. Parkland comparisons There are stark commonalities in the aftermath of so many school shootings, including the stories of the victims who died young or the acts of selfless teachers. But another similarity between the Jonesboro and Parkland shootings stands out to former federal agent David Chipman. In the Florida Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, for instance, suspect Nikolas Cruz, 19, allegedly pulled the fire alarm at the school and then started firing his AR-15 style weapon at students in the hallway. A notably similar scene unfolded at Westside Middle School 19 years and 11 months earlier. Jonesboro shooters Andrew Golden, then-11, and Mitchell Johnson, then-13, pulled the fire alarm after lunch and stood outside the door where they knew students would be fleeing. Then they opened fire. “The way in which they did it - pulled the fire alarm and then lay in wait for kids to leave the school - it's certainly a cautionary tale for people who are planning to improve school security today,” said Chipman, who now works as a senior policy adviser at gun violence prevention advocacy group Giffords. Backpacks and cleaning supplies lie in the hallway of Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Ark., March 25, 1998. The view is from a door used by students to leave the building during a false fire alarm, followed by a shooting. As for Wright, the slain Jonesboro school teacher’s husband, “I have never watched any [coverage] of these school shootings – I can’t.” But that was before the Parkland shooting unfolded before his eyes Feb. 14 when he found himself at an airport surrounded by televisions showing the breaking news. “I’m stuck watching this, so I’m seeing all this take place and I don’t really know what’s going on,” Wright said. “I found out this guy [Cruz] apparently pulled a fire alarm and it sent chills,” he said. Facing the anniversary The start to every year is difficult for Wright because March 24 looms. “When January comes around, it’s like ‘OK, here it comes, February [same], March, you start feeling it,’” he said. “The shooting in Florida really opened the floodgates a whole lot quicker than they normally do. It’s been real tough this week. You just get through it… It’s like a continuous stress ball that you don’t want anyone to ever have to feel,” he said. A mourner carries the Wright family portrait to the gravesite of slain Westside Middle School teacher Shannon Wright before burial services, March 28, 1998, in Jonesboro, Ark. Wright is “hopeful” about the new wave of activism that the Parkland students are leading, he said, adding thathe’s happy about the March for Our Lives events, especially the one set to take over Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. “If I could pick somewhere to go [on the anniversary], I would love to go and witness that. I would love to go to D.C. and see those kids march. It would be nice,” he said. A trip to the nation’s capital doesn’t seem like it will be in the cards for Wright, though. He said that he typically spends the day with his and Shannon’s 22-year-old son, who was 2 at the time of the shooting, doing something like playing golf “to try and escape everything.” As for the students in Jonesboro, who happen to be on spring break this week, there is a March for Our Lives event scheduled at Jonesboro High School Saturday, and the community last week hosted its annual memorial motorcycle ride that raises funds to maintain the garden dedicated to the victims of the 1998 shooting. “It boils down to this: You just don’t want another family to go through this. It doesn’t matter what anniversary it is,” Wright said. “They're still gone and it still hurts.”","Twenty years ago, the Jonesboro, Ark., attack was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, with four students and a teacher killed and 10 others injured.",2018-03-22T11:07:31Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",March for Our Lives falls on 20th anniversary of deadly Jonesboro school shooting,http://abcnews.go.com/US/march-lives-falls-20th-anniversary-deadly-jonesboro-school/story?id=53873395,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/jonesboro-ap-4-er-180320_hpEmbed_2_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,deadlier,1

This silly stop-motion short has a group of Predators invading the North Pole and engaging in violent battle with Santa Claus, his reindeer, and more. It’s kind of stupid! But it’s short enough that you might get a good laugh. Watch the Predator Holiday Special below.
This Predator Holiday Special is mildly amusing! That’s the most energy I can muster here. The concept is a riff on the old stop-motion Rankin/Bass holiday specials, but with a much higher body count. As the special starts, an elf is cheerfully chatting with a reindeer at the North Pole. And then all hell breaks loose when Predators start attacking! All of Santa’s reindeer just happen to be armed, though, so a fight ensues.
Throughout the special, blunt references to the first Predator are peppered in: a recreation of the famous bicep-flexing handshake; a character saying “I ain’t got time to bleed!”, and so on. You get the idea. It’s interesting that the reason this exists is to help advertise the latest Predator film from Shane Black, and yet there’s no reference to it at all. I suppose they thought the brand was strong enough to stand on its own.
The Predator is now available on digital and Blu-ray, and while this holiday special isn’t included in the special features, several other items are. Check them out below.

"USA Today, The Editorial Board, USA Today","Painkillers (Photo: John Moore, Getty Images) Even as more than 64,000 people in America died in 2016 of drug overdoses — 40 a day from prescription opioids alone — doctors continued promiscuously writing prescriptions for the drivers of this horrifying epidemic. Far too many physicians haven't changed their prescribing habits, even in the face of government guidance, state restrictions, heavy news coverage and studies showing the advantages of other painkillers. More than 61 million people — one out of every four adults in America — received at least one prescription for an opioid painkiller in 2016. Are Americans really supposed to believe that roughly one-quarter of adults is in enough pain to require heavy-duty painkillers? AMA: We're helping to end overdose epidemic In New Hampshire on Monday, President Trump announced his latest plan to deal with the epidemic. His call for emulating countries that execute drug dealers garnered most of the headlines. And the plan, like his declaration last fall that the crisis was a public health emergency, lacked sufficient detail and funding. But at least on the prevention side of the problem, the president was on to something when he said that ""the best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with."" He set a goal of reducing opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years, and ensuring that federally reimbursed prescriptions follow best practices. Physicians, many of them well-meaning, helped fuel the crisis by handing out opioids like candy. Now they can be of enormous help in bringing it under control by preventing the creation of new addicts. The challenge is to act with a scalpel and not a sledgehammer, so as not to drive addicts to even deadlier street drugs, or to deny needed medication to people with chronic pain. Maddeningly, many of the doctors who are part of the problem have shown little inclination to solve it. Some are even profiting from their association with opioid makers. Opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors six-figure sums for speaking, consulting and other services in 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis by CNN and Harvard researchers published last week. Thousands of other doctors were paid more than $25,000 during that period. Most disturbing was that those prescribing large amounts of drugs were the most likely to get paid. The researchers couldn’t link the payments to prescribing, which a spokesman for the American Medical Association was quick to point out. It’s “not a cause and effect relationship,” said Patrice Harris, who heads the AMA’s opioid task force. Nor is taking payments illegal, unless it is proved that doctors are prescribing in exchange for kickbacks. But addiction expert Andrew Kolodny of Brandeis University cut right to the chase. ""It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics,"" he told CNN. At the very least, shouldn’t money from manufacturers that originally marketed these drugs as non-addictive, and helped produce a generation of addicts, be considered off-limits? Shouldn’t doctors and their associations be embarrassed by such relationships and call for them to end? Recent research has also shown that for arthritis pain, other drugs work as well as opioids. For what’s known as osteoarthritis, over-the-counter Tylenol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical lidocaine patches worked as well — and in some cases better — at treating long-term pain. To end overprescribing, several states have passed laws limiting initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to about a week. New Jersey, with the strictest law, set a five-day limit. These restrictions are blunt tools, but when other efforts have cut prescriptions by less than 15% since 2013, they become necessary. Prescription opioids, dangerous in their own right, have become gateways to heroin, to illicit fentanyl and too often to death. A top priority for any new strategy is to keep more people from walking through that door in the first place. If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.

Scot Paltrow,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama rode into office in 2009 with promises to work toward a nuclear-free world. His vow helped win him the Nobel Peace Prize that year. FILE PHOTO - Democratic US presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) meets with his foreign policy panel of former U.S. officials including former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (2nd R) and former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry (R) at a hotel in Washington June 18, 2008. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo The next year, while warning that Washington would retain the ability to retaliate against a nuclear strike, he promised that America would develop no new types of atomic weapons. Within 16 months of his inauguration, the United States and Russia negotiated the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, meant to build trust and cut the risk of nuclear war. It limited each side to what the treaty counts as 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. By the time Obama left office in January 2017, the risk of Armageddon hadn’t receded. Instead, Washington was well along in a modernization program that is making nearly all of its nuclear weapons more accurate and deadly. And Russia was doing the same: Its weapons badly degraded from neglect after the Cold War, Moscow had begun its own modernization years earlier under President Vladimir Putin. It built new, more powerful ICBMs, and developed a series of tactical nuclear weapons. The United States under Obama transformed its main hydrogen bomb into a guided smart weapon, made its submarine-launched nuclear missiles five times more accurate, and gave its land-based long-range missiles so many added features that the Air Force in 2012 described them as “basically new.” To deliver these more lethal weapons, military contractors are building fleets of new heavy bombers and submarines. President Donald Trump has worked hard to undo much of Obama’s legacy, but he has embraced the modernization program enthusiastically. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to complete a review of the U.S. nuclear arsenal by the end of this year. Reuters reported in February that in a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump denounced the New START treaty and rejected Putin’s suggestion that talks begin about extending it once it expires in 2021. Some former senior U.S. government officials, legislators and arms-control specialists – many of whom once backed a strong nuclear arsenal -- are now warning that the modernization push poses grave dangers. “REALLY DANGEROUS THINKING” They argue that the upgrades contradict the rationales for New START - to ratchet down the level of mistrust and reduce risk of intentional or accidental nuclear war. The latest improvements, they say, make the U.S. and Russian arsenals both more destructive and more tempting to deploy. The United States, for instance, has a “dial down” bomb that can be adjusted to act like a tactical weapon, and others are planned. “The idea that we could somehow fine tune a nuclear conflict is really dangerous thinking,” says Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based think tank. One leader of this group, William Perry, who served as defense secretary under President Bill Clinton, said recently in a Q&amp;A on YouTube that “the danger of a nuclear catastrophe today is greater than it was during the Cold War.” Perry told Reuters that both the United States and Russia have upgraded their arsenals in ways that make the use of nuclear weapons likelier. The U.S. upgrade, he said, has occurred almost exclusively behind closed doors. “It is happening without any basic public discussion,” he said. “We’re just doing it.” Podcast: America’s Secret Nuclear Upgrades The cause of arms control got a publicity boost in October when the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a Geneva organization, won the Nobel Peace Prize for its role in getting the United Nations General Assembly in July to adopt a nuclear prohibition treaty. The United States, Russia and other nuclear powers boycotted the treaty negotiations. The U.S. modernization program has many supporters in addition to Trump, however. There is little or no pressure in Congress to scale it back. Backers argue that for the most part the United States is merely tweaking old weapons, not developing new ones. Some say that beefed up weapons are a more effective deterrent, reducing the chance of war. Cherry Murray served until January as a top official at the Energy Department, which runs the U.S. warhead inventory. She said the reduction in nuclear weapon stockpiles under New START makes it imperative that Washington improve its arsenal. During the Cold War, Murray said in an interview, the United States had so many missiles that if one didn’t work, the military could simply discard it. With the new limit of 1,550 warheads, every one counts, she said. “When you get down to that number we better make sure they work,” she said. “And we better make sure our adversaries believe they work.” An Obama spokesman said the former president would not comment for this story. The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Asked about Trump’s view on the modernization program, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said the president’s goal is to create a nuclear force that is “modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies.” A BUDGET BUSTER? The U.S. modernization effort is not coming cheap. This year the Congressional Budget Office estimated the program will cost at least $1.25 trillion over 30 years. The amount could grow significantly, as the Pentagon has a history of major cost overruns on large acquisition projects. As defense secretary under Obama, Leon Panetta backed modernization. Now he questions the price tag. “We are in a new chapter of the Cold War with Putin,” he told Reuters in an interview, blaming the struggle’s resumption on the Russian president. Panetta says he doubts the United States will be able to fund the modernization program. “We have defense, entitlements and taxes to deal with at the same time there are record deficits,” he said. New START is leading to significant reductions in the two rival arsenals, a process that began with the disintegration of the USSR. But reduced numbers do not necessarily mean reduced danger. In 1990, the year before the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States had more than 12,000 warheads and the Soviets just over 11,000, an August 2017 Congressional Research Service report says. Soon the two countries made precipitous cuts. The 1991 START treaty limited each to somewhat more than 6,000 warheads. By 2009 the number was down to about 2,200 deployed warheads. Tom Collina, policy director of the Ploughshares Fund, an arms control group, says that both Moscow and Washington are on track to meet the 1,550 limit by the treaty’s 2018 deadline. The treaty, however, allows for fudging. At Russia’s insistence, each bomber is counted as a single warhead, no matter how many nuclear bombs it carries or has ready for use. As a result, the real limit for each side is about 2,000. Collina says the United States currently has 1,740 deployed warheads, and Russia is believed to have a similar number. Each side also has thousands of warheads in storage and retired bombs and missiles awaiting dismantlement. The declining inventories mask the technological improvements the two sides are making. There is a new arms race, based this time not on number of weapons but on increasing lethality, says William Potter, director of nonproliferation studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo “We are in a situation in which technological advances are outstripping arms control,” Potter says. One example of an old weapon transformed into a more dangerous new one is America’s main hydrogen bomb. The Air Force has deployed the B61 bomb on heavy bombers since the mid-1960s. Until recently, the B61 was an old-fashioned gravity bomb, dropped by a plane and free-falling to its target. THE MOST EXPENSIVE BOMB EVER Now, the Air Force has transformed it into a controllable smart bomb. The new model has adjustable tail fins and a guidance system which lets bomber crews direct it to its target. Recent models of the bomb had already incorporated a unique “dial-down capacity”: The Air Force can adjust the explosion. The bomb can be set to use against enemy troops, with a 0.3 kiloton detonation, a tiny fraction of the Hiroshima bomb, or it can level cities with a 340-kiloton blast with 23 times the force of Hiroshima’s. Similar controls are planned for new cruise missiles. The new B61 is the most expensive bomb ever built. At $20.8 million per bomb, each costs nearly one-third more than its weight in 24 karat gold. The estimated price of the planned total of 480 bombs is almost $10 billion. Congress also has approved initial funding of $1.8 billion to build a completely new weapon, the “Long Range Stand-Off” cruise missile, at an estimated $17 billion total cost. The cruise missiles, too, will be launched from aircraft. But in contrast to stealth bombers dropping the new B61s directly over land, the cruise missiles will let bombers fly far out of range of enemy air defenses and fire the missiles deep into enemy territory. Obama’s nuclear modernization began diverging from his original vision early on, when Republican senators resisted his arms reduction strategy. Former White House officials say Obama was determined to get the New START treaty ratified quickly. Aside from hoping to ratchet down nuclear tensions, he considered it vital to assure continued Russian cooperation in talks taking place at the time with Iran over that country’s nuclear program. Obama also feared that if the Senate didn’t act by the end of its 2010 session, the accord might never pass, according to Gary Samore, who served four years as the Obama White House’s coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction. Obama hit resistance from then-Senator Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona. Kyl, the Senate’s minority whip, assembled enough Republicans to kill the treaty. In e-mailed answers to questions, Kyl said he opposed the accord because Russia “cheats” on treaties and the United States lacks the means to verify and enforce compliance. Moscow’s deployment of new tactical weapons since 2014, he said, was a violation of the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. (Russia denies violating the treaty.) Kyl also faulted New START for omitting Russia’s large arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons for use on battlefields, a subject the Russians have refused to discuss. But Kyl proved willing to let the treaty pass – for a price. In exchange for ratification, the White House would have to agree to massive modernization of the remaining U.S. weapons. Obama agreed, and the Senate passed the treaty on the last day of the 2010 session. Samore, the former White House arms control coordinator, says Obama did not oppose taking steps to refurbish superannuated weapons. He just did not plan the costly decision to do it all at once, Samore said. DESTABILIZING THE STATUS QUO While the number of warheads and launch vehicles is limited by the treaty, nothing in it forbids upgrading the weaponry or replacing older arms with completely new and deadlier ones. Details of the modernized weapons show that both are happening. The upshot, according to former Obama advisers and outside arms-control specialists, is that the modernization destabilized the U.S.-Russia status quo, setting off a new arms race. Jon Wolfsthal, a former top advisor to Obama on arms control, said it is possible to have potentially devastating arms race even with a relatively small number of weapons. The New START treaty limits the number of warheads and launch vehicles. But it says nothing about the design of the “delivery” methods – land- and submarine-based ballistic missiles, hydrogen bombs and cruise missiles. Thus both sides are increasing exponentially the killing power of these weapons, upgrading the delivery vehicles so that they are bigger, more accurate and equipped with dangerous new features – without increasing the number of warheads or vehicles. The United States, according to an article in the March 1 issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, has roughly tripled the “killing power” of its existing ballistic missile force. The article’s lead author, Hans Kristensen, director of the Federation of American Scientists’ Nuclear Information Project, said in an e-mail that he knows of no comparable estimate for Russia. He noted, however, that Russia is making its own extensive enhancements, including larger missiles and new launch vehicles. He said Russia also is devoting much effort to countering U.S. missile defense systems. The U.S. modernization program “has implemented revolutionary new technologies that will vastly increase the targeting capability of the U.S. ballistic missile arsenal,” Kristensen wrote in the article. “This increase in capability is astonishing.” Kristensen says the most alarming change is America’s newly refitted submarine-launched Trident II missiles. These have new “fuzing” devices, which use sensors to tell the warheads when to detonate. Kristensen says that for decades, Tridents had inaccurate fuzes. The missiles could make a direct hit on only about 20 percent of targets. With the new fuzes, “they all do,” he says. Under New START, 14 of America’s Ohio Class subs carry 20 Tridents. Each Trident can be loaded with up to 12 warheads. (The United States has four additional Ohio subs that carry only conventional weapons.) The Trident II’s official range is 7,456 miles, nearly one-third the Earth’s circumference. Outside experts say the real range almost certainly is greater. Each of its main type of warhead produces a 475-kiloton blast, almost 32 times that of Hiroshima. RUSSIA‘S DIRTY DRONE Russia, too, is hard at work making deadlier strategic weapons. Ploughshares estimates that both sides are working on at least two dozen new or enhanced strategic weapons. Russia is building new ground-based missiles, including a super ICBM, the RS-28 Sarmat. The Russian missile has room for at least 10 warheads that can be aimed at separate targets. Russian state media has said that the missile could destroy areas as large as Texas or France. U.S. analysts say this is unlikely, but the weapon is nonetheless devastatingly powerful. Russia’s new ICBMs have room to add additional warheads, in case the New START treaty expires or either side abrogates it. The United States by its own decision currently has only a single warhead in each of its ICBMS, but these too have room for more. Russia has phased in a more accurate submarine-launched missile, the RSM-56 Bulava. While it is less precise than the new U.S. Tridents, it marks a significant improvement in reliability and accuracy over Russia’s previous sub-based missiles. A Russian military official in 2015 disclosed a sort of doomsday weapon, taking the idea of a “dirty bomb” to a new level. Many U.S. analysts believe the disclosure was a bluff; others say they believe the weapon has been deployed. The purported device is an unmanned submarine drone, able to cruise at a fast 56 knots and travel 6,200 miles. The concept of a dirty bomb, never used to date, is that terrorists would spread harmful radioactive material by detonating a conventional explosive such as dynamite. In the case of the Russian drone, a big amount of deadly radioactive material would be dispersed by a nuclear bomb. The bomb would be heavily “salted” with radioactive cobalt, which emits deadly gamma rays for years. The explosion and wind would spread the cobalt for hundreds of miles, making much of the U.S. East Coast uninhabitable. A documentary shown on Russian state TV said the drone is meant to create “areas of wide radioactive contamination that would be unsuitable for military, economic, or other activity for long periods of time.” Reif of the Arms Control Association says that even if the concept is only on the drawing board, the device represents “really outlandish thinking” by the Russian government. “It makes no sense strategically,” he said, “and reflects a really egregiously twisted conception about what’s necessary for nuclear deterrence.” Reported by Scot Paltrow; edited by Michael Williams",WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama rode into office in 2009 with promises to work toward a nuclear-free world.

RICK GLADSTONE,"The jump in killings in Mexico was clearly a dominant theme in the Committee to Protect Journalists’ 2017 tally. In most cases the killers acted with impunity. Mr. Pineda, 38, a freelancer who covered crime, social issues and corruption for a number of Mexican publications, regularly received threats via social media. He was relaxing in a hammock on the evening of March 2 outside a car wash in Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero State, when he was fatally shot. Mr. Valdez Cárdenas, 50, who chronicled drug trafficking and was a co-founder of an investigative weekly in 2003 in the city of Culiacán, Sinaloa State, was the winner of the Committee to Protect Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award in 2011. His killers were waiting for him when he left his office at noon on May 15. They fled in his car. From Jan. 1 through Dec. 15, at least 42 journalists around the world were killed in the line of duty, the Committee to Project Journalists said; the total for all of 2016 was 48. Assuming the 2017 total holds, it would be the second consecutive annual decline from the record highs reached this decade, when as many as 74 journalists were killed in a year, in large part because of surging conflicts in the Middle East. Iraq was the deadliest country for journalists in 2017, with at least eight killed, followed by Syria, with seven, the Committee to Protect Journalists said. This year was the first in six years that Syria did not lead the list. Since that country plunged into civil war in 2011, at least 114 journalists have been killed there.

Eddie Makuch,"10 years later, we're still learning more about Naughty Dog's popular Uncharted franchise. Animator Jonathan Cooper revealed on Twitter that the red indicator in the UI that shows up when you're under attack is not a health meter, but instead a ""luck"" meter. When enemies bear down on Drake, his ""luck"" will eventually run out, and at that point enemy gunfire will kill him. But this explains that Drake isn't just taking bullets left and right and living to tell the story. That is often a criticism of games; that players are bullet sponges. That’s a mega-swing! Sidenote I learned on joining the team: Drake doesn’t ever take bullet damage. The red UI that shows ‘hits’ is to represent his ‘luck’ running out. Eventually enemies will get a clear shot and kill him if he takes enough near-misses. https://t.co/byzVKYXVe7 — Jonathan Cooper (@GameAnim) July 8, 2018 It still requires some amount of suspension of disbelief, though, as it means the enemies have really, really bad aim and tactics. But there's an explanation for that, too. Uncharted 1-3 director Amy Hennig chimed in to say the idea was inspired by Naughty Dog's intention to have the Uncharted games align with the ""spirit and tone"" of the movies the franchise was homaging like Indiana Jones. In many action movie franchises, the hero often survives against incredible odds thanks in part to the shoddy aim of enemies. That may be true, but if you're looking for a more challenging experience, the Uncharted franchise offers Hard and Crushing modes that make enemies smarter and deadlier. True!

Peter Staley,"On September 5th, 1991, I put a giant condom over Jesse Helms’ house. Why? Because, as the condom said, “Helms is deadlier than a virus.” Senator Jesse Helms was one of the chief architects of AIDS-related stigma in the U.S. He fought against any federal spending on HIV research, treatment or prevention. He once said, referring to homosexuals, “it’s their deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct that is responsible for the disease.” Here’s another choice one: “There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy.” By saying words like this on the floor of the Senate, Helms gave a veil of legitimacy to every parent who threw their HIV positive kid out of the house. ACT UP New York was filled with angry young men who experienced this kind of Helms-related hatred. He proposed and passed laws that are still on the books, enshrining this stigma as official government policy. People with HIV couldn’t travel to the U.S. The CDC was not permitted to spend money on preventing the spread of HIV among gay men. Our country never launched a single well-funded HIV prevention campaign because of Jesse Helms. To this day, fifty thousand Americans become infected each year in no small part due to “Senator No”. In the summer of 1991, it was bugging me that gay and AIDS activists had largely left him alone. Sure, there were thousands of angry words said and written excoriating the man for his hate-filled agenda, but no one got up-close-and-personal with a response. We needed to send a proverbial shot across his bow. One of the best tools an activist can use is humor. If you can get folks laughing at your target’s expense, you diminish his power. I wanted the country to have a good laugh at Helms’ expense. I wanted his fellow senators to have a little chuckle behind his back. And I wanted Senator Helms to realize that his free ride was up - if he hit us again, we’d hit back. The Planning Fortuitously, I had recently met Twilly Cannon, one of the leading activists in Greenpeace - the guy that trained their new recruits in how to accomplish challenging actions like hanging banners from bridges. I told him about my idea for a house-size condom - could we cover Helms’ house in less than five minutes so the cops couldn’t arrive and stop us? Twilly, ever the optimist, said “no problem.” Step one: find his address. One of the many great things about being gay is that we have access to one of the largest spy networks in the world. There isn’t a single organization, company, or government agency anywhere that doesn’t have a gay spy willing to share intelligence with their compatriots in the gay underground for the greater good. So I just picked up the phone and called one of our spies in the Hart Senate Office Building. Helms’ DC area home was in Arlington, Virginia, on South Glebe Road. Address in hand, Twilly and I took a road trip to Arlington, and snapped a picture of Helms’ simple two-story brick colonial house. Twilly showed me how you could estimate all the measurements of a house by starting with the door. Since most front doors come in a standard size - 80 inches high - we took a ruler to the picture, and did some math. We didn’t need to cover the entire house, just enough of it so that it looked completely covered from the street (where the TV cameras would be). It was a small rectangular house with a steep, salt box roof. We needed a huge inflatable section for the front side of the roof which would tower above the house once inflated, including a reservoir nipple. A long sheet of the same material would lead from the bottom of this “balloon” to the ground, ending in a second inflatable section shaped like a tube (for the unrolled bottom of our condom). I faxed the specs off to three companies in California that specialized in custom-made inflatables, like the big gorillas in front of car dealerships, telling them that we wanted to cover a house on Long Island that was hosting an AIDS benefit. They sent bids ranging from $3,500 to $15,000. This was going to be the first action by the newly formed ACT UP affinity group called Treatment Action Guerrillas (which split off from ACT UP a few months later and renamed itself TAG, the Treatment Action Group ). We didn’t have any money yet, but I stumbled on a donor I kept anonymous for many years. My boyfriend at the time, Kevin Sessums, was good friends with David Geffen. We were on Fire Island Pines that August, and Kevin told David about by plans. David walked up to me on the beach one morning, and handed me a thick wad of cash - $3,000. Problem solved. I started to recruit our team of activists, the TAG Helms Seven: myself, POZ Magazine founder Sean Strub, Garance Franke-Ruta, Mark Allen (who blogged about it here ), Derek Link, Jim Serafini, and Jason Childers. An eighth activist, Dan Baker, agreed to be our coat-and-tie-wearing media spokesperson. The condom arrived, and we took it up to ACT UP treasurer Marvin Shulman’s country home outside New Paltz so that we could practice blowing it up. His house wasn’t at all shaped like Helms’, but we could use his well-hidden backyard to see how long it took to inflate. Once back in New York, Garance stencil-painted the front of the condom in big block letters, saying “A CONDOM TO STOP UNSAFE POLITICS. HELMS IS DEADLIER THAN A VIRUS.” The Action We made sure the house was empty. The last thing we wanted was to spend our lives in jail for giving a senator a heart attack. We knew he was on the last week of his summer recess, and probably in North Carolina. We even rang his doorbell the night before to make sure no one was home. CNN and all the local TV stations were contacted in advance, and only told we’d be putting a condom on a politician’s house. They were to meet us at our Arlington motel early that morning, and follow our rented U-Haul truck. Besides opening the rented ladder in the motel parking lot, we never did an actual walk-through as practice. But we talked it through at length, and everyone had their specific tasks and equipment to manage, including a heavy portable generator, a long extension cord, two ladders, rubber mallets, plastic stakes, one of those early clunky cell phones, a small cold-air blower for the ground, and a large blower with a custom-built stand for the roof. Sean Strub and I were the roof guys. The condom was made of parachute material, so when carefully rolled up, it fit into a large duffle bag, which I pulled and he pushed up the 28 foot extension ladder. We unfurled it on the roof, connected it to the blower, and prayed the cops took at least five minutes to get there. As it began to rise, all the guy wires were quickly staked into the lawn on our four sides of the house, while Mark and others used the other ladder to guide the front section past electrical wires and the front door awning. The first cop car arrived just as the reservoir nipple was beginning to rise, a little over seven minutes after we had arrived. We had done it! A crazy neighbor started yelling at us. One of the TV crews filmed her complaining to the police, saying “You guys don’t want to tangle with these people because you don’t want to get AIDS, I know.” I heard just yesterday that someone watching the video below recognized her. She’s supposedly Becky Norton Dunlop, and was the wife of Helms’ administrative assistant (see her Heritage Foundation bio ). I actually saw one of the cops chuckling when he got out of his car. They didn’t know what to do at first. Shoot the thing? They spent quite a while radioing their superiors, and eventually asked us for our driver’s licenses, wrote down our addresses, and told us it was up to the senator to press charges or not. After the press got all the pictures they needed, I asked the cops if they wanted us to take down the condom, and they let us back on the property to reverse the whole process. All we got was a parking ticket for parking the truck in the wrong direction. We were free to go, and could take the condom with us. It’s now in Los Angeles at the ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives. That night, local TV stations around the country played short funny clips of the action. Senator Helms complained about it on the floor of the Senate a week later, calling us “radical homosexuals.” He never proposed or passed another life-threatening AIDS amendment. Robert Hilferty, an ex-boyfriend of mine, filmed the action, some of the planning, and a few interviews, and created a wonderful short documentary called TAG Helms. I also uncovered some raw footage from one of the TV stations, and it shows the action from beginning to end. In loving memory of this special moment in AIDS activism, I’m posting both here for your viewing pleasure.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harmful smoke, fuelled by strong winds, has been spreading across California As firefighters work endlessly to control California's raging fires, experts warn of long-term damage from wildfire smoke that could affect millions. The fires have burned through over 200,000 acres, blanketing parts of California with clouds of thick smoke. So what are the biggest impacts of wildfires and why is the western US state so susceptible to such deadly blazes? How dangerous is wildfire smoke? Wildfire smoke is comprised of water vapour, carbon monoxide and dioxide, chemicals and very small particulates. Strong winds can carry harmful pollutants for hundreds of miles, and at current levels, the plumes can cause breathing difficulties even in healthy individuals. The types of vegetation burning can affect how harmful the plumes are. Smoke from pine trees, for example, may be carcinogenic and eucalyptus is particularly toxic to humans. One study by researchers from several US universities, including Yale and Harvard, estimates that more than 82 million people in the western US will suffer ""significant"" health consequences from wildfire smoke in the next 20 years. And those consequences are not just respiratory-related - wildfire smoke can also affect those with cardiovascular diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Those with pre-existing chronic conditions like asthma or heart conditions, as well as children, pregnant women and the elderly are most susceptible to negative health effects. Masks can help mitigate some of the dangers, but only certain kinds can keep out all the toxins, and some California communities are already experiencing a mask shortage, Kaiser Health reported. Image copyright NOAA Image caption Satellite imagery showed plumes of smoke from the Camp Fire stretching across portions of Northern California What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes How do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Determining the cause of a wildfire can be a painstaking process. Investigators search for a fire's point of origin by looking at how the fire spread - at the start, flames grow outward in a circle unless wind or terrain affects it otherwise, according to National Wildfire Coordinating Group's handbook. From there, officials comb through the area to determine if the blaze was of natural or human origin, looking for pieces of evidence like lightning scars on trees, campfire kindling, or cigarette butts.

According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.","BBC News California wildfires: Is smoke the most dangerous side-effect?

Hoai-Tran Bui,"Ozark returns for a darker second season — figuratively and literally. The blue-tinted Netflix drama starring Jason Bateman and Laura Linney checks in with the Byrde family soon after the tense events of season 1, and things have only escalated. The first season of Ozark followed Marty Byrde (Bateman), his wife Wendy (Linney), and their two children as they flee Chicago to set up a money laundering operation in Missouri in service of a cartel to whom Marty owes a scary amount of money. But as the cartel descends on their gloomy, perpetually cloudy home, the Byrdes find that it’s not just their finances that are in danger — it’s their lives. The sophomore season of the Emmy nominated drama picks up as matters are starting to escalate for the Byrdes, with Marty considering murder to keep the cartel at bay. But a new attorney ( Janet McTeer ) sent by the cartel may present a deadlier foe to the Byrdes, threatening if Marty makes one wrong word, “they’ll kill your children.” The first season of Ozark received five Emmy nominations, including two directing nods. Here’s the official synopsis for Ozark season 2: In its much-anticipated second season, Ozark continues to follow Marty Bryde and his family as they navigate the murky waters of life within a dangerous drug cartel. With Del out, the crime syndicate sends their ruthless attorney Helen Pierce to town to shake things up just as The Byrdes are finally settling in. Marty and Wendy struggle to balance their family interests amid the escalating dangers presented by their partnerships with the power-hungry Snells, the cartel and their new deputy, Ruth Langmore, whose father Cade has been released from prison. The stakes are even higher than before and The Byrdes soon realize they have to go all in before they can get out. Ozark season 2 premieres on Netflix on August 31, 2018.

The newest TV spot bombards us with bloody action and terror as the titular alien wreaks havoc upon the human scientists and soldiers trying to contain it. We finally got a peek at that old Shane Black dry humor in the most recent The Predator trailer, but the newest TV spot brings us back to the moody violence that we saw in previous trailers. The Predator terrorizes the scientists who detained it and rips the soldiers attempting to capture it to shreds. The TV spot is an outburst of bloody violence punctuated by the rapid breathing sounds of Olivia Munn’s Casey Bracket. Sterling K. Brown’s unnamed government agent and Boyd Holbrook’s PTSD-suffering soldier Quinn McKenna also get the spotlight in this TV spot. Directed by Black, The Predator is the fourth installment in the long-running sci-fi horror franchise that began back in 1987 with the gritty jungle flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and directed by John McTiernan. Black pens the screenplay for The Predator alongside Fred Dekker, Jim Thomas, and John Thomas. The Predator features an all-star cast including Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Sterling K.

Matt Brown,"Fallout 76 marks a new direction for Bethesda's post-apocalyptic role-playing franchise, abandoning its single-player roots in pursuit of a shared-world multiplayer experience. Dropping dozens into the harsh lands of West Virginia, players are tasked with exploring, building, and fighting for survival. While the vast world of Fallout 76 can be daunting, the game provides opportunities to harness menacing tools. Several nuclear missile launch sites are scattered across the wasteland, primed to unleash their destructive payloads. Ahead of its release this fall, we've compiled everything we know about the game's nukes so far. Fallout 76: Everything you need to know See at Amazon See at Microsoft Active nuclear missile silos are spread across Fallout 76, ready for players to explore and leverage. Bethesda envisions the journey to nuclear weaponry as an endgame activity, requiring teams to solve puzzles and uncover launch codes. Like raids in other shared-world games, players must band together and scour the wasteland. Firm details on Fallout 76's nuclear weapons are currently limited, though Bethesda briefly detailed core mechanics at its E3 2018 showcase. Firstly, it recommends pursuing nukes as a team rather than following the trail solo. As an ""endgame"" activity, don't expect to launch nukes the minute you start – your party will likely need to level up and obtain high-level gear. What nukes can do in Fallout 76 It's rare that games provide players with such impactful tools, yet nuclear missiles present a range of player-driven possibilities. Bethesda hopes its emergent gameplay could bring further endgame depth, from power-crazed groups, tense nuclear standoffs, or all-out war. The obvious application of nukes is their destructive capabilities, delivering unrivaled destruction to the map. The nuclear blast can impact a sizeable area, wiping out players and settlements instantly. A more significant element of this is ensuing nuclear fallout, drastically changing map sectors for a period of time. Spawning rare drops and legendary tier items, you'll find the game's best items here. Nukes terraform land into pools of valuable resources, housing new vegetation, deadlier mutated creatures, and coveted crafting materials. The outcome of the fallout will vary based on where the bomb fell too, creating variation between fallout zones. Before stepping foot in the fallout, you'll also need to obtain Power Armor. This high radiation zone will kill anyone unshielded, making the suit's radiation resistance capabilities ideal. Beware that areas will only be fully irradiated briefly, making it crucial to take advantage of them fast. How to launch nukes in Fallout 76 Before embarking on your hunt for nukes, players will likely be provided with some form of guidance via a quest. With independent objectives to obtain each launch code piece, the lead-up will be broken into multiple stages. For example, the E3 showcase features players attacking a group of weapon-wielding ""Scorched"" ghouls, before killing the ""feral ghoul officer"" for one code piece. This piece, ""Silo Alpha Code Piece R-8,"" provides two characters for the Alpha missile silo code. Multiple nuclear launch sites will be stationed across West Virginia, though it's unclear how many are planned for release. After collecting the code pieces, teams can make their way to the correct missile site. Combating foes and other security measures may challenging, though skilled squads will have the means to break past. You'll eventually find the main control room, where inserting the code and keycard initiates the launch. An overview of West Virginia will be displayed, allowing players to choose a target using the on-screen reticle. Shortly after, havoc should rain down on unlucky foes. Prepare for war As Fallout 76's release nears, we'll be sure to update this article with the latest details. In the meantime, Fallout 76 is now available for preorder starting at $59.99, ahead of its November 14 release for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Windows PCs.

Cory Doctorow,"The Boston Globe has published a giant weekend package of responses to Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the Big Tech monopolies.
I'm absolutely in favor of this proposal, but I'm concerned that the proponents for it have fallen into the trap of tech exceptionalism, the idea that tech is either intrinsically monopolistic (something you hear from Big Tech itself, as they insist that ""network effects"" and similar excuses mean that they are helpless to avoid monopolies), or more dangerous (see the rhetoric about how ""algorithms"" can produce influence campaigns that turn decent people into anti-vaxxers, Trump supporters or murderous jihadis), or both.
I think both of these are vastly overstated and that you don't need to believe in them to support the case for breaking up Big Tech. Big Tech is monopolistic because it grew up without any meaningful antitrust enforcement -- because the Apple ][+ and Reaganomics were born in the same 12-month period, because a generation of tech lawyers learned from the FTC's tame response to Microsoft that it was fair game, and because the investors who choose the boards of these companies are great fans of monopolies in every industry they back, not just tech.
And as to tech's ability to distort our thinking, the idea that this is due to some kind of machine-learning secret sauce is something that Big Tech itself promotes (""Buy our ad-tech and we'll sell your stuff to people who wouldn't buy it otherwise""), but I don't know why we'd conclude that these companies lie about everything except their sales literature. On the other hand, the fact that we have (effectively) one search engine that unilaterally decides what goes on the front page for every search query, and one App Store whose editorial policies decide whether certain political messages can or can't be shown to Apple users. These have massive, obvious effects on public opinion, and no mind-control is necessary to understand how that works.
The fact is that every industry needs antitrust enforcement: we need to break up Big Content (start by unwinding last week's Disney-Fox merger, then block the rumored pending merger between Simon and Schuster and Harpercollins), and Big Cable, and Big Finance, and all the other Bigs that have come to dominate us and whose distortions make Big Tech so much deadlier.
But the closest the Globe's package comes to acknowledging this is Mohamad Ali and Mike Baker's call to regulate Big Tech rather than break it up so that it can hold its own against Big Cable, rather than breaking up Big Cable too.
It's great to see pickup for Warren's proposal, but please, people, let's not believe Big Tech when they say they're different from everyone else.
So why havent the feds been tougher on Big Tech already? One reason laws have been slow to catch up with the tech giants is because conventional understanding of antitrust law has required regulators to show that market concentration has resulted in some kind of direct harm to consumers. In this way of thinking, harm to competitors, or even to the broader market, isnt enough to trigger Justice Department intervention: There needs to be some way in which consumers are shown to be paying higher prices. Since most services offered by Facebook and Google are free to consumers, proving harm under that standard is close to impossible.
In the legal community, some scholars have called for a rethinking of antitrust law to keep pace with technological changes and to reemphasize harm to competition. Thats an evolving debate, and its clear that Warren and some other lawmakers agree that its time to expand interpretations of antitrust law.

matthewgrobar,"After directing the Oscar-nominated documentary Cartel Land, on the vicious drug war spanning the U.S. and Mexico, Matthew Heineman would have been forgiven for taking on a less dangerous assignment for his next film. Instead, he turned his attention to an even deadlier conflict, Syria’s brutal civil war, for his harrowing City of Ghosts. The film, which recently made the Oscar documentary shortlist, centers on members of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), a heroic group of citizen journalists who risked death to report on atrocities committed by ISIS in their hometown. “The film basically follows them after members of the group were killed and [survivors] were forced to flee,” Heineman tells Deadline. “I was with them as they were fleeing from Syria to Turkey and then ultimately to Europe as they continued to be hunted by ISIS, moving from safe house to safe house.” The citizen journalists incurred the wrath of the terrorist organization by daring to counter the myth propagated by ISIS that it had turned Raqqa—the capital of its self-styled caliphate—into a paradise on earth. Members of RBSS secretly recorded video demonstrating Raqqa under ISIS had in fact become a hellscape of harsh conditions and hideous public executions. “When ISIS took over my city the main thing they focused on was how to spread their propaganda to recruit people all over the country, all over the world. They were able in a short time to recruit thousands of people from 84 countries,” explains Aziz Alhamza, RBSS founder and chief subject of City of Ghosts. “It was a duty to to do something to show the reality, otherwise ISIS will be able to recruit more people.” Heineman made the decision to show deeply disturbing images taken by RBSS members, including the crucifixion of a man in a public square. “For me I didn’t want to shy away from the violence. I think that would have been an injustice to the true horror and fear that the citizens of Raqqa have lived with every single day,” Heineman declares. “It was very much a balancing act of showing the violence, but also being cognizant of how intense it was…The story is about image-making, the power of images. We’re not trying to use violence in a pornographic way. It’s inherently part of the narrative this film is telling.” Since the film’s theatrical debut last summer ISIS has been driven out of Raqqa and its footprint sharply curtailed in other parts of the Middle East where it previously reigned. But Heineman believes it would be a grave mistake to consider ISIS eradicated. “The sad reality is that to members of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently and to many people, ISIS is an idea, and you can’t beat an idea. You can’t win a battle against an idea with bombs, with guns, or militarily,” Heineman observes. “What remains is this ideological battle. And I think the question we pose in the film is, how do we as a global community, how do we as citizens, as governments, as journalists, fight ISIS as an idea, fight this extremist ideology that not only took over Raqqa but has been exported from Raqqa to other places all across the world? And I think that is a question that we don’t have an answer for—‘we’ being the U.S. government and other governments.” City of Ghosts is currently available on Amazon and iTunes. For Heineman, making it presented a particular set of challenges. “This is definitely the hardest film I’ve made thus far, by far. Just the nature of following a group of people who are fleeing for their lives, moving from safe house to safe house [and] by nature don’t want to be seen…Making sure we were diligent in how we were communicating and making sure we weren’t exposing anybody more so than we necessarily had to—these were all extremely difficult things to navigate,” Heineman explains. “And then cinematically it was also quite difficult because it’s sort of the opposite of my last film, Cartel Land, which was a visual feast out of this Wild West of Mexico and really anywhere you pointed your camera was interesting. This film, the drama partly took place in these safe houses, in these closed smoky rooms…[with] a group of guys sitting around. Trying to find the humanity in that, the drama in that, the cinema in that was a big challenge.” Heineman heads into 2018 with a full slate of projects. His documentary series The Trade, which explores the opioid epidemic from both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, holds its world premiere in January at Sundance. And he will be continuing work on A Private War, his first fictional film that stars Rosamund Pike as the late war correspondent Marie Colvin. On January 23 he will learn whether City of Ghosts earns an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature. “I’m extraordinarily honored to be on the shortlist,” he tells Deadline. “There’s so many incredible films out there, so many incredible films about Syria this year. I’m even more moved that this means so much to the members of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, that hopefully this will give greater recognition, greater exposure to the incredibly important work that they do.” He adds, “This film is many things to me, but partly it’s an homage to journalism, an homage to people fighting for the truth, especially in an age where truth, the facts, seem to be malleable.”","After directing the Oscar-nominated documentary Cartel Land, on the vicious drug war spanning the U.S. and Mexico, Matthew Heineman would have been forgiven for taking on a less dangerous assignment for his next film.

Bryan Gibb,"The world's most frightening infections aren't carried by plague-infested rats, rabid dogs, or chimps with Ebola. They're transmitted by ""superbugs"" -- disease-causing bacteria that can't be killed by antibiotics. This year, superbugs will kill about 700,000 people, including 23,000 Americans. That toll will increase exponentially in the coming years as ever-evolving bacteria develop resistance to more and more antibiotics. Even hand sanitizers are struggling against certain microbes. By 2050, superbugs could kill 10 million people annually. Fortunately, it's possible to avert this grim future. ""Bacteriophages"" — viruses that infect only bacteria — can destroy antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The U.S. government, however, isn't doing enough to facilitate the development of these viruses. That needs to change. Antibiotics don't work as well as they used to. From 2012 to 2014, the share of bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics rose from 5 percent to 11 percent, according to a study published in Health Affairs. Why the spike? For years, doctors doled out antibiotics willy-nilly. Even today, up to half of all prescribed antibiotics are unnecessary or used ineffectively. Whenever antibiotics are used, some mutant bacteria survive. But the more an antibiotic is used, the more rapidly bacteria become resistant, reducing the effectiveness of the drug. New treatments for superbugs are needed, but there have been no major novel antibiotic developments since the 1960s. That's largely because pharmaceutical companies are abandoning antibiotic research. It's time-consuming and expensive to bring a new drug to market — it takes about ten years and $2.9 billion, on average. So companies develop drugs that will make as much money as possible. Since drugs for chronic diseases make people life-long subscribers, and antibiotics are ""one and done,"" developers opt to make the former. Moreover, growing antibiotic resistance reduces the effective lifespan of new drugs, further limiting profits. READ MORE: Veterinarians report some owners are abusing their pets to get opioids That's why researchers must look beyond antibiotics and devote more resources to novel treatments — like bacteriophage therapy. Our planet is home to trillions and trillions of bacteriophages — phages for short — making them the most abundant biological form in the world. Each phage evolves to attack a specific bacterium. If a patient has a bacterial infection, she could take a cocktail of many phages in the hope that some will target the infection. The treatment can be modified with different phages if the first cocktail does not work. And phages very rarely produce side effects. It may seem absurd to fight disease with viruses. But phages are already working wonders in some parts of the world. Doctors in the Republic of Georgia and Poland have used them for decades. One Texas woman with a debilitating infection recently decided to fly 6,500 miles to Georgia to try phage therapy. Within weeks, she made a full recovery. Despite such successes, phage research is underfunded. The National Institutes of Health only spent $473 million on antibiotic resistance research last fiscal year, according to a Politico report. And just a third of it went to phage therapy. That's chump change. Just look at how generously the government funds other health initiatives. Since 2004, the government has funneled $1.6 billion into bioterrorism defense research every year, even though there haven't been any notable bioterror attacks. Even if there were a smallpox attack, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates it would only infect tens of thousands. By comparison, we know that millions of people will die from superbugs unless better treatments reach the market. The government isn't merely skimping on research funding. It's also making it difficult for private companies and non-profits to develop phage therapies. Phages aren't a static chemical compound — they quickly evolve just like the mutating bacteria, giving them a huge edge over antibiotics. Even when a bacteria develops resistance to the phage, new phages can be found or existing phages can evolve to become effective again. But this advantage also makes phages difficult to evaluate in a traditional clinical trial setting. Right now, the FDA only approves phages for use on a case-by-case basis. To take full advantage of its potential, phage therapy needs its own separate FDA approval track. Superbugs are becoming more and more deadly — and traditional antibiotics alone can't stop them. Phages may be the secret weapon; they're proven to be safe and effective. It's time for the government to realize the best way to defeat killer bacteria may be to give people harmless viruses.","It may seem absurd to fight disease with viruses, but bacteriophages could be the fix for a growing problem",2018-09-09T23:30:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Salon.com'}","Antibiotic-resistant superbugs are getting deadlier, but they can be defeated — with viruses",https://www.salon.com/2018/09/09/antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-are-getting-deadlier-but-they-can-be-defeated-with-viruses/,https://media.salon.com/2018/09/antibiotic-resistant-bacteria.jpg,,Salon.com,deadlier,1
Rafael Motamayor,"What would you do if you received a call from a dead nieces phone? Would you work with the apparently-not-dead-yet version of her to prevent her murder a few days earlier? Probably not, because youre neither a homicide detective nor can you shatter the confines of spacetime.
But thats what happens to David Oyelowos character Jack Radcliffe in Relive, a sci-fi thriller from Blumhouse Productions that premiered at the genre-friendly midnight hour at this years Sundance Film Festival. Soon after the horrific murder of his niece, Ashley (A Wrinkle in Times Storm Reid), Los Angeles detective Jack gets a call from his victim relative and shes dialing in from the past. Logically, Jack decides to get her niece to look around for clues that may solve the murder before it happens. Its basically a time-traveling whodunnit, without too much consideration over the whodunnit part.
A great thriller works on the audiences senses through character experiences. Revelations are felt, not simply unloaded. Beads of sweat drip down the actors faces to convey whats on the line. The eyes provide windows to the turning gears in a mystery-solvers head. Thats where the film, by Jacob Aaron Estes (Mean Creek), excels; Oyelowo and Reid deliver grounded, ticking-clock performances, which helps give the story some weight as the sci-fi conceit breaks the rules. Jack is overwhelmed with grief and guilt over not being able to protect his family as he tries to maintain a clarity needed to do his job. Hes also terrified of having to explain how he knows so much of what is happening, or will happen, to Ashley technically, hes not playing by the rules. 
Relive doesnt waste much time explaining those rules. This means the time traveling is poorly defined, which actually winds up being a refreshing take on what is one of the most complicated subgenres. We dont waste time trying to explain paradoxes, or what you can or cant change in the past. Everything is game, even if it doesnt immediately make sense. 
Of course, Estes still has fun with the time travel. The director visualizes new timelines and the ripples of the Butterfly as a wave carrying the changed timeline that smacks Jack and expands to cover the screen (fans of Legends of Tomorrow will be familiar with the concept). Some changes are simple, like the painting of a red X on the garage door, while others, like calling the police, have bigger, deadlier, consequences for everyone. 
Estes and his co-writer Drew Daywalt cant help but indulge in police procedural tropes and a dangerously slow pace. Early on, Jack resists answering the phone calls from his dead niece, though once he does, he immediately buys the validity of the supernatural calls. He just rolls with it and enjoying Relive takes the same leap of faith. There are also some very questionable actions; at one point, Jack takes a bullet to the gut, goes back to the police station, and walks around yelling nonsense while everyone just stands around watching him bleed to death like its a regular Monday afternoon.
Relive is more concerned with using the supernatural element as a tool to explore Jacks grief and guilt than carving out a new section of fan-theory Reddit. Every role is cast to perfection, including Mykelti Williamson and Alfred Molina as Jacks colleagues at the police force, or the always great Brian Tyree Henry as Ashleys father, a man struggling to do the right thing when he also needs to provide for his family.

Chris Moyse,"Hope I don't do any... lunges We're approaching the one year mark since the release of Activision's billion-dollar earning first-person shooter Call of Duty: WWII. There's still plenty of updates being applied to keep the game's multiplayer fresh, including a new division and other perks, which roll out today. in alignment with new DLC expansion; Shadow War. The new division, Commando, allows players to ""Paratroop"" (spawn) straight into the heat of battle, as opposed to the designated spawn points, similar to the Tactical Insertion skill in the Black Ops titles. Commandos also have faster health regeneration than other Divisions, and gain extra ammo for multi-kills. Sounds like a expert class, that would benefit solid players and make them even deadlier in combat. Alongside the new Division come two new Basic Training unlocks. Remedy also for a fast health regen, while Catalyst allows access to a serum that can be used in battle to momentarily increase weapon handling. For Zombies, new shovel variants, orders and contracts have been added. Accompanying these additions are a selection of bug fixes across the board.

Paul Carsten,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Lying in bushes by the side of a road, the security officer played dead and hoped the militants would mistake the blood pooling from a colleague’s body as his own. He did not risk looking up to see what was happening, but he could hear. 
“We warned you civilians not to take part in elections, but you refused,” said a fighter loyal to the extremist group Islamic State. “Cut their throats.” 
Kashim Shettima, governor of the war-torn northeastern Nigerian state of Borno, issued a statement two days later saying three people were killed when insurgents attacked his motorcade on route to an election rally. 
But survivors of the Feb. 12 assault, along with two Nigerian and two international security personnel, put the toll much higher. 
Reuters was unable to confirm precise figures. One survivor said he saw about 40 bodies; another estimated that as many as 100 died. The militants also took between 100 and 200 people captive, officials said. 
The scale of the attack raises concern about the ability of militants from Boko Haram and a breakaway group calling itself Islamic State West African Province to disrupt voting in a delayed presidential election on Saturday, despite government assurances that only remnants of the insurgency remain. 
“Islamic State and Boko Haram have over the past weeks ceaselessly warned locals that voting in the elections is tantamount to apostasy,” said Fulan Nasrullah, a researcher who tracks the groups at the Global Initiative For Civil Stabilisation, a Nigerian-based think tank. “They have both explicitly threatened to attack the voters who go out to vote in these communities or who work with the electoral commission or otherwise carry out activities in support of the elections.” 
Others interviewed by Reuters asked not to be identified because they said the government and military command had ordered them not to discuss the ambush, which could be damaging to both Shettima, a government politician, and Buhari. The president, who is seeking a second term, has vowed to defeat the insurgents once and for all. 
A spokesman for the state governor did not respond to requests for comment on the accounts provided to Reuters, saying there might be a response later. A regional military spokesman referred questions to the state government. 
Buhari urged Nigerians “to go out and vote,” assuring them in a televised address on Friday that adequate security measures were in place. 
FATAL CHOICE 
 Shettima’s motorcade left the state capital Maiduguri in the morning, bound for the market towns of Mafa, Dikwa and Gamboru. The 85-vehicle convoy included buses full of supporters headed to campaign events, officials said. 
 In Dikwa, the local army commander urged the governor to stop for the night, according to one of the survivors and a Nigerian security official. Dusk was approaching, and the risk of an ambush was too high. 
But Shettima decided to press on, they said. The governor’s office did not answer questions about the decision. 
At 6:45 pm, as the convoy snaked past the village of Maula, dozens of fighters armed with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked. It was unclear how they found the convoy. 
Survivors heard grenades slam into the middle of the convoy, followed by a hail of bullets. The governor, who was in the front half of the convoy, escaped, they said, but those riding at the back were trapped. 
“They then came out with two pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns, all of the fighters in military camouflage, while the rest of them came from the roadside, firing on us,” said a security official who was part of the motorcade. 
Some people tried to escape by turning back. Others abandoned their vehicles and ran into the bush. 
“As they ran, the insurgents opened fire,” the official said. “I would not be surprised if 100 people lost their lives.” 
‘CUT THEIR THROATS’ 
Lying in the bushes next to his colleague’s body, the officer who was playing dead heard the militants begin to gather survivors by the roadside. 
    There, as the wrecks of the convoy vehicles smoldered, some were killed, he said. He later saw two fresh bodies, their throats slit. 
The fighters ordered other survivors into the remaining vehicles and drove away with at least 100 people, said one of the witnesses and an international security official who looked into the attack. A Nigerian intelligence official put the number of captives as high as 200. 
After the insurgents were gone, the hiding officer joined a flood of survivors fleeing through the bush, making for nearby towns and a military base. More than 200 men and women managed to escape, trekking through the night, another witness said. 
The intelligence official and other security personnel corroborated the witnesses’ accounts. 
    At least 60 bodies were taken to a hospital morgue in Maiduguri after the attack, some with their throats cut, said a humanitarian worker who looked into the incident. A morgue official declined to comment. 
It wasn’t immediately clear whether any Islamic State fighters were killed. 
“SUPREME PRICE” 
    The ambush was part of a surge of attacks as Islamic State and Boko Haram seek to sow chaos during the election. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced since December. 
    Last Saturday, the day voting was supposed to take place before it was delayed for logistical reasons, six people were killed in a bomb blast in Maiduguri. 
There have also been reports of dozens of people abducted from buses as they returned to their home areas to vote. The state government and military authorities declined to comment on those reports. 
The morning after the ambush, soldiers returned to the scene, said one of the security officials who survived the attack. There, they recovered the body of one soldier, two civilians and 23 vehicles, leaving soon after. 
The troops did not check far inside the bush, the survivor said. 
    On Tuesday, Shettima told reporters in the capital Abuja that he would return after the election to Gamboru - the town his convoy had tried to reach - “ready to pay the supreme price if need be”.

"Arielle Duhaime-Ross, VICE News","COAL RUN, Kentucky — Kentucky is at the center of what experts are calling the worst black lung epidemic on record. But instead of making it easier for miners to get access to health care, Kentucky’s lawmakers passed a law that may soon hinder miners’ ability to obtain workers’ compensation benefits. The new law, which goes into effect on July 14th, bars federally certified radiologists from assessing coal miners’ X-rays in state black lung workers’ compensation claims. Instead, the state will require that only pulmonologists, physicians whose focus is lung disease, be allowed to judge X-rays for benefit claims. Right now, there are only 11 doctors in Kentucky who are certified to examine X-rays for state benefits claims, and the new law will cut that number down to five. “It doesn't make any sense from a medical perspective,” Centers for Disease Control epidemiologist and black lung expert Scott Laney told VICE News in an interview at the agency’s Morgantown, West Virginia, offices. The law could restrict coal miners’ access to care, he said. “Certainly it's going to restrict their access to disability compensation proceedings.” Moreover, of the five pulmonologists who will still be allowed to examine X-rays when state claims are filed, three have acted as expert witnesses on behalf of coal companies or their insurers as they sought to challenge miners’ benefit claims. Because of this, many black lung experts and advocates say the law is an attempt by the coal industry to limit the amount of money they have to spend on coal miner healthcare in the midst of a mounting epidemic. “I mean, it's anti-science, is what it is. It's absurd” “I mean, it's anti-science, is what it is. It's absurd,” says Wes Addington, a lawyer at the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center who represents miners who make federal benefits claims. “It's almost like saying, ‘You know, your biopsy sample is not going to be read by a pathologist. We're going to have some other physicians look at it.’” The CDC’s Laney agreed, explaining that there’s no evidence to suggest that a radiologist would be less qualified to diagnose black lung for a state benefit claim, compared with a pulmonologist. Federally certified radiologists may, in fact, be more qualified than pulmonologists in this matter because looking at X-rays is their specialty, he said. Adam Koenig, the Kentucky House representative who sponsored the bill, told VICE News that the law was passed to address a state Supreme Court decision that found that miners who seek benefits face tougher requirements than other people with similar lung illnesses. The new law is intended to fix that, Koenig said. “One radiologist found a 41 percent incidence of black lung, [whereas] another one had found 91 percent. So that's an issue; it has to be consistent.” When asked about the reasons underpinning the state’s decision to exclude radiologists, Koenig said that although radiologists and pulmonologists are “both doctors,” pulmonologists are lung disease specialists. “And so, that's how we got to the pulmonologists being the ones that would be required to check it out.” Koenig said he consulted with “experts and insurance, basically,” before passing the bill into law. “We also heard a lot from the coal association on this,” he added, in reference to the Kentucky Coal Association. Tyler White, the president of the association, sat next to Koenig during a c ommittee hearing in March, and testified in favor of the bill. When asked if he’d consulted with doctors while drafting the bill, Koenig said that he did not hear from radiologists “until after the bill became law.” He also said he had consulted with the Kentucky Medical Association and that the organization had raised no concerns about the law. Emily Schott, communications director for the Kentucky Medical Association, said the group “did not take a position on this bill,” adding that there “were no concerns raised to us by our members with that provision or any others contained in House Bill 2,” the bill in question. A preventable epidemic There is no cure for black lung disease, but its cause is well-established. It’s triggered by tiny particles of coal and rock dust that are inhaled and then settle in lung tissue. These particles cause the lungs to scar over, limiting their function. Dying of black lung can therefore be likened to slowly suffocating to death. Until recently, black lung disease was generally considered an illness of the past; it peaked in the 1970s and then steadily declined. But in 2000, that started to change, as an increasing number of American coal miners received diagnoses. Since then, the prevalence of black lung among coal miners has doubled nationally, exceeding 10 percent among current miners who’ve worked in coal mines for 25 years or more, Laney said, citing data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. But the increase in black lung isn’t uniform across the U.S. It’s largely the result of the high levels of black lung recorded in Central Appalachia, where severe black lung diagnoses among the region’s 20,000 active coal miners have hit the highest level recorded in the past 25 years. Today, one in every five current, long-tenured miner has some form of black lung, Laney said. And things aren’t getting any easier for those affected. The end stages of black lung used to take 20 or 30 years to develop, but now take a much shorter period of time — 10 years, Laney explained. This has prompted Laney and others to call the Central Appalachian epidemic the worst on record. “Premature mortality is serious with black lung, and it seems to be worse now than in the past, where miners would be diagnosed much later in life,” Laney said. “This is a health crisis. I think I'm beginning to exhaust the way that I describe my alarm, concern, and outrage.” “Premature mortality is serious with black lung, and it seems to be worse now than in the past” Coal miners tend to get screened for black lung after they leave the mining industry, and the coal industry has experienced a significant downturn in recent years, so it’s possible that at least some of the uptick that scientists have identified is related to increased testing among former coal miners. But that doesn’t explain the entire epidemic, because scientists are now seeing an increase in the number of current miners who are getting sick, at an earlier age. So what’s going on? Improvements in mining equipment efficiency are at least partially to blame for the rise in black lung disease, Laney says. Increased mechanization has caused the dust to be finer, and with increasing coal production over the last few decades, miners have also been exposed to more of it, “in a much shorter period of time.” But the CDC researcher also suspects that coal companies don’t always comply with federal dust regulations. “We know well what the exposure-response relationship between coal mine dust and human health effects from black lung disease are. We've known this for 60 years,” Laney said. “If the measurements that coal mine inspectors take when visiting mines reflected the conditions that miners regularly face when they’re working in mines, you would not see this level of impairment in these miners; there's something that is not jiving with those two things.” Three current and former coal miners told VICE News that mining companies often use appropriate safety measures during inspections — only to remove them when inspectors leave the premises because they’re too cumbersome and too time-consuming to maintain. “It ain’t right. But you can’t do nothing about it,” said a former coal miner who’d seen this happen on the job. He was recently diagnosed with black lung. On July 11, eight employees working for Armstrong Coal in Western Kentucky were indicted for conspiracy to falsify coal mine dust sampling in the district court of Western Kentucky. The indictment alleges that these management-level employees, all of whom had previously received training on dust regulations, willfully altered the company's required dust-sampling procedures, “by circumventing the dust-sampling regulations, submitting false samples, and by making false statements on dust certification cards.” Armstrong Coal was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator. Its parent company, Amstrong Energy, went bankrupt in 2017, and the mines mentioned in the indictment have been closed or sold. VICE News attempted to reach the indicted former employees for comment; these attempts were unsuccessful. According to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, coal companies are following dust regulations to the letter; inspectors report a rate of compliance of around 99 percent. In an email, a Department of Labor spokesperson told VICE News that the Administration inspects underground mines four times a year and surface mines twice a year. Through this process, MSHA issued nearly 47,000 coal mine health and safety citations in 2017 — down from 93,000 citations in 2011. Compensation roadblocks Regardless of the epidemic’s cause, Central Appalachian miners are in trouble. Because more miners are seeing the disease progress to debilitating stages, there’s also been an increase in lung transplants in the workforce — a procedure that costs an average of $1.2 million. So, any law that affects how miners access workers’ compensation benefits is bound to be controversial. “We were trained specifically to read chest X-rays from the beginning of our residency,” says Brandon Crum, a radiologist in Coal Run who’ll soon be barred from evaluating X-rays for state benefit claims. “I have no idea why you would want to limit the number of physicians that could be able to help individuals when you're in one of the largest epidemics or the largest epidemic in the United States history for occupational lung disease.” “I was seeing a significant amount of disease, and in very young miners” Crum has diagnosed hundreds of cases of black lung in Kentucky. And as a former coal miner himself, he says he’s uniquely qualified to talk to coal miners about the work that made them sick. Perhaps as a result, Crum was the first to alert the CDC to the cluster of severe cases of black lung in Eastern Kentucky in 2016. “I was seeing a significant amount of disease, and in very young miners,” he said. “And that was my primary concern — the individuals in their 30s and 40s with complicated disease, which is the most severe form.” Miners and advocates worry about the effect of having fewer doctors reviewing their claims. But that’s not the only reason they’re concerned. In late 2016, the families of two deceased coal miners filed a class action lawsuit against Johns Hopkins Hospital, accusing one of its doctors of intentionally misreading the coal miners’ X-rays when they filed for benefits. The lawsuit was eventually thrown out; the federal judge presiding over the case ruled that the doctor was immune to litigation. Today, Johns Hopkins no longer does work on black lung benefits claims. “Johns Hopkins took swift action when we learned of potential issues with the program,” said Kim Hoppe, director of public relations at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “We suspended the program immediately and later decided it would remain closed.” For coal miners in Central Appalachia, allegations like that have contributed to a general mistrust of doctors. “When you read about doctors giving false readings on black lung, major hospitals — I think the Hopkins Center gave false readings on black lung — why would you trust them?” said current coal miner Jeff Tiller, who was diagnosed with black lung a year ago in Virginia. Now, Kentucky’s new law runs the risk of deepening that mistrust among the state’s miners, as three out of the five remaining physicians who’ll still be able to evaluate claims have worked for coal companies or their insurers. VICE News reached out to the three pulmonologists to ask them about the law and their previous work for coal companies. Dr. Thomas Jarboe and Dr. Byron Westerfield declined to comment. Dr. Bruce Broudy, who works at Lexington Clinic with Dr. Jarboe, agreed to talk to about the new law during an on-camera interview. But less than two hours before the discussion was set to take place, a PR specialist representing the clinic, named Brandon Thompson, canceled the interview, stating that the clinic “had made the determination that Dr. Broudy is not going to participate.” When asked about the pulmonologists’ work for coal companies, Kentucky Representative Koenig said he had faith that the state’s pulmonologists would do what they think is best for patients.

Evan Hopkins,"Wolverine likes to say that hes the best there is at what he does, which is slice people up with his adamantium claws and generally act surly. The diminutive X-Man has made a name for himself with the Marvel Universe for his capableness, his ferociousness, and his body count numbering in the low thousands. Theres no other way to put it: Wolverine is deadly. But is the vastness of the multiverse, Wolverine isnt the only claw-popping mutant to be the best there is at what he does. In fact, there are numerous alternate-reality Wolverines populating the multiverse, and many of them are far, far deadlier than the original. The multiverse has seen it all: gender-bent Wolverines, wacky Wolverines, time-traveling Wolverines, even a Batman Wolverine! While the OG has earned a reputation as one of the most slice-happy heroes in the Marvel U, there are numerous Wolvies out there in the multiverse that could give Logan a run for his money. So join CBR as we reality hop, bringing you the definitive list of alternate-reality Wolverines that are DEADLIER than the original. Buckle up, bub; this is gonna get stabby. When the Ultimate Universe started, Marvel sought to use the new universe to cast off the burden of decades of continuity, starting characters fresh. But as the line continued, it fell victim to the same pitfalls of continuity that it set out to avoid. Case in point: Ultimate Cable, the undisputed king of kinda confusing continuity, and certified OG Wolverine butt-kicker. Heres the cliff notes version: in an alternate future, Apocalypse wipes out the X-Men, rips off Ultimate Wolverines arm, absorbs Ultimate Wolvies healing factor, and leaves the mutant for dead. Wolverine replaces his missing arm with a metal appendage, becomes proficient in weaponry, and travels back in time to end Charles Xavier. Possessing the famous claws of Wolverine, the battle proficiency of Cable, and a boatload of guns, Ultimate Cable managed to take out the Ultimate X-Men single-handedly, making him more the capable of taking 616 Wolverine out. Weve all seen what happens when Wolverine hops between the sheets. Wolvies son Daken has proven to be a perpetual thorn in his fathers side, with a bloodlust only matched by his cruelty. But thats not to say that every spawn of Wolverine ends up an amoral monster; in fact, one of the deadliest Wolverines in the multiverse manages to carry on her fathers heroic legacy. Over in Marvels MC2 universe. Rina Logan, daughter of Wolverine and Elektra, battles the forces of evil as Wild Thing. Like her father, Wild Thing wields three claws on each hand, but Rinas claws are psychic in nature, allowing the burgeoning hero to deal both physical and mental damage. Mix Wolverines ferocious fighting style with Elektras grace and mind for tactics, and add some gnarly psychic claws, and youve got one powerful Wolverine. Wolverine has always had what you might call an anti-authoritative streak. He tends to butt heads with leaders, and hes not above flipping an adamantium bird to anyone with power who tries to boss him around. But what if Wolverine had a bit more structure in his life? What if, instead of rebelling against authority, Wolvie embraced it? Youd end up with something like Wolverine, Director Of S.H.I.E.L.D. In What If? Vol. 2 #7, Wolverine joins up with S.H.I.E.L.D. and grows to enjoy his work with the spy agency, eventually rising through the ranks to the position of S.H.I.E.L.D director. As director, Wolverine manages to halt production of the Sentinels, prevents the rise of Dark Phoenix, and fosters relations between humans and mutants. A Wolverine with the full support of S.H.I.E.L.D.? Now thats one powerful alternate-reality Wolvie. They say a man is shaped by his experiences. For the Wolverine of Earth-616, a lifetime of pain and heartache have made the mutant rough and cold. But if Wolverine had found love, a place to belong, its possible the diminutive Cannuck could have turned out much differently. Such was the case with General James Howlett, an alternate-reality Wolverine vastly different from the Wolverine we know. On Earth-12025, James Howlett served as the Governor-General of Dominion of Canada, and embarked upon many adventures in service of the Queen. Howlett eventually began a romantic relationship with Hercules, who gifted the moral with the mystical gold metal Adamantine, which was bonded to Howletts skeleton. With a lifetime of military training, and mystically-imbued claws, this alternate-reality Wolverine could take down the OG Wolvie no problem. Raze Darkholme may have the kind of name that makes you think of a 90s Spawn knock-off (seriously, was Burn Shadowhouse taken?), but this claw-popping baddie has the kind of power that would allow him to take down the OG Wolverine with ease. Hailing from a war-torn alternate future, Raze Darkholme is the son of Wolverine and Mystique, equipped with Wolverines claws and Mystiques shape-changing abilities. Serving as the most vicious member of a twisted villainous incarnation of the X-Men, Raze mixes his fathers animalistic bloodlust with his mothers cold and calculating tactics, making this alternate-reality Wolverine truly scary. With Marvels introduction of Weapon H, the novelty of Hey, its the Hulk, but he has Wolverines claws! has kind of worn off. But while Weapon H is just a poor shlub wrangled into an experiment granting him a mish-mash of Hulk and Wolvies powers, what would happen if the real Wolverine were to Hulk out? Turns out, such an alternate-reality Wolverine exists, and the result is scary. In the Secret Wars tie-in, Civil War, Iron Man and Captain America battle for control of an America divided (literally and figuratively) by an explosion that occurred during the Superhero Registration Act. Heroes choose sides in the war for supremacy, but Iron Man just so happens to have an ace up his sleeve: a Hulkified Wolverine. Possessing all the power of the Hulk, but retaining his intelligence and trademark claws, this alternate-reality Wolverine manages to take out tons of heroes, making him one of the deadliest Wolverines in the multiverse. The Mangaverse is many things: a transparent cash-grab, a remarkably silly alternate-reality, and a giant, confusing pile of anime tropes. But it did give the world Mangaverse Wolverine, one of the most deadly Wolverines in the multiverse. In the Mangaverse, Wolverine founded the X-Men to serve as mutant-kinds last line of defense. Leading the team alongside his brother Cyclops, Wolverine battles ninjas and giant monster using his trademark claws, with one set being composed of adamantium and the other being energy-based. Sure, an anime Wolverine with lightsaber-claws is ridiculous, but this alternate-reality Wolverine is no joke. Were sure this manga mutant could take down the OG Wolverine no problem. Wolverines healing factor is nothing to sneeze at. The man regularly survives all manner of maimings. But Wolverines healing factor has its limits, and if pushed too far, he can die. Ultimate Wolverines healing factor not only gives him a hairy Canadian leg up on the original Wolverine, but it makes him one of the most deadly Wolverines in the multiverse. While Ultimate Wolvie is remarkably similar to his 616 counterpart, this alternate-reality Logan boasts a vastly superior healing factor. While main-reality Wolverine was taken out from crummy adamantium suffocation, Ultimate Wolverine has survived being torn in half and chucked across a mountain range, and even walked away from a point-blank nuclear explosion! Putting Ultimate Wolverine down is hard, making this tough SOB one powerful alternate-reality Wolverine. There are some combinations of words that evoke pure fear. Zombie Apocalypse. Nuclear War. Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel. But perhaps one of the most scariest word combinations in the comic world would have to be Wolverine, Lord Of The Vampires. In the classic Uncanny X-Men #159, Dracula attacked the X-Men and attempted to turn Storm into his consort of the night. Storm was able to break free of Dracs sway, and the team rallied to defeat the vampire, but What If? #24 expanded on the story, imagining a world in which Storm became a vampire, and the newly nocturnal mutant and Dracula attacked the X-Men together. Wolverine discovered his healing factor allows him to control his vampiric urges, and Wolvie takes out Dracula, making Wolverine the new lord of the vampires. With an army of blood-sucking X-Men at his beck and call, this vampiric Wolverine is one of the scariest Wolverines in the multiverse. Well take Things that are completely ridiculous and awesome for $500, Alex. Yes, Dark Claw might be the most 90s character in existence, but theres no denying the appeal of the character. Plus, with Dark Claws background, hes easily one of the most dangerous Wolverines in the multiverse. If you cant tell, Dark Claw is a combination of Batman and Wolverine. Arising from the Marvel and DC crossover event Amalgam, Logan Wayne was a claw-popping mutant on the run from the Weapon X project, who splits his time between a billionaire playboy jet-setting lifestyle and stalking the streets of New Gotham City as the mysterious Dark Claw. With Wolverines claws and healing factor, and Batmans martial arts mastery and gadgets, this oddball mash-up is one deadly alternate-reality Wolverine. Wolverine and the legendary beast known as the Wendigo arent too different. After all, these are both creatures prone to extreme violence, and theyve both been known to run around the wilderness sans pants. But Wolverine retains his humanity, while the Wendigo operates solely as a blood-thirsty animal. Thus, if Wolverine were to run afoul of the Wendigo curse, youd have a truly fearsome creature. Allow us to introduce you to Wendigo Wolverine. In What If? vol. 2 #29, Logan acquires the Wendigo curse after an unfortunate run-in with the creature in the wilds of Canada. Logan learns to control the Wendigo, and is eventually recruited by Captain America to serve as a founding member of the Avengers. As an Avenger, the Wendigo Wolverine (Wendirine? Wolvergo?) is given the code name Hulk, and goes on to become one of the teams most dependable heroes. A Wolverine with the strength to match the Hulk? Now thats one scary alternate-reality Wolvie. The story of Weapon Omega is a tragic one. Once going by the name Weapon X, Logan fought as a hero, rallying his fellow X-Men in defiance of war-hungry despot Apocalypse. But when Celestials came to Earth to judge the planets inhabitants, Weapon X offered himself to the God-like beings to spare the planet. This is where Weapon Xs descent into madness began, cementing the mutant as one of the most dangerous Wolverines in the multiverse. The Celestials augmented Logan, twisting the mutants mind until Weapon X became Weapon Omega, a blood-thirsty madman set on culling humanity from the face of the planet. Supported by the insidious Black Legion, Weapon Omega surpasses Apocalypse in pure power, becoming a threat not just to Earth, but to the entire multiverse, making Weapon Omega a truly scary alternate-reality Wolverine. Brother Mutant is what is traditionally known as stupid powerful. Sure, there are plenty of powerful alternate-reality Wolverines, but Brother Mutant is no mere alternate-reality Wolvie. No, Brother Mutant is a veritable melting pot of power, and he is hands down of the most powerful alternate-reality Wolverines in the multiverse. In Exiles #85, the reality-hopping Exiles were introduced to Brother Mutant, an all-powerful being created after a failed spell from Scarlet Warlock caused Wolverine, Magneto, Quicksilver, Mesmero, and Scarlet Warlock to merge into a single being. With Wolverines claws and healing factor, Quicksilvers speed, Magnetos control of magnetic fields, Mesmeros hypnosis, and Warlocks spells, Brother Mutant has a power for every situation. Able to take down scores of reality-hopping Wolverines single-handedly, Brother Mutant would have no problem taking down the original Wolvie. The Marvel multiverse is filled to bursting with ridiculous alternate-reality versions of beloved characters. Sure, characters such as Dogpool and Juggerduck are strange, but youd be hard pressed to find a stranger alternate-reality take on a character than Sideburn, the Regenerating Planet. In fact, this alternate-reality Wolvie is as powerful as he is ridiculous. Over on Earth-10711, Galacta, daughter of the mighty Galactus, sought to create a never-ending food source for her ravenous father. After some quick tinkering in the lab that involved splicing Wolverines DNA with a planet, Sideburn, the Regenerating Planet was born. Designed to be continuously eaten by Galactus, Sideburn can effectively recover from any amount of damage. If this giant sideburns-sporting orb were to break free, a planet-sized Wolverine could do unspeakable damage to the multiverse, more than earning Sideburn the title of one of the deadliest Wolverines in the multiverse. In theory, Wolverine may never die. Thanks to his healing factor, Logan will likely outlive all of his friends, and may very well outlive humanity. So when you take an aged Wolverine, fill him with grief and rage, and give him the power to snuff out galaxies with a snap of his fingers, youve got yourself the most powerful Wolverine in the multiverse. Debuting in Thor vol. 5 #1, this Wolverine hails from an Earth in which humanity was wiped out by Loki to spite his brother Thor. An aged Wolverine passed in this purge, but his body was chosen by the Phoenix Force as its new vessel. Phoenix Wolverine subsequently spent eons roaming the universe, wiping out entire planets to push the universe towards entropy. With claws composed of pure cosmic fire, and the power of an actual God, youd be hard pressed to find a scarier Wolverine in the multiverse.","Think Wolverine is the best there is at what he does?

"Michael Waters on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Jose Herrada, an inmate at Floridas Gulf Correctional Institution, first heard news about Hurricane Michael on the radio. Initially, Herrada thought little of it. Although the state of Florida had issued a mandatory evacuation order for nearby Panama City and surrounding areas, officials at Gulf CI hadnt brought up the possibility of evacuating the prisons 1,500 inmates. Herrada assumed that meant he would be safe. We thought [the hurricane] was not coming close when they did not evacuate us, Herrada told Earther by email. If officials at Gulf CI reached a similar conclusion, they were dead wrong. The prison took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael as the historically-powerful storm surged across the Florida Panhandle on October 10th. The damage to was immediate: The facility lost power, and phone lines stopped working. Water started flooding in through cracks along the windows. The wind was so strong that it cleaved off several dormitory roofs and a section of the perimeter fence, according to Herrada and The Miami Herald, and inmates had to rush to keep their belongings dry as water flooded in. Buzzfeed reported that many dorm rooms were destroyed and that some windows were entirely blown off. We were scared, Herrada told Earther. Most of us are scarred emotionally. I myself have nightmares. Although the Florida Department of Corrections evacuated six prisons prior to Hurricane Michaels arrival, Gulf CI is one of a number in the path of the storm were not evacuated in advance. Four days after the storm, on October 14th, Gulf CI and other hard-hit prisons were fully evacuated until further damage assessment can be completed, per the department. Michelle Glady, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections, told Earther the department makes determinations about what facilities should be evacuated in the best interest of public, staff and inmate safety based on wind speed, flooding history, building age, road safety, and other factors. Glady added that much like many North Florida communities, our facilities sustained damage but, in all prisons, our staff and inmates were safe, and no one was injured during the storm. Herrada takes a different view. They took a gamble with our lives, he told Earther. In recent years, a spate of mishandled hurricanes has exposed the failures of the U.S. prison system to account for those it incarcerates during natural disasters. The problem was on full display during the two most destructive hurricanes of 2018. A month before Michael, in September, Hurricane Florence bore down on the Carolinas. While North Carolina and Virginia evacuated prisons under threat, the South Carolina Department of Corrections refused to evacuate facilities that lay within high-risk zones. And climate change, which expected to produce bigger and deadlier storms, could place already-vulnerable incarcerated people in even greater danger. Thats not only because their personal safety is consistently ignored during storms, but also because prisons themselves are often at greater risk from hurricanes than other housing structures. According to Yale researcher Hannah Hauptman, who mapped out prison geographies in a recent paper, prisons are disproportionately located on low-lying land that remains vulnerable to storm impacts, in part because many U.S. prisons are former slave plantations. The state approves of and constructs prisons significantly closer to dangerous floodplains than it does for other forms of settlement, Hauptman notes. Even today, private companies sometimes fail to consider storm risks when choosing the locations for new prisons. Washingtons Northwest Detention Center, which opened in 2004, houses up to 1,575 immigrants in one of the nations riskiest tsunami zones. In the event of a tsunami, according to The Seattle Globalist, the prison will fill with as much as two meters of water in less than eight minutes. (Northwest Detention Center did not immediately return Earthers request for comment.) We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated, Keramet Reiter, a professor of criminology at the University of California Irvine School of Social Ecology, told Earther. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. The problem is deeply entrenched, beginning with the fact that many prisons do not even have clearly stated emergency evacuation plans during natural disasters, and there is no state or national requirement that they do, as noted in a recent paper by Columbia Law student William Omorogieva. (Some states require other forms of emergency planning, but none mandates plans specific to natural disasters.) Shaundra Young Scott, director of the ACLU in South Carolina, told Earther that part of the issue is funding. Evacuations are expensive, and in South Carolina, where the state has already slashed mental health programs in its prisons in the last eight years, its pretty clear the state legislature is loath to spend money on prisoners, and quite frankly, they arent worried about evacuation because they dont care about prisoners. When voters also tend to lack empathy for people in prison, there is no political will to change the system. Reports of inmates stranded by devastating hurricanes date back to at least 1937, when the Kentucky state reformatory broke into riots after days without drinking water. Following Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans prisoners who were not evacuated smashed windows to let air in as the floodwaters rose, and they lit their shirts on fire so aid workers would know they were trapped. Last year, during Hurricane Harvey, Houston inmates in multiple prisons were left in cells flooded knee-high with water contaminated by urine and feces without enough food or drinking water, according to The Nation. Texas inmate Deidre McDonald wrote for The Marshall Project about waking up to the sound of thunder cracking and officers screaming for everyone to get to the second floor the morning that Harvey made landfall. Though the state had issued an evacuation warning for Dickinson, Texas, where she was held, the prison did not relocate the group of predominantly disabled inmates living there. McDonald noted that her prisonlike so many otherswas structurally unequipped for a dangerous hurricane: Given the way the Texas Department of Criminal Justice built this place, the sidewalks overflow during even the lightest rain, creating a constant slip-and-fall hazard for the predominantly disabled offender population here, McDonald wrote. We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. Last year, after Hurricane Irma struck her 700-person Miami prison, Homestead Correctional Institute, inmate Natalie Price went two weeks without power. Around her, people were crammed three to a room. Two inches of water lined the floors, Price told Earther, and more leaked in through the walls. All things considered, Price feels the prison administration handled things well for our state emergencymost of the problems, she said, came not from the administration but from the old age of the buildings, which were prone to leaks. Most of the families of inmates around her also didnt understand what was happening, according to Price. Although the state notified them that the Homestead Correctional Institute would be evacuated, it never was. This fall, even Florida prisons located further from the shore than Gulf CIlike Apalachee Correctional Institution, which houses up to 1,300 peoplefelt the effects of Hurricane Michael. Michael Henderson, an inmate at Apalachee CI, told Earther that the prison is so old that even before Hurricane Michael, some windows were broken or outright missing. When the storm arrived, rain rushed in through the open windows, and inmates scrambled to salvage their belongings. For some of us, like myself that meant vital legal work that if destroyed would have left me at a major disadvantage, Henderson said. Yet the worst part was not the flooding itself but the unrest after. Inmates were stuck in lockdown and unable to leave their dorms, Henderson said, recalling that they ate only cold sandwiches served at odd hours. On October 14th, four days after Hurricane Michael, the dorm across from Hendersons broke into a full on free for all that resulted in officers armed with tactical gear detaining inmates. About thirty men were removed and taken to confinement or transferred, Henderson said. (Apalachee CI did not respond to Earthers request for comment on this incident, but verified a near riot over food to the Florida Times Union in October.) The officials knew this hurricane was coming and did little to prepare, Henderson added. The systemic failures of the prison system to account for the people it incarcerates during major storms has not escaped the notice of inmates. Before a hurricane, more experienced inmates often warn newer ones about the unique dangers they face. Back at Gulf CI, Shamar McCullum, another inmate, calls this the talk. McCullum told Earther that a group of older inmates sat him and others down before the storm and warned them that officers may leave to save themselves; that after the hurricane, each person should eat light; and that each inmate should save his most valuable property because it may get flooded out. (According to McCullum, the last two concerns proved to be true.) McCullum also told Earther that, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he had little access to drinking water because the pipes burst. Food came infrequentlyon the third day, he was fed only one meal. McCullum recalls that when an inmate asked an officer when their meal was coming, the officer responded, Better hope you even get feed at all. Thats when I knew it was not looking good for us, McCullum said. Inmates who asked to be seen by nurses were refused and threatened with disciplinary reports because of the lockdown, according to McCullum. He and the other inmates had no way of communicating with their families, though Gulf CI did relay a message that everyone was OK, McCullum said. They spent long days sitting in their cells without possibility of leaving. When presented with these allegations the Florida Department of Corrections told Earther that although it could not confirm or deny individual claims, all inmates had access to food and drinkable water and medical needs were addressed and prioritized, and inmates have access to routine care. Only two days after Hurricane Michael made landfall, Gulf CI was reduced to such disrepair that the first set of inmates were finally evacuated. Adam Baird, a Gulf CI inmate, said that when the evacuation order finally came, many inmates had gone a day without food. 50 or 60 officers came in around 10:30 pm and told everyone to grab their toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and deodorant, and tie the rest of our property in a sheet and leave it in the cell, Baird told Earther, recalling the evacuation. McCullum, for one, was relieved. Now that it is all over I still find myself day dreaming about just how bad things could have been if I stayed one more day at that place, he said. What I and the others went through is a experience I dont want anybody thats locked up to go through because officers dont care about inmates, especially at the time of a hurricane. McCullum and the other Gulf CI inmates have been moved to a patchwork of neighboring prisons, including Mayo CI and the Northwest Florida Reception Center. They do not know whenor ifthey will return to Gulf, but because of the damage, they dont expect it will be anytime soon. (Maintenance crews are currently working on repairs, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.) Whether their experiences will propel policy changes remains to be seen. Some researchers, like Omorogieva of Columbia Law, have proposed that FEMA create a special coordinator for incarcerated populations who could craft new requirements to evacuate inmates during natural disasters. There is even a mechanism for doing this: Congress could expand the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which created a Disability Coordinator within FEMA, to also address the needs of incarcerated people. But that requires political will. And although during this years National Prison Strike incarcerated activists highlighted the importance of environmental issues, and a disparate group of protesters convened outside the South Carolina State House to demand evacuations during Hurricane Florence, few lawmakers have even acknowledged the risks that incarcerated populations face during major storms.

Heather Alexandra,"Red Dead Online s beta kicked off today, for players who own Red Dead Redemption 2s Ultimate Edition. Its an incredibly familiar experience, taking the first games online component and adding a healthy dose of story, survival, and shenanigans. Its a bit barebones at the moment, but the foundation is strong. My first day in Red Dead Online had tiny battles royale, haircuts, clothes shopping, horse theft, and more. The multiplayer mode takes many of the things I enjoyed about the original Red Dead Redemption s online and expands them outwards. The result is an experience thats fast and silly, but holds detailed management and narrative elements as well. You play as an outlaw wrongly accused of a handful of crimes. After working through the character creator, you are rescued by men working for a new character called Jessica LeClerk. She offers a proposition: in return for freeing you, you will help hunt down the men who killed her husband. What follows is a loose story experience peppered with co-op missions and sillier diversions. Its not as wild as Grand Theft Auto Online but also not as slow and serious as the main story. I streamed today with my coworker Tim Rogers. We had a pretty good time. The entire map of Red Dead Redemption 2 is available to explore: the green plains of New Hanover, the swaps of Lemoyne, even the New Austin segment originally found in the first Red Dead Redemption. The game started me in New Austin and was excited to retread the ground Id worn so heavily during the first game, but some players have said they started elsewhere in the game world. In any case, the opening still hits the same beats. Youll meet LeClerk, set up your own camp somewhere in the game world, get your first horse, and then be left to your own devices. Red Dead Online s somewhat limited at the moment in terms of what you can do in free roam. There are up to 32 players in each server, all running around like Western idiots. You can ride around and team up with (or harass) other players, hunt animals, raid gang hideouts, get your haircut, and take side missions from numerous characters. That last part has been the most exciting aspect for me thus far. In my first side mission, I encountered Sean MacGuire, the quick-talking Irishman from Dutch van der Lindes gang, and learned how to pilfer from stagecoaches. In another, I happened upon the first games Bonnie MacFarlane and helped recover stolen property. You might not be able to sit down for a hand of poker or round of Five Finger Fillet, but Red Dead Online seems dense with characters to meet and missions to embark on. Red Dead Online makes a few changes to how players interact in the open world. First and foremost is the ability to set up your own camp. Much like in the main game, this is your home base where you or anyone in your possecan change your outfit or rest up. Camps are flagged as safe zones but players can opt out of that safety if theyre looking for a more dangerous lifestyle. Posses can be joined with a quick romp through a side menu, but theres a permanent option as well. If you have $200 in in-game cash, you can set up a sort of official gang, making it easier to join up with friends. The main games karma meter rears its head here in a system where lawful posses can interrupt the open-world missions of dishonorable players, and vice versa. These little social touches provide a bit more of a framework for collaborative play than the chaotic ad hoc grouping in Red Dead Redemption. Sure, you might get shot by another player on the way into town, but youre just as likely to find someone who will ride up and ask you to take on a gang hideout or simply come back to their camp. Theres still plenty of chaos to be had, though. Beyond whatever grudges might flare up in free roam, the game has playlists for competitive gunfight modes and racing. Ive spent most of my time in the Showdown playlist, which includes traditional team deathmatches and a few other modes. Most Wanted is a free-for-all mode where the more you kill other players, the most your own personal point value increases. The goal is to get the highest score, but the twist is that its best to kill enemies that are worth a lot of points. The deadlier you are, the more people will be gunning for you. If youre looking for something quieter, Make It Count is Red Dead Online s miniaturized battle royale. Every player is armed with a bow and arrow, each hit is instantly lethal, and the play area slowly shrinks over time. My first match took play on a swampy Lemoyne farm, where players slinked through marshlands and ran through crop fields. It was a tense experience that should appeal to players looking for a methodical mode to balance out the brash gunfights of something like team deathmatch. Sometimes, youll just ride with a stranger and thats great. Whereas Red Dead Redemption 2 has a pretense of realism and verisimilitude, Red Dead Online is explicitly gamier. Its odd seeing Valentine go from supposedly realistic town to a deathmatch level, but Red Dead Online exists in a hazy space. You can buy all possible weapons regardless of the modes ambiguous place in the games timelineIve encountered characters who should have been long dead by the time folks were slinging Mauser pistols around. You can walk into stores to buy guns, but your clothes shopping is done by pulling out a catalogue wherever you want (a bit like GTA Online s cellphone) and having them delivered to your camp. If Red Dead Redemption 2 wanted to be a world, Red Dead Online is content to be a playground. After a few hours, youre bound to run through most of the available game modes and activities currently available in Red Dead Online. Theres shooting, story, racing, and some occasional rustling, but players expecting something as diverse as GTA Online should manage their expectations. This is a framework that Rockstar can and will build upon, not an immediately fleshed-out experience. Its a chance to wander the map, play dress-up, dominate a few silly game modes, and chat with friends as you occasionally shoot the horse out from underneath some unlucky bastard. After a long days work, thats really all you need.","Red Dead Online ’s beta kicked off today, for players who own Red Dead Redemption 2’s Ultimate Edition.

Kevin Loria,"Viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread by a variety of viruses and are mostly untreatable. They affect many organs and damage blood vessels, sometimes causing internal and external bleeding. Infections often cause fever, weakness, soreness, and headache, often followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, organ failure, and bleeding. These diseases regularly emerge from the wild, as Ebola did again just recently. They can be extremely deadly — in past Ebola outbreaks, fatality rates ranged between 25% to 90%, with an average of about 50%. Hemorrhagic fevers feature on both the CDC's list of biological agents that could pose a national security threat and on the WHO's list of diseases that can cause a public health emergency, and for good reason. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa infected more than 28,600 people and killed more than 11,300. Such outbreaks can also cause public terror. Experts widely agree that the world needs to develop better ways to contain diseases like this. In the case of Ebola, researchers are testing an experimental vaccine to see if it can help stop the current outbreak.

Forest Fire burning in Butte County Ca as seen from Chico neighborhoods and new housing developmentGetty
In the past two years, wildfires scorched 2.9 million acres in California, including five of the states 20 deadliest fires killing 131 people.
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown grimly warned that because of man-made climate change, these destructive wildfires are the new abnormal that threaten our whole way of life.
Newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsoms rhetoric has been more balanced.
As with Brown before him, Newsom blames climate change for the fires, saying during the campaign last September that, The science is clear increased fire threat due to climate change is becoming a fact of life in our state. Drier, longer summers combined with unpredictable wet winters have created dangerous fire conditions.
Claiming that climate change causes wildfires naturally leads to a demand for action, with Newsom promising an aggressive progressive pushback against the Trump Administrations effort to cut red tape regarding vehicle mileage standards, power plant carbon dioxide emissions, and oil and gas extraction.
Thats politics. Governing often dictates practicality. Here Newsom appears set to do more to combat wildfires than the tentative half-measures signed into law by Brown. Newsom is calling for improved wildfire surveillance and warning systems, better urban planning, and helping property owners clear brush.
Regarding reducing the fuel load, in an interview four months ago, Newsom said that there are Hundreds of millions of dead trees in the state and that it cost his father $35,000 to clear a small little patch of dead trees on his property.
Newsom didnt admit it, but the outrageous cost to remove a few dead trees from private land is a consequence of Californias Byzantine environmental regulatory patchwork.
This is Californias big secret: its not climate change thats burning up the forests, killing people, and destroying hundreds of homes; its decades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush.
This dangerous situation attracted attention from President Donald Trump who, during the height of Californias wildfires last year insisted that There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.
Every year about 3.8 billion board feet of new timber grows in the Golden State, capturing almost one metric ton of CO2 per acre in the productive timberland areas. Trees grow until they die, burn, or get harvested. If harvesting declines, tree mortality and fires increase. Its the tyranny of math.
In the early 1990s, a series of restrictions were placed on logging in the West to protect the Spotted Owl. As it turned out, nature was more complicated than expected, with owl numbers continuing to declineeven after the California timber harvest plummeteddue to predation from other raptors.
In the meantime, the harvest fell below the growth rate in the 1990s, to about 1.5 billion board feet per year over the past decade. The tree harvest on federal lands is now one-tenth of what it was in 1988, President Reagans last full year in office.
The California forest report draft concludes by observing that the Current flux [of CO2] may not be sustainable without forest management! while citing the challenge of Aging of forests on federal lands.
Unlike much of the American South and East, California has a distinct wet season, with Pacific storms rolling in by November or December and wrapping up by March. In even the wettest years (2016-17 was the wettest in 122 years) much of California is bone-dry by late fall. Thus, it isnt climate change that sets the conditions for firesits Californias natural weather pattern. Comparing acres burned in wildfires to weather and tree harvest data, there appears to be little link to climatebut a big connection to the growing forest fuel load, especially on government land.
Which brings us back to policy. If federal and state environmental policies continue to make it difficult and costly to harvest timber and manage the fuel load, then the wildfires will continue and they will be bigger and deadlier. This will, in due course, cause some politicians to blame the fires on climate change.
In the meantime, the timber harvest infrastructure is less than one-third of what it was 30 years ago, meaning that even if politicians were sincere in wanting to manage the public forests, there few people remaining to manage them.

""&gt;Forest Fire burning in Butte County Ca as seen from Chico neighborhoods and new housing developmentGetty
In the past two years, wildfires scorched 2.9 million acres in California, including five of the states 20 deadliest fires killing 131 people.
Former California Gov. Jerry Brown grimly warned that because of man-made climate change, these destructive wildfires are the new abnormal that threaten our whole way of life.
Newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsoms rhetoric has been more balanced.
As with Brown before him, Newsom blames climate change for the fires, saying during the campaign last September that, The science is clear increased fire threat due to climate change is becoming a fact of life in our state. Drier, longer summers combined with unpredictable wet winters have created dangerous fire conditions.
Claiming that climate change causes wildfires naturally leads to a demand for action, with Newsom promising an aggressive progressive pushback against the Trump Administrations effort to cut red tape regarding vehicle mileage standards, power plant carbon dioxide emissions, and oil and gas extraction.
Thats politics. Governing often dictates practicality. Here Newsom appears set to do more to combat wildfires than the tentative half-measures signed into law by Brown. Newsom is calling for improved wildfire surveillance and warning systems, better urban planning, and helping property owners clear brush.
Regarding reducing the fuel load, in an interview four months ago, Newsom said that there are Hundreds of millions of dead trees in the state and that it cost his father $35,000 to clear a small little patch of dead trees on his property.
Newsom didnt admit it, but the outrageous cost to remove a few dead trees from private land is a consequence of Californias Byzantine environmental regulatory patchwork.
This is Californias big secret: its not climate change thats burning up the forests, killing people, and destroying hundreds of homes; its decades of environmental mismanagement that has created a tinderbox of unharvested timber, dead trees, and thick underbrush.
This dangerous situation attracted attention from President Donald Trump who, during the height of Californias wildfires last year insisted that There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.
Every year about 3.8 billion board feet of new timber grows in the Golden State, capturing almost one metric ton of CO2 per acre in the productive timberland areas. Trees grow until they die, burn, or get harvested. If harvesting declines, tree mortality and fires increase. Its the tyranny of math.
In the early 1990s, a series of restrictions were placed on logging in the West to protect the Spotted Owl. As it turned out, nature was more complicated than expected, with owl numbers continuing to declineeven after the California timber harvest plummeteddue to predation from other raptors.
In the meantime, the harvest fell below the growth rate in the 1990s, to about 1.5 billion board feet per year over the past decade. The tree harvest on federal lands is now one-tenth of what it was in 1988, President Reagans last full year in office.
The California forest report draft concludes by observing that the Current flux [of CO2] may not be sustainable without forest management! while citing the challenge of Aging of forests on federal lands.
Unlike much of the American South and East, California has a distinct wet season, with Pacific storms rolling in by November or December and wrapping up by March. In even the wettest years (2016-17 was the wettest in 122 years) much of California is bone-dry by late fall. Thus, it isnt climate change that sets the conditions for firesits Californias natural weather pattern. Comparing acres burned in wildfires to weather and tree harvest data, there appears to be little link to climatebut a big connection to the growing forest fuel load, especially on government land.
Which brings us back to policy. If federal and state environmental policies continue to make it difficult and costly to harvest timber and manage the fuel load, then the wildfires will continue and they will be bigger and deadlier. This will, in due course, cause some politicians to blame the fires on climate change.

Meagan Damore,"SPOILER WARNING: This article contains major spoilers for ""Failure Is an Orphan,"" the latest episode of The Flash.
The true villain of The Flash Season 5 has revealed herself. As Team Flash attempted to cure Orlun ""Cicada"" Dwyer in ""Failure Is an Orphan,"" the latest episode, an older version of Grace Gibbons tore through STAR Labs in search of her uncle. The swift attack revealed her metahuman abilities as well as her decision to take up the Cicada mantle.
During an interrogation with Dr. Vanessa Ambres, Grace's doctor, the longtime Cicada ally revealed Grace had developed metahuman abilities. However, since Grace remained in a coma, it was unclear what those powers would be; Ambres only knew that the girl's forehead had begun to glow. Considering Cicada's killer grudge against metahumans, she elected to keep that information from him for fear he would kill her.

Ambres' fear was unfounded. When Barry revealed to Dwyer that Grace was now a metahuman, he agreed to take STAR Labs' cure for her sake. After Ambres and Caitlin administered the cure, this future version of Grace crashed through a window into STAR Labs' lounge. She used her metahuman abilities to lift Nora and Cecile and trap them against a column with beams of energy, but only brushed Sherloque aside. This allowed him to hit a panic button, alerting the rest of the team to Grace's appearance.
Since she took them by surprise, Grace swiftly defeated Team Flash with her powers and two Cicada daggers of her own. When she discovered her uncle missing, she went in search for him, only to find him unconscious on a gurney. Wielding Cicada's dagger, Ambres begged her not to hurt them; in response, Grace called the dagger to herself, then killed Ambres with it. Grace took Dwyer to a cabin in the woods, where she removed her hood and said, ""I've missed you, Uncle Orlun.""

How this older version of Grace returned to the present remains a mystery, but her presence solves another. Her role as Cicada in the future timeline explains how Flash defeated Dwyer, only for Cicada to resurface years later. As CBR previously speculated, Flash did successfully stop Dwyer, with Grace taking up the mantle in his stead. When Flash disappears, she is able to go on a wild killing spree; according to the Flash Museum in Nora's memory, Grace has a kill count of 152 victims and rising.
Airing Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW, The Flash stars Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Carlos Valdes, Danielle Panabaker, Tom Cavanaugh, Jesse L. Martin, Danielle Nicolet, Hartley Sawyer and Jessica Parker Kennedy.

Lauren Weber,"Ivan Sekretarev/Pool Photo via Reuters Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks Thursday before the Global Ministerial Conference held by the World Health Organization in Moscow. The conference this year was dedicated to the tuberculosis epidemic. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke publicly about the need to rally resources and attention in the fight against tuberculosis, the world’s top infectious killer, in a move public health officials consider a signal that Russia is taking a larger role in the global health sphere. “I am convinced that only together by closing the ranks will we be able to counter the threat which has acquired truly global character,” Putin said while opening the 2017 World Health Organization’s Global Ministerial Conference on Thursday. “TB still poses a serious health risk for people all over the globe.” The Russian leader, who is not known for his public health record in this arena ― Russia previously had pulled out of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the country is currently suffering a massive HIV outbreak ― compared the fight against tuberculosis to the battles against cardiovascular and cancer deaths. All are among the top five causes of death worldwide. Tuberculosis, a treatable, curable airborne disease that kills about three people a minute, has long been a global scourge. A recent report conducted by KPMG estimates the disease will kill 28 million more people and cost the world economy $1 trillion by 2030. And while Russia has had great success in bringing down its high TB rates in recent years, the country still faces some of the worst rates of multi-drug-resistant TB ― a deadlier, harder-to-treat form of the disease. While TB was named a global health emergency and “forgotten epidemic” in 1993 by the WHO, the resources and political will needed to properly address it have not matched the battles against the HIV/AIDS epidemic or Ebola crisis. “It is quite apparent that it doesn’t make much difference politically calling it a global health emergency because the people making decisions for the last 24 years clearly haven’t been treating it as an emergency,” said Matt Oliver, head of the Secretariat for the Global TB Caucus, a worldwide group of parliamentarians. “If your house was on fire for 24 years, you wouldn’t wait that long to put it out. Global leaders are not recognizing it for the threat that it is.” Which is what makes the appearance of Putin all the more meaningful. “One of the most visible public figures making the time to appear and talk is a level of political clout we haven’t seen before,” Oliver stressed. To feature TB previously was like pulling teeth. Dr. Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the international Stop TB Partnership Dr. Eric Goosby, the U.N. special envoy on tuberculosis, sees this move by Russia, to hold the conference and have Putin open it, as a pivot in its influence in the global health sphere. “I think it’s connected to a long-term growing realization on the part of Russia that they need to play a donor role on the planet, that their next kind of maturation moment is becoming a country that helps in the region and helps other countries that need help in a benevolent, humanitarian way,” Goosby told HuffPost three weeks ago. “It’s about Russia being prominent and playing that role in the world, and that’s part of President Putin’s narrative to his people,” Goosby said. Russia’s movement into the playing field comes amid a lack of complete clarity in the U.S. role going forward in fighting TB ― and thus a potential leadership vacuum. While the U.S. is the world’s largest donor by far in the fight against TB, President Donald Trump has previously threatened to cut funding for international aid. However, the Senate has proposed a $20 million increase in USAID’s TB funding, and USAID administrator Mark Green reiterated his support for the fight against TB last month. Meanwhile, Putin isn’t alone in wading into the fight ― India’s Prime Minister Narenda Modi recently tripled the budget to fight TB in his country, which has the most cases worldwide. When asked why TB might be gaining more popularity among political leaders now, Oliver suggested it could be the preventable and treatable nature tuberculosis. “My guess is we are facing a rising tide of noncommunicable diseases,” Oliver said. “And if you’re looking around for something to have an impact in the health sphere, TB is the most tractable of the intractable problems.” Dr. Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the international Stop TB Partnership, pointed to the need for political points ― and the Russian presidential elections are in March. “Even a village mayor wants to show to their own people something that they can finalize and look amazing and their mandate is usually two to three years,” she said, saying the TB community would do well to remember that. “If we want to keep the same spirit and energy, we need to show something in the next two, three years.” Courtesy the World Health Organizations Global Tuberculosis Report 2017 Ditiu also emphasized the importance of having such high-level involvement, calling it the “beginning of a change” in which TB will stay in the minds of world leaders. Previously, she said, “to feature TB was like pulling teeth.” For Dr. Mario Raviglione, director of the WHO Global TB Programme, Russia’s involvement and commitment are game-changers globally, and he called the moment “historic.” He also highlighted the unprecedented gathering of 75 health ministers, who committed to a declaration to up their countries’ fights against TB. The involvement of Russia, a superpower, helps propel the global health community closer to ending TB, Raviglione told HuffPost. “The fact that you have a visible event like this with the head of state and everything else, it’s quite important for the movement itself, as it elevates the political discussion to a level it hasn’t been before,” he said. “We should maintain this momentum at all costs. We have to be thinking we will be judged by the next generations about what has been done.” Alissa Scheller/HuffPost While ending tuberculosis by 2030 is one of the health targets of the U.N. Sustainable Health Goals, experts warn the world is far off track. A recent KPMG report, which used the WHO’s data and mortality numbers, estimated the globe would miss that target by nearly 100 years. But as Goosby often stresses, this is a disease the world knows how to treat and cure ― it’s just a matter of scalability, he told HuffPost. New treatments and technology are also raising the hopes of the TB community, despite an estimated $1.3 million gap in research and development funding. The TB community is gearing up for the first U.N. high-level meeting on tuberculosis ― a monumental global commitment to tackling the disease ― and considers this ministerial conference a stepping stone to greater political commitment. Only four other such meetings have been held: one for HIV/AIDS in 2001, one for noncommunicable diseases in 2011, one for Ebola in 2014 and one for antimicrobial resistance in 2015. Ditiu hopes this is only the beginning of growing interest and global accountability in the fight against TB. “For the U.N. high-level meeting, we hope to have 40 Putins,” she said.

Patrick Redford,"Coming into this postseason Al Horford’s playoff reputation never really stood out. He spent most of his career on a series of Hawks teams that were doomed by be steamrolled by LeBron James every spring. In the 17 times he met James in the playoffs, he only won one game, and that was on his 15th try. Horford has never been a spectacular player, and arguments about the unseen value he adds to a team do not fare well in the face of six playoff series wins in nine seasons in Atlanta and a complete inability to trouble the Eastern Conference hegemony of LeBron James. But everyone in the Eastern Conference has lost to James, whose teams have been to every Finals since 2009-10, and Horford is a legitimate star even though, yeah, sure, he’s kind of boring. He’s showing that now while leading the Boston Celtics, dreadfully misshapen and injured team at the moment, through their playoff run. He anchored the Cetlics in their Game 1 victory over the Sixers last night, going for 26 points on 12 shots, along with seven boards and four assists. A great deal of productive basketball things that the Cetlics do—things observers tend to chalk up to coaching wisdom passed down from Brad Stevens—can actually be attributed to Horford, who is one of the NBA’s craftiest screen setters. The hobbled Celtics are short on ball handlers and shot creators, and so they rely on the space Horford creates with his movement and screens to generate good shots. His newfound three-point aptitude makes him an even deadlier screener. Watch how far away he got from Joel Embiid on the simplest of pick-and-rolls. Because of Horford’s complete game, Embiid is left with two bad choices whenever he’s tossed into a screen action with Horford: stay with his man and leave the rim unprotected, or drop back and leave Horford wide open for a three. Horford has punished defenders who’ve made the latter choice by logging a 70 percent true shooting percentage throughout these playoffs. His ability to spread the floor will continue to be critical in moving Embiid away from the hoop. Horford’s shooting is a newish wrinkle, but he’s always been one of the game’s better defensive centers. The unit he captained this year finished first in defensive rating, and even without Jaylen Brown last night, the Celtics looked imposing. Essentially everyone who logs minutes for Philly besides J.J. Redick is 6-foot-9 or taller, and Horford helped keep every Sixer besides Embiid (whom he rarely guarded one-on-one) nice and quiet. He’s the ideal defender to throw at Philly’s all-arms team. He’s perfectly comfy checking a super-sized point guard driving in from the perimeter: He can even stand tall against Embiid if he has to: The Sixers played like dogshit last night, and you can bet that they won’t shoot 5-for-26 from three again this series. Though they have home court and a better coach, Philly may still have them beat on talent. Boston will need to keep finding inventive ways to score while stymying Philly’s lengthy attack, and their ability to do that begins and ends with Horford. The more control he has, the better the Celtics’ chances will be.","Coming into this postseason Al Horford’s playoff reputation never really stood out.

Laura Geggel,"The U.S. Navy's most commonly used torpedo — the Mark 48 — is getting a makeover that will make it stealthier, deadlier and more far-reaching than ever before, according to news sources. The upgrade will help the submarine-launched heavyweight torpedo — which is a self-propelled underwater missile — demolish enemy ships, submarines and small boats in both shallow and deep waters, according to Warrior Maven. But the new torpedo isn't ready for prime time just yet. In fact, it has yet to be built; the Navy issued these specs, and others, in a recent solicitation to the industry, Warrior Maven reported. [ Weird Weapons: Strange Artifacts in the US Navy's Archives ] Once completed, the high-tech torpedo will help the Navy hit its targets more effectively and from farther distances, helping it compete with other countries that are ramping up their navies, including Russia and China, Warrior Maven noted. For instance, the upgraded weapon’s guidance and control systems will have a better communications structure that replaces its copper wire with fiber-optic wire, allowing the submarine to send more data to the torpedo and vice versa, in effect giving the deadly device a better reaction time, Shephard media reported. ""The Mk 48 ADCAP (advanced capability) torpedo is a heavyweight acoustic-homing torpedo with sophisticated sonar, all-digital guidance and control systems, digital fusing systems and propulsion improvements,"" William Couch, Naval Sea Systems Command spokesman, told Warrior Maven. Submariners and Military SealiftCommand civilian mariners secure a MK-48 torpedo to a crane as they onload to the USS Topeka on June 7. Credit: U.S. Navy All classes of U.S. Navy submarines use the Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo as an anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare weapon, including the Virginia class and yet-to-be-made Columbia class subs, Couch said. (The first Columbia class submarines are expected to be operational in 2031, the U.S. Department of Defense reported.) The current Mk 48 is nearly 2 feet (0.5 meters) in diameter and weighs a whopping 3,520 lbs. (nearly 1,600 kilograms). It can destroy targets 5 miles (3.1 km) away at speeds greater than 28 knots (32 mph or 52 km/h), and even maneuver at depths deeper than 1,200 feet (365 m), Navy and Lockheed data showed, according to Warrior Maven. In addition, the Mk 48 can shoot a 650-lb. (295 kg) high explosive warhead underwater. The upgraded torpedo is expected to be operational in 2024, Warrior Maven reported. The Navy has used the model that is being updated — the Mod 7 — since 2006. ""The latest version of the Mk 48 ADCAP is the mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System [CBASS],"" Couch told Warrior Maven. CBASS allows electronics to go in the torpedo's nose, as well as its guidance system. Lockheed Martin Sippican is already working on the torpedo's new guidance and control systems, and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) has a contract for the weapon's afterbody (its tail-end) and propulsion section, Couch said. On June 20, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. was awarded a contract to use its engineering and maintenance services on the Mk 48, the Department of Defense reported. The United States isn't the only country to use the Mk 48 torpedo; Australia, Canada, Brazil and the Netherlands use it, too, Warrior Maven reported.

Ethan Anderton,"This week will bring the first trailer for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the sequel to the 2015 reboot/sequel in the Jurassic Park franchise. Though some would argue that Jurassic World was a tad underwhelming, much like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it delivered the right amount of nostalgia mixed with fresh elements to make it feel new again. Plus, it had been awhile since we’d gotten a decent blockbuster with dinosaurs. Anyway, with just a few days out from the release of the full trailer, Universal Pictures has released a Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom trailer teaser featuring out first look at one of the action sequences from the film, and it has one particular elemtn that we’ve never seen in a Jurassic Park movie before. You’ll see what I mean below. The clip begins with Chris Pratt as Owen Grady running across an open field like Indiana Jones being chased by the native protectors of the idol in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Claire Dearing ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) and an unknown new character played by franchise newcomer Justice Smith ( Paper Towns ) look on in fear as they see a stampede of dinosaurs trailing behind him. But why are they running? It just so happens that there’s a volcano erupting in the background, creating plenty of fire, smoke and flying debris. I’m not sure whether the volcano or dinosaurs are more deadly in this instance. Actually, the volcano might make the dinosaurs deadlier since they’re running in complete terror. Much of the plot of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is still under wraps, but we know the movie will include new cast members James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, and Rafe Spall. But perhaps the most enticing piece of casting is the return of Jurassic Park star Jeff Goldblum this time. Plus, there will be new dinosaurs coming into play too. A Monster Calls director J.A. Bayona has taken over directing duties from Jurassic World helmer Colin Trevorrow, and we’ll be sure to post the full trailer as soon as it’s available. With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful franchises in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.

Emma Beswick,"The proportion of people who are dying at sea trying to reach Europe has greatly increased, according to a new UNHCR report. Despite lower numbers of refugees and migrants crossing the sea than in 2017, the UNHCR reported one death for every 18 people that arrived via the Central Mediterranean route in Europe from January-July 2018. For the same period in 2017, there was one death for every 42 arrivals. “This report once again confirms the Mediterranean as one of the world’s deadliest sea crossings,” said UNHCR’s Director of the Bureau for Europe, Pascale Moreau. “With the number of people arriving on European shores falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives.” ""The risks involved for refugees and migrants travelling to Europe remain very high,"" the report said. In the first seven months of 2018, over 1,500 refugees and migrants are believed to have died at sea, most of them while attempting to cross the sea from Libya. Increased death rate A major factor that contributed to the increased death rate was the decreased search and rescue capacity off the Libyan coast in 2018 compared to the same period last year. In the first seven months of 2017, NGOs were the primary actors intervening off the Libyan coast, rescuing almost 39,000 refugees and migrants. In 2018, the number of NGO boats operating off the coast on a consistent basis has been reduced to two, so there are fewer actors to detect and rescue in the area. ""The Libyan Coast Guard has become the primary actor intervening off the Libyan coast, including sometimes over 70 miles (112 km) from the shore, with most interventions conducted by two patrol vessels,"" claimed the report. As a result of rescues occurring further out to sea, migrants and refugees are forced to spend longer on ""overcrowded and unsafe"" boats before they are rescued and traffickers are taking more risks due to the Libyan Coast Guard's increased surveillance. The sea route from North Africa to Spain also saw a 50% increase in deaths since last year, with 200 dying in the whole of 2017 — 300 people have died so far in 2018. This April over 1,200 reached Spain by sea and the death rate was one in 14. Less people making the 'desperate journey' The report puts the lower numbers of migrants crossing the sea than in 2017 down to several measures: Further support for Libyan authorities to prevent sea crossings to Europe. Further restrictions on the work of NGOs involved in search and rescue operations. Limited access to Italian ports for refugees and migrants rescued at sea since June. According to the report, action by Italy has also lead to a ""far higher death rate"". Matteo Salvini, the populist interior minister of Italy, said his country would “no longer be Europe’s refugee camp”, with the country involved in diplomatic feuds when they refused to allow migrant rescue ships to dock in Italian ports unless other EU states agreed to take in those onboard. What can be done? The UNHCR called on Europe to increase access to safe and legal pathways for refugees, including by increasing resettlement places and removing obstacles to family reunification – helping to provide alternatives to potentially deadly journeys.","There is one death for every 18 migrants that arrive in Europe, according to a new UNHCR report — a sharp increase compared to the same period last year.",2018-09-03T12:29:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Euronews.com'}",Crossing Mediterranean 'deadlier than ever' for migrants — UNHCR report,http://www.euronews.com/2018/09/03/crossing-mediterranean-deadlier-than-ever-for-migrants-unhcr-report,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/29/93/08/1000x563_cmsv2_01fbec19-7e13-58a6-bcf2-407854345ffb-3299308.jpg,,Euronews.com,deadlier,1
Brian Crecente,"Looking across Bethesda Softwork’s recently unveiled portfolio of games – from old-school shooter and RPG to VR experiences and AAA mobile game – it might be hard to connect the dots between those titles. How can one devine how Bethesda picks what to spend time on creating and when to do so? That’s simple said Pete Hines, Berthesda’s senior vice president of marketing, and it really hasn’t changed much in the company’s more than 30 year history. “The basic idea is still that we work on the kind of things that our devs are excited about making on the platforms that make sense,” Hines said. “If that’s console great. If that’s PC great. If it includes VR great. If not OK.” Take, for instance, “Elder Scrolls: Blades.” Revealed during the company’s E3 showcase earlier this week, “Blades” will be Bethesda’s latest entry in its popular Elder Scrolls role-playing game franchise. But instead of launching on a console or PC, it will hit this fall as a free-to-play iPhone, iPad and Android game. Despite its launch on mobile, the game is meant to be a massive first-person role-playing game. The title has high-end graphics, rich environments and a robust line-up of magic, gear and skills. You can also customize your city or take on other players in an arena. Finally, the game has the Abyss – an infinitely replayable mode in which daring heroes push their limits floor after floor in a never-ending dungeon, where enemies become deadlier and deadlier as you progress. During my time with the work-in-progress game, the controls felt like they could use a bit of work to tighten the responsiveness, but it was a fun way to play and worked equally well whether playing in horizontal or vertical mode. The ultimate goal is to bring the same game to other platforms too, from PC to console. How the game came about is typical of how Bethesda decides what to work on. Hines said that Todd Howard just said he wanted try to do something different with the Elder Scrolls franchise. “This is Todd saying, ‘I want to do a thing, a mobile Elder Scrolls that feel like a console experience but on your phone and then bring it to every other platform,” Hines said. “That seemed awesome so OK, do it.” In some ways, Bethesda’s decision to revive “Rage” and develop a sequel nearly eight years after the first hit followed the same path. It was about pairing the right person or studio with the right game and idea. “We didn’t have anyone who had that ability that could bring what we thought would be exciting to ‘Rage,’” Hines said. “Until we talked to Avalanche and saw they could take it to the originally place id (Software) wanted to go. “ Hines noted that while the game had driving and vehicular combat, the original game wasn’t the sort of open-world title that was intended. “I had a lot of fun playing it, it needed an ending, but it was fun,” Hines said. “But it felt like it never delivered on the promise of being able to go all over the place and do stuff everywhere.” Developers Avalanche, especially after their work on the “Mad Max” game seemed like a good match. “They did great stuff with ‘Mad Max’ and know vehicles and combat,” he said. “There needs to be a lot of quests to do, but also there needs to be some ‘What if I took that and take it over there to see what it will do?’”",Looking across Bethesda Softwork’s recently unveiled portfolio of games – from old-school shooter and RPG to VR experiences and AAA mobile game – it might be hard to connect the dots between those titles.

Stefanie Fogel,"Square Enix showed off a very stealthy Lara Croft during its E3 2018 presentation on Monday. In the upcoming “ Shadow of the Tomb Raider,” Lara will “become one with the jungle,” according to Eidos Montreal senior game director Daniel Chayer-Bisson. During the brief gameplay video, she takes down enemies in a variety of sneaky ways, including swooping down on a rope. So, she’s basically morphing into Batman. Chayer-Bisson said Lara will have a variety of new moves, including grappling, wall running, and 360 degree swimming, which means there will be underwater areas to explore and plunder. The hub world is the biggest Eidos Montreal has created for any “Tomb Raider” game, and it includes a large hidden city, Chayer-Bisson said. Of course, there will also be plenty of tombs and they’ll be deadlier than ever. “Tomb Raider” is an important IP for Square Enix. The 2013 and 2015 reboots have sold over 18 million copies combined, Square Enix CEO Yosuke Matsuda told GamesIndustry.biz in 2017. “ Shadow of the Tomb Raider ” is expected to launch on September 14 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

"Fred Kaplan, Fred Kaplan","President Donald Trump arrives to attend the ceremonial swearing-in of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the State Department on May 2. In the past couple days, the vice president and the secretary of state have threatened to go to war against Iran and North Korea if those countries’ leaders don’t bend to President Donald Trump’s will. The nation’s top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, said in a speech on Monday that the United States would “crush” Iran, through economic and military pressure, if it did not change its behavior in the Middle East. Trump’s right-hand man, Mike Pence, told Fox News, on the same day, that North Korea would wind up like Libya “if Kim Jong-un doesn’t make a deal” to get rid of his nuclear weapons. Asked if this could be interpreted as a threat, he said, “Well, I think it’s more of a fact.” Pence brought up Libya to clarify the recent remarks by Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, who likened an acceptable deal with North Korea to the one struck in the early 2000s with Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi, who gave up his nascent nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. A few years later, Qaddafi was overthrown in a Western-backed revolt, then killed. North Koreans’ leaders were not amused by the comparison Pompeo and Pence issued these threats without the slightest backing of a single foreign ally or international institution. Their statements—along with Trump’s recent abrogation of the Iran nuclear deal, despite the uncontested fact that Iran has abided by its terms—have, in fact, alienated the European leaders who co-signed the deal. An actual attack on either country would likely have catastrophic consequences. A tangible buildup to war with North Korea would arouse opposition from South Korea and Japan—and, possibly, resistance from China. Sunni Arabs and Israel’s political leadership might welcome an attack on Iran, but it would embroil the United States in an even deeper, deadlier conflict than the war in Iraq. For one thing, Iran is much larger than Iraq; for another, though most of its people despise their regime, history suggests that they detest foreign invaders even more. Trump is letting the overheated rhetoric flow. And yet, when it comes to North Korea, it’s clear that he doesn’t know what he wants or how to get it. In a press conference Tuesday, preceding his meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump sent mixed messages, at best, to any friend or foe who might be watching. Moon came to Washington to shore up the prospects of a summit, scheduled for June 12, between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Kim’s top negotiator issued a statement last week, threatening to call off the summit if Trump didn’t back down from Bolton’s demand that North Korea surrender all of its nuclear weapons right away, in exchange for vague promises of U.S. economic assistance later. One could envision Bolton’s face turning the color of his mustache. The statement upset Trump, who had been assuming that his vaunted deal-making skills would win Kim over and that the resulting treaty would win him the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump’s remarks at Tuesday’s news conference revealed a man in confusion. He said he was surprised by Kim’s change in attitude and noted that the shift occurred shortly after the North Korean leader’s second meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, making Trump wonder whether Xi had shifted his own stance on peace and sanctions. In fact, Kim’s views haven’t changed at all—he has long declared, as his goal, the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” (not just of North Korea) through “phased and synchronous measures” (not all at once). Asked about Kim’s conditions, Trump said he would prefer to have North Korea get rid of its nukes right away, but phasing them out over time might be fine as well. One could envision Bolton’s face turning the color of his mustache. If the all-at-once demand—which has been endorsed by Bolton and Pompeo—was ever a bargaining position, it isn’t any longer. If, as is more likely, it was meant as a demand that Kim couldn’t accept and, therefore, as a prelude to U.S. military action, it no longer carries much weight on that level either. Trump, after all, has now said he could go for gradual disarmament if Kim preferred. Nor did Trump try to eke any leverage from the summit date. He would still like to have it happen on June 12, but if it’s delayed a bit, well, that’s all right. In any case, Trump said, in his most baffling remark, “In the end, it will work out. I can’t tell you how or why, but it always does.” This isn’t diplomacy or strategy or pressure or a stab at détente or anything else that might shore up a nation’s credibility or even express its intentions. It’s simply piffle from someone who watches too much bad television. In every contest to date, Trump has acceded to Kim, who is very much in control of this process and of the whole complex of U.S.–South Korean–North Korean–Chinese relations. This is what happens when one negotiator knows what he wants and the other negotiator is in it simply for the pageantry. Meanwhile, Pence, Pompeo, and Bolton are taking it all seriously but rejecting the diplomatic possibilities outright, waiting only for the summit to collapse and then pushing for war as the logical sequel. Through all the commotion, Secretary of Defense James Mattis—the last remaining “grown-up in the room”—has stayed fairly quiet. A retired Marine four-star general who lost many of his troops to Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, he has long scorned and distrusted Tehran, though he spoke up for the nuclear deal—especially its verification procedures, which have kept Iran in compliance—just before Trump pulled out. And he has always opposed attacking North Korea, even resisting White House requests for attack options, knowing that retaliation by Pyongyang would kill hundreds of thousands of people in the region, with no benefit to U.S. or allied security. I wonder what books Mattis is pulling down from his vast personal library’s shelves for solace and strategic guidance. One can only hope that they’re helping him outmaneuver the hawks who have never seen war across the river.

Grant DeArmitt,"There was so much to love about both Aquaman and Black Panther. Both introduced us to new and exciting civilizations, both told gripping tales of leadership, and both featured some exquisite CGI. But one of the best parts about both films were their respective villains.
Killmonger and Black Manta made for some incredible arch-nemeses in these movies, and comic book films from here on out will have a tough time matching either of them. But we've got to ask; just which one is a better arch-nemesis? We broke down the role of an arch-nemesis into categories to find out, awarding points to each character based on that category. So read on to find out who wins the battle of Black Manta Vs. Killmonger: who's the deadlier arch-nemesis?
10 Strategy: Killmonger
It takes a lot of planning to go up against two of the greatest heroes in comic book movies. So if you're going to be an arch-villain, you'll need to have a knack for organization. Of course, Black Manta's got this quality in spades. He's been a pirate most of his life, so he has to think things through before boarding an enemy ship.
However, Killmonger's ability to plan reaches just a bit farther. He's got a strategy for finding Wakanda, for invading Wakanda, and for taking over Wakanda. Then, he's got a plan to use Wakanda to literally rule the world. Black Manta's no doubt got a great revenge plan for Aquaman two. But we doubt it's as visionary as Killmonger's.
9 Technology: Black Manta
It was hard to decide between Wakandan technology and Atlantean. After all, both are basically magic. But, there's one fact that sets Black Manta's weaponry apart from Killmonger's. In the scene in which Orm hires Manta to kill Aquaman, he tells him that the technology he's giving him is an all-new prototype. It's never been used before, by any Atlantean.
Killmonger's suit is cutting edge as well, but it's not as new as Manta's. Plus, Black Manta actually modifies the weaponry to better suit his fighting style. (More on that later.) Both suits and weapon sets are far more advanced than what we have today. But Manta's tech reaches even farther into the future.
8 Skill: Killmonger
Alright, so Manta might have the better fightsuit, but what happens when the suits come off? Well first, billions flock to the steamiest R-rated superhero crossover movie ever. All joking aside, without their tech, Erik Killmonger is just a better fighter.
He can hold his own against powerful enemies even without the heart-shaped flower's medicine, and with it, he could give Captain America a run for his money. David Kane is an impressive combatant, but nowhere near that in terms of pure martial arts ability.
7 Partners: Black Manta
Both Black Manta and Killmonger form partnerships with people they find useful. Of course, they're not loyal to these partners in crime, they just keep them around as long as they serve their purposes. So which set of partners serve our villains' respective purposes better? Of course, Ulysses Klaue helped get Killmonger to Wakanda, and was definitely instrumental to his plans.
However, Black Manta partnered up with the Ocean Master. Not only is Orm in a higher position than Klaue, he's got more resources and more commitment to his ideals. Plus, he just looks so much more put together. And that's important when introducing your partner to your supervillain family.
6 Ruthlessness: Killmonger
Speaking of partners, neither Killmonger or Black Manta are opposed to killing theirs. That's pretty evil and can mark a character as a real villain to an audience. Black Manta, however, doesn't end up killing his in Aquaman. That's not the case for Killmonger.
Not only does Killmonger kill Klaue to get him into Wakanda, but he also kills his romantic partner to further his plans. This probably wouldn't come up on this list because of the subject matter we're talking about, but Black Manta definitely wins the category of ""better friend.""
5 Look: Black Manta
Ok, this category might have been the hardest to decide. Killmonger has several awesome outfits throughout Black Panther, from his golden fightsuit to his casual outfit in the beginning to his mask and armor combo. If this was a contest of looks between MCU villains, Killmonger would be in the top three at the very least.
But Black Manta looks just like his comic book counterpart. And that comic book counterpart looks insane! Black Manta's costume is one of the weirdest products of the Silver Age of comics. And for adapting it so faithfully, we have to give this one to him.
4 Experience: Killmonger
Both of these villains have lived harsh, difficult lives. They've seen violence since they were children. They absorbed it as they grew. So in a contest of who has more villainous experience, the answer is close to a toss-up. However, one fact puts Killmonger above Black Manta in this category. Both villains have seen their fathers killed, leading ultimately to their roles as arch-villains.
Killmonger saw his father die much earlier in life, though. The hatred he learned that day developed for a lot longer, setting him on the path of death and destruction he brings into Black Panther. Both characters have lives defined by hatred, Killmonger has just lived it longer.
3 Intelligence: Black Manta
Combat skills and advanced technology aren't all that these villains bring into a fight. Both are also incredibly intelligent. However, we get a pretty clear picture of just which one is smarter in one of the most fun montages a superhero movie has ever produced. We're talking, of course, about Black Manta building his battle suit.
Not only is he working with incredibly advanced, inhuman technology, but David is also actually improving it in this scene. We get hints at a brilliant mind under Killmonger's mask several times in Black Panther, but nothing compared to this cool montage in Aquaman.
2 Arch-Nemesis: Killmonger
You can hardly judge a character considered a villain if you don't also look at the hero they oppose. And in this case, Killmonger's arch-nemesis is just cooler. He's the kind of leader that we could see ourselves following in real life; considerate, decisive, humble despite his place of power.
Of course Aquaman is all of these things too, but it takes him a while to get there in his DCEU arc. In Justice League, after all, he's kind of selfish. From the first moment we meet him in the MCU, T'Challa proves himself to be a great king, a great hero, and a truly powerful enemy to evildoers.
1 Winner: Killmonger
This list took us a while to write. We loved both Black Panther and Aquaman as films, and they wouldn't have been half as good without their great villains. But after spending a while thinking about it, we have to give this award to Killmonger. Still, we want to know; do you agree? Did we judge any of these categories unfairly? Or would you have used different categories altogether?
Let us know in the comments section below, we want to hear your thoughts! Keep an eye on Comic Book Resources for more Who Would Win articles like this one, and let us know who you'd like to see go head-to-head. Happy debating!

"USA TODAY, Dalvin Brown and Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","Coastal properties took a beating as Hurricane Michael roared ashore along the Florida Panhandle. USA TODAY The storm surge from Hurricane Michael pushes into the homes four hours prior to high tide on October 10, 2018 in the Florida Panhandle community of Shell Point Beach, Florida. (Photo: Mark Wallheiser, Getty Images) The strongest hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history blew away roofs and snapped trees with winds of up to 155 mph, just two short of a Category 5. And the news about Michael, now downgraded to a tropical storm, is about to get worse, as residents return to find their homes flooded by storm surge that reached 14 feet. Though a hurricanes power is typically measured by its winds, the storm surge is often just as destructive and even deadlier, accounting for about half the hurricane-related fatalities in the U.S. since 1970 and the majority of the 1,200 deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. For folks dealing with flooding, what to do after the hurricane has passed can be as important as pre-storm preparations. Here are the key steps to take: TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF ""Make sure you're emotionally OK,"" said Elaina Sutley, assistant professor of structural engineering at the University of Kansas. ""Only then should you start assessing any structural damage."" What materials do I need? Make sure you have knee-high rubber boots, rubber gloves, long-sleeve clothing, a respirator, a flashlight, a camera and liquid bleach. Where do I start? Start by turning off any gas or power to prevent explosions or electrocution. Then begin drying out your home and addressing the structural damage such as a wall collapse or sinking ceilings. And remember: There may still be water left either in the basement or seeping from soaked furniture. Avoid coming in direct contact with any water, which may have been exposed to sewage, debris or dead animals. And let the house air out. ""You need to open up windows and doors. Let things dry out,"" Sutley said. Fans and dehumidifiers can help speed up the drying process. While everything dries, which can take a few days, homeowners are encouraged to throw out any food left in the home along with any absorbent material that has come in contact with water. And wash dinnerware, glasses and flatware before using them again. ""If there was saltwater flooding, there might be corrosion, so get an electrician to look at that,"" said Jeffrey Schlegelmilch of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. ""Even if it's not salt water, things could still be dangerous. Fact-check with a professional before plugging anything in."" What do I do with damaged items? Coastal areas that have experienced floods in the past will likely have protocols for picking up and handling debris such as drywall and furniture. To prevent the spread of mold and mildew, you may also have to remove flooring and insulation. Ideally, have a professional company do a mold assessment soon after the flooding to help you decide what items must be discarded and what can be saved. Time is of the essence because mold can develop within 24 hours. What can I keep? Family heirlooms, jewelry, photographs and other valuables can be air-dried and saved. Clean and disinfect them if they came in contact with floodwater. What should I avoid? Most of all, standing water, which is likely to be contaminated. But also look out for wildlife like snakes, raccoons or any critters trapped in your home brought in by the floodwaters. What happens if I wait? ""If your home is just left to sit, it will continue to deteriorate, and it becomes even more of a health threat,"" Schlegelmilch said. In other words, act now. TAKING CARE OF YOUR WALLET The sooner homeowners file claims with an insurance agency or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the faster a resolution can be reached. However, traditional homeowner policies don't cover flooding. Only flood insurance policies reimburse families for water damage caused by flooding. ""After Hurricane Matthew hit the southeastern United States, I worked on a project where we spoke to households and businesses about receiving assistance from their insurance or FEMA,"" Sutley said. ""Most people who had insurance and filed a claim received help within 30 days. Most people who applied for FEMA had received it within a month. What do I need? Insurance documents, home deeds and your Social Security card can get you started on making an insurance claim. Photos and videos of the property both before and after the flood are also essential, since recovery agencies will likely request proof of the damage. Where do I start? It's important to contact your insurance agency before you remove anything from your home. ""Insurance companies sometimes want to send someone down to investigate before anything is taken out,"" Schlegelmilch said. After contacting your insurance company, work can begin. Homeowners are encouraged to remove any carpet or drywall that has come in contact with water before mold starts to form. ""You don't want just to get surfaces to look clean; you want to make sure that there aren't any living mold spores,"" said Schlegelmilch, who recommended seeking guidance on which bleach to use from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What if I don't have insurance? It's pretty common for people not to have flood insurance, no matter their income level. In coastal regions, it may be mandatory. But for those who live further inland, there are often local aid options. ""Find out what types of public assistance is available in your area,"" Schlegelmilch said. ""There are a lot of charities that pop up to help people get back in their homes. Some move people to the top of the list who are low-income or have disabilities."" To find out if you qualify for assistance or for more information, check FEMA's website disasterassistance.gov.

Eddie Makuch,"Lucasfilm, the film and TV company behind Star Wars, has responded to the controversy around microtransactions surrounding the recently launched Star Wars: Battlefront II. A spokesperson told The Washington Post that the company stands behind publisher EA's decision to temporarily suspend the game's implementation of microtransactions. ""Star Wars has always been about the fans--and whether it's Battlefront or any other Star Wars experience, they come first,"" the spokesperson said. ""That's why we support EA's decision to temporarily remove in-game payments to address fan concerns."" Battlefront II's microtransactions were removed just hours before the game's official launch on Friday, November 17. EA made the call after facing a wave of criticism amongst those who played an early version of the game through EA/Origin Access or by pre-ordering. In addition to heat from fans, it seems like Disney executive Jimmy Pitaro, who heads up the company's consumer products and interactive media division, might have been involved in the decision to have microtransactions removed. The Wall Street Journal reported that Pitaro spoke with EA management just hours before microtransactions were removed. Pitaro reportedly informed EA that executives at Disney were upset by how the dissatisfaction amongst players ""reflected on their marquee property."" Headlines about Battlefront II and player outrage made international news, and with just weeks to go before The Last Jedi 's release on December 15, Disney was surely looking for a more positive news cycle around its biggest brand. Battlefront II offers loot crates that contain randomized items. Before the microtransactions were removed, you could purchase Crystals with real-world money that could be spent on loot crates. Part of what made Battlefront II's loot crate system highly contentious is that the boxes could contain items that provide actual gameplay performance-boosters such as deadlier grenades or extended cloaking. You can still get those bonuses, but now all progression is tied to your in-game achievements. EA is bringing back microtransactions at a later date, but there is no word as of yet if changes to the progression system will also be made. For example, we don't know if EA will take a page out of Overwatch 's playbook and offer only cosmetic items in its loot crates or if the company will take a different approach. We will be monitoring the situation and will report back with more details as they're made available. EA's stock price took a hit after Battlefront II dropped microtransactions, but the company says this will have no meaningful impact on its bottom line for the fiscal year. It remains to be seen what effect the microtransaction controversy may have on Battlefront II sales. In the UK, first-week physical sales were down 61 percent compared to the 2015 Battlefront reboot, which doesn't paint the rosiest of pictures, even with an assumed rise in the digital share factored in.

"Jonathan J. Cooper, Cathy Bussewitz & Garance Burke / AP","(SACRAMENTO, Calif.) — A utility facing severe financial pressure amid speculation its equipment may have sparked a deadly Northern California wildfire asked U.S. energy regulators last month for permission to raise its customers’ monthly bills to harden its system against wildfires and deliver a sizable increase in profits to shareholders. In an October filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. laid out a variety of dangers confronting its transmission lines running through Northern California, saying its system faced a higher risk of wildfires than any other utility. “The implications of PG&amp;E’s exposure to potential liabilities associated with wildfires are dramatically magnified,” the filing said. “Overcoming the negative financial impact of any significant damages that might ultimately be attributed to PG&amp;E will require an ongoing commitment of capital from investors.” San Francisco-based PG&amp;E — one of the nation’s largest electric utilities serving most of Northern and central California — made the request a month before the Camp Fire broke out Nov. 8 and quickly ballooned into the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century. No cause has been determined, but speculation has centered on PG&amp;E, which reported an outage around when and where the fire ignited. The company has lost $15 billion in market value, its shares plummeting 60 percent in a week. PG&amp;E already faced financial pressure from its suspected role in a series of deadly fires in California wine country last year. The company’s filing last month said it needed to boost revenue to keep investors from fleeing, noting that its credit rating was downgraded and its shares had plummeted since the 2017 fires. Wildfires threaten PG&amp;E’s ability to attract and maintain the investment necessary to support its system and meet California’s clean energy goals, company spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said. “PG&amp;E’s electrical system is not immune from the impact of increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather,” Paulo said. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker sought to calm financial markets late Thursday with a statement noting “an essential component of providing safe electrical service is the financial wherewithal to carry out safety measures.” But he added that he’s expanding an investigation of PG&amp;E’s safety culture to look at the company’s “corporate governance, structure and operation.” PG&amp;E shares rebounded in after-hours trading, regaining Thursday’s losses but remaining far below their value when the fire broke out. The company said in its rate-hike request that the extreme wildfire risk justified a higher profit than an average utility is allowed to earn. It cites a California legal standard holding utilities entirely liable for damage caused by their equipment regardless of whether the company was negligent. A state law approved this year makes it easier for the company to raise rates to pay off lawsuits, but the company says it still faces high risk and got no relief for fires that started this year. The precipitous drop in the stock price shows investors are taking into account not just the fires but also the risk of future wildfires for which the utility could be responsible, analysts said. “It’s going to be very difficult for PG&amp;E to finance its needs in the short run, so we think at this point, regulators need to step in and give the market some reassurance,” said Travis Miller, a strategist at Morningstar. PG&amp;E is asking for a 9.5 percent increase in transmission charges — the cost of high-voltage lines that move power across large distances. That amounts to about $1.50 more per month for the average residential customer, Paulo said. Advocates for utility customers have balked at PG&amp;E’s contention that it needs to raise rates because of wildfires. They say its problems are the result of poor management decisions. “We don’t pay electric bills in order to keep bailing PG&amp;E out from its own negligence and incompetence, and we can’t afford it,” said Mindy Spatt, communications director for The Utility Reform Network. PG&amp;E reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission this week that it had renewed its insurance coverage for wildfires to about $1.4 billion for the year covering this fire season. But an analyst at Citi Investment Research estimated damages could exceed $15 billion. And the company’s potential liability for last year’s fires has been pegged at upward of $10 billion. Some analysts believe PG&amp;E will be able to survive financially as long as there isn’t another major catastrophe. But wildfires are getting bigger, deadlier and more destructive as housing pushes into rural areas and drought and high temperatures tied to climate change become the norm. “The business doesn’t earn enough money to pay for that in any kind of regular way,” said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University. “These have to be extreme, once-in-a-generation events.” PG&amp;E’s ability to raise capital will be constrained, so it will probably be forced to cut back on expenses such as replacing aging equipment, analysts said. California utilities also need to invest in the type of upgrades that will allow the state to meet its aggressive renewable energy and carbon reduction goals. Fire investigators have blamed PG&amp;E equipment for 12 of last year’s wildfires, including two that killed 15 people combined. In eight of those fires, investigators said they found evidence of violations of state law and forwarded the findings to prosecutors. The company is facing dozens of lawsuits from insurers and people who lost their homes in last year. And a lawsuit this week blames PG&amp;E for the latest fire, accusing the company failing to effectively maintain power lines. California regulators generally allow utilities to pass on the costs of those lawsuits to their customers, but only if the company can show it prudently managed its equipment. The new state law makes it easier for utilities to bill customers if they can show a fire got worse from things outside their control, like severe weather. But lawmakers didn’t drop the standard that puts all the liability on the utility, which is unique to two states. “Very large damage payments of the size faced by California utilities are very unusual in other states,” said Hugh Wynne of Sector and Sovereign Research, an investment research firm.

Brittany A. Roston,"Smoking, lack of exercise, not getting enough sleep — these are among the many lifestyle factors popularly known to have a negative effect on one’s health, but none of them compare to the ramifications of a poor diet, according to a new study. A poor diet is “an equal opportunity killer,” according to the study’s lead author Dr. Ashkan Afshin, who said the risks can be found regardless of gender, age, and other demographics.
The research was recently published in The Lancet, a medical journal, and it involved an analysis conducted by more than 130 scientists across almost 40 countries. The study found that poor diets were behind 22-percent of all adult deaths in 2017 (10.9 million) — cardiovascular disease was the primary cause, with cancer and diabetes being next in line.
In addition to the deaths, the study found that poor diets were responsible for 255 million DALYs — disability-adjusted life years. This, the researchers explained, are the collective number of years people spent living with disabilities directly linked to poor diets and the number of years lost due to early deaths associated with eating poorly.
Overall, poor diet is behind 16-percent of adult DALYs around the world. Variations in poor diets aside, the study points toward three dietary factors that greatly contributed toward diet-related death and DALYs: high sodium intake, low whole grains consumption, and low amounts of fruit in one’s diet. Other risky dietary habits include high red meat consumption, eating large amounts of processed meats, trans fatty acids, and sugary drinks.
The findings indicate that the general public would benefit from a diet that decreases the consumption of sugary drinks, processed foods, red meat, and high sodium products, instead replacing those substances with fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, plant-based proteins, and whole grains.","Smoking, lack of exercise, not getting enough sleep — these are among the many lifestyle factors popularly known to have a negative effect on one’s health, but none of them compare to the ramifications of a poor diet, according to a new study.

Chris Evangelista,"Two new looks at The Predato r are here to give us a glimpse of the new and improved alien trophy hunter. Shane Black ‘s upcoming film attempts to breathe new life into the stagnant action franchise, but early buzz has been a bit muted. Perhaps these new Predator images will change that. I would love for Shane Black’s The Predator to be a smash success. I love Black’s work, I’m impressed with the cast he’s assembled – Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, Thomas Jane – and there’s a lot of potential for a new Predator film. But the marketing for the sequel has been a bit…underwhelming. The first trailer left a lot to be desired, and while the second was better, it still felt like it was missing something. A part of this is likely due to a deliberate obtuseness – Black and company don’t want to give too much away, and are keeping the trailers secretive. Empire has two new Predator photos that continue to keep the film shrouded in secrecy, while also giving us new looks at the Predator itself. In this image, we see a Predator with some new, sleek armor. “The challenge became to make it frightening,” Black told Empire. “’Cause upon that hinged everything — whether you bought our heroes going up against him and felt a real threat for them. We had to invent a scenario in which the Predators were mysterious and scary again.” This looks pretty cool, although the mask looks a bit weird to me for some reason. Perhaps it’s the snout. The second image shows a Predator hurling some unlucky fool across a room. R.I.P, that guy. The Predator underwent some reshoots recently to add even more references to past Predator films. Whether or not that’s a good thing is up to you to decide. I’m happy for some franchise call-backs, but I wouldn’t exactly be bent out of shape if The Predator decided to not mention the Alien vs. Predator films. The Predator opens on September 14, 2018.

Ethan Anderton,"A new TV spot for The Predator has surfaced, and the marketing campaign is starting to show off the comedy that will be showcased alongside the bloody sci-fi action, courtesy of director Shane Black. Check it out below. While most of this The Predator TV spot is full of quick cuts to action and characters, it also gives us a better vibe of how the movie will blend some laughs with gory action. For example, Olivia Munn calls out Boyd Holbrook as an ex-sniper with PTSD, and she calls out the rest of the soldiers in the movie (played by Trevante Rhodes, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, Alfie Allen, Thomas Jane, and Augusto Aguilera ) as a team that has a few screws loose, to put it mildly. But the real gag is that the entire TV spot itself touts these guys as the only thing standing between us and the Predators who have come to our planet. That shot of all the aforementioned soldiers in a hotel room is straight from one of the sequence shown to us at San Diego Comic-Con last month, and that’s the scene that was chock full of both a surprising amount of witty banter and exposition. It’s a bonafide Shane Black scene through and through. Even though the TV spot touts a war between “us” and “them,” as we saw in the footage at Comic-Con, one of these Predators won’t be a threat for long. There’s a shot in this trailer featuring the signature heat vision perspective of the Predator, but that point-of-view shot just so happens to be looking at another masked Predator. That’s because it’s the Mega Predator looking at a smaller, weaker Predator who is about to get his ass kicked. You can read more about that in our coverage from Comic-Con.

Rick Lash,"CIA assassin forced to use his skills for revenge, again Denzel Washington has basically always been better than everyone else in his movies. He’s smarter ( Crimson Tide ), faster ( The Book of Eli ), deadlier ( Man on Fire ), handsomer (all of them), and wittier ( Training Day ). Even when he’s not getting the best of someone ( Inside Man ) he’s still getting the better of someone else. It’s therefore no surprise that Denzel has a franchise like The Equalizer to his name. If you’re not familiar, you should be. The original was a real treat—think of it as Taken with Denzel. Or better yet, think of it as The Book of Eli, but he’s not blind. The original takes a good man with a checkered past (and of course, the obligatory certain set of skills Taken trope, and forces him to use those skills for good. Judging by the sequel, they’ve opted to give Denzel’s character a bit more of a backstory and are forcing him to seek revenge rather than justice. It’s not quite the same motivating circumstances, but apparently he was just too mysterious in the first to not give him a backstory. Or the backstory was necessary to provide enough reasons for him to want revenge (his character leads a highly simple, uncomplicated life). Denzel’s pure cockiness makes him the perfect fit for these roles and I can’t wait to see what creative ways he can find to kill criminals while timing himself on a stopwatch.

DeAngelo was charged on Wednesday with eight counts of murder for killings in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. He is suspected of killing 12 people and raping about 50 and could face more charges. Authorities say DeAngelo is the man once dubbed the East Area Rapist for some four dozen sexual assaults in the suburbs east of Sacramento. After losing his job on the police force, the suspect committed fewer crimes, but 10 were slayings and all were in Southern California.

Ben Pearson,"Shane Black ‘s The Predator is using the titular alien’s triangular laser targeting system to zero in on a $25-$30 million opening weekend for the upcoming sci-fi sequel. That’s a far cry from Iron Man 3 ‘s gigantic opening, but a significant improvement over Black’s previous film, The Nice Guys. Read more about The Predator box office tracking below, and see how the sequel stacks up against the other movies in the franchise. According to Variety, early tracking numbers suggest that The Predator could open to between $25 and $30 million dollars. (That’s 25 million, not $25 dollars. This isn’t Billionaire Boys Club.) If that estimate proves accurate, it would top the opening weekends of Predator ($12 million in 1987, which would be $28 million in 2018 dollars adjusting for inflation), Predator 2 ($8.7 million in 1990, which would be $16 million in 2018 dollars), and Predators ($24 million in 2010, which converts to $27 million in 2018 cash). All numbers are borrowed from Box Office Mojo. How would a $25 to $30 million opening would compare to other movies that Black has directed so far? It would be a solid number for him. 2005’s excellent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang opened to just $180,660, and The Nice Guys opened to just over $11 million. Iron Man 3 opened to $174 million, but coming off the success of The Avengers and with the weight of MCU fandom behind it, it seems almost unfair to even include that movie in this conversation. This will be the first solo Predator movie since Predators, but from what we can gather, this one basically ignores that film’s existence. Instead, it picks up after the events of the first two movies, upping the stakes with a story that features the aliens coming to Earth after discovering how to genetically upgrade themselves with the DNA of animals to make them better killers. The cast includes Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown, Alfie Allen, Thomas Jane, Augusto Aguilera, Jake Busey, and Yvonne Strahovski.

Zeon Santos,"Kids playing with guns was seen as no big deal back in the day, and whether they were playing Cowboys and Indians, War or Astronauts versus Aliens guns factored into playtime in a big way. But we live in a different world these days, one which is far deadlier and full of gun-related controversy as killing sprees reach an all-time high with seemingly no end in sight. And as the gun-related violence rises the idea of kids playing with guns becomes more taboo, especially when you consider how many kids have been killed by cops or otherwise for waving around a plastic gun. This Circa Now collection of toy gun commercials from the 50s and 60s seems odd by today's standards, and yet it's important to remember there was a time when kids playing with toy guns didn't lead to tragedy.

Ethan Anderton,"The NBA Finals came to a close last night, but not before a brand new TV spot for this fall’s release of The Predator debuted. The first trailer for The Predator was a little underwhelming, especially without a big moment to entice even the biggest fans of the franchise. But thankfully this latest TV spot is a much tighter and more exciting tease of the movie, especially because it teases the genetically modified hybrid mega-Predator, and this thing looks like a beast. While the TV spot still doesn’t give much away in the vein of the story, it would appear that this towering mega-Predator might be on the side of humans. But much like the genetically enhanced hybrid Indominus Rex of Jurassic World ended up being a bad idea, we’re betting on this mega-Predator turning against its creators and causing even more of a problem before all is said and done. There are plenty of new shots of cast members Boyd Holbrook ( Logan ), Sterling K. Brown ( Hotel Artemis ), Keegan-Michael Key ( Keanu ), and Trevante Rhodes ( Moonlight ) trying their best to survive attacks by the Predator in question. The rest of the cast includes Thomas Jane, Edward James Olmos, Augusto Aguilera, Alfie Allen, Olivia Munn, Yvonne Strahovski, Jacob Tremblay and Jake Busey, playing the son of his father Gary Busey’s character from Predator 2. Shane Black ( The Nice Guys, Iron Man 3 ) is directing The Predator, and he also co-wrote the script with Fred Dekker. If you’d like to find out more about Black’s approach to reviving the sci-fi action franchise, check out our set visit interview with the man himself over here. We’ve also got interviews with Boyd Holbrook, Olivia Munn and Keegan-Michael Key, so make sure to give those a read as well.

Alessandro Fillari,"The original Attack on Titan game was a bit of a departure for developer Omega Force, the same team behind the Dynasty Warriors series. Forgoing the slaying of countless mobs of infantrymen for the larger and far deadlier Titans, the gameplay focused more on verticality and speed, pushing players to take out as many of the grotesque giants as possible. Continuing on in Attack on Titan 2 --releasing March 20 on PS4, Xbox One, PC and for the first time Nintendo Switch --you'll play as a number of the series' central characters as they embark on missions inspired by the anime, while also forging your own path with an original character. During a recent event held by Koei Tecmo, we got to go hands-on with the PS4 and Nintendo Switch versions of the game, and spent some time discussing the many changes with the president of Koei Tecmo, Hisashi Koinuma. With the sequel, Koinuma stated the developers focused on one particular piece of feedback they received from the first game's combat. This convinced Koei Tecmo to rethink certain aspects of AoT's action gameplay to offer more of a challenge for returning fans. ""We received a lot of feedback from the first game, and we found that many players who played the game got good at it very quickly,"" said Koinuma. ""This ultimately wasn't really adequate for a game that was supposed to be challenging. In creating the second version, we focused on the action, and wanted to make sure that we're giving that to players. Particularly the attack techniques, we enhanced that and made them more intricate, while also making the Titans more powerful and robust in their own strategies. While we made the game more challenging, there is still an easy mode for newcomers to try out. So please be assured that anyone can enjoy the game."" In addition to the return of the story campaign, covering the early narrative of the series from different perspectives--along with online co-op modes tackling key missions--AoT2 now features a new competitive multiplayer mode known as Annihilation. Pitting two teams against one another to score the highest number of Titan kills, you and your partner will grapple and hook-shot your way across the map to take out as many enemies as possible. The original AoT game did a good job faithfully translating the anime and manga series' fast-paced and gory thrills to a videogame, and AoT2 looks to keep that going with a more unique story of its own. The new multiplayer mode is a nice touch as well. While the Nintendo release does suffer from a noticeable visual and performance downgrade from the other releases, it still manages to offer the same satisfying thrills and action from its counterparts. Plus, the portability of the Switch makes a bit more of an interesting dive into the game, especially for first timers. While it is a sequel, Attack on Titan 2 covers much of the same story from the original, with new perspectives and stories added on--making this the preferred game to jump into.

Quick Edit,"The government must respond with great caution to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s written letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking resumption of comprehensive bilateral dialogue. On the one hand, Khan, who was the Pakistan army’s candidate in the recently held general elections, wants to resume the December 2015 bilateral talks which were suspended in the wake of the terror attack on Pathankot airbase. But on the other hand, Pakistan has not shown any change in its approach and policy vis-à-vis cross-border terrorism. There has been no action against the mastermind and executors of the Pathankot, Uri and the subsequent terror attacks. The Trump administration suspended massive aid to Pakistan, which is in the dire need of an IMF bailout due to a balance of payment crisis because the quasi-military state has not adequately addressed America’s concerns on terrorism. On Wednesday, the US specifically said that Pakistan based terror groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which operate in Kashmir, continue to pose a serious threat to the region.

Dominic Tarason,"It should be pretty clear by now that I am an enormous fan of Doom 1 &amp; 2, and 90s FPS design in general. While I greatly enjoyed Id Software’s 2016 reboot of the series, I didn’t love it. After watching three good chunks of footage live from QuakeCon, I’m feeling a lot more positive about its sequel, Doom Eternal. Green-haired zombies, spiky imps, semi-abstract urban/demonic hybrid environments and a bunch of new ideas were on display. Check out the gore-drenched action below, along with the extended and wooly thoughts from a certified Doomhead. While I’m glad they didn’t name this one Doom 2: Hell On Earth (for the sake of keeping retro mods separate), that’s exactly what Doom Eternal looks like. Doom 2’s monsters are all represented, including Pain Elementals, Arachnotrons and (being introduced as a possible boss), the Archvile. Existing enemies have regressed to something a bit closer to the originals, too. Mancubi look less high-tech, Former Human soldiers have goofy green haircuts, and Imps are covered in spikes. There’s also some new critters, like a poison-spitting winged Imp-like thing. We’ve time-stamped to the start of the Doom presentation, but if that fails, skip to 1:09:10. First new gameplay is at 1:16:22, second is at 1:24:12, and third is 1:29:50. While it’s hard to judge from the footage, level structure feels a little more old-school as well. There felt like a lot less ‘player walks into arena, doors lock, kill demons and continue’ scenarios. Instead, levels look larger and more open, with interconnected secrets. Vertical mobility is even greater than in the previous game, thanks to a powerful grappling hook that lets you use any demon’s body as a hook-point to pull yourself to – even flying enemies, letting the Doom Slayer launch himself skyward to new areas and hard-to-reach ledges. There’s even fast ground/air-dashes. Level design feels more playful and willing to be abstract, too. Great thing about hell itself melding with earth is that it doesn’t have to make sense. You can have a shopping centre full of sci-fi advertisements, that you swing off a pole out of (another new mobility tool) and into wall-to-wall demon meat-tunnels. I even spotted a very obvious crusher trap, smashing down on top of a bundle of powerups, tempting the player to take stupid risks that of course you will. There’s a few new weapon options on display, too. There’s a Painkiller-esque stake gun, its bolts detonating after time. Also, the Doom Slayer’s armor seems to have picked up a Revenant’s shoulder-mounted weapon arm, as you can now cycle through a variety of grenades to load into it or switch to a flamethrower mode for additional close-up firepower. Yes, you can dual-wield a super-shotgun/grappling hook and flamethrower here. Oh, and the classic Doom 2 plasma gun makes a return, familiar beige barrel casing and all. There’s even a Dark Souls or Resident Evil 6-styled invasion mode. Players can choose to raid someone else’s single-player session – fortunately not deathmatch-style, but rather to possess a demon. While I’m sure the player-controlled demons will be a cut above the usual NPC fodder, I’d not expect them to be too much deadlier in the name of balance. It’s an exciting feature though, and gives the game a bit of an (optional) multiplayer spin, even if you’d rather just stick to the story mode. There’s even more that I’d love to dig deeper into. The fiery Baron Of Hell variant with flaming blades and an internal structure made up of lava and bone that becomes more visible as you damage it looks cool. The Archvile reveal ( here comes flame boi ) was all well and good, but the revelation that the player gets to use the demonic key-sword that was teased so much in the first game? That’s interesting. I also want to know what’s up with that “Demonic Corruption” gauge on the map screen. I was a bit sceptical about Doom Eternal, but well done, Id, you’ve got me excited again.","It should be pretty clear by now that I am an enormous fan of Doom 1 & 2, and 90s FPS design in general.

Denise Petski,"Australian actor Xavier Samuel has been cast in a key series regular role opposite Lily Rabe, Amy Brenneman and Hamish Linklater in TNT ’s thriller drama series Tell Me Your Secrets (fka Deadlier Than The Male ). Created and written by Harriet Warner ( Call the Midwife), Tell Me Your Secrets, produced by Bruna Papandrea’s Made Up Stories and Turner’s Studio T, is described as an intense, morally complex thriller. It revolves around a trio of characters, each with a mysterious and troubling past: Emma (Rabe) is a young woman who once looked into the eyes of a dangerous killer, John (Linklater) is a former serial predator desperate to find redemption, and Mary (Brenneman) is a grieving mother obsessed with finding her missing daughter. As each of them is pushed to the edge, the truth about their pasts and motives grows ever murkier, blurring the lines between victim and perpetrator. Enrique Murciano, Chiara Aurelia, Ashley Madekwe and Bryant Tardy co-star in the series. Samuel will play Kit Parker, a convicted serial killer who has admitted to multiple accounts of murder. There is an undeniable irresistible quality about him that helps him lure in his victims. Samuel became known for his breakout role as villainous vampire Riley Biers in Twilight: Eclipse. He later starred opposite Kate Beckinsale in Whit Stillman’s indie Love and Friendship, and opposite Robin Wright and Naomi Watts in Adore. On the TV side he was recently seen in a starring role opposite Hugo Weaving in the critically praised Australian limited series Seven Types of Ambiguity. Samuel is repped by Management 360, UTA, Ziffren Brittenham, and Shanahan Management in Australia.","Australian actor Xavier Samuel has been cast in a key series regular role opposite Lily Rabe, Amy Brenneman and Hamish Linklater in TNT ’s thriller drama series Tell Me Your Secrets (fka Deadlier Than The Male ).

Quick Edit,"The suicide bombing in Pulwama, that left around 40 CRPF soldiers dead, has been claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed which in turn has been provided safe haven by Pakistan and consists of many Pakistanis. In other words the Pakistani state, which is essentially controlled by the army and ISI, will remain defiant against all international pressure applied since September 11.
In the last five years, Pakistan supported terror groups have not only taken heavy toll of human lives through mob violence, rioting and stone pelting in Kashmir, but also upped the ante by orchestrating deadlier suicide attacks, the worst of which has been the Pulwama attack carried out in Islamic State/ al Qaeda style. The NDA government at the Centre must now consider all the options on the table, to deter Pakistans asymmetric and unconventional warfare. The cost of cross-border terrorism needs to be raised so that Pakistan finds it harder to use it as a foreign policy tool.
It is apparent from news reports that Pakistans mosque-mujahideen-military complex has been emboldened by two geo-political reasons. First, Chinas repeated and successful blocking of Indias bid to get chief of Jaish-e-Mohammad Masood Azhar designated as a terrorist, at the United Nations. Second, the Donald Trump administrations announcement of withdrawal of the US forces from Afghanistan after a protracted military engagement.
Thus, it is time as well to recognise the elephant in the room: China.  While India mulls its options, it must also find means to pressurize China to review its stand on terrorism as well as unstinting support for Pakistan in its asymmetric warfare against India. This must be pursued with the same determination as the one on display when India pushed back against Chinese encroachments in Doklam.

Egyptian security officials say a roadside bomb has targeted a pickup truck carrying members of the security forces in the turbulent north of the Sinai Peninsula, killing two. The officials say the Sunday blast took place on a road just south of the coastal city of el-Arish. Five other members of the security forces and a civilian were wounded in the attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of the extremist Islamic State group, now leading a long-running insurgency in Sinai.

Anna Terekhova,"The Forest isnt like other games. You wont be given tutorials or guidance, there are no NPCs or missions. Youre dropped into a world and its up to your creativity and abilities to survive. Youll probably die a lot, especially at first. Survive in this new type of game unlike anything else with these hints and tips: CRAFT One of the simplest weapons you can make is a CLUB. This weapon is effective in combat but wont chop trees. To make a club, simply find an enemy cannibal and kill him. Once hes dead, chop his head off and then build a fire. Place the head on the fire and wait for it to burn away the skin and flesh. Now, take your freshly cooked skull, find a stick and shove the skull onto the stick. You now have an effective weapon against the bad guys. BUILD AN EFFIGY Another effective survival tactic is to fully dismember all of the enemies you kill. With your new club this should be much easier. Take as many body parts as you can carry and decorate stick effigies with them. You can then light these all on fire as a warning to others not to mess with you. Extra hint: Build a log sled to transport lots of bodies at once to make harvesting them easier. FOOD Its important to keep your energy up, and that means eating. You can hunt deer and rabbits, or maybe find a boar or racoon. Berries are available but some might be poisonous. Another option is to cook and eat the body parts of the enemies youve killed. Body parts can be cooked by drying on a drying rack, placed directly on a fire, or for an energy-boosting stew add a leg to a pot of boiling water with some mushrooms and berries. BUILDINGS A good base needs a good fence. You have a few options here, you can make a weak fence out of sticks, a strong wall out of stones, or take a dead enemy, drop him on a fire, wait for the body to burn away, and then collect his or her bones. These bones can make a great decorative fence thats a lot stronger than regular wood. UPGRADES Finding your weapons too weak against the ever encroaching enemy threat that cannot be reasoned with? Weapons can all be upgraded. First, chop at a tree to receive some TREE SAP. Now, bash away at some enemies — TEETH should fly out. You can now use the tree sap with the teeth to make your weapons even deadlier. ARMOR Smash open the skull of a lizard and then cut off its skin to wrap around your body for an effective light armor. Combine skin with leaves for a stealth armor. Want even more powerful armor? Slice away at the corpses of some of the games bigger monsters and wear their skin as protection. STAY CLEAN Covered in blood from fighting and chopping enemies? Make sure to find a clear water source to wash off. Getting blood inside your cuts won’t be good for you. STILL FINDING THE GAME TOO HARD? Invite a friend to play with you. Sure, the enemies will scale up in difficulty as a result, but going online is a great way to learn the ins and outs of survival as well as making new friends.

THE EDITORS,"Annual opioid fatalities have now surpassed the yearly number of deaths from AIDS at the height of that epidemic in the mid-1990s. In 2016 drug overdose deaths numbered 63,000, more than the U.S. death toll from the entire Vietnam War. The trend is terrifying: the problem is getting worse each year. Cities and states reeling from opioid deaths need to give serious consideration to setting up safe injection rooms, which could significantly reduce fatalities. These are places where a drug user can go to consume illegal drugs under the supervision of health workers. They have been used in Europe, Canada and Australia for decades, and evidence and experience have shown that they are very effective. This may not seem like an obvious way to fight an abuse epidemic, but few other options exist. In the U.S., many cities' efforts to establish such sites have stalled, but now multiple cities have plans to open the country's first officially sanctioned injection sites. Philadelphia expects to do so in 2019. San Francisco, too, hopes to overcome legal and siting obstacles and open its first facilities this year. New York City's mayor has also endorsed setting up multiple sites at current needle-exchange programs. Misuse of prescription opioids such as OxyContin is inextricably linked with that of street drugs such as heroin. Nearly half of young people who inject heroin started by abusing prescription drugs. Then they turned to the cheaper, more readily available alternative. The path from pills to needles has meant that U.S. deaths from heroin have increased by a factor of five since 2010, topping 15,000 people in 2016. And the toll is continuing to climb as people overdose on heroin laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that makes heroin much more potent—and much deadlier. That is where safe injection sites come in. If someone overdoses at one of more than 90 such locations in Europe and elsewhere, a health worker or other first responder quickly administers an antidote. The facilities have also proved they can reduce the transmission of blood-borne infections, partly through needle exchanges. Moreover, they can save money: in San Francisco, for example, one analysis concluded that for every dollar spent on supervised sites, $2.33 in emergency medical, law enforcement and other costs would be reduced, producing a yearly net savings of $3.5 million. The evidence for increased safety is compelling. At Insite in Vancouver, B.C., there was a 35 percent reduction in fatal overdoses in the area around the facility, compared with a 9.3 percent reduction in other parts of the city that may have had other interventions. People who used Insite were also much less likely to share needles than those who shot up in unsupervised places. And of the 8,040 people who visited the facility in 2016, 517 were referred to addiction treatment, and more than a third of them completed it. Critics argue, correctly, that injection sites are not a perfect solution. Our country also needs more drug-treatment beds and counseling options; medication assistance to help with drug withdrawal; and other evidence-based care to alleviate the crisis. Safe sites also work best in places where drug use is centralized, such as in specific urban neighborhoods rather than rural areas. And of course, they are controversial because they require officials to tacitly accept illegal drug use. That is why no American city has yet cleared the necessary hurdles to proceed with establishing an injection site. In addition to San Francisco and Philadelphia, Denver has considered this option. Seattle, too, has called for two safe consumption rooms and has even set aside funds to support them, but its effort has been mired in legal battles. Federal law currently makes it illegal to use nonprescribed opiates and opioids, so Philadelphia officials have said they would not fund or operate such a facility. They would instead encourage private efforts to open one—which would perhaps provide slightly more legal distance than if they were to finance and manage it themselves. Still, the U.S. Department of Justice could choose to prosecute the city for endorsing the move.

Martin ‘s 1980 novella of the same name—is a story the author describes as “a haunted house story on a starship,” or, if you prefer your horror more gory, as a sort of “ Psycho in space.” And based on the first look at the show, things out in the cosmos will be even bloodier than they are in Westeros. Only in space you can’t flee across the Narrow Sea to safety. In the first teaser for the show, which also includes some behind-the-scenes looks, we get a glimpse of just how gruesome things will get for the deep-space travelers of the Nightflyer. Because while normally the worst thing that can happen on spaceship is something catching on fire, that usually doesn’t result in so much blood splatter on the walls and floors. Although catching on fire still looks pretty horrible. We know the people involved with any new show will give their series a hard sell, but we’d be lying if we denied we’re pretty excited after hearing supervising producer Sean Ryerson describe it as “just f***ing awesome.” That’s really all we want from a George R.R. Martin sci-fi horror story. And even though filming required them to build “acres of spaceship,” one of the most haunting aspects of Martin’s story is the claustrophobia felt by its passengers. This teaser certainly seems to capture that feeling of being trapped while the walls–and far worse–close in on them. Because as awful as the White Walkers are, at least you can still see them coming.

"Morten Wendelbo/The Conversation, Morten Wendelbo/The Conversation","Leer en español. Last September, President Donald Trump told Puerto Ricans they should be grateful Hurricane Maria had not caused a “real catastrophe like Katrina.” However, mounting evidence now reveals the death toll for Maria far surpasses initial estimates. New research puts the number close to 3,000, adjusted up from just a few dozen when the president made his now infamous remark. This is an estimate, but it is virtually certain that the number is in the thousands. The president has denied these numbers, but without offering any evidence to support his claims. The devastating truth is that most of the deaths in Puerto Rico were avoidable. The majority of fatalities were not caused by the hurricane’s force, but by the failure of the U.S. disaster response system. Many people died in the days and months after Maria because they lacked access to basic lifesaving goods and services. The president’s comparison between the Katrina disaster and Puerto Rico’s plight after Maria highlights a major underlying problem. Using fatalities to gauge the magnitude of disaster assumes that all disasters are made the same. The disaster following Hurricane Maria shows us that this is fundamentally untrue. Understanding this fact is necessary to grapple with how such a disaster was allowed to unfold on U.S. soil, despite one of the biggest and most well-prepared disaster response forces in the world. Fatality counts are virtually useless More than 3.3 million Americans were caught in Hurricane Maria’s path. Almost all of the deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. Compare that to Katrina, when a large proportion of the fatalities occurred immediately during the hurricane. Failing levies caused many to drown as their homes were engulfed in water. If judged only by the official and known death toll during the first few days or weeks, Puerto Rico appeared to have escaped a catastrophe. In reality, the early declaration that Puerto Rico had escaped catastrophe and that the federal government had already done its job may have been deadlier than the hurricane itself. While the initial death toll was low, virtually every other indicator suggested Puerto Rico would be reeling from the disaster for years and that lives were still in danger. Basic lifesaving services were inoperational, power was down on the whole island, and people were stranded around the island with no access to clean water or any kind of help. Disasters can be particularly devastating for those with poor access to government services, lower incomes, or living further from population centers. Many Puerto Ricans fit all three conditions, and most fit at least one or two. Even if the death toll had not yet grown by the time the president made his remarks, it was already clear in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane that the death toll would grow immensely in the days and weeks to follow. Maria’s long-term consequences Even then, the fatality count alone is woefully inadequate for understanding the depth of the disaster still unfolding in Puerto Rico. Considering disaster in terms of fatalities does not capture the hardship experienced by survivors. Although survivors did not pay with their lives, many lives were still changed in devastating and often permanent ways. Some of these ways are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Increased levels of disability, either directly because of a storm injury or because other conditions were not cared for properly while hospitals were shut, higher incidence of malnutrition, homelessness and lower school participation are good examples. Others are much less tangible. For example, the mental health consequences of disaster can stay with survivors for a lifetime. But all of these consequences leave both the individuals and their communities worse off, slowing recovery. Disaster responders know that these damages occur in virtually every disaster, and they are consequences not captured or foreshadowed by the fatality count. Even if the true fatality count had been a mere 64, as the original death count indicated, a strong response would have been necessary nonetheless to prevent people’s lives from being irreparably upended. The inadequate response not only caused more fatalities – it also made virtually every surviving Puerto Rican worse off. Puerto Rico may not have appeared to be a catastrophe at the time, looking only at the death toll, but the slow and inadequate response all but ensured that it would be.

"JOHN LEICESTER, RAF CASERT and LORI HINNANT / AP","(PARIS) — World leaders with the power to make war but a duty to preserve peace solemnly marked the end of World War I’s slaughter 100 years ago at commemorations Sunday that drove home the message “never again” but also exposed the globe’s new political fault lines. As Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and dozens of other heads of state and government listened in silence, French President Emmanuel Macron used the occasion, as its host, to sound a powerful and sobering warning about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nationalism and of nations that put themselves first, above the collective good. “The old demons are rising again, ready to complete their task of chaos and of death,” Macron said. “Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,” he said. “In saying ‘Our interests first, whatever happens to the others,’ you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: Its moral values.” Trump, ostensibly the main target of Macron’s message, sat stony-faced. The American president has proudly declared himself a nationalist. But if Trump felt singled out by Macron’s remarks, he didn’t show it. He later described the commemoration as “very beautiful.” As well as spelling out the horrific costs of conflict to those with arsenals capable of waging a World War III, the ceremony also served up a joyful reminder of the intense sweetness of peace, when high school students read from letters that soldiers and civilians wrote 100 years ago when guns finally fell silent on the Western Front. Brought alive again by people too young to have known global war themselves, the ghostly voices seemed collectively to say: Please, do not make our mistakes. “I only hope the soldiers who died for this cause are looking down upon the world today,” American soldier Capt. Charles S. Normington wrote on Nov. 11, 1918, in one of the letters. “The whole world owes this moment of real joy to the heroes who are not here to help enjoy it.” The Paris weather — gray and damp — seemed aptly fitting when remembering a war fought in mud and relentless horror. The commemorations started late, overshooting the centenary of the exact moment when, 100 years earlier at 11 a.m., an eerie silence replaced the thunder of war on the front lines. Macron recalled that 1 billion shells fell on France alone from 1914-1918. As bells marking the armistice hour rang across Paris and in many nations ravaged by the four years of carnage, Macron and other leaders were still on their way to the centennial site at the Arc de Triomphe. Under a sea of black umbrellas, a line of leaders led by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, marched in silence on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees, after dismounting from their buses. Trump arrived separately, in a motorcade that drove past three topless protesters with anti-war slogans on their chests who somehow got through the rows of security and were quickly bundled away by police. The Femen group claimed responsibility. French authorities said the three women faced charges of sexual exhibitionism. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited security protocols for the presidential motorcade’s solo trip down the grand flag-lined avenue, which was closed to traffic. Last to arrive was the Russian president, Putin, who shook Trump’s hand and flashed him a thumbs-up. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was positioned in pride of place between Trump and Macron, an eloquent symbol of victors and vanquished now standing together, shoulder to shoulder. Overhead, fighter jets ripped through the sky, trailing red, white and blue smoke in homage to the French flag. The geographical spread of the more than 60 heads of state and government who attended, silent and reflective, showed how the “war to end all wars” left few corners of the earth untouched but which, little more than two decades later, was followed so quickly and catastrophically by the even deadlier World War II. On the other side of the globe, Australia and New Zealand held ceremonies to recall how the war killed and wounded soldiers and civilians in unprecedented numbers and in gruesome new, mechanized ways. Those countries lost tens of thousands of soldiers far away in Europe and, most memorably in the 1915 battle of Gallipoli, in Turkey. In central London, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, clad in black, watched from a balcony as her son Prince Charles laid a wreath on her behalf at the foot of the Cenotaph memorial that honors the fallen. Britain had 880,000 military dead in the war. The gulf between Trump’s “America First” credo and European leaders was starkly underscored again later Sunday, when Trump went his own way. He visited an American cemetery outside Paris at precisely the moment that Macron, Merkel and other dignitaries were opening a peace forum where the French leader again sounded the alarm about crumbling international harmony as he ruminated about the legacy of the morning’s commemorations. “Will it be the shining symbol of durable peace between nations or will it be a picture of a last moment of unity before the world goes down in new disorder?” Macron asked. “It depends only on us.” While praising France for “a wonderful two days,” Trump described his rainy stop at the American cemetery at Suresnes as “the highlight of the trip.” On Saturday, Trump drew criticism for canceling a separate commemorative visit to the Belleau Wood battleground northeast of Paris because of rain. Remembered for brutal trench warfare and the first use of chemical weapons, WWI pitted the armies of France, the British empire, Russia and the U.S. against a German-led coalition that included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Almost 10 million soldiers died, sometimes tens of thousands on a single day. The U.S. came late to the war, in April 1917, but over 1½ years it became a key player and tipped the scales for the allies. At the war’s end, the U.S. had 2 million troops in Europe and another 2 million ready to cross the Atlantic if needed, a force that turned the United States into a major military power whose soldiers then fought and died again for Europe in World War II. Even though Germany was at the heart of provoking two world wars over the past century, the nation has become a beacon of European and international cooperation since. With so many leaders in Paris, the commemoration also provoked a flurry of diplomacy on the sidelines, with conflict in Yemen and Syria among the hot-button issues. On Sunday, Merkel met with the head of the United Nations, an organization born from the ashes of World War II, and the president of Serbia. It was a Serb teenager, Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated the Austro-Hungarian crown prince in Sarajevo in 1914 to set off events which led to the outbreak of war.

"Sofie Werthan, Sofie Werthan","Raiders fans wear respirator masks during an NFL game in Oakland, California, on Nov. 11, 2018. An Air Quality Advisory was issued due to heavy wildfire smoke in parts of the Bay Area from the Camp Fire in Butte County. Trump Is Wrong About What Is Causing the Devastating Fires in California Should Pregnant Women Take Anti-Anxiety Medication? Some Have No Choice. Trump Called Barbed Wire at the Border a Beautiful Sight. But It Has a Long, Troubling Legacy. World War Is Advanced Military Technology Didnt Shatter the British Belief in Progress The now-infamous Camp Fire ignited near the small town of Paradise in Butte County, California early Thursday morning. In the few days since, it has grown into what is now the states most destructive fire in history. Within hours, strong winds pushed plumes of thick smoke around the region, stretching hundreds of miles along the coast and inland. Since Thursday, a large swath of northern California, including Sacramento and the Bay Area, has been blanketed in a yellowish haze that has blocked out the blue sky. The sun is an eerie red, and the air smells like a perpetual bonfire. The current air quality map of California is alarming. On Monday, in significant portions of northern California, the air was rated unhealthy for anyone outdoors. An even larger area was rated as unhealthy for sensitive groupsthat is, people with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, young children, and the elderly. (The Environmental Protection Agency considers Air Quality Index (AQI) values over 100 to be unhealthy for sensitive groups, and over 150 is considered unhealthy for everyone.) Californians outside the Camp Fires path of destruction may be safe from immediate harm, but they are not immune from negative health effects caused by the blaze. Notably, the recorded air quality in areas far away from the Camp Fire is in some cases even worse than in areas directly adjacent to the fire. In Chico, about 10 miles from Paradise, the AQI score was 158 on Monday. In Sacramento, about 80 miles south of the fire, the AQI score was 177. Even further away, San Francisco was 164, and Oakland was 169. (You can check out the air quality for anywhere in the U.S. here.) During wildfires, it is important for people experiencing bad air quality to take precautions against the smokes insidious impact. Smoke from wildfires is filled with gases and particles that can cause a wide range of short-term health problems, including coughing, wheezing, phlegm, runny nose, burning or stinging eyes, and shortness of breath. Large particulate matter, called PM 10, can cause physical discomfort, but it is the fine particulate matter, called PM 2.5, that is far more dangerous to your health. As Megan Molteni wrote in Slate during last years wildfires in Napa and Sonoma counties, Particles this small can be inhaled into the deepest recesses of the lungs, into the broccoli-shaped alveolar sacs, where they bypass the bodys filtration systems and slip directly into the bloodstream. The New York Department of Health warns that long-term exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 may be associated with increased rates of chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease. A few days of smoke exposure may not amount to long-term exposure, but its still worthwhile to take as many steps as you can protect yourself against wildfire smoke, and there are many steps you can take. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people stay indoors if possible, keeping the windows and doors closed. (For homeless people in California, the situation is more dire, although some institutions, like the San Francisco Public Library, have announced they will stay open later to provide respite from the unhealthy air, and a group of volunteers in Oakland is working to distribute face masks to local homeless people.) If you have an air conditioner, make sure the fresh-air intake is closed to prevent it from bringing in smoke from outside. You can also purchase an air cleaner with a HEPA filter to help remove particles from the air. To cut down on creating more pollution, refrain from smoking, burning candles, lighting a fire in the fireplace, or using a gas stove inside. If you do go outside for an extended period of time, keep in mind that scarves, bandanas, and normal surgical masks dont prevent the inhalation of harmful PM 2.5 particles. Instead, you should use a respirator mask. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends using a particulate respirator that has been tested and approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. These masks will be labeled with the words NIOSH, N95, or P100. For proper use, the respirator mask must be worn with two straps around your head, and it must fit snugly over your nose and under your chin. Unfortunately, these masks have some constraints that make it impossible for everyone to use them. Respirator masks do not come in sizes suitable for childrens small faces, and people with beards cant wear them (facial hair makes it difficult for the masks to seal). Additionally, since the masks are thick and tight-fitting, they can make breathing more difficult or lead to heat-related illness if its hot outside. There are also reports of respirator mask shortages at local stores as residents rush to stock up on them, and at least one hardware store in Berkeley imposed a limit of three masks per customer. The recommended solution, for people who cant access masks, use masks properly, and frankly everyone else, is to leave the area until the smoke dissipates (or stay indoors as much as possible). This, of course, is far from ideal, or even realistic for many people who dont have the ability to relocate temporarily. As Californias wildfires have gotten bigger and deadlier, fires and smoke are becoming regular features of life in the Golden State. Harm to peoples lungs is yet another external cost of what is already shaping up to be a devastating and ongoing disaster. Support our work: become a Slate Plus member.

https://www.facebook.com/philip.bump,"This article has been updated. The school shooting near Houston on Friday bolstered a stunning statistic: More people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while serving in the military. Initial estimates put the number killed at Santa Fe High School at eight. We can compare that to figures for the military compiled from Defense Department news releases, including both combat and noncombat deaths. Even excluding non-students who died in school shootings (for example, teachers) the total still exceeds military casualties. A large part of that is the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14. This is not usually the case. In 2017, the number of fatalities among service members was far higher than the number of people killed in school shootings, according to The Washington Post data. After this story was originally published, Jared Keller, a senior editor at the site Task &amp; Purpose, noted that the Department of Defense releases offered an incomplete picture of service member fatalities. Separate data compiled by the Navy, including the Marines, adds another seven casualties to the total, excluding motor vehicle accidents. In March, an Air National Guard plane crashed in Puerto Rico killing another nine — an incident not included in the Department of Defense’s reports. Including those figures (and adjusting the revised figure in Texas), the comparison graph looks like this. “The DoD doesn’t always present a clear picture of accidental mishap-related deaths due to worries about operational security, hence the trouble with [Public Affairs Office] releases,” Keller wrote in an email. “Back in March 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis even cautioned public affairs officials across the military to ‘be cautious about publicly telegraphing readiness shortfalls’ because ‘communicating that we are broken or not ready to fight invites miscalculation,’ as his spokesman put it at the time.” The figures for 2018 do not suggest schools are more dangerous than combat zones. After all, there are more than 50 million students in public elementary and high schools and only about 1.3 million members of the armed forces. So far in 2018, a member of the military has been about 40 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting, including Keller’s revised figures. That said, it is still the case that 2018 is shaping up to be unusually deadly at schools. Comparing the number of deaths and the number of shooting incidents this year directly with those through May 18 of 2017, that difference is stark. The number of deaths and school shooting incidents through May 18 are each higher this year than at any point since 2000. There have been three times as many deaths in school shootings so far this year than in the second-most deadly year through May 18, 2005. In fact, there were 36 fatalities in school shootings in total through May 18 of each year from 2000 to 2017 — seven fewer than there have been in 2018 alone. Without the shootings in Florida and Texas, the figure is substantially lower. In 2000 through 2017, there were an average of two deaths in five or six school shootings through this point in each year. Without Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Santa Fe, the totals in 2018 would be four deaths in 14 incidents. With them, it is 29 deaths in 16 incidents. So far in 2018, there have been 13 service member fatalities in seven incidents. Seven of those casualties occurred in a helicopter crash in Iraq in March. Three of the total number of military casualties were not related to combat.",Washington Post 2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than service members Washington Post This article has been updated.

Ben Farmer,"America has begun a $10m project making a vaccine to a deadly cousin of the Ebola virus considered a potential bioterrorism weapon.
Finding a way to stop Marburg virus is an urgent public health and biodefence need, the US government said.
The haemorrhagic fever virus has caused a string of deadly outbreaks in Africa since it was discovered in the 1960s. Several outbreaks have had high mortality rates, killing four-out-of-five infected.
In addition to the threat of naturally occurring infection, the Marburg virus, like Ebola, is deemed a potential bioterrorism threat by the US Department of Homeland Security, a statement said.

Reuters,"U.S. traffic fatalities rise dramatically on April 20, the day pot smokers celebrate. In the quarter-century since High Times magazine proclaimed April 20 a time to light up and smoke marijuana, traffic fatalities have spiked 12 percent on that date, compared to one week before or after, a new study shows. ""This was such a great natural experiment to examine the risk of cannabis intoxication,"" said lead author Dr. John Staples, an internist and researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Though the study could not assess whether marijuana-intoxicated drivers caused the surge in vehicle deaths on the counter-cultural ""High Holiday"" dubbed ""4/20,"" they appear to be the most likely culprits, Staples said in a phone interview. ""The simplest explanation is that some drivers are impaired by cannabis use, and these drivers are contributing to fatal crashes,"" he said. ""There should be very clear messaging to the public: Don't drive high."" The impact of marijuana's psychoactive effects on drivers is of particular concern given that six U.S. states now permit marijuana to be sold for recreational use to customers at least 21 years old. Since High Times popularized the date in a story the magazine published in 1991, thousands of Americans have been celebrating the intoxicating properties of cannabis on April 20, the authors write in JAMA Internal Medicine. Five San Rafael High School students claim to have coined the term ""4/20"" after regularly meeting at 4:20 p.m. in 1971 to search for a patch of pot plants in a nearby forest. Staples and Dr. Donald A. Redelmeier analyzed U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fatality reports from 1992, the year after the High Times story, through 2016. Traffic fatalities were 12 percent more likely on April 20 after 4:20 p.m., the time the celebrations begin, than on the same day one week before or one week after, the study found. Fallout from the festivities could be even deadlier for youth. Fatal crashes were 38 percent more likely for drivers under 21 years old after 4:20 p.m. on April 20 than they were the week before or after, Staples said. The increased risk of fatal traffic crashes on April 20 was comparable in magnitude to the increased traffic risks observed on Super Bowl Sunday, the authors write. Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, previously studied a spike in traffic fatalities on Super Bowl Sunday. All U.S. states prohibit driving impaired by marijuana, said Jennifer Whitehill, a professor of health promotion and policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not involved with the study. Organizers of 4/20 festivals should promote safe-driving measures, she said by email. In Colorado, where marijuana is legal, Lyft, the ride-sharing service, last year launched a fleet of green cars wrapped with the message: ""Plan a ride before you're high."" Jolene Forman, an attorney with Drug Policy Alliance, a New York nonprofit working to reduce the harms of both drug use and prohibition, said factors other than 4/20 celebrations might contribute to the increase in fatal crash rates. White supremacist groups, for example, also gather on April 20 to mark Adolf Hitler's birthday. Nevertheless, Forman, who was not involved with the study, credited the report with creating ""the opportunity to take a deeper dive into the research on marijuana and road safety to truly understand whether there is a link between marijuana use and crash risk, and the extent of that risk."" Previous research has shown that opioid-overdose deaths and hospitalizations drop in states that legalized marijuana, she said by email. Legalization ""provides an opportunity to shift our mindset away from prohibition and, instead, toward treating marijuana as a public health issue,"" Forman said. ""By treating marijuana as a public health issue, we can include marijuana in a comprehensive conversation about impaired and distracted driving, including the effects of prescription drugs, alcohol, texting, fatigue, etcetera on driving."" Whitehill agreed that the study highlights numerous questions that remain to be answered about marijuana and driving. ""For policymakers implementing marijuana legalization, it is critical to invest in research that will help us understand the impact the policy change may have on traffic safety,"" she wrote. Whitehill also urged parents to discuss the dangers of impaired driving from all psychoactive substances, including marijuana. ""As marijuana becomes legal in more states,"" she said, ""this type of conversation will become more necessary and, hopefully, more common as well.""

Karoli Kuns,"Yesterday around 1 PM, Hubs and I packed up the car, locked up our Camarillo home, and hit the road for a hard-earned weekend away to recover from all the midterm madness and sadness connected with the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks yesterday. As we were packing, we noticed the winds picking up speed and intensity. Ah, the Santa Ana winds, a staple of fall months forever. But these Santa Anas aren't like the ones I recall. They're hotter and drier, turning a coastal community into a desert. We said a quiet prayer that there would be no repeat of the Thomas fire, got in the car and took off for the north just about the time reports of the fire up north near Paradise, CA -- the Camp fire -- were breaking. That fire was moving at a pace of 3 football fields per second. It blasted through a hospital, burned schools and countless homes in the blink of an eye. That fire is now responsible for at least 5 deaths. About the time we hit Santa Barbara, a news alert popped up on my phone telling me there was an 800-acre fire in Santa Rosa, just to the east and south of Camarillo. Uttering a silent hope that a midday onslaught of helicopter drops and firefighters were ready to handle it, we continued on. Between Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, it ballooned into a 7,000 acre fire (original reports said 10,000!), with yet another new fire outbreak farther south. SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES in about an hour. That's a firestorm, not a fire. Our Camarillo fire was dubbed the Hill Fire ; the later fire is the Woolsey Fire. The Hill fire blew up so fast that my son and daughter-in-law had to grab their cat and their ""go bag"" for the second time in five years and head for our house, located near the city center. It would, I believe, require a nuke to land on City Hall or something to set us on fire. I say that while knocking on wood, but... We're 50 yards from a lake on one side, a freeway on the other and homes on a valley floor, so that's a bonus too. We breathed easier knowing our loved ones were safe, but...BUT. In less than a year, three fires have ravaged surrounding communities to ours. As I write, Malibu is being evacuated after the Woolsey fire jumped the 101 and races through the canyons for the second time in five years! It was just five years ago that a fire started in Camarillo and raced through Sycamore Canyon to the ocean -- the Springs fire. And that was in May, during unseasonal Santa Ana winds in MAY. Hot, dry, desert winds. Climate change is real, friends, and it is HERE. If we do not take some serious steps to reverse it, we're all going to be living under domes -- if we're lucky. Clean air will be for the privileged and the rich. Clean water will be for those who can filter it. If anyone doubts climate change is real, just watch that 2-minute video above. These fires are a hell on earth that threaten everything everywhere. It isn't just California. Yes, the Santa Anas are stronger, drier and hotter than ever before. But it is no different in the Southeast, where increasingly intense, wet hurricanes devastate communities, or in the Midwest, where the tornadoes are bigger and stronger than ever, chewing through entire communities in seconds. We cannot allow the denial anymore. Man-made global warming is a national security threat and an emergency. We have to work at state and federal levels to defeat the forces of evil (yes, I mean to call them evil) who continue to put every single community in danger across this country in service to the great God Petrochemical. I'm grateful to be in a safe place and know my family is safe today, but so many others are suffering. Natural disasters are a reality of life, but they don't have to be this intense and this devastating. That is entirely the fault of those who refuse to take steps to do something right now.","Yesterday around 1 PM, Hubs and I packed up the car, locked up our Camarillo home, and hit the road for a hard-earned weekend away to recover from all the midterm madness and sadness connected with the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks yesterday.

Donate A stunning new study by researchers at Harvard has revealed the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria may be 70 times higher than official count of 64. The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, says the death toll is at least 4,645—and perhaps as many as 5,740. President Trump has so far not responded to the new study. But in October, during a visit to Puerto Rico, Trump boasted about the low official death count. With a death toll of at least 4,645, Hurricane Maria would become the second-deadliest hurricane in U.S. history—behind only the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 which killed as many as 12,000 people in Texas. The Harvard study found that “interruption of medical care was the primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months after the hurricane, a finding consistent with the widely reported disruption of health systems. Health care disruption is now a growing contributor to both morbidity and mortality in natural disasters.” For more we go to San Juan, Puerto Rico where we speak with Omaya Sosa, co-founder of Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism, where she is a reporter. Her latest article is headlined, “Puerto Rico Government Did Not Prevent Most Hurricane María-Related Deaths.” Please check back later for full transcript.","A stunning new study by researchers at Harvard has revealed the death toll in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria may be 70 times higher than official count of 64.
