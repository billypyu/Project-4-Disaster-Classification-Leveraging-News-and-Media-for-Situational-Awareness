A mining dam has collapsed in Brazil, causing a sea of sludge to spread to rural areas of the country's south-east state of Minas Gerais.
Up to 200 people are missing, the fire brigade says, although there have been no confirmed fatalities.
Rescue teams were dispatched and officials said a number of residents close to the dam had been evacuated. 
The dam and Feijão iron ore mine are owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale.
Vale and local authorities said on Friday that leaked tailings from the Corrego de Feijão mine had spread into the nearby community Vila Forteco, close to Brumadinho. 
Footage broadcast on local television showed the mudflow sweeping over roads and destroying buildings in its path.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Los Angeles PD Image caption Burned out areas from wildfires are more susceptible to flooding and mudflow At least two people are dead amid mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off, US media report. ""Waist-deep"" mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal highway, officials say. Emergency crews are working to rescue multiple people trapped in vehicles and homes, a Santa Barbara official said. At least eight people were injured and thousands have fled ahead of the rain. Heavy rain run-off caused waist-deep mudflow in the Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Huber told the newspaper two people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months. Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion (£226 billion) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9 inches (23 cm) in select areas. Snow is forecast for higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service.",Heavy rains triggered massive mud flows as emergency crews worked to rescue people from their homes.,2018-01-09T17:33:55Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Two dead amid California heavy rains and mudslides,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42624408,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/120EA/production/_99526937_carinmud.png,bbc-news,BBC News,mudflow,1
The Associated Press,"By Christopher Weber | Associated Press LOS ANGELES — Crews working around the clock cleared boulders, trees and crushed cars from all lanes of U.S. 101, but California officials still weren’t sure Monday when the key coastal highway might reopen after being inundated during mudslides that killed 20 people. Much of the water on the roadway near the devastated town of Montecito had receded by Sunday, allowing workers to use bulldozers and other heavy equipment to push away solid debris that was still several feet deep.

Sign up for our new Morning Report weekday newsletter. “It is not until you can see the damage with your own eyes that you can come to understand the magnitude of the incident, the response that is necessary, but most importantly the impact to the citizens and families of Santa Barbara County,” said Jim Shivers, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation. Four people remained missing after the mudslides were triggered Jan. 9 by a powerful storm that swept in from the Pacific and dumped a deluge on mountain slopes that had been burned bare by a huge wildfire in December. Search and rescue operations ended over the weekend, and authorities transitioned to recovery. The move allows officials to release resources that were no longer needed and slow the search to a safer pace, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. At least 65 homes were destroyed and more than 460 others were damaged. The name of each victim was read aloud during a vigil Sunday night attended by thousands of people. “We all know someone who has been affected by this,” said Bethany Harris, who brought her two young sons to mourn. “We will heal together.” Crews have made it a priority to clear debris basins and creek canals before another rainstorm hits the area. Long-range forecasts gave the crews less than a week before the next chance of rain — and potential new mudslides — although the precipitation was expected to be light. Another storm system could move in two days later. Officials hoped to have an estimate Monday about when U.S. 101 would reopen, Shivers said. Meanwhile, Amtrak added additional cars to its route between Santa Barbara and points east as travelers increasingly relied on rail service to get around the closure. With many surface streets also shut down, the only other ground route into the Los Angeles area — located 90 miles (145 kilometers) down the coast — was a series of smaller mountain highways that add more than three hours to the trip.","The Mercury News SoCal crews struggle to clear mud from Hwy. 101 The Mercury News Photo from video: Highway 101 remains underwater as clean-up crews work to clear the roads throughout Montecito, following the deadly mudflow and flooding Jan. 9.

Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it's rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7.5 kilometers. It said that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ""will certainly spill over to the slopes,"" Sutopo said. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that's serving as an evacuation center. ""We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,"" she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano's alert was at the highest level for several weeks but didn't erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. ""If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I'll just accept it if our house is destroyed,"" she said. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia's tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the mountain, which prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

Kathleen Joyce,"A shocking video shot by California firefighters captured the full wrath of the California mudslides, showing a car being swept away by the raging flows of mud and debris that have plagued the state this week. A member of the Burbank Firefighters Local 778 filmed the footage of the car careening down a street and posted the footage on the group's Instagram page. “Urban Prius bobsledding in Burbank!” the video caption stated. The driver of the car, Desionne Franklin, told FOX5, he and his girlfriend were at home Tuesday morning when they realized they needed to evacuate.

Crews on Friday continued to dig through the rubble to look for survivors. (AP) The couple hopped in the car and started driving -- but soon realized the mud had overtaken the vehicle and was sweeping them down the road. Franklin explained the scary experience. “The steering wheel was shaking and we could feel boulders and rocks underneath us,” Franklin said. “The brakes didn’t work. My girlfriend was screaming ‘go go go.'” The mudslides have killed at least 17 people. (AP) The driver said the firefighters failed to capture the panic he and his girlfriend felt at the time. “What you can’t see in that video is the panic inside,” Franklin said. “We know we are lucky this turned out to be a positive story.” CALIFORNIA MUDSLIDES AFFECTING OPRAH, ROB LOWE, OTHER CELEBS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY The mudslides that have ravaged Southern California this week have killed at least 17 people and at least 43 others have been reported missing.

Many of the mudslide deaths occurred in Montecito, an area that’s home to celebrities such as Rob Lowe, Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey. The mudslides have raged in Southern California this week. (AP) Crews on Friday continued to dig through the muck and rubble to look for more people. The mudslides, which were ignited by heavy rain, took many homeowners by surprise early Tuesday, despite warnings issued days in advance the slides were possible due to the recent wildfires that stripped hillsides of vegetation that normally holds soil in place. Officials estimated the mudslides destroyed some 64 homes and damaged 446 others.

http://www.facebook.com/ktla5,"The portion of the 101 Freeway in Santa Barbara County that was blocked for two weeks by debris and soil left by an onslaught of deadly mudslides has finally reopened, Caltrans officials said in a tweet Sunday. Describing the highway’s cleanup as a “Herculean effort,” the agency tweeted side-by-side photos of the 101 Freeway in Montecito covered in 12 feet of mud, water and debris just 12 days ago and a photo of its current state. In the first photo, piles of pieces of wood, what appears to be garbage and other bits of debris can be seen sitting atop a thick, dark-colored layer of sediment that covers the entirety of the freeway. The next photo shows the highway now cleared, back to its normal coloring after crews spent weeks digging it out of the mud. The agency said on Saturday the highway would be open to drivers on Monday, but it appears officials were able to get it safely cleared even sooner. The mudslides — which killed 21 people while two still remain missing — were spurred by a period of heavy rains that flooded areas left vulnerable to moving debris and soil after being scorched by the Thomas Fire, a wildfire that swept across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties before being named the largest wildfire in the state’s modern history. The most recently recovered victim of the mudslides is a 28-year-old woman named Faviola Benitez Calderon, whose body was discovered by a search dog on Saturday morning, officials said. Calderon’s 10-year-old son, 3-year-old cousin and the 27-year-old mother of that cousin also died in the natural disaster. Other nearby roadways were also impacted by the mudslides, as the 166 Freeway near Maricopa had been closed off until reopening on Jan. 19, Caltrans officials said in a tweet.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) The closure of the 101 Freeway, a major route for commuting between Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, was particularly tough on commuters since alternate route between those areas could take several hours. A ferry service between the two counties was even set up by some local boating companies to get people up and down the coast by water instead of ground. “Some people are in desperate need to get to their loved ones, to work,” Cherryl Connaly, the owner of one of the boating companies, told KTLA. She said the ferry service, being offered in part by her Ventura company, Island Packers, would stop once the freeways are reopened.","KTLA 101 Freeway in Santa Barbara County Reopens After Being Blocked by Deadly Mudslides KTLA The portion of the 101 Freeway in Santa Barbara County, which was blocked for two weeks by debris and soil left by an onslaught of deadly mudslides, has finally reop…",2018-01-21T21:05:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ktla.com'}",101 Freeway in Santa Barbara County Reopens After Being Blocked by Deadly Mudslides - KTLA,http://ktla.com/2018/01/21/101-freeway-in-santa-barbara-county-reopens-after-being-blocked-by-deadly-mudslides/,https://tribktla.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/dufzxdouqaarxdi.jpg?quality=85&strip=all,,Ktla.com,mudflow,1

The Associated Press,"By FIRDIA LISNAWATI and STEPHEN WRIGHT KARANGASEM, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities ordered 100,000 people to flee Monday from an erupting volcano on Bali that forced the island’s international airport to close, stranding large numbers of travelers. Mount Agung volcano erupting in Karangasem, Bali, Indonesia, Monday, Nov. 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Firdia Lisnawati) Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 10,000 feet into the atmosphere since the weekend, and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard 7 miles away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano’s alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 6 miles. It said a larger eruption is possible. The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. “Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,” he said. “If needed we will forcibly evacuate them.” About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater “will certainly spill over to the slopes,” Sutopo said. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation center. “We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,” she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano’s alert was at the highest level for several weeks but it didn’t erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. “If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I’ll just accept it if our house is destroyed,” she said. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure was in effect until Tuesday morning, though officials said the situation would be reviewed every six hours. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transiting flights. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. A Chinese tour service, Shenzhen PT Enjoy Bali International, had about 20 groups totaling 500 to 600 travelers from the Chinese cities of Wuhan, Changsha and Guangzhou in Bali, according an executive, Liao Yuling, who was on the island. “They are mostly retirees or relatively high-end, so they don’t say they are especially anxious to rush home,” she said by telephone. The company was waiting to see whether Bali’s airport might open on Tuesday, said Liao. If not, she said buses and ferries would be arranged to take travelers to Surabaya on Java, where the company’s charter flights could pick them up. “We are not really affected, because the volcano is too far away. It is about 70 kilometers (45 miles) from us,” said Liao. “We only can say we saw pictures of it on television.” Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption. The agency’s chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia’s tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night’s free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and disrupted daily life outside the immediate danger zone. “Ash that covered the trees and leaves is very difficult for us because the cows that we have cannot eat,” said Made Kerta Kartika from Buana Giri village. “I have to move the cows from this village.” Indonesia sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

Add California Wildfires as an interest to stay up to date on the latest California Wildfires news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Heavy rain unleashed flash floods and debris flow in the southern part of the Golden State Tuesday, just weeks after several wildfires torched the area. At least 15 people have died and more than 20 injured from weather-related incidents as of today, according to officials in Santa Barbara County. At least two dozen people in Santa Barbara County were unaccounted for, officials said. Aerial view of Montecito, Calif., where mud and debris covers roads, homes and everything in it's path following heavy rains, Jan. 9, 2018. US 101 Freeway at the Olive Mill Road overpass flooded with runoff water from Montecito Creek and blocked with mudflow and debris following heavy rains in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018. The mudslides struck the communities hit hard by the Thomas fire in December, the largest wildfire in California's modern history. That's because burned soil can act as a water repellent like pavement, so rainfall that would normally be absorbed in the ground runs off rapidly after a wildfire. Thus, much less rain is needed to cause a flash flood. As the floodwater gushes downhill through burned areas, it can create major erosion and pick up vast amounts of ash, mud, rocks, sand, silt and scorched vegetation like trees and shrubs. Locations downhill and downstream from the burn scar left by a wildfire are susceptible to flash flooding, debris flow and mudslides, according to the National Weather Service. The force of the rushing water, mud and debris can be catastrophic. It can damage or destroy roadways, bridges, culverts and buildings even miles away from the burned area. Firefighters rescue a 14-year-old girl trapped inside a destroyed home during heavy rains in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018. Heavy rains overnight combined with large areas burned by the Thomas Fire combined for flash flooding and mudslide risk. A member of the Long Beach Search and Rescue team looks for survivors in a car in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018. The devastating Thomas fire that ignited Dec. 4 burned hundreds of thousands of acres in Southern California. Communities in Santa Barbara County, like Montecito, located below the burned area, are under siege again as mudslides crushed cars and ripped homes from their foundations this week. Highway 101 has been shut down in both directions because of the mud, Santa Barbara County officials announced Tuesday afternoon. A total of 0.54 inches of rain was reported at Montecito in just five minutes. The rate of rainfall in Southern California Tuesday was 18 times more than required to produce debris flow, according to an analysis by ABC News meteorologists. The Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management said Tuesday night that Montecito would be without potable water, electricity and sanitation ""for an extended period of time.""","Last year's wildfires in Southern California paved the way for this week's deadly mudslides, which turned roadways into ruinous rivers of mud and debris.",2018-01-10T16:30:44Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Southern California wildfires paved the way for deadly mudslides,http://abcnews.go.com/US/southern-california-wildfires-paved-deadly-mudslides/story?id=52257400,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/calif-mudslides-04-gty-jrl-180109_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,mudflow,1

More than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road have been closed and police said the scene ""looked like a World War One battlefield"". A group of 300 people are reportedly trapped in Romero Canyon neighbourhood east of Santa Barbara, with rescue efforts due to resume at daybreak. The death toll is expected to rise. More than 50 people have been rescued already but many places are still inaccessible. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. Image copyright Santa Barbara News via Reuters Image caption Fire department workers rescued a woman from a collapsed house in Montecito The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been scorched by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. In some places mud was waist-deep, officials said. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Those who have stayed in the area have been warned to boil their tap water before drinking it. Image copyright EPA Image caption Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said that five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito, possibly as a result of the storm. The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and broadcaster Oprah Winfrey. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights would be grounded. This comes after a record-setting year of $306bn (£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",Roads are closed and people are trapped in what police say looks like a World War One battlefield.,2018-01-10T08:41:59Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",California: Rescuers search for mudslide survivors,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42632660,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05tck00.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,mudflow,1
Johnny Simon,"At least 13 people have died after mudslides in Southern California, the Los Angeles Times reports. After last month’s wildfires cleared stabilizing vegetation from hillsides, strong rains turned the remainder into devastating mud flows yesterday.

Scott Neuman,"Some 100,000 people in Bali are being evacuated from a danger zone around a volcano that has been spewing ash thousands of feet into the air since last week, forcing the closure on Monday of the airport on the Indonesian resort island. The eruption, which is sending white and gray ash streaking off the top of the cone, began on Tuesday and was a first for the volcano in 50 years. Loud explosions from Mount Agung could be heard miles away. Officials say lava is welling up in its crater — a sign that a larger eruption is possible. ""The volcano's alert level has been raised to the highest level,"" senior state volcanologist Gede Suantika was quoted by The Jakarta Post as saying. ""Constant tremors can be felt."" That means a larger eruption is possible. As of Monday, the Indonesian government has designated a 7.5-mile radius around the volcano that it considers a danger zone. That zone was expanded from just 4 miles over the weekend in an apparent sign of increasing concern over the volcano's activity. Government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters in Jakarta that the danger zone encompasses 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. According to The Associated Press, he said that about 40,000 people had heeded the evacuation order so far, but that the rest say they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. Meanwhile, an estimated 59,000 passengers have been affected by the cancellation of 445 international flights to the island since Bali's Denpasar Airport closed on Monday. According to the AP, ""Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it's rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers."" The BBC adds that Tuesday's event was a ""phreatic eruption"" which causes ""the expulsion of [pressurized] steam from inside the volcano because the magma within is heating up water. This can lead to a build-up of pressure which causes an explosion blasting rock and bits of the crater into tiny pieces of ash."" Indonesia is located on the western rim of a seismically and volcanically active ""Ring of Fire"" that traces an outline around the Pacific Basin from New Zealand to the tip of South America. It's the second time in as many months that the people around Mount Agung have been advised to leave. In September, some 144,000 people heeded the government's warning, only to be told they could return a few days later. Also in September, thousands were evacuated from the South Pacific island of Ambae, belonging to Vanuatu when a volcano there showed increased activity. Mount Agung last erupted in 1963, killing 1,100 people near the volcano's base.","Mount Agung began spewing ash last week, but over the weekend authorities raised the alert level for a possible larger eruption and expanded a danger zone around the base of the volcano.",2017-11-27T09:39:51Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Indonesia Tries To Evacuate 100,000 People Away From Erupting Volcano On Bali",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/27/566671385/indonesia-tries-to-evacuate-100-000-people-away-from-erupting-volcano-on-bali,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/11/27/ap_17331061661216_wide-32166d468651ac5dffad8a6990e6d242f87a15f1.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,mudflow,1
Joseph Serna,"Investigators have determined that Southern California Edison power lines ignited the 2017 Thomas fire, a massive blaze in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that killed two people and later gave rise to a massive mudflow that resulted in at least 20 deaths.
Following a 13-month probe by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and Ventura County Fire Department investigators, officials found the fire was started by two power lines that slapped together during high winds on the evening of Dec. 4, 2017.
“A high wind event caused the power lines to come into contact with each other, creating an electrical arc,” the Ventura County Fire Department said in a press statement Wednesday. “The electrical arc deposited hot, burning or molten material onto the ground, in a receptive fuel bed, causing the fire. The common term for this situation is called ‘line slap,’ and the power line in question is owned by Southern California Edison.”
In October, the utility said its electrical equipment likely sparked at least one starting point in the massive fire, which burned 281,893 acres. The loss of vegetation in that area ultimately resulted in the collapse of hillsides north of Montecito during heavy rains on Jan. 9, 2018.
The finding puts the utility on the hook for not only more than $1.3 billion in insurance claims filed by Thomas fire victims, but also for the $400 million in claims filed after the Montecito slides.
Although Southern California Edison had acknowledged its equipment likely started a fire off Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula, its investigators concluded that the company was probably not responsible for a second, larger blaze that began in Anlauf Canyon earlier in the evening.
In the report released Wednesday, investigators said the Thomas fire first began as two separate fires that joined together and burned for 40 days. They determined the utility was responsible for both ignitions.
“We understand the ramifications around releasing information and making statements in this official report. … It was very thorough,” said Ventura County Fire Capt. Stan Ziegler.","Investigators have determined that Southern California Edison power lines ignited the 2017 Thomas fire, a massive blaze in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that killed two people and later gave rise to a massive mudflow that resulted in at least 20 deaths. …",2019-03-13T21:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Latimes.com'}","Southern California Edison power lines sparked deadly Thomas fire, investigators find",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-thomas-fire-edison-cause-20190313-story.html,https://www.latimes.com/resizer/fulJlROQi0YbNvQMk2zDVKJ2A_U=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AVQLFJYZWJHGVKU2UJPHA4SOAY.jpg,,Latimes.com,mudflow,1
Jacob Passy,"While the devastating volcanic eruptions that have hit Hawaii’s Big Island and Guatemala in the past month may seem like rare events, eruptions are more common than one might expect. On any given day, roughly 20 volcanoes are actively erupting, said Janine Krippner, a volcanologist and postdoctoral researcher at Concord University in West Virginia. “This is normal — this is what our planet does,” Krippner said. Also see: With the Kilauea volcano erupting, here’s what you need to know about visiting Hawaii And while some tourism hot-spots are well-known for their geothermal or volcanic activity — such as Yellowstone National Park or Mt. Elba on Sicily — many other destinations could be at serious risk were a volcano ever to erupt. Experts said that volcanic activity shouldn’t scare tourists away from a given location, but they also cautioned that travelers should go into their trips well-informed about the dangers volcanoes can pose. Tourists should check with a given destination’s local authorities and with the State Department to assess the risk a volcano poses in a given destination, said Bethany Torvell, editor of Safe Travels Magazine. Additionally, Krippner advised following emergency agencies on Twitter TWTR, -3.34% and Facebook FB, -2.25% so that travelers can have easy access to emergency information in the event of a crisis. Don’t miss: What I learned after being robbed at gunpoint in Mexico Moreover, travelers visiting a volcanic area should come prepared with an emergency plan that includes possible evacuation routes and supplies such as goggles and a face mask, in case the situation took a turn for the worst. “You need to understand the dangers and be willing and able to react should the need arise,” Krippner said. Here are some popular tourist destinations where travelers should consider preparing for a possible eruption: Mexico City Residents of Mexico City may be more concerned about earthquakes than they are volcanic eruptions, but both pose a significant risk to the Mexican capital. While it’s no stranger to seismic activity, the capital city of Guatemala’s northern neighbor could be the next victim of a major volcanic eruption. Mexico City is located in a valley within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a span of volcanos across the central-southern portion of Mexico. And in recent years, one volcano in particular has prompted concern among residents of Mexico City. Popocatépetl, a volcano located roughly 40 miles southeast of Mexico City, has periodically spewed rock, ash and lava over the past decade. Though the volcano has had 15 major eruptions since the 1500s, it hasn’t had a so-called “Plinian eruption” since the year 800, according to the Smithsonian Institute. Also known as Vesuvian eruptions, Plinian eruptions are among the most catastrophic of eruptions. Scientists have warned that recent eruptions Popocatepétl has experienced could quickly turn into this more-destructive class, which could have devastating effects on Mexico City. Naples, Italy Mt. Vesuvius is famous for its eruption that destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum, but these days it poses a risk to Naples. Speaking of Vesuvius, what is perhaps the world’s most well-known volcano is indeed still considered an active volcano. It is on the list of 16 “Decade” volcanoes that were identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth’s Interior as being important to study given their proximity to major cities and their explosive histories. While Naples itself might not be the most adversely impacted in the event of Vesuvius’ eruption, the Italian government has emergency plans in place to evacuate 700,000 people in the greater Neapolitan region were it to blow. Vesuvius isn’t the only volcano putting Naples at risk though. To the city’s west is the Campi Flegrei caldera — and a recent study warned that the volcano could be close to erupting again thanks to a build-up of energy over the past 60 years. Nearly 360,000 people now live above the caldera. Also see: How to hurricane-proof a Caribbean or Florida vacation Tokyo Mt. Fuji, seen here rising above the Tokyo skyline, has long served as a source of inspiration for Japanese artists. The Japanese capital and home to more than 13 million people is just 60 miles northeast of Mt. Fuji. The famous volcano is considered one of the Three Holy Mountains, revered in Japanese culture and art. The volcano has become a popular destination for hikers — local governments recently had to set limits on the number of people who could climb Mt. Fuji because of overcrowding concerns. Mt. Fuji hasn’t erupted in more than 300 years, but some scientists have argued the devastating earthquake that hit Japan in 2011 could make an eruption more likely in the near future. In the event of an eruption, Tokyo would likely be covered in ash and the lives of around 8 million people could be at risk. An eruption could also paralyze transportation systems throughout Japan. Iceland Picturesque views like these have helped lure tourists to Iceland, but the island country still faces a significant risk from the many volcanoes that dot its landscape. The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, a volcano in Iceland, didn’t cause any fatalities but did lead to major disruptions in air travel, resulting in a $1.7 billion loss for the airline industry. But the eruption also helped to make Iceland a prime tourist destination — particularly for sightseers looking to catch a glimpse of a volcano (and then enjoy the hot springs.) But that 2010 eruption could be indicative of eruptive events to come across the island nation. Scientists have warned that the decrease in ice could allow the Oraefajokull, Iceland’s largest active volcano, to warm and eventually erupt. Katla, another large volcano, has historically erupted following volcanic events at Eyjafjallajökull. Last year, seismic activity near the volcano prompted an influx of tourists. Seattle Mt. Rainier may currently be in a dormant phase, but scientists warn it could become active again and endanger the booming Seattle metropolitan area. The home of Starbucks SBUX, +0.66% Amazon AMZN, -1.04% and Microsoft MSFT, -1.29% is located at the foot of Mt. Rainier, the highest mountain in the state of Washington — and an active volcano. Mt. Rainier is yet another entry on the Decade volcanoes list. Unlike some other volcanoes, a major concern regarding an eruption of Rainier isn’t just ash or lava. Because of the glaciers located on the mountain, such an event could trigger a phenomenon known as a lahar: This is a violent type of mudflow or debris flow composed of volcanic material, rocks and water. Historically, these flows have been known to travel as far as 30 miles — far enough to put Seattle at significant risk of major destruction.","On any given day, roughly 20 volcanoes are actively erupting.",2018-06-07T14:34:52Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Marketwatch.com'}",Hawaii and Guatemala aren’t the only tourist destinations with active volcanoes,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hawaii-and-guatemala-arent-the-only-tourist-destinations-with-active-volcanoes-2018-06-07,http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK445_volcan_ZG_20180606182005.jpg,,Marketwatch.com,mudflow,1
IANS,"At least 13 persons are dead amid “waist-deep” mudslides in US’ southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding, an official said. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had “storm-related injuries” and four were critically hurt, the BBC reported on Wednesday. A group of around 300 people were reportedly trapped in Romero Canyon, east of Santa Barbara. A police officer said the scene “looked like a World War One battlefield.” 48 km of highway closed The flooding and mudslides, affecting areas scorched by wildfires in December 2017, have shut down over 48km of the main coastal highway. Emergency services said a number of people are unaccounted for and they expect the death toll to rise. Thousands have fled the deluge and over 50 were rescued. Heavy rain run-off caused mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, the BBC quoted Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason as saying. Big boulders block roads Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, the BBC report said. The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities like actor Rob Lowe and chat show host Ellen DeGeneres. Oprah Winfrey also has a property in Montecito that is reportedly worth nearly $90 million. After the wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil created a water repellent layer that blocked water absorption and increased risk of mudslides and floods. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the US, its National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.","Death toll may rise with many missing, at least 163 people hospitalised.",2018-01-10T03:53:11Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}","13 dead in US rains, mudslide",http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/13-dead-in-us-rains-mudslide/article22409830.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article22409829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10INTHVLRUSA-WEATHER,the-hindu,The Hindu,mudflow,1

Raul Roa,"I’ve been a professional photojournalist for 24 years and I’ve seen major changes in my industry. I’ve gone from film to digital. I’ve seen the reduction of staff, the reduction of print pages, and even the complete shut down of newspapers and magazines. And I’ve been at the forefront of the explosion of the World Wide Web and digital content. I’ve also seen a troubling trend where publishing companies ask to use photos or video in exchange for the proverbial “photo credit throughout our platforms.” I recently made a video of clean-up after a mudflow and posted it on my personal Facebook page. Shortly after my posting, a news producer from TIME Magazine sent me a message asking if the video was mine and if they could use it with proper credit throughout their platforms. Well, curiosity got the best of me so I had to finally ask the question. “What is the fee that you can offer me for the use of my exclusive video,” I asked. The answer was apologetic and quick. “I’m very sorry but TIME does not pay for ugc. I am sorry. Wish I could!” was the response from offices somewhere in New York. (“ugc” means “user generated content.”) I politely responded with “No problem. I completely understand but you must realize this is how I make a living and my work, for me, is valuable.” They contacted me and therefore my work is not “user-generated.” Furthermore, they asked to use my video on their websites, so they saw some type of value in it. But the definition of value, unfortunately, is probably not the same for me as it is for them in this case. You might say, “but you missed an opportunity to be seen by millions throughout TIME Magazine platforms.” And yes, you are right. But, for me, my work is extremely valuable and I don’t need credit for work done. What I do need is to pay my bills and feed my children plus keep a roof over my family. And the only way I can do that is through my work and getting paid for that work. I don’t think there is any other industry where they will give you valuable work for simply giving them “exposure.” But it’s not entirely the fault of those asking to use our work for free. The problem also lies with those photographers and videographers who will give their work away for access, or exposure or a free meal. If no one said yes to giving their work away, these types of requests would be few and far between. So, in an industry where paid work is harder and harder to find, we have to realize that our visual work is still a crucial foundation, a needed component of any story. Be it for print or digital, photos and video from the scene will always be needed. We have to stand up and come together to create a collective voice and let publishers know our work is worth more than a simple credit line. That’s where each one of us comes in. We all have put in countless hours at school, in workshops, in the field, money into our equipment and time honing our skills so that we can create great work. We must value our work enough to say no, even to TIME Magazine. About the author : Raul Roa is staff photographer at the LA Times Community News and covers parts of LA and Orange Counties.

"Gabriel Connelly, VICE News","About 300 residents of Santa Barbara County were said to be trapped Wednesday morning after flooding and mudslides devastated the area Tuesday, leaving 15 dead and two dozen missing. Experts say December’s wildfires spurred the mudslides after leaving the area's soil burned and vulnerable to rains. Just weeks before the mudslide in, the area experienced its largest wildfire on record, burning through a total of 273,400 acres and destroying more than 1,000 structures. Rescuers were trying to reach residents cut off by the debris left from the massive flooding and mudflow triggered by several days of heavy rain in the region. The rainfall accumulation reached up to an inch per hour, which is twice the amount considered enough to start a mudslide. Most deaths are believed to have occurred in the wealthy SoCal community of Montecito.",California's wildfires are to blame for the mudslides that left 15 dead,2018-01-10T22:41:11Z,"{'id': 'vice-news', 'name': 'Vice News'}",Wildfires are to blame for California's mudslides,https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xw455z/wildfires-are-to-blame-for-californias-mudslides,https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5a568717ffaba13556426d85/lede/1515620452798-mudslides.jpeg,vice-news,Vice News,mudflow,1
Jason Notte,"Flood insurance may comfort you when the water’s rising, but it may not cover all of your losses.
Flooding became an issue for my wife and me on New Year’s Day 2017, when we came home to find our basement coated in roughly an inch and a half of standing, bitterly cold water. An emergency call to a plumber led to double the normal maintenance fee, but helped us discover that the float on our house’s drainage pump was no longer working.
Our house isn’t in a flood plain and is nowhere near a river, but it does sit on a flat lot comprised largely of clay and requires a drainage pump to keep excess water away from the foundation. This instance didn’t cost us any furnishings or appliances and was easily cleaned with a portable sump pump and some wet-dry vacuums, but it did get us thinking about flood insurance.
Two months after our basement flooded, the folks at insuranceQuotes released the results of a survey it commissioned, asking homeowners for their thoughts on insurance coverage. According to that survey, 56 percent of homeowners believed that a standard homeowners policy covered flood damage. Among younger homeowners, aged 18 to 36, a full two-thirds (67 percent) believed that to be true.
It isn’t.
“And floods can happen at any time in any place, Stephanie Moffett, spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Association, said at the time. “Its the No. 1 costliest disaster in the United States.”
We were fortunate, as five inches of water in a 1,000 square-foot home can do more than $11,000 in damage. But federal disaster assistance won’t pay for flood damage unless the home is in a disaster area declared by the president. Even then, FEMA says, much of that assistance comes in the form of loans that need to be paid back… with interest.
However, back in 1968, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program to not only manage flood plains and identify flooding hazard zones, but to insure homeowners from most flooding events. Roughly 25% of all flood claims occur in low- to moderate-risk areas, with people in those areas receiving a third of federal disaster relief related to flooding.
It’s the cost of flood insurance that gives some folks pause. Though FEMA notes that flood insurance premiums start at only $119 a year, that’s dependent on a number of factors. The average annual premium is closer to $700, but in states including Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island, the average is double that amount. Meanwhile, the maximum coverage for residential buildings is $250,000 on the structure and $100,000 for contents.
If your home is worth more than those payout limits, you may have to dip into privately funded excess flood insurance. Even if your home is at the $250,000 limit for structural flood damage, a mortgage lender might require you to take out more if you live in an area that’s known for flooding.
If you’re in a low-risk B zone or lower, that supplemental coverage might run you about $400 extra a year. However, if you’re in an A zone or a more-endangered V zone right near water, the annual bill can fluctuate between $3,000 and $14,000.
That said, excess flood insurance also comes with loss-of-use protection that kicks in if you have to pay to live somewhere else while your home is being fixed. It also tends to lack the deductibles of federal flood insurance policies, which can stretch as high as $10,000, depending on how much of a discount you want upfront. The downside to those excess insurance policies is that they aren’t beholden to the same guidelines as federal policies, and aren’t required to cover the same damages.
There are other downsides, too. Both private and NFIP policies will kick in only if there is flooding on two or more neighboring properties or on two or more acres. Also, cosmetic damages caused by our basement flooding wouldn’t have been covered under flood insurance, because it doesn’t cover non-essential items in areas below ground level on all sides, such as carpeting, flooring, or furniture.
Finally, any mud damage that results from flooding has to fit a specific (and oddly dessert-based) definition to be covered: According to FEMA, “a mudflow is a river of liquid mud similar in consistency to a milkshake. Mudslides, on the other hand, are more solid and more closely resemble a cake.” Only the former is covered by a federal flood insurance policy, which makes it a tough lesson to learn on the fly if your house survived Western wildfires, only to be hit by a mudslide a few months later.
“Dont confuse mudflows with mudslides, as there are distinct differences, notes the Insurance Information Institute. “Mudslides occur when a mass of earth or rock moves downhill, propelled by gravity. They typically don’t contain enough liquid to seep into your home, and they aren’t eligible for flood insurance coverage. In fact, mudslides are not covered by any policy.”
If you live on a grade and mudslides are a concern, there is a way to get covered without convincing an insurer that mudslides and wildfires are linked and should both be covered under the same insurance. The III notes that an earth movement rider may cover both the structure and your valuables in the event of a rare occurrence like an earthquake, volcano eruption, or landslide. Those riders are often known as Difference in Conditions policies and offer all-in-one coverage for landslides, mudflows, earthquakes, and floods.
The cost will vary based on the the value of the home, its location, and the history of such cataclysmic conditions, but insuranceQuotes notes that such policies typically aren’t cheap. If those disasters are genuine concerns in your area, you may still want to look into it.
However, if you’re like us and just get spooked by occasional water in your basement, just know that items like a furnace will typically be covered by your home’s structural policy, while appliances like your washer and dryer and other various items you have stored down there will be covered under contents coverage. If you’re still worried, either invest in some regular maintenance for your drainage system, or shop around for a submersible sump pump. Leave the flood insurance to those dealing with actual flooding.

https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"What happened?   Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow.    Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano in continental Europe and is thought to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.   Every single resident died instantly when the southern Italian town was hit by a 500°C pyroclastic hot surge. Pyroclastic flows are a dense collection of hot gas and volcanic materials that flow down the side of an erupting volcano at high speed. They are more dangerous than lava because they travel faster, at speeds of around 450mph (700 km/h), and at temperatures of 1,000°C. An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance.  Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century.   His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unaware. Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours.   While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life.   Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. The Orto dei fuggiaschi (The garden of the Fugitives) shows the 13 bodies of victims who were buried by the ashes as they attempted to flee Pompeii during the 79 AD eruption of the Vesuvius volcano As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000. What have they found? This event ended the life of the cities but at the same time preserved them until rediscovery by archaeologists nearly 1700 years later. The excavation of Pompeii, the industrial hub of the region and Herculaneum, a small beach resort, has given unparalleled insight into Roman life. Archaeologists are continually uncovering more from the ash-covered city. In May archaeologists uncovered an alleyway of grand houses, with balconies left mostly intact and still in their original hues. A plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79. Around 30,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day Some of the balconies even had amphorae - the conical-shaped terra cotta vases that were used to hold wine and oil in ancient Roman times. The discovery has been hailed as a 'complete novelty' - and the Italian Culture Ministry hopes they can be restored and opened to the public. Upper stores have seldom been found among the ruins of the ancient town, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius volcano and buried under up to six metres of ash and volcanic rubble.

Reuters Editorial,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (Reuters) - Residents around an erupting volcano in central Philippines have should prepare to flee to safer areas because of risks from huge debris that could be swept from slopes by heavy rains, state volcanologists said on Saturday. The most active volcano in the poor Southeast Asian country has been spewing lava and ash for the last two weeks and may have a major eruption within days, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said. The provincial government has expanded its danger zone to a 9 km (5.6 miles) radius of Mount Mayon in Albay province from the 8 km radius set by volcanologists. More than 75,000 people had been moved out from the danger zone to sheltered areas but many farmers and quarry workers were defying evacuation orders to work in stone quarries, on farms, and to tend livestock. “It’s a real threat so we are urging everyone to prepare and evacuate when told by authorities,” said Mariton Bornas, head of the volcanology agency’s monitoring and eruption prediction, adding there are fresh lahar (mudflow) deposits in the 2,462 meter (8,977 feet) Mayon’s slopes. “It’s really a dangerous combination for the communities. Lahar from Mayon can carry huge boulder and it can bury communities, wash away people and everything in its path, but also because of impact.” Residents wade thorugh a river with lahar flow from Mount Mayon volcano in Daraga, Albay province, south of Manila, Philippines January 27, 2018. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco She said boulders as huge as cars and houses could roll down Mayon’s slopes swiftly in minutes. Heavy rains poured in central Philippines, flooding shelter areas and raising risks of lahar flows. In Salvacion village, many farmers were sneaking inside the danger zone to plant and look after farm animals saying they need to earn a living. “I don’t think the volcano will erupt,” Istong Jayvee told Reuters. “It already let out fire. It will quiet down soon.” Farm worker Edna Medina said they are ready anytime to flee when the volcano erupts. ”When the volcano does erupt, we’ll get out of here using our motorcycle then head straight for the main road out,” she added. Volcanologists have raised Mayon’s alert to level 4, one notch below the highest level.

Mireya Villarreal,"MONTECITO, Calif. -- A community of people still recovering from deadly mudslides are being forced from their homes again. With a few hours before the storm hits, deputies are trying to warn residents that they need to get their valuables and their families and get out before it's too late. Most of the homes Sgt. Brad Welch and his team hit were already empty. If no one is home, he says they tag it and move on. The few people who are still around promise they'll be gone soon. The goal is to clear out nearly 30,000 homeowners by nightfall. This affluent coastal community is just starting to recover after a devastating mudslide killed 21 people and destroyed hundreds of homes back in January. That was a voluntary evacuation zone. This time around, the evacuation is mandatory.

John Palminteri,"Holiday shopping is up significantly in Santa Barbara from the dismal picture during the Thomas fire disaster a year ago. (KEYT photo) SANTA BARBARA, Calif. - Holiday sales in Santa Barbara and surrounding areas appear to be stronger this year without a disaster like the massive two county Thomas fire. That destructive event sent tons of ash into the air and customers either left town or curtailed their shopping tremendously. The mood this year is far more upbeat. There's clean air, no localized emergency and out of town shoppers have made trips to experience Santa Barbara for the holidays. Diane Garmendia at 33 Jewels recalls how slow the days were 12 months ago. Now customers are coming through at a steady pace at her State Street store for rings, necklaces, watches, and bracelets. ""It's like night and day,"" she said. A group of downtown workers remember wearing N-95 masks last year to protect them from the soot when they went out for lunch. Chris Morgan at LogicMonitor said, ""everybody was wearing masks all over actually our business handed them out. Everything was closed downtown It was a ghost town."" He says State Street is starting to return to normal in his eyes instead of the quieter scene that occurred earlier this year in the mudflow crisis and during the fire. Morgan was walking with coworkers ready to dine at a downtown restaurant for lunch. Alicia Vito works at a clothing store and said, ""there's a lot more people out on the street and they are shopping for Christmas. At my job we are getting a lot more customers every single day. It's crazy busy so many people that are shopping for their relatives for themselves."" Garmendia said, ""I feel like this year people are much more into the Christmas spirit making up for last year. They are celebrating more, they are more festive, they want to shop. Definitely shopping is up."" Many shoppers had multiple bags as they went in and out of stores. ""It's nice to see. I love this time of year,"" said Vito. When it comes to the ultimate connection between the holiday shopping excitement for many people and gift giving, Garmendia said she sees ""women getting these little boxes on Christmas morning, that's because of us. That just warms my heart. I am just one of Santa's little helpers.""

Meghan Bartels,"Sunday's eruption of the Fuego volcano in Guatemala has ended, at least for now, after killing at least 25 people, according to the country's disaster response agency. But even if the volcano remains quiet, residents of the area aren't necessarily safe quite yet. Guatemala's national agency monitoring earthquakes, volcanos and the weather, has warned that in the wake of the eruption, areas around the volcano may be at risk of what scientists call lahars, which are sort of like very fast mudflows, but filled with rock particles released by the eruption. That risk reflects how the eruption played out: there was no lava involved, only pyroclastic flows. Despite the name, pyroclastic flows aren't liquids, they're a dense mixture of super-hot rocks—from boulders all the way down to the tiny particles of rock scientists refer to as volcanic ash. Pyroclastic flow can reach temperatures as high as 1500 degrees Fahrenhei t and speeds of 50 miles per hour or more, barreling through pretty much whatever is in its path. As if the initial destruction weren't bad enough, pyroclastic flows bring a second, longer-lasting threat to areas surrounding a volcano. That's because all that rock and ash stays on the ground. And if heavy rains come along, they can send that mass flowing again, since it's loosely packed particles the consistency of sand and rock. (In colder regions, lahars can also be triggered by melting glaciers.) ""If you think of trying to build a sand castle on a beach, the water just carries it away,"" Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University in West Virginia, told Newsweek. The result is what scientists call a lahar, essentially an incredibly fast-moving volcanic mudflow that can reach speeds up to 120 miles per hour. As a lahar travels, it can pick up boulders, debris, cars and other objects in its way. The Fuego volcano as seen on June 4, showing the path of pyroclastic flow down its side. That volcanic debris could become a mudslide known as a lahar. Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows Lahars are a known volcanic threat. ""They really are just part of living next to an explosive eruption where you have rainfall,"" Krippner said. And unlike eruptions themselves, which are unpredictable, scientists can give some warning about rain-triggered lahars based on local weather forecasts. That's particularly helpful because lahars can reach areas that weren't originally affected by the eruption itself. And the risk of lahars lingers after an eruption—in some regions, like Indonesia, where lahars are particularly common, they can occur years after the original eruption. As for the eruptive future at Fuego itself, that's more difficult to predict. ""This volcano has been erupting for a long time, it's quite an active volcano,"" Krippner said, adding that that means it's likely to remain fairly active. Sunday's eruption wasn't unusual for taking place at all, it was unusual for its scale. ""The size of this eruption is what's different, it's much bigger than what usually occurs at this volcano.""","A lahar, which is essentially a mudflow filled with rock particles, can reach speeds as high as 120 miles per hour.",2018-06-04T16:59:13Z,"{'id': 'newsweek', 'name': 'Newsweek'}",What Are Lahars?

A shallow river is seen with the Mayon volcano in the background in Sto Domingo, Albay, January 30, 2018. Photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The threat of catastrophic mudflows is building on the slopes of an erupting Philippine volcano where nearly 90,000 residents have been moved out of harm's way, authorities said Tuesday, January 30. Mount Mayon has spewed millions of tons of ash, rocks, lava and debris in less than 3 weeks, much of it loosely lodged on its burnt slopes and which experts warn could be dislodged by heavy rain. Activity continued overnight with ""energetic lava effusion"", while previously extruded lava was also collapsing on the crater, only to be pushed out again as debris, the state volcanology office said in its latest bulletin. Loud booming sounds, like that of thunder, accompanied the eruptions, an Agence France-Presse photographer near the mountain said. ""The public is strongly advised to be vigilant and desist from entering the 8-kilometer (5-mile) -radius danger zone, and to be additionally vigilant against pyroclastic density currents, lahars, and sediment-laden stream flows,"" the bulletin said. Pyroclastic currents are the superheated clouds of gas, ash and other volcanic debris that burn everything in their path as they speed down the slopes of the 2,460-metre (8,070-foot) mountain, located 330 kilometers southeast of Manila. The institute said these materials are building blocks for ""lahar"" – mammoth debris flows that could find their way into streams and rivers and mow down surrounding communities. An earlier Mayon eruption passed without any casualties in 2006, but 4 months later a typhoon unleashed an avalanche of volcanic mud from its slopes, killing about 1,000 people. On Saturday, January 27, the volcanology institute issued its first ""lahar"" warning on Mayon this year due to incessant rain that is usual in the region at this time of year. A day later the institute made a video recording of lahar flowing down a river near Daraga town south of the volcano, though it did not cause any damage or casualties. – Rappler.com","LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The threat of catastrophic mudflows is building on the slopes of an erupting Philippine volcano where nearly 90,000 residents have been moved out of harm's way, authorities said Tuesday, January 30.

Robin Abcarian,"People unattuned to the subtle shifts in California’s weather like to complain that we have no seasons here.
Of course we have seasons.
We have drought, followed by fires, followed by rain, followed by mudslides.
We can’t predict when drought will beset us, exactly, but we can predict the cascade of problems that will follow a dry spell, especially when the Santa Anas or the Diablos or the sundowners begin to blow over tinder-dry landscape, wicking away every last ounce of moisture.
This year, meteorologists said, the winds were stronger than usual and lasted longer than usual. Up and down the state, they pushed over trees, which fell onto power lines, which sent up explosions of sparks, which ignited brush and more trees. The winds sent embers shooting like flaming arrows along the landscape. Borne on a wildly flowing, invisible river of wind, the embers touched down, torching homes and cars, sometimes even creating their own weather systems.
Over the summer, near Redding, climatological conditions combined to create one of the most terrifying natural disasters imaginable: a fire cyclone. On July 23, a couple towing a vacation trailer had a flat tire. When the metal rim hit the pavement, sparks flew into parched grass, touching off a wind-whipped blaze in the 113-degree heat. By evening, cool coastal air blew into the Sacramento Valley. The air masses collided, creating a 30,000-foot-high spinning convection column that became a cyclone of flames.
If an alarm goes up early enough, residents threatened by wildfire are able to evacuate. Some stubbornly stay and regret it. But others are caught off guard, or move too slowly, and find themselves trapped in flames, or running or driving through hell to find safety.
In 2018, we lost a sobering number of souls this way.
Three and a half months later, in Paradise, a retiree-filled mountain town near Chico, at least 86 people died in the Camp fire, which began Nov. 8 and is now considered the deadliest, most destructive fire in recorded state history.
Three people are still missing. Almost 14,000 homes were lost, along with thousands of other buildings.
The town, which the local paper had warned was a fire disaster waiting to happen, will take years to recover.
The 2018 wildfire season is the worst on record in California. (And 2017 was the worst wildfire season before that.) More than 8,000 fires burned some 1.8 million acres, causing preliminary damage tallying at least $11 billion. More than 100 people died, including at least six firefighters.
Given global climate change, experts say, these kinds of fires may well be California’s new normal.
Just as fire season ends, if we are lucky, the rains begin.
Blessedly, the air clears and the lingering, acrid smell of smoke recedes. But a new danger threatens foothill and mountain communities near burn areas: flooding and mudslides, which, like fire, can come without warning.
Indeed, California’s first natural cataclysm of 2018, the Montecito debris flow, was the result of the last cataclysmic event of 2017, the Thomas fire, a massive conflagration that scorched land from Ventura County to Santa Barbara County and briefly held the mantle of the state’s largest wildfire.
In the wee hours of Jan. 9, half an inch of rain fell in five minutes, and the mountains above the tony, bucolic town that is home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jeff Bridges seemed to give way.
Mud, rocks and boulders came raging down from the Santa Ynez Mountains, burying, crushing or sweeping away everything in their path.
In trying to describe a mudflow, a Santa Barbara geologist suggested picturing a 15-foot-high river of mud moving at 20 mph, so viscous that one- and two-ton boulders could bounce along the surface, like pingpong balls, obliterating everything in their path.
The debris flow came down the gulleys and creeks, crossed the 101 Freeway, then flowed into the sea, where for weeks, the waves stayed the color of mud.
Twenty-one people died in that mudflow, and two children remain missing, their bodies perhaps washed out to sea. More than 125 homes were completely destroyed; 300 more were damaged.
More and more in California, it feels as if no place is immune from the ravages of our seasons.
Last year’s wine country fires, which killed 44 people, taught us that fire combined with hurricane-force winds can level populated suburban neighborhoods that have never before been considered susceptible to wildfire.
Two Santa Rosa hospitals right next to the 101 were singed and evacuated. A nearby Kmart in the middle of a shopping center, surrounded by blacktop, burned to the ground.
But even populations hundreds of miles away from a fire can suffer.
While the Camp fire raged in the piney mountains around Paradise, the air quality as far away as San Francisco — 170 miles southwest — became so bad that parents feared for their children’s health. Bay Area school districts and University of California campuses cancelled classes.
Likewise, in November, when the Woolsey fire burned from Thousand Oaks through Malibu to the beach, Santa Monicans choked on smoke.
It is winter now. The fires are out.
Our next disaster may be only a storm away.","People unattuned to the subtle shifts in California’s weather like to complain that we have no seasons here. Of course we have seasons.

Only a fraction of people, estimated at 10 to 15 percent, followed the order.

More than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal road have been closed and police said the scene ""looked like a World War One battlefield"". A group of 300 people are reportedly trapped in Romero Canyon neighbourhood east of Santa Barbara, with rescue efforts due to resume at daybreak. The death toll is expected to rise. More than 50 people have been rescued already but many places are still inaccessible. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. Image copyright Santa Barbara News via Reuters Image caption Fire department workers rescued a woman from a collapsed house in Montecito The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been scorched by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) says the risk of flooding stays ""significantly higher"" for up to five years after a wildfire. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. In some places mud was waist-deep, officials said. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Those who have stayed in the area have been warned to boil their tap water before drinking it. Image copyright EPA Image caption Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said that five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito, possibly as a result of the storm. The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and broadcaster Oprah Winfrey. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights would be grounded. This comes after a record-setting year of $306bn (£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California has suffered severe drought in five out of six of the past years. In December, California Governor Jerry Brown said the state was ""facing a new reality"" as climate change meant wildfires could erupt ""every year or every few years"".

"Saphora Smith, Shanshan Dong","Santa Barbara officials have warned that they need to clear debris from drainage basins and channels following this week’s deadly mudslides or risk possible further mud flows if another storm hits Southern California. Rob Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Emergency Management Officials, told a press conference Saturday that the blocked drainage channels in the Montecito area of the county meant that even if a storm of ""less intensity"" hit, the area could see ""more mud and flow."" The warning came as the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office announced that the death toll in Tuesday's mudslides had risen to 19, after 25-year-old Morgan Christine Corey was identified as among the dead. Five others remain missing after mudslides occurred after a heavy downpour struck areas burned by the so-called Thomas Fire that scorched hillsides last month, the county sheriff's office said. Four children aged 3, 6, 10 and 12 are among the dead. The mudslides left drainage basins and channels clogged with debris, officials explained. A section of Highway 101 — which runs north-south through the states of California, Oregon and Washington — also remains closed indefinitely due to the high-levels of water on the road surface, according to California's Department of Transportation. “We have got to get those basins cleared as fast as we can,” Rob Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Emergency Management Officials told a press conference Saturday. “If we don’t get those debris basins cleared out then we’re not going to be prepared for the next storm and we don’t know what that storm is going to look like.” Lewin said clearing the debris was his team's number one priority to mitigate the risk of another mudslide. He added that a task force was working on locating places where they could safely move the debris. “We have got to get those channels ready or we’re going to have more mud and flow under a storm that would be of less intensity,” he said. Mudflow and damage from mudslides are pictured in this aerial photo taken from a Santa Barbara County Air Support Unit Fire Copter over Montecito, California on January 10. Matt Udkow / Santa Barbara County FD via Reuters The seven day forecast for the Montecito area has no storm warnings and is largely dry with a small chance for light rain on Friday, according to the Weather Channel. “We’re into a little bit of a dry pattern over the next few days,” said Frank Giannasca, senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel. “There’s a possibility of some rain showers around Friday but it doesn’t look like anything of significant consequence, relatively light showers.” As for Highway 101, Jim Shivers a representative from the California Department of Transportation said he could not tell members of the public when the road would reopen due to the ""massive amount of water on the highway."" Shivers added that while he did not yet have a time or date for when the road would be reopened, it would reopen at some point. ""Once we can get that water to recede we feel very confident that we can bring in the available equipment on standby get down to the bottom and move the heavy material out of the way,"" he said.

Don Dahler,"A disaster is unfolding in Guatemala, where the Volcano of Fire has erupted, forcing nearby residents to run for their lives with no warning. Ash and mud hot enough to melt shoes has buried homes and people. Rescuers have pulled at least 10 people to safety. More than 62 people have been killed and the toll is expected to rise. More than 46 were hurt and more than 3,200 were evacuated. Orange superheated gas and rocks shot into the sky and poured down the mountain reportedly wiping out entire villages. The eruption sent ash as far as 40 miles away. ""I count dead people. I can see buried people hurt and the situation is very sad,"" Manual Cobar said. Eugenia Garcia Uspatan lost all but two of her family members. ""I only managed to find two children last night,"" she told Reuters. ""But my two female daughters, my grandson and my son are missing, together with my entire family."" Firefighters and police are forced to evacuate a search and rescue effort as the Volcan de Fuego, or ""Volcano of Fire,"" continues to spill out smoke and ash in Escuintla, Guatemala, Monday, June 4, 2018. In the first few hours, the ash and mud remained so hot that rescuers had a difficult time reaching victims, some of whom could be heard crying out for help. The rapidly moving mixture of gases and volcanic matter -- known as pyroclastic flows -- reached 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in some places. Rafael Salguero was one of the first people on the scene. ""The challenge we've faced is that the volcano has been active,"" Salguero said in Spanish. ""And also working with this kind of material, which is extremely hot."" By the time first responders did reach them, it was often too late. Dozens were either burned to death or asphyxiated by the deadly fumes, including children. A rapidly rising mudflow destroyed a highway bridge and sent several onlookers running for their lives, and a once-pristine nearby golf course was covered in dark gray ash and mud. The volcano is located about 25 miles from Guatemala City and is one of Central America's most active volcanoes. Sunday's 16-hour long eruption was the most violent in more than a century.","Ash and mud hot enough to melt shoes has buried homes and people, and rescuers have pulled at least 10 people to safety",2018-06-04T22:09:28Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}",Guatemala's Volcano of Fire wipes out entire villages,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guatemalas-volcano-of-fire-wipes-out-entire-villages-as-ash-rocks-rain-down-2018-06-04/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/04/3b2f58a4-c42d-4633-804c-60abf151da67/thumbnail/1200x630/17dfc18a635da5749d0ea697c246618e/ap-18155635626377.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,mudflow,1
AP,"By: AP | Bali (indonesia) | Updated: November 27, 2017 8:34 pm Glowing light of hot lava is seen during the eruption of Mount Agung as seen from Amed in Karangasem, Bali, Indonesia, November 27, 2017. Reuters Indonesian authorities ordered 100,000 people to flee Monday from an erupting volcano on Bali that forced the island’s international airport to close, stranding large numbers of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometers (7 1/2 miles) away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano’s alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7 1/2 kilometers. It said a larger eruption is possible. The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. “Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,” he said. “If needed we will forcibly evacuate them.” About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater “will certainly spill over to the slopes,” Sutopo said. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation center. “We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,” she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano’s alert was at the highest level for several weeks but it didn’t erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. “If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I’ll just accept it if our house is destroyed,” she said. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure was in effect until Tuesday morning, though officials said the situation would be reviewed every six hours. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transiting flights. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. A Chinese tour service, Shenzhen PT Enjoy Bali International, had about 20 groups totaling 500 to 600 travelers from the Chinese cities of Wuhan, Changsha and Guangzhou in Bali, according an executive, Liao Yuling, who was on the island. “They are mostly retirees or relatively high-end, so they don’t say they are especially anxious to rush home,” she said by telephone. The company was waiting to see whether Bali’s airport might open on Tuesday, said Liao. If not, she said buses and ferries would be arranged to take travelers to Surabaya on Java, where the company’s charter flights could pick them up. “We are not really affected, because the volcano is too far away. It is about 70 kilometers (45 miles) from us,” said Liao. “We only can say we saw pictures of it on television.” Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption. The agency’s chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia’s tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night’s free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and disrupted daily life outside the immediate danger zone. “Ash that covered the trees and leaves is very difficult for us because the cows that we have cannot eat,” said Made Kerta Kartika from Buana Giri village. “I have to move the cows from this village.” Indonesia sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes.

"Robin Andrews, Contributor, Robin Andrews, Contributor https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinandrews/","The word “supervolcano” is, well, not ideal – but it’s not really its fault. It’s like nectar to hungry media bees, keen to capitalize on any tiny, insignificant event occurring at or near a supervolcano by squeezing it into a scary-sounding headline or – worse – writing an entire fear-mongering tale about it, much to the chagrin of volcanologists everywhere. It’s actually a technical term, but it doesn’t mean what you think it means. Again, this isn’t your fault; I’m a volcanologist, and its prolific misuse in the media has even tripped me up once or twice in the past. So, in case you were wondering, here’s a breakdown of what a supervolcano is, and what is most certainly is not. Yellowstone National Park, seen here steaming away in the winter months. (Shutterstock) The term “supervolcano” – and “supereruption”, by default – didn’t get much attention in the media prior to the turn of the millennium. In 2005, it was popularized by a docu-drama produced by the BBC and the Discover Channel that focused on the consequences of a supereruption event taking place at Yellowstone. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a supervolcano is any volcanic center that has explosively erupted at least 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cubic miles) of fresh volcanic material in a sudden, violent manner – in a so-called supereruption – often producing a huge depression crater named a caldera. This rules out flood basalts, large effusions of lava that can spend a million years or so scorching the earth and massively altering the climate. That is literally all there is to it. There are plenty of supervolcanoes all over the world, from Taupo in New Zealand to Toba in Indonesia. Some are potentially just dormant, whereas others are almost certainly extinct. What's a supereruption, in a single image. USGS Yellowstone, that now-infamous volcano hanging out in Wyoming, is in particular sensationalized in this way, with certain publications keen to herald the end of the world as frequently as possible to get those sweet, sweet clicks piling in. The one that gets all the attention, as you might have guessed, is Yellowstone. It’s not clear why it is reported on far more than any others, but I suspect it’s down to the erroneous idea that a supereruption is imminent at any time, encouraged by a cannibalistic positive feedback cycle in which the media has essentially generated its own legend. Incidentally, I’m acutely aware that I’m part of the media too. Rumors regarding a supervolcanic apocalypse pop up almost on a weekly basis these days, which is why I spend much of my time turning them into linguistic dust. The most bizarre of all didn’t actually involve Yellowstone, but a story about a supervolcano appearing in New England. The idea that Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s ice cream – based in Vermont – could be annihilated by this fake pit of hellfire was particularly vexing, so I naturally felt compelled to say something on the subject. If you’re to believe the headlines, though, Yellowstone is primed to blow constantly, which makes you wonder what the heck this primadonna pyrotechnics display is waiting for. It doesn’t matter what it is: from dead bison to a crack appearing in a neighboring National Park, to some, it’s a sign of a supereruption. Whenever this happens, USGS staff members are inundated with phone calls from the panicked public – an increasingly unwelcome distraction when there’s actual volcanic eruptions and monitoring to deal with. As experts are acutely aware, Yellowstone’s two-step magma reservoirs now more than 15 percent molten, whereas any eruptive activity requires around 50 percent molten material to be present. Even if it did erupt, it’d be more likely to be a lava flow or a hydrothermal blast, two surficial volcanic expressions that have occurred far more frequently throughout the beast’s geological history. Yellowstone has experienced two supervolcanic eruptions in the last 2.1 million years, with another powerful event not quite making the cut, volume-wise. Considering the North American plate is moving around over a stationary, superheated mantle plume – the heat source that generates so much magma in the crust there – Yellowstone will eventually “ die ” as its underlying power is slowly removed. There may never be a supereruptive event there again. The best analogy I have here is to Olympic medals. Sure, the volcano may have got the gold medal twice with those two supereruptions, but it doesn’t mean it’ll ever get that same spot on the podium again during the next Olympic Games. Perhaps it’s already retired in that sense. I've never been to Yellowstone National Park, but not out of fear that an eruption there will melt my face. (Shutterstock) Yes, it’s an active volcanic center. You have earthquakes and surface deformation, but that’s to be expected – it’s just doing what a volcano does. No-one’s shocked by all the surface geothermal activity, like those glorious (but frightfully deadly) hot springs and geysers. They may be fueled by the subterranean fire and fury, but because they happen all the time in plain view, it’s just perceived by the public as par for the course. Small earthquakes and land movement happen near-constantly too, as the USGS is acutely aware, but as no-one in the public notices this, but instead sees terror-inducing headlines about them, this makes Yellowstone still seem like a threat. There’s a chance that Yellowstone may engage in a supereruption one day. Yes, it would be an unmitigated social and economic disaster, if not world-ending. Right now, though, it’s really not worth worrying about. You couldn’t even use a nuke to set it off. The USGS, to the bets of their ability, peg the odds of a supereruption occurring this year as one-in-730,000 – very low odds indeed. Technically, you should be far more worried about dying in a car crash or simply falling over a bit awkwardly. Someone recently suggested that the odds of a Yellowstone paroxysm is still a lot higher than the chances of them winning the lottery’s top-tier jackpot prize, but that’s not how probability works. There’s only one volcano here, not hundreds of millions vying for the same prize. Supervolcanic centers are potentially very dangerous, yes, which is why they are heavily monitored and researched. There’s a lot that volcanologists still don’t understand about them. They’re fascinating colossi, and they absolutely deserve our attention – but not in the way they’re often pushed to be perceived by certain media outlets. Instead, we should focus on other volcanoes around the world, particularly those that are seen as unusually quiet and that are surrounded by plenty of people. In the 20 th century alone, tens of thousands of people died from volcanic eruptions, and the hazards styles are plentiful : from mudflow-like lahars and pyroclastic flows – the two big killers – to volcanically induced tsunamis, gas emissions, debris fallout and even indirectly exacerbated epidemics, these are the real killers, not supervolcanoes. Don't expect this at a supervolcano near you anytime soon. (Shutterstock) Fortunately, scientists are on the case. From monitoring the silent Cascades in North America to leading relief efforts on the ground near Guatemala’s Fuego, from keeping people away from the dangers of the ongoing Kilauea eruption to comprehending the heartbeat of Campi Flegrei, volcanologists are working around the clock to better understand these beasts, so that we can do our best to co-exist with them, and perhaps even tame them a little. Supervolcanoes are scientific wonders too, but the term “supervolcano” itself is now a little bit silly. It still remains a technical term, but at this point it’s being given the Geostorm treatment by the tabloids. It’s less than the sum of its parts, and not something to lose sleep over. ""&gt; The word “supervolcano” is, well, not ideal – but it’s not really its fault.

The one that gets all the attention, as you might have guessed, is Yellowstone. It’s not clear why it is reported on far more than any others, but I suspect it’s down to the erroneous idea that a supereruption is imminent at any time, encouraged by a cannibalistic positive feedback cycle in which the media has essentially generated its own legend. Incidentally, I’m acutely aware that I’m part of the media too. Rumors regarding a supervolcanic apocalypse pop up almost on a weekly basis these days, which is why I spend much of my time turning them into linguistic dust. The most bizarre of all didn’t actually involve Yellowstone, but a story about a supervolcano appearing in New England. The idea that Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream – based in Vermont – could be annihilated by this fake pit of hellfire was particularly vexing, so I naturally felt compelled to say something on the subject. If you’re to believe the headlines, though, Yellowstone is primed to blow constantly, which makes you wonder what the heck this primadonna pyrotechnics display is waiting for. It doesn’t matter what it is: from dead bison to a crack appearing in a neighboring National Park, to some, it’s a sign of a supereruption. Whenever this happens, USGS staff members are inundated with phone calls from the panicked public – an increasingly unwelcome distraction when there’s actual volcanic eruptions and monitoring to deal with. As experts are acutely aware, Yellowstone’s two-step magma reservoirs now more than 15 percent molten, whereas any eruptive activity requires around 50 percent molten material to be present. Even if it did erupt, it’d be more likely to be a lava flow or a hydrothermal blast, two surficial volcanic expressions that have occurred far more frequently throughout the beast’s geological history. Yellowstone has experienced two supervolcanic eruptions in the last 2.1 million years, with another powerful event not quite making the cut, volume-wise. Considering the North American plate is moving around over a stationary, superheated mantle plume – the heat source that generates so much magma in the crust there – Yellowstone will eventually “ die ” as its underlying power is slowly removed. There may never be a supereruptive event there again. The best analogy I have here is to Olympic medals. Sure, the volcano may have got the gold medal twice with those two supereruptions, but it doesn’t mean it’ll ever get that same spot on the podium again during the next Olympic Games. Perhaps it’s already retired in that sense. I've never been to Yellowstone National Park, but not out of fear that an eruption there will melt my face. (Shutterstock) Yes, it’s an active volcanic center. You have earthquakes and surface deformation, but that’s to be expected – it’s just doing what a volcano does. No-one’s shocked by all the surface geothermal activity, like those glorious (but frightfully deadly) hot springs and geysers. They may be fueled by the subterranean fire and fury, but because they happen all the time in plain view, it’s just perceived by the public as par for the course. Small earthquakes and land movement happen near-constantly too, as the USGS is acutely aware, but as no-one in the public notices this, but instead sees terror-inducing headlines about them, this makes Yellowstone still seem like a threat. There’s a chance that Yellowstone may engage in a supereruption one day. Yes, it would be an unmitigated social and economic disaster, if not world-ending. Right now, though, it’s really not worth worrying about. You couldn’t even use a nuke to set it off. The USGS, to the bets of their ability, peg the odds of a supereruption occurring this year as one-in-730,000 – very low odds indeed. Technically, you should be far more worried about dying in a car crash or simply falling over a bit awkwardly. Someone recently suggested that the odds of a Yellowstone paroxysm is still a lot higher than the chances of them winning the lottery’s top-tier jackpot prize, but that’s not how probability works. There’s only one volcano here, not hundreds of millions vying for the same prize. Supervolcanic centers are potentially very dangerous, yes, which is why they are heavily monitored and researched. There’s a lot that volcanologists still don’t understand about them. They’re fascinating colossi, and they absolutely deserve our attention – but not in the way they’re often pushed to be perceived by certain media outlets. Instead, we should focus on other volcanoes around the world, particularly those that are seen as unusually quiet and that are surrounded by plenty of people. In the 20 th century alone, tens of thousands of people died from volcanic eruptions, and the hazards styles are plentiful : from mudflow-like lahars and pyroclastic flows – the two big killers – to volcanically induced tsunamis, gas emissions, debris fallout and even indirectly exacerbated epidemics, these are the real killers, not supervolcanoes. Don't expect this at a supervolcano near you anytime soon. (Shutterstock) Fortunately, scientists are on the case. From monitoring the silent Cascades in North America to leading relief efforts on the ground near Guatemala’s Fuego, from keeping people away from the dangers of the ongoing Kilauea eruption to comprehending the heartbeat of Campi Flegrei, volcanologists are working around the clock to better understand these beasts, so that we can do our best to co-exist with them, and perhaps even tame them a little. Supervolcanoes are scientific wonders too, but the term “supervolcano” itself is now a little bit silly. It still remains a technical term, but at this point it’s being given the Geostorm treatment by the tabloids. It’s less than the sum of its parts, and not something to lose sleep over.","The word ""supervolcano"" appears in the news a lot, but I'm guessing a lot of the public aren't clear on what it means.

"Darran Simon, Paul Vercammen and Faith Karimi, CNN","Heavy rains make Southern California vulnerable to flooding and debris flows, especially after fires that strip steep hillsides of vegetation. Mudflows, mudslides and landslides often are used interchangeably when disaster strikes, but the terms have distinctions. A mudflow is ""a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,"" according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""Other earth movements, such as landslide, slope failure or a saturated soil mass moving by liquidity down a slope, are not mudflows,"" it says. FEMA sees a mudflow as similar to a milkshake, while the more solid mudslide is comparable to a cake. The US Geological Survey dismisses mudslide as an ""imprecise but popular term... frequently used by laymen and the news media to describe a wide scope of events, ranging from debris-laden floods to landslides."" A landslide occurs when soil or rock moves downhill, usually due to gravity, but erosion, heavy rains and earthquakes can contribute to landslides.

Sputnik,"Almost two thousand years after Pompeii was buried by ash and rock spewed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, the ancient city continues to reveal its long-hidden treasures. Archaeologists have revealed their newest discoveries made in the house of a wealthy man who lived in the ancient Roman city, The Nation wrote. One of the most prominent discoveries was made in Casa di Giove (the House of Jupiter), including well-preserved frescoes, terracotta vases and traces of everyday life despite having survived one of the most catastrophic eruptions in written history. Traces of fire were found in an adjacent house which had blackened the frescoed wall. The name of the house, decorated in the first Roman style, comes from a small picture depicting Jupiter found on a shrine placed in the garden. The house has a central atrium surrounded by several decorated rooms with fake marble painted in bright shades of red, yellow and green. The house of Jupiter was partially excavated in the 18th and 19th centuries, but archaeologists have now discovered more frescos and ornate remains that help us understand what day-to-day life was like in the city thousands of years ago. Also discovered were premises reflecting the architectural style of later periods of Roman history. The archeologists found the heads of terracotta lions, coins, glass decorations and roof tiles emblazoned with trademarks. Over the past few months archeologists have also uncovered a surrounding square, nearby pavement and also a street of houses with intact balconies that were also buried by the vast eruption.

Hannah Fry,"A fierce winter storm packed with subtropical moisture continued its destructive path across California, triggering widespread flooding that prompted evacuations and unleashing a mudslide that sent one home sliding into another in Marin County.Southern Marin fire officials said the mudslide dislodged the home from its foundation and pushed it down a hill before it slammed into another residence.Rescuers pulled a woman from the wreckage after they saw her hand sticking out of the debris. Caked in mud, she was wheeled on a stretcher into an ambulance. Officials evacuated 50 homes in the area after the hillside gave way.
“Surprisingly, she was in great condition,” Southern Marin Fire Protection District Capt. Doug Paterson said of the woman. “She was talking to us. She was alert. She was able to tell us exactly what had happened.”

Other Bay Area cities also got a solid soaking. San Francisco received more than 3 inches of rain in the same time frame and faced wind gusts of up to 50 mph. The conditions prompted the National Weather Service to issue a flash-flood watch and high-wind warning for the region.
The massive storm has already broken daily precipitation records after 1.94 inches of rain fell in downtown Sacramento on Wednesday. That shattered the record of 1.61 inches set in 1926, according to the weather service.
Forecasters said San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties were hit hard during the storm. Some areas saw more than 3 inches of rain along the coast and more than 10 inches at higher elevations, said Casey Oswant, a meteorologist with the weather service in San Diego. ​​​​​​
​​​​​“Usually these storms are stronger up north, but this one is hitting our area much harder,” said James Brotherton, a meteorologist with the weather service in San Diego. “It’s definitely stronger than others we’ve experienced, and it’s likely the strongest we’ve seen this winter.”
Some residents whose communities were affected by last year’s Holy fire in Riverside and Orange counties were told to leave their homes before the brunt of the storm hit Thursday.
Laguna Beach in Orange County faced a similar concern hours later, prompting officials to evacuate a cluster of homes and businesses along Laguna Canyon Road. Officials warned residents on social media and made announcements over a loudspeaker at the city’s beaches that Laguna Canyon Creek had reached levels that could trigger flooding in the city’s downtown.

(Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via AP) Many Californians in the area hit hardest by this week’s deadly mudslides did not heed warnings for hours and days by emergency officials encouraging them to evacuate their homes _ and then received cellphone alerts of imminent slides when the massive streams of debris were already heading toward them or had already hit their neighborhoods. Wireless emergency alerts are cellphone messages sent to everyone in a region, similar to the Amber alerts that are sent to cellphone users in specific areas when authorities are trying to find missing children. The alert sent by Santa Barbara County officials to all those in mandatory and voluntary evacuation areas went out around 3:50 a.m. Tuesday, Rob Lewin, the county’s emergency management director said Thursday. It followed a cellphone alert sent by the National Weather Service, he said. There has been no outpouring of complaints from people that wireless warnings should have been sent out earlier, and residents of affected areas spoke with The Associated Press said they knew they lived in evacuation areas but chose not to leave. The first slides tore through Montecito about 3:30 a.m. and continued after the county cellphone alerts went out, destroying or damaging 400 homes and killing at least 17 people. The vast majority of those homes were in areas already designated by authorities as under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. See Pictures: California mudslide: After wildfire, state devastated by rains The National Weather Service sent out four wireless emergency alerts in various areas of Santa Barbara County between 2:30 a.m. and noon on Tuesday, spokeswoman Susan Buchanan said. The warnings for residents to leave had been issued for days before the mudslides through social media, news media and community information emails about the potential for mudflows from the huge wildfire scar in hills above neighborhoods. Sheriff’s deputies also knocked on doors in the mandatory evacuation area to warn residents to leave. Another emergency management official told the Los Angeles Times that county officials decided not to use the its push alert system to cellphones earlier for concern it might not be taken seriously. “If you tell everyone to get out, everyone get out, the next time people won’t listen,” emergency manager Jeff Gater told the newspaper. “If you cry wolf, people stop listening.” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown defended the timing of the wireless emergency alert, saying they are supposed “to be used to notify someone of an active incident that is occurring.” “It was activated at the appropriate time actually when the event was occurring,” Brown said at a news conference Thursday. Controversy over the use of wireless emergency alerts during disasters emerged in California in October when a wildfire ripped through Sonoma County, killing 40 people. Officials decided against sending a wireless alert as the fire raged. Because of the broad reach of the alerts, they said they believed the message would have panicked people who were not in danger and triggered mass evacuations that would have snarled traffic and delayed emergency vehicles. Jim and Alice Mitchell, who were both killed after their Montecito home was swept away when flash floods cascaded through their neighborhood had not left because their house was under a voluntary evacuation order, their daughter, Kelly Weimer said Wednesday. Nearly every home on their block was destroyed. Others were lifted and tossed from their foundation. “They were in a voluntary evacuation area so they figured they were OK,” said Weimer. “They weren’t concerned. It’s not like anybody came around and told them to leave.” Officials said that generally when mandatory evacuation orders are issued, there is an imminent threat to life or property. For areas with voluntary warnings, the threat still exists but it is in the near future. Santa Barbara officials defended their decision not to issue a mandatory evacuation order for the area hit hardest by the storm. “This isn’t an exact science in terms of actually defining where something is going to happen,” Brown said.

,"LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A new storm moved into Southern California Saturday, bringing heavy rain and winds, shutting down roads and freeways, threatening mud and debris flows in recent burn areas and prompting a flash flood warning for part of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
Coastal and valley areas received more than 1 inch of rain per hour during peak rainfall, according to the National Weather Service. 
In the recent Woolsey Fire burn area, officials issued mandatory evacuation orders for Seminole Springs Mobile Home Estates in Agoura Hills and Paseo Canyon Malibu West in Malibu. Evacuation centers were set up at the Agoura Hills/Calabasas Community Center, Santa Monica High School, and Pepperdine University in Malibu. 
The 5 Freeway was closed in both directions for a few hours Saturday at Sheldon Street in Sun Valley due to flooding. As of 4 p.m., the southbound I-5 was still closed at Sheldon, and the two right lanes of the northbound 170 Freeway were closed at Sherman Way.

A flash flood advisory was issued through Sunday morning for the recent Woolsey Fire burn area. 
``Given 1-3 inches of rain across (parts of Southern California) roughly 48 hours ago, along with the presence of a few recent burn scars, flash flooding, mudslides and debris flows appear likely,'' the NWS said earlier. ``This is a very dangerous situation for the terrain of Southern California sensitive to heavy rain impacts.'' 
Caltrans tweeted: ``Do not try to pass through flood waters. 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock over an adult, 12 inches of rushing water will carry away a small car, and 2 feet of rushing water will carry away most vehicles. Be smart. Be safe.'' 
The city of Burbank issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents of Country Club Drive above Via Montana, beginning at 5 a.m. Saturday and continuing through at least 4 p.m. By Saturday afternoon, Walnut Avenue east of Sunset Canyon, and Harvard Road east of Bel Aire Drive, were closed to all except residents. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power tweeted at 1:17 p.m. that crews were working on restoring power in many areas of the city, including Hollywood, mid-Wilshire, Brentwood, San Pedro, Toluca Lake, Reseda and Studio City. 
Los Angeles Fire Department officials reported the evacuation of two homes on Courtney Avenue in the Hollywood Hills due to mudflow, pending a new assessment by city inspectors. The homes previously were yellow tagged from a Jan. 17 mudslide. 
Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia announced on its web site that the park was closed Saturday due to inclement weather. Disneyland announced that its main park in Anaheim would close at 10 p.m. instead of midnight. 
A winter storm warning was in effect through early Sunday evening for the Los Angeles County mountains, excluding the Santa Monica Range. 
The snow level was expected to be at 7,000 to 7,500 feet through Saturday morning and drop to around 6,000 feet by evening, to between 5,000 and 5,500 feet Sunday, according to an NWS statement. 
Disruptions were also expected at lower elevations, including ``significant wind impacts possible for Interstate 5 near the Grapevine, where very strong gusts of 70 to 80 mph will be possible.'' 
The bad weather was blamed for two vehicle accidents on the northbound 5 Freeway at Pyramid Lake, near the L.A. County/Kern County line, which sent nine people to the hospital and claimed the life of a search-and-rescue team member with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department

CBS/AP,"LOS ANGELES -- Authorities were keeping a wary eye Friday on fire-scarred Southern California hillsides after a storm brought flooding fears and prompted evacuation orders for hundreds of homes, some of which were later downgraded to voluntary. Thursday's second storm in a week dropped record-breaking rains on downtown Los Angeles, jammed major roads and sent an airliner skidding off a runway, but no major injuries were reported. Evacuations were ordered for areas of Orange and Riverside counties ravaged by a summer wildfire. Black, surging torrents choked with downed trees and mud swept down channels near homes and in one case swept across a bridge and took out a guardrail. Other areas saw foot-deep mud or water. No homes were seriously damaged. Even though the storm eased by nightfall, evacuation orders for hundreds of homes in Trabuco Canyon in the Santa Ana Mountains south of Los Angeles and for a few neighborhoods in the Lake Elsinore area east of Los Angeles remained in place overnight. Other Lake Elsinore areas had their mandatory evacuation orders downgraded to voluntary evacuation warnings late Thursday night, although fire officials said there was still a potential for dangerous conditions and urged residents to remain vigilant. Also in Lake Elsinore, firefighters worked into the night lining a street with sandbags to protect homes. A mudslide shut down the Pacific Coast Highway and surrounding roads in and around Malibu neighborhoods charred by another fire last month that destroyed hundreds of homes.

But when heavy rains arrived, mud, water and rocks blasted through the bags and across their properties. Kotler, who wielded water hoses to beat back the flames in November, used a tractor to keep the debris from entering his home. ""Saving my house once again,"" said Kotler, 57, a lifelong Malibu resident. ""I'm more than a little concerned. If we get another blast of heavy rain there'll be no stopping the hill from coming down."" At Hollywood Burbank Airport, about 15 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, nobody was hurt when a Southwest Airlines plane from Oakland skidded off a wet runway as it landed. The plane came to a stop in a graded area designed to slow aircraft that overshoot the runway, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California sorely need rainfall. Virtually the entire region is experiencing drought conditions, with portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties and areas along the Mexican border in extreme drought. The storm provided a big boost in and around Los Angeles. The downtown area set a new rainfall record for the day with 1.9 inches, nearly double the previous mark set in 1997, the National Weather Service reported. Normal monthly rainfall for December is only a bit more - 2.33 inches. Elsewhere, fire crews had to rescue a man from the flood-swollen Los Angeles River, a concrete flood control channel, and helped motorists to safety in several areas where cars became stuck in flooded intersections. While rain caused numerous accidents and backups on L.A.-area freeways, heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley. The hours-long shutdown along the key north-south route caused backups for miles. Motorists were urged to use caution on mountain passes, where up to 6 feet of snow was predicted at higher elevations. Forecasters said the end of the storm would be followed by a ridge of high pressure that will bring dry and warm conditions to the area through the weekend, but another storm system could move in early next week.",Mandatory evacuations remain in several areas after second storm in week brought record-breaking downpours,2018-12-07T09:14:38Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}","Mudslides, flooding still feared after heavy rain in wildfire-scorched SoCal areas",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southern-california-malibu-los-angeles-mudslides-flooding-still-feared-after-heavy-rain-wildfire-scorched-socal-areas-today-2018-12-07/,https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/07/ff9054eb-1eb7-474c-888c-e238f5de2cd2/thumbnail/1200x630/3adb7f25d98d9be4470a42e285872290/malibu-mud-120618.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,mudflow,1
"Jane Bracher, for CNN","In one of the most disaster-prone regions on the planet, a new city has been designed specifically to withstand natural calamities -- and it's being built using remnants of a major disaster. The Philippines has begun building a ""back-up"" city, from where government offices can still function should capital Manila succumb to a natural disaster such as an earthquake. The proposed metropolis, located 100 kilometers north of Manila, is called New Clark City. With plans to cover 9,450 hectares, it will be bigger than Manhattan and could accommodate as many as 1.2 million people. As well as being able to withstand typhoons, flooding, and earthquakes -- inevitable parts of life for a country located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic and volcanic activity -- the city aims to be pollution-free. But how does it intend to achieve such a lofty goal? Vivencio Dizon, president of government owned and controlled Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), which is spearheading the project, says one key is to minimize traffic pollution. Large areas of the city will be pedestrianized, and a river walkway will run right through the city. Efficient mass transportation is planned, to reduce the need for cars. ""When we build this city, we are building for people, we're not building for cars. It's a big difference,"" Dizon tells CNN. He says public utilities will use greener energy sources, such as solar power, liquefied natural gas and waste-to-energy facilities. Buildings will be designed to use little energy. The planners also intend to preserve the natural landscape of the area, retaining its river and avoiding cutting down trees. They're also taking a more unusual approach -- using a unique, locally sourced building material called lahar, which Dizon says will form the ""main fabric"" of the city's infrastructure to make it more sustainable. Lahar is a term used to describe a violent volcanic mudflow that cascades down volcanoes and comes to rest in a valley. It contains rocks, debris and ash, and solidified lahars are found in many areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano, located less than 40km from New Clark City. Dizon says lahar will be combined with concrete to construct all the buildings. Dutch architect Matthijs Bouw, who was asked to review an early version of the city master plan, says the production of concrete can take huge amounts of energy and water and create a lot of pollution from particulate matter released into the atmosphere. But he adds that using lahar in place of some of the concrete, doesn't necessarily mean a lower environmental impact. Bouw says New Clark City's green planning will go a long way to ensuring pollution levels in the city will be ""drastically different and much lower"" compared with other Asian cities. Central to New Clark City's disaster resilience is its location. It is on a much higher elevation than Manila, making it less vulnerable to flooding, says Dizon. The city will further implement wide drainage systems and ""no-build zones"" to mitigate any flooding that may occur. It is also surrounded by a nearby mountain range that could protect it against strong winds from typhoons. While Manila is vulnerable to earthquakes and sits on a massive valley fault system that could move any day, Dizon says experts have confirmed New Clark City does not have any fault lines close to it. But Kelvin Rodolfo, professor of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois in Chicago, tells CNN: ""All of the Philippines is subject to earthquake risks. It is a serious misconception that only areas close to faults are at risk."" New Clark City's proximity to the Mount Pinatubo volcano could be a cause for concern. The volcano is infamous for its last catastrophic eruption in 1991, the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, but experts say another big eruption isn't expected for hundreds of years. The name New Clark City alludes to its location within the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone, a former military area for American and Filipino forces. The first of at least five phases of building the city will cost the government and private funders nearly $2 billion, according to Dizon. Construction has already started, with a sports complex, government buildings and housing for government employees expected to be up and running in time for the Southeast Asian Games, which are being held in the Philippines in December 2019, says Dizon. The first phase is expected to be completed by 2022 but it will take at least 30 years to finish, he adds. It's an enormous undertaking, but Dizon does not believe the ambitions for New Clark City are too grand. ""That's the worst kind of attitude we Filipinos could have,"" says Dizon.

"Associated Press, By Associated Press","KARANGASEM, Indonesia — Authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the Indonesian island's international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. A mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar was filmed moving down the volcano's slopes. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency raised the alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous maximum of 7.5 kilometers. It said in a statement that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses are being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. He told Indonesian television on Monday morning that he did not expect a big eruption but added ""we have to stay alert and anticipate."" The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their made to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

"Matt Hamilton, Joseph Serna","When the Thomas fire swept down from the Los Padres National Forest and took aim at this coastal town in December, the looming disaster was impossible to miss. Powerful winds picked up, smoke shielded the sun and brought an eerie darkness to the landscape, and towers of flames could be seen in the distance. Thousands of residents fled as what would become the largest fire on record in California pushed to the Pacific Ocean. Dozens of homes were lost in the Montecito area, but no one died. The mudslides that followed the fire this week were a much more stealthy and ultimately lethal threat. Though residents had been warned about heavy rain and potential debris flows, many took the threat far less seriously than the fires. And when the earth started moving, there was nowhere to run. Rethinking mudslide response The Montecito mudslides killed at least 17 people, with five still missing, making it the deadliest flooding event in California in decades. It’s likely to spark rethinking about how government agencies handle evacuations and warnings about the coming threat. Many of those killed lived in areas that were under only voluntary evacuation orders because officials didn’t believe the mudslides would travel so far south toward the ocean. The destruction in Montecito underscores how little margin of error there is in dealing with a mudslide because once a debris flow begins, it’s extremely difficult to get out of the the way, said Richard Rudman, vice chairman of the California Emergency Alert System. Some unofficial estimates have placed the mudflow at 20 mph, faster than most people could run. And many residents had no idea the mud was coming their way until it slammed into their homes. “This is not a fire that you can watch slowly and see if it’s coming,” said Jeff Gater, Satan Barbara County’s emergency manager. “It’s going to come during the dark. You’re not going to be able to see it. It happened exactly that way.” First-responders agreed, saying that by the time the 911 calls started rolling it, there was little they could do. ""The event happened. People were just gone. It was the middle of the night so there weren’t witnesses saying, 'I saw people getting swept away. Send help,' "" said Andy Rupp, a firefighter with the Montecito Fire Protection District. When firefighters reached the scene, the depth of the disaster was staggering. “When you look at mud, it’s 20 feet high,"" said Montecito Fire Capt. Ben Hauser. County officials have defended their preparation for the mudslides, pointing to extensive outreach in days before the rains hit. Voluntary evacuations in hard-hit areas Santa Barbara County issued mandatory evacuation orders for about 7,000 people living north of Highway 192 in areas closer to where the Thomas fire had burned. Voluntary orders were issued for 23,000 others as the storm approached. Many residents in both zones disregarded the warnings and stayed in their homes. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the evacuation maps were created by a group of local, state and federal emergency and water officials. The zones mirrored the evacuation areas the county used for the Thomas fire. They knew the rains would be bad. The totals — more than 2 inches — hit the National Weather Service estimates. But the rain fell in much more intense bursts than expected, creating a once-in-200-years event that caused burn areas to dissolve into walls of mud and debris. “The really sad part in all this is they were spot-on in terms of prediction that there was going to be an incident,"" Brown said. ""The difficultly really comes in the fact that what they said was going to occur actually did occur. It just occurred much more intensely than what was anticipated."" Indeed, fire and emergency response officials reviewed maps before the mudslides that showed with remarkable accuracy how a devastating mudflow would cover neighborhoods down to the 101 Freeway and beach. The maps were created from water data from the County of Santa Barbara and were circulating at least a day before the mudflows came, said Montecito Fire Protection District Battalion Chief Scott Chapman. The maps showed what epic 100-year and 500-year floods could do to Montecito. Chapman said the flooding and flows foretold by the map are mostly accurate, with the exception of a small patch of homes by the 101 Freeway and Montecito Creek, which were not as flooded as the map would have predicted. “Even expecting the worst and planning for the worst, no one expected this,” he added. It’s unclear how much these maps were shared with the public. As the storm got worse early Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service sent out repeated alerts of imminent flash flooding. But for reasons that remain unclear, those bulletins did not reach everyone in the vulnerable areas, county officials said. It wasn’t until 3:50 a.m. Tuesday that Santa Barbara County officials sent an alert through a federal wireless system that buzzes every cellphone within range of a working tower, just like an Amber Alert. By then, the mudflows had begun. Improving the system Rudman said the outcome shows the clear need to improve how agencies and residents prepare for the potential of mudslides. Part of the problem, he said, is that the warnings officials did provide did not get people out of their homes. “The usual measure of effectiveness is what actions it makes people take to protect their homes and lives,” he said. Many mudslide survivors admitted they stayed in their homes because they doubted the rains would cause widespread disaster and that they were unwilling to evacuate again just weeks after fleeing the fires. Jonathan Schwartz, 29, decided not to evacuate — a decision he said was made too casually. When the rain and mud and rock came crashing through his family’s neighborhood along Lilac Drive in Montecito, he felt a singular terror. “You saw the mud start to rise outside and feel the ground shaking,” Schwartz said. He said he was aware of the warnings but that the level of danger didn’t sink in. “They did give people notice,” Schwartz said. “But when people hear ‘flash flood’ they think, ‘water. Maybe we’ll get wet.’ They are not thinking of landslides. “I think nobody predicted the severity. Well, they did,” he added. “We were just cavalier about it.” CAPTION Illinois Sen.

CBS News,"A catastrophic and deadly volcano eruption in Guatemala is affecting more than a million people. The ""Volcan de Fuego,"" or ""volcano of fire,"" exploded just before noon on Sunday. At least 25 people were confirmed dead as of early Monday morning, and authorities said an undetermined number were still missing, potentially trapped beneath thick ash. The blast belched thick black smoke over an area extending all the way to the capital, Guatemala City, about 30 miles away. More than 3,000 people have been evacuated, and Guatemala's president called for a state of emergency to be declared on Sunday night. Rescue operations resumed Monday morning after being suspended overnight due to the dangerous conditions. People living in villages near the volcano didn't have much time or warning to escape the lava flow, reports CBS News correspondent Don Dahler. A volunteer firefighter carries a child after the eruption of the Fuego Volcano, in El Rodeo village, Escuintla department, south of Guatemala City, June 3, 2018. The devastation from Volcan de Fuego was unrelenting. As hot molten lava flowed from the volcano's banks into small towns, people scrambled to escape. For many, it was too late. The charred bodies of several victims were strewn lifeless on the ground. Thick black and gray ash blanketed entire towns. Hundreds of rescue workers rushed in to try to tend to the badly injured and help anyone still alive, but they struggled to reach some of the rural villages. ""The firemen say they can hear people screaming, but they can't go to help them because the mud is blocking the roads,"" AP correspondent Sonia Perez said from one of the hardest hit areas. ""Not everyone from my family escaped,"" said Consuelo Hernandez, who fled up a hillside as the lava advanced. She said others didn't make it and were likely buried behind her. Guatemala's Volcan de Fuego is seen erupting, June 3, 2018. Bystanders recording video on their cell phones caught the moment that a high-rising volcanic mudflow destroyed a highway bridge. They bolted as the molten rock drew closer. Government officials hesitated to call for evacuations when the eruption began. They waited until lava began flowing down the volcano's banks to urge people to leave -- about four hours after the initial blast. The Fuego volcano is one of the most active in Central America. This eruption spewed ash and rock more than 32,000 feet into the air. Sunday's blast was the volcano's second this year, but its most violent in more than 40 years, and the danger is not over. Officials fear the death toll will rise because so many homes are difficult to access. The country is already receiving help from other nations with deliveries of food, blankets and medicine.","At least 25 people are dead, and authorities say an undetermined number are missing after explosive eruption",2018-06-04T10:29:17Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}",Rescue operations underway amid unrelenting devastation of volcano,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guatemala-volcano-volcan-de-fuego-deadly-eruption-2018-6-4/,https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/04/7e66a3bd-ae22-40eb-a415-4596d193e15f/thumbnail/1200x630/21b414c703ed8bacf449c239f0f2b675/ctm-0604-guatemala-volcano-2.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,mudflow,1
James Queally,"The number of people still missing in the wake of a deadly mudslide in Montecito now figures at five, officials said Friday morning. Authorities said late Thursday that roughly 43 people were unaccounted for after heavy rains pounded the Thomas fire burn scar earlier this week and unleashed a torrent of mud, boulders and debris that killed 17 and destroyed scores of homes. The number of missing had grown, officials said, after authorities combed through social media posts and message boards at evacuation shelters. Many of those people have since been reported safe, according to Chris Elms, a spokesman for Cal Fire, but the number of people missing remains fluid. “We’re starting to get to the phase where people are actually calling in and saying, ‘If you’re looking for me, I’m OK,’” Elms said. Rescue efforts will continue Friday in the ravaged community. Elms said emergency crews are still trying to fight their way through roadways made inaccessible by mudflow in the hopes of locating more survivors. “There is still a large area to be searched,” he said. “The mud and the debris is hindering progress, it’s just slow going out there. It continues as a search-and-rescue mission.” The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office released the names of the 17 dead on Thursday, all of whom were Montecito residents. They ranged in age from 3 to 89 years old. They dead were identified as Jonathan Benitez, 10; Kailly Benitez, 3; Martin Cabrera-Munoz, 48; David Cantin, 49; Sawyer Corey, 12; Peter Fleurat, 73; Josephine Gower, 69; John McManigal, 61; Alice Mitchell, 78; James Mitchell, 89; Mark Montgomery, 54; Caroline Montgomery, 22; Marilyn Ramos, 27; Rebecca Riskin, 61; Roy Rohter, 84; Peerawat Sutthithepn, 6; and Richard Taylor, 67.

AFP,"Activity continued overnight with ""energetic lava effusion"", while previously extruded lava was also collapsing on the crater, only to be pushed out again as debris, the state volcanology office said in its latest bulletin. LEGAZPI: The threat of catastrophic mudflows is building on the slopes of an erupting Philippine volcano where nearly 90,000 residents have been moved out of harm’s way, authorities said Tuesday. Mount Mayon has spewed millions of tonnes of ash, rocks, lava and debris in less than three weeks, much of it loosely lodged on its burnt slopes and which experts warn could be dislodged by heavy rain. Activity continued overnight with “energetic lava effusion”, while previously extruded lava was also collapsing on the crater, only to be pushed out again as debris, the state volcanology office said in its latest bulletin. Loud booming sounds, like that of thunder, accompanied the eruptions, an AFP photographer near the mountain said. “The public is strongly advised to be vigilant and desist from entering the eight-kilometre (five-mile) -radius danger zone, and to be additionally vigilant against pyroclastic density currents, lahars, and sediment-laden stream flows,” the bulletin said. Pyroclastic currents are the superheated clouds of gas, ash and other volcanic debris that burn everything in their path as they speed down the slopes of the 2,460-metre (8,070-foot) mountain, located 330 kilometres southeast of Manila. The institute said these materials are building blocks for “lahar” — mammoth debris flows that could find their way into streams and rivers and mow down surrounding communities. An earlier Mayon eruption passed without any casualties in 2006, but four months later a typhoon unleashed an avalanche of volcanic mud from its slopes, killing about 1,000 people. On Saturday the volcanology institute issued its first “lahar” warning on Mayon this year due to incessant rain that is usual in the region at this time of year. A day later the institute made a video recording of lahar flowing down a river near Daraga town south of the volcano, though it did not cause any damage or casualties.

Berkeley Johnson said the two-year-old girl was taken to hospital and suffered an injury to her hip. Rescue efforts are under way in Santa Barbara County for residents trapped by mudslides that overwhelmed an area scorched by wildfires last month. At least 15 people have died and more than two dozen others were injured. ""I don't know how the baby survived,"" Mr Berkeley told the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper. Image copyright Santa Barbara News via Reuters Image caption Fire department workers rescued a woman from a collapsed house in Montecito ""This was an hour of rain, and the house was gone,"" he said of his home in the community of Montecito. Mr Johnson said he and his wife, Karen, heard a baby crying after the flooding had subsided and they managed to climb down from the roof of their swamped home. The pair joined a fireman to dig the toddler out, scooping mud from her mouth before she was taken to hospital. ""Had we not gone over there, I don't think that kid would have [survived]"", he added. More than 50 people have been rescued already but many places are still inaccessible. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and media mogul Oprah Winfrey. Ms Winfrey said on Instagram that her property sustained only minor damage as she toured the scene. The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been burned by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) says the risk of flooding stays ""significantly higher"" for up to five years after a wildfire. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. In some places mud was waist-deep, officials said. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Those who have stayed in the area have been warned to boil their tap water before drinking it. Image copyright EPA Image caption Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said that five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito, possibly as a result of the storm. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights would be grounded. This comes after a record-setting year of $306bn (£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California has suffered severe drought in five out of six of the past years. In December, California Governor Jerry Brown said the state was ""facing a new reality"" as climate change meant wildfires could erupt ""every year or every few years"".

Sputnik,"Almost 2,000 years after Pompeii was buried by ash and rock spewed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, archaeologists have discovered a fresco illustrating a sensual scene between the Roman god Jupiter (disguised as a swan) and Leda, a Spartan queen in Greek mythology. The vividly colored fresco, which was found in a bedroom in the remains of the ancient Roman city Friday, shows Leda protecting the swan with her cloak as it sits on her lap. ""The scene — Full of Sensuality — depicts the union of Jupiter, transformed into a swan, and Leda, wife of King Tyndareus,"" the Pompeii Archaeological Site wrote in a Facebook post Monday. ""From her embraces, first with Jupiter and then Tyndareus, would be born the twins Castor and Pollux from an egg (the Dioscuri), Helen — the future wife of King Menelaus of Sparta and cause of the Trojan War — and Clytemnestra, later bride (and assassin) of King Agamemnon of Argos and brother to Menelaus,"" the post says. According to Greek mythology, the Greek god Zeus fathered Leda's children. Pompeii Archaeological Park Director Massimo Osanna commended the fresco's creativity; it was painted in such a way to make it appear as though Leda is looking at whomever enters the bedroom. The bedroom is located near the corridor close to the entranceway of an upscale domus, which is the type of house occupied by the upper class in ancient Rome. ""Leda watches the spectator with a sensuality that's absolutely pronounced,"" Osanna recently told Italian news agency ANSA, also adding that the fresco depicts the Greek ""myth of love, with an explicit sensuality in a bedroom where, obviously beside sleep, there could be other activities."" Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis and Stabiae under ash and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow.

JP Research,"According to the companys press release, earlier this month, Vales (VALE) Board of Directors received from the state and federal prosecutors a recommendation to consider the dismissal of some company executives and employees following the accident in Feijão dam.
The Board held meetings on the next day with the companys executives, during which it immediately accepted requests by those same executives for temporary removal from office. The new executive team is regarded as experienced and will likely be well received by the market.
Vale is a profitable company with a strong cash flow generation profile and a solid asset base. However, theres now more risk to the story emerging from potential liabilities occurring from the accident. With the lack of significant upside and catalysts, we prefer to stay on the sidelines.
Feijão dam disaster
The Feijão dam disaster occurred on 25 January 2019 when Córrego do Feijão iron ore mine's Dam I breached in Minas Gerais state. Vale owned the dam, and this is the second accident in less than four years in which the company is involved. In 2015, the Mariana dam disaster killed 19 people and destroyed the village of Bento Rodrigues.
The mudflow from the dam advanced over houses in a rural area. As a result, at least 186 people were confirmed dead, and 122 were considered missing. Most victims were Vales employees, said Fabio Schvartsman, Vales CEO, in a press conference.
Vale was fined R$250 million by The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, one day after the failure and judicial authorities have also frozen R$11 billion of Vale's assets.
The workday after the accident, Vales stock price fell 24%, losing R$71.3 billion (US$19 billion) in market capitalization, the biggest single-day loss in the history of the Brazilian stock market, surpassing the time when Petróbras lost more than R$47 billion, in May last year. Fitch Ratings downgraded Vale's debt to a rating of BBB-, on that same day.
Executives dismissal
The Federal and Minas Gerais state Public Prosecution Offices along with the Federal Police issued the recommendation No. 11/2019 with considerations on the dismissal of several of Vales executives and employees. After the announcement, Vale had ten days to deliver a decision.
Following the issue, Fábio Schvartsman (CEO), Gerd Peter Poppinga (Executive Director of Ferrous and Coal), Lucio Flavio Gallon Cavalli (Head of Planning and Development of Ferrous and Coal) and Silmar Magalhães Silva (Head of Operations of the Southeast Corridor) voluntarily requested their temporary removal from office, which the Board accepted immediately. Luciano Siani, CFO, remains in office.
As part of the interim succession plan, the Board appointed Eduardo de Salles Bartolomeo (currently Executive Director of Base Metals) as CEO, Claudio de Oliveira Alves (current Head of Pellet and Manganese) will hold the position of Executive Director of Ferrous and Coal and Mark Travers (Head of Legal, Institutional Relations and Sustainability of Base Metals) will be the new Executive Director of Base Metals.
It isnt clear yet if Mr. Bartolomeo will be holding the position permanently since the board has hired recent CEOs from outside of the company. Mr. Bartolomeo is less familiar to the markets but is an experienced name in the industry. Having worked over a decade at Vale and previously holding several executive positions in other companies, he is the logical internal choice.
We expect Mr. Bartolomeo to be well received by the market and capital allocation strategy to remain unchanged.
Conclusion
While Vale remains a low leverage name with a quality asset base and a strong cash flow generation profile, the recent developments add uncertainties over Vales investment case. The Brumadinho tragedy should result in higher scrutiny from the government going forward, possible regulatory changes and potential liabilities. Additionally, we expect iron ore prices to remain low in the long-term.
In summary, we think: 1) Iron ore prices remain lower for longer, 2) strong cash generation offset by uncertainty around potential liabilities from the dam accident and higher capex, and 3) The current valuation discount could increase as we get more color around potential liabilities. 
With that in mind, we consider theres no significant upside to the stock at these levels that justifies taking a position with increased risk.
Potential risks to our view include China steel output growth surprising to the upside and leading to higher-than-expected IO prices, higher quality premiums on higher grade ores, Vale having to make lower than expected payments for the Feijão accident and BRL depreciation.

"Faith Karimi and Steve Almasy, CNN","Rescuers plan to search several areas again Friday Dozens remain unaccounted for despite days of frantic searches (CNN) The grueling search efforts following a mudslide in Southern California enter a third day Friday, with authorities scouring piles of murky debris again as the window to find survivors narrows. Rescuers plan to search several areas for a second time, hoping to find victims in structures previously searched in the immediate aftermath of the mudslide. The mudslide killed at least 17 people and destroyed dozens of homes. Those killed were between ages 3 and 89, and all lived in Santa Barbara County, authorities said. Dozens remain unaccounted for despite days of frantic searches by rescuers after rivers of mud and boulders flooded through communities in Montecito, demolishing homes and leaving roads impassible. ""In disaster circumstances, there have been many miraculous stories of people lasting many days. We certainly are searching for a miracle right now,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. ""But realistically, we suspect that we are going to continue to have discovery of people who were killed in this incident."" The number of people missing in and around the oceanside community of Montecito was in flux Thursday, with Brown saying it could be as high as 43. Authorities have not confirmed that many people are unaccounted for, he said, but are looking into reports from phone calls, social media and message boards. ""It doesn't mean that they (the 43 people) are all actively missing,"" he said. ""We certainly hope there are going to be far fewer than that. We hope there's not going to be any more."" Evacuation zone increased The immediate areas where at least 17 people were killed are under mandatory evacuation, and officials increased the size of the evacuation zone Thursday. ""We know that this a terribly inconvenient development but it is also incredibly necessary,"" Brown said. ""This entire area is a very active rescue and recovery and repair zone right now,"" he said. He said the zone, which includes areas formerly under voluntary evacuation advisories, would be in effect for one week, but residents should plan for two. Rescue workers are using helicopters and all-terrain vehicles in a search hampered by blocked roads and downed trees and power lines. Billy Grokenberger lived in a part of Montecito that was under a voluntary evacuation order. He and his parents put belongings in their three cars, in case they decided to leave before the storm. They didn't. ""We had thought about leaving, but we had just had the fires... we didn't take it serious(ly) enough,"" he said. On the morning of the storm, he watched as 2 to 3 feet of water streamed down the street. ""(In) four minutes the water was through our wall and in our house, almost to the second story,"" he said. ""The house is destroyed, but you know, there's just so many others who are less fortunate. But we just feel lucky that we were able to get out and (are) alive,"" he said. Risk of mudflow for years The storm hit hard between 3 and 6 a.m. Tuesday. The rain poured down on hillsides charred by recent wildfires, which burned vegetation that otherwise could make the terrain more resistant to mudslides. The Thomas Fire -- the largest wildfire in California's recorded history -- has burned more than 281,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties since it began in early December. It's still burning. Geologists and forecasters warned that intense rain could trigger deadly mudslides from the scorched areas. And because of the fire, communities below the scarred terrain could remain at risk of mudflow for years, said Randall Jibson, a research geologist with the US Geological Survey. Mudflows, mudslides and landslides often are used interchangeably when disaster strikes, but the terms have distinctions. A mudflow is ""a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas,"" according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""Other earth movements, such as landslide, slope failure or a saturated soil mass moving by liquidity down a slope, are not mudflows,"" it says. Montecito may be at slightly less risk now, because this week's flooding already brought down vulnerable material. ""(But) no storm brings down everything that is susceptible. There's almost always more"" that could come down, he said. Montecito and Carpinteria are especially vulnerable to mudslides because the steep terrain in some places goes from thousands of feet above sea level to sea level in just a few miles, said Tom Fayram, a deputy public works director with Santa Barbara County. CNN's Paul Vercammen, Lindsay Benson, Darran Simon, Joe Sutton, Dave Alsup, Stella Chan and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","The grueling search efforts following a mudslide in Southern California enter a third day Friday, with authorities scouring piles of murky debris again as the window to find survivors narrows.",2018-01-12T08:04:01Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",California mudslides: Search 'for a miracle' enters 3rd day,http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/us/southern-california-mudslides/index.html,http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180112011447-santa-barbara-county-fire-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,mudflow,1
Juliana Rose Pignataro,"Severe rainstorms sparked mudslides and flooding in Southern California Tuesday, killing at least five people. The situation was particularly bad in Montecito and Carpenteria, where some residents were reported trapped and others missing. Pictures and videos from the region showed debris littered where homes stood, while muddy runoff filled roadways. Search and rescue teams were deployed to search for missing people amid the damage. Santa Barbara County Fire Department public information officer Mike Eliason posted multiple pictures of the devastating scene Tuesday on social media, showing rescue dogs searching for people and rescue workers sifting through muddy debris. Eliason described the mudflows at one point as “waist high,” according to the Los Angeles Times. “Heavy rains have triggered massive runoff in the Montecito area,” Eliason posted on Twitter Tuesday. “Multiple rescues from vehicles and structures are underway. Access is difficult/delayed due to some locations- waist deep mudflow, trees, and wires down. Avoid the area.” The five deaths were reported in Montecito and Carpenteria. In Montecito, a community of about 8,000 on the coast, some homes were washed away by the floods. Recent wildfires burned through immense swaths of vegetation, leaving the land especially vulnerable to severe flooding and mudslides. In Montecito, firefighters worked for hours to rescue a 14-year-old girl trapped beneath the debris of a home, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reported. The firefighters were able to successfully free the girl. Another man was rescued from mud that reached up to his neck, according to KEYT-TV. A portion of the 101 Freeway was closed after an immense mudslide swept over the roadway. Officials had not yet released an estimate of how many people they believed were missing or trapped, or how many homes had been damaged or destroyed. They had also not yet released the cause of death for those who died. “It’s going to be worse than anyone imagined for our area,” Eliason said, according to the LA Times. “Following our fire, this is the worst case scenario.”","Severe rainstorms sparked mudslides and flooding in Southern California Tuesday, killing at least five people.

Associated Press,"KARANGASEM, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the island’s international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometers (7 1/2 miles) away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano’s alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7 1/2 kilometers. It said a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. “Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,” he said. “If needed we will forcibly evacuate them.” About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater “will certainly spill over to the slopes,” Sutopo said. The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation center. “We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,” she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano’s alert was at the highest level for several weeks but it didn’t erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. “If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I’ll just accept it if our house is destroyed,” she said. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transiting flights. China said there were 17,000 Chinese tourists on Bali before the latest eruption. The Chinese consulate said on its website that airlines and travel services were arranging 100 buses to take Chinese tourists to catch ferries to neighboring Java. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. “We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they’re not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,” said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen, who was stranded at Bali’s airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption. The agency’s chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia’s tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night’s free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano, and soldiers and police distributed masks over the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to school. Indonesia sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung’s alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the mountain, which prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity, but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

EMILIANO RODRIGUEZ MEGA,"NEW YORK (AP) — Guatemala’s Volcano of Fire erupted over the weekend, spewing deadly clouds and rivers of ash and pulverized rock. It is one of 11 active volcanoes in the Central America country that is along the so-called Ring of Fire. Some questions and answers about the volcano: HOW BIG IS IT? At its peak, the volcano is 12,346 feet (3,763 meters) above sea level. It’s an example of one of the tallest and most violent types of volcanoes in the world, its steep sides made out of accumulated layers of lava and ash. The volcano is 27 miles (44 kilometers) west of Guatemala City and only about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the colonial city of Antigua, one of Guatemala’s most popular tourist destinations. HOW ACTIVE IS IT? This volcano is probably the most active in Guatemala, according to the country’s National Institute for Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. Records of activity go back to the 1500s and recent reports show that the volcano has been continuously erupting since 2002. Before Sunday’s eruptions, the most recent event began May 17, when a mudflow of water and rocks started moving down the slope of the volcano, followed by explosions and ash plumes that rose almost 3,300 feet (1 kilometer). The eruptions continued for at least four days but were much smaller than Sunday’s major eruption, which reached almost 15,000 feet (4.5 kilometers). WAS THERE A WARNING? Authorities say they were closely monitoring the volcano after activity picked up around 6 a.m. Sunday. But there was no indication that any eruption would be any worse than previous ones, and no evacuations were ordered. The disaster agency Conred issued standard precautions, telling people to wear face masks and cover their food and water supply. A powerful explosion about 2 p.m. sent a river of red-hot ash and rock down the volcano’s flanks. “It traveled much faster. It arrived in communities right when the evacuation alerts were being generated,” Conred spokesman David de Leon said. WHAT IS THE RING OF FIRE? It’s a horseshoe-shaped region surrounding the Pacific Ocean that stretches from South America, up the western coast of North America, and rounds to Japan, the Philippines and New Zealand. Along a series of fault lines, it contains about three-quarters of the world’s active volcanoes. While it’s called a ring, Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University in West Virginia, says the volcanoes are not really connected. The eruption of one of them will not set off its neighbors, she said. IS HAWAII’S KILAUEA VOLCANO DIFFERENT? Yes, Kilauea is a different kind of volcano. It started as an underwater volcano and built itself up with continuous lava flows that formed a shield-like shape with gentle slopes. Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983. It’s not in the Ring of Fire and the possibility that it may have triggered Guatemala’s Volcano of Fire is extremely small, according to Krippner. It’s very rare for one volcano to trigger another, she said. ___ AP reporter E.

Adam Harvey,"Updated November 28, 2017 09:49:11 About 150,000 people will leave their homes on the slopes of Mount Agung, Bali's Governor says, as the volcano's eruptions grow more powerful, while the island's main airport will close for another 24 hours due to ashfall. Key points: The evacuations will cover people living within 10 kilometres of the crater Disaster officials say people will be forcibly evacuated if needed 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers Governor Made Pastika said the evacuation period for people living within 10 kilometres of the crater could easily last as long as a month. Indonesia's disaster management agency said the evacuation is so far orderly and without panic. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 meters into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes.

Flights grounded again Bali's Ngurah Rai airport will be closed for a further 24 hours, after being closed on Monday morning due to falling volcanic ash. The airport said it will reassess the situation on Wednesday morning. Spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled on Monday, stranding about 59,000 travellers. Another 30,000 passengers will be unable to leave via plane after today's closure. The airport's closure is having a disruptive effect on flights around Indonesia and the region. Bali is a hub airport in Indonesia with many flights transiting there for domestic as well as international destinations. Planes that would have flown other routes on Monday were stuck on the tarmac in Bali. Human Rights Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono said he was waiting for two hours at Jakarta's terminal 3 for his delayed flight to a domestic destination. He said other flight delays had been announced at the terminal, which serves national carrier Garuda, and the departure area was filling up with many waiting passengers. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption. The agency's chief said major ferry crossing points had been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. About 500 passengers have so far moved on to airports on the island of Java, but most are remaining on Bali and hoping the airport will resume operations. Indonesia's Tourism Ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association would provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure.

Belinda Smith,"Early humans called the Philippines home as far back as 700,000 years ago — and it appears they had an appetite for rhinoceros, according to newly discovered fossils. key points Key points: Stone tools and animal remains, including a nearly a complete ancient rhino skeleton, were found on the island of Luzon in the Philippines The fossils were dated to around 700,000 years old, which pre-dates modern humans How these early humans and animals arrived at the island is unknown, but they may have been carried across by a tsunami Hundreds of stone tools and animal bones, including the best part of a rhino skeleton showing signs of butchering, were unearthed on the island of Luzon. Published in the journal Nature today, they push the date of human occupation in the archipelago back hundreds of thousands of years. Precisely who these rhino-eating colonisers were remains a mystery, said study co-author Gert van den Bergh, a palaeontologist at the University of Wollongong, but there's little chance they were of our species, Homo sapiens. ""This remains speculative because we don't have fossils yet, but the dates pre-date modern humans,"" he said. Even without fossils of the toolmakers themselves, the work fits in with evidence of early humans on nearby South-East Asian islands of Flores — home of Homo floresiensis or the Hobbit — and Sulawesi, according to Gilbert Price, a palaeontologist at the University of Queensland who was not involved with the study. ""The original story for human evolution was very basic, that maybe there was one single migration into places like South-East Asia, but it's becoming so much more complicated now,"" Dr Price said. Food scraps and utensils The new fossil haul isn't the first to be found on Luzon: a US team found animal bones and stone tools back in the 1950s. From these, palaeontologists suspected humans colonised the Philippines back in the Middle Pleistocene, between around 780,000 and 120,000 years ago. But without accurate dating, they couldn't be sure. So the firmest earliest date for the human occupation in the Philippines was pegged at around 67,000 years ago, thanks to a foot bone belonging to a Homo species found in a cave in Luzon's north. In 2013, a team of palaeontologists including Dr van den Bergh, knowing that fossils had been found in the area before, started excavating in a valley in the neighbouring Kalinga province. ""For the first couple of weeks, we didn't see much,"" Dr van den Bergh said. ""But we kept going, and not long after, bingo! Nearly a whole rhinoceros skeleton."" Three-quarters, in fact — the most intact skeleton found of the now-extinct Rhinoceros philippinensis. Intriguingly, 13 of its bones showed clear cut marks. Two leg bones looked like they had been smashed — one was completely shattered — presumably to get at the marrow inside. The team also found other animal remains alongside stone tools, including an extinct elephant called the stegodon, deer and monitor lizards. To find out how old their finds were, the researchers enlisted the help of labs to deduce the age of the sediment surrounding the artefacts, as well as directly dating a rhino tooth. Volcanic minerals gave a maximum age of 1 million years. The tooth and sediment grains turned up dates of around 700,000 years, plus or minus 70,000. Taken together, the researchers wrote, ""it follows that the rhinoceros skeleton was buried by a mudflow"" at least 631,000 years ago. Who butchered the rhino and how did they get there? Given Homo sapiens has only been around for a few hundred thousand years, the most likely Luzon-dweller is Homo erectus, according to Dr van den Bergh. Unfortunately, without fossilised bones belonging to the mystery rhino-eaters, there's no way to identify them. Their tools were a standard run-of-the-mill style, produced by many Homo species around the world. Ancient DNA isn't a viable route either. The heat and humidity of the tropics degrade it quickly, Dr van den Bergh said. So the team is continuing to excavate and hopefully find remains of those elusive toolmakers. The work not only shows that humans were around a lot earlier than thought, and probably migrated in waves rather than in one big hit, but it also has interesting implications about how they got there, Dr Price said. During past millennia, various ice ages dropped sea levels, so it may have been possible to walk to some islands of the Philippines — but not Luzon, which is surrounded by deep water. ""The only way for land animals to get over is to float or swim, and they probably didn't do it deliberately,"" he said. One method of ""accidental dispersal"" is being picked up and washed across by a tsunami. ""You can't say these early people took purposeful sea voyages on boats or anything like that — there's no evidence for that at all,"" Dr Price said.

"Associated Press, By Associated Press","KARANGASEM, Indonesia — Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the island's international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. Video released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7.5 kilometers. It said in a statement that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses are being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. He told Indonesian television on Monday morning that he did not expect a big eruption but added ""we have to stay alert and anticipate."" The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their made to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

"Benjamin Oreskes, Shelby Grad","Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter.

By Associated Press Reporter,"The death toll has hit 39 from a powerful earthquake that struck the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido last week. One person remained missing in the town of Atsuma, where multiple landslides triggered by the quake slammed into houses at the foot of steep hills. Rescue workers used diggers and shovels to search for the missing in a tangle of dirt, fallen trees and the rubble of homes left by the landslides. All but four of the victims were from Atsuma, a community of 4,600 people. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the Kiyota ward on the eastern edge of Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido. In some parts of Kiyota, the earth liquefied and sank as much as a metre, tilting houses, cracking roads and unleashing a mudflow that solidified and trapped vehicles in car parks. The magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck before daybreak on Thursday and knocked out power and train service across Hokkaido, home to 5.4 million people. It took two days to restore electricity to most households. A few hundred were still without power on Sunday, mostly in Atsuma.

"James Queally, Hailey Branson-Potts","The death toll from a massive debris flow that buried homes and cars under a torrent of mud and boulders has risen to 15 in Montecito, where local personnel and the U.S. Coast Guard are planning to continue rescue operations Wednesday morning. About 300 people remained stuck in their homes in Montecito’s Romero Canyon neighborhood and authorities planned to launch helicopter rescues at daybreak Wednesday morning. The mudslides began around 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday, when intense rains dislodged boulders and caused heavy mudflow along hillsides that were scarred by the sprawling Thomas fire late last year. A number of homes were ripped from their foundations, with some pulled more than a half-mile by water and mud before they broke apart. “It looked like a World War I battlefield,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said Tuesday. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said on Twitter that the death toll had risen to 15 early Wednesday morning, but could not provide additional details. With much of the area still inaccessible, officials have said they fear that number could rise. It’s unclear how many remain missing, while dozens of residents have been injured, according to officials. Southern California was drenched Tuesday, but nowhere did the rainstorm inflict more pain than in Montecito, just weeks after the community dealt with the devastating Thomas fire. Some 500 firefighters from across the state rushed to help, with crews struggling through clogged roads, waist-deep mud and downed trees throughout the day in search of victims. Dozens of survivors were hoisted to safety in helicopters. The rain overwhelmed the south-facing slopes above Montecito, flooding the creek and sending mud and boulders into residential neighborhoods, officials said. At least 7,000 people have been evacuated from the area. The storm system that hit Southern California beginning Monday dumped more than 5 inches of rain on some parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and officials had been concerned that sections of the state damaged by last month’s wildfires would be susceptible to heavy mudflows. Soil scorched by fire is less able to absorb water. Mudflows washed out a nearly 30-mile stretch of the 101 Freeway between Santa Barbara and Ventura, and also prompted evacuations in parts of Burbank and Los Angeles on Tuesday. The heavy weather also caused a surge in motor vehicle accidents across the Southland, according to the California Highway Patrol. But Santa Barbara County clearly took the brunt of the damage, where mud, boulders, husks of cars and housing frames were common sights. The section of Montecito that was hit hardest was actually south of the Thomas fire’s burn scar, and not subject to mandatory evacuation, according to Mike Eliason, public information officer for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. But a creek that feeds the Pacific Ocean swelled early Tuesday morning, raining boulders and flood waters onto residents as they slept. The rains were like a starter’s gun for many in Montecito and nearby Carpinteria. Peter Lapidus said the sound of droplets pummeling his home forced him out of bed around 4 a.m. Tuesday. “It was like a bomb went off,” he said. “It wasn’t raining hard, and then it was like you flipped a switch.” CAPTION Over a dozen people died after a rainstorm sent mud through Montecito neighborhoods Over a dozen people died after a rainstorm sent mud through Montecito neighborhoods CAPTION Former White House advisor Stephen Bannon stepped down from Breitbart News on Tuesday.

https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"What happened?  
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow.  
Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano in continental Europe and is thought to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.  
Every single resident died instantly when the southern Italian town was hit by a 500°C pyroclastic hot surge.
Pyroclastic flows are a dense collection of hot gas and volcanic materials that flow down the side of an erupting volcano at high speed.
They are more dangerous than lava because they travel faster, at speeds of around 450mph (700 km/h), and at temperatures of 1,000°C.
An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. 
Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century.  
His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unaware.
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow
He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night.
People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours.  
While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse.
An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life.  
Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly.
The Orto dei fuggiaschi (The garden of the Fugitives) shows the 13 bodies of victims who were buried by the ashes as they attempted to flee Pompeii during the 79 AD eruption of the Vesuvius volcano
As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge.
While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.
What have they found?
This event ended the life of the cities but at the same time preserved them until rediscovery by archaeologists nearly 1700 years later.
The excavation of Pompeii, the industrial hub of the region and Herculaneum, a small beach resort, has given unparalleled insight into Roman life.
Archaeologists are continually uncovering more from the ash-covered city.
In May archaeologists uncovered an alleyway of grand houses, with balconies left mostly intact and still in their original hues.
A plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79. Around 30,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day
Some of the balconies even had amphorae - the conical-shaped terra cotta vases that were used to hold wine and oil in ancient Roman times.

The Associated Press,"KARANGASEM, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has closed the island’s international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. Video released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. The agency raised the volcano’s alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7.5 kilometers. It said in a statement that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. “Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,” he said. “If needed we will forcibly evacuate them.” About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after ash reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. “We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they’re not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,” said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali’s airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses are being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency’s chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. He told Indonesian television on Monday morning that he did not expect a big eruption but added “we have to stay alert and anticipate.” The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their made to school. Indonesia sits on the “Pacific Ring of Fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung’s alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

Madeline Farber,"At least 19 people have died from the mudslides that swept over parts over Southern California early this week -- impacting the same area that was ravaged in December by the Thomas Fire, the state’s largest wildfire on record that is 100% contained, the U.S. Forest Service announced Friday. Many of the mudslide deaths occurred in Montecito, Santa Barbara County -- an area northwest of Los Angeles that’s home to celebrities such as Ellen DeGeneres, Rob Lowe and Oprah Winfrey, among others. Search and rescue efforts are still underway, Amber Anderson, the public information officer for the Santa Barbara Office of Emergency Services told Fox News. And many people are still missing or unaccounted for, according to a statement from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. ""Right now our assets are focused on determining if anyone is still alive in any of those structures that have been damaged,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said, according to The Associated Press. In addition to the deaths and missing persons, several homes were destroyed from the mudslides, which were sparked after torrential rains caused flash flooding in the Santa Ynez Mountains. The flooding caused mud and debris to slide down from wildfire-charred hillsides that are stripped of vegetation, eventually reaching the communities below. In light of the recent mudslides, here’s what you need to know. Why do mudslides occur? Mudslides, also known as debris flows, are a type of landslide that can occur after a natural disaster, such as a wildfire. Debris flows often contain mud, rock and other materials. “Human modification” of land can also make certain slopes and steep areas “vulnerable to landslides during and after heavy rains,” according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that roughly 25 to 50 people die each year in the United States because of land and mudslides. But mudslides can also occur without a wildfire preceding it, according to Francis Rengers, a research geologist at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the science agency for the Department of Interior. A firefighter stands on the roof of a house submerged in mud and rocks Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018, in Montecito, Calif. (The Associated Press) In this particular case, “you had a large amount of rain and a burn area that didn’t need much to get going in the first place,” Rengers said. A few different factors contribute to debris flows in Southern California, David Peterson, a professor of forest ecology at the University of Washington, told Fox News. The Thomas Fire, which burned more than 280,000 acres and primarily affected Ventura, Montecito, Carpinteria and Santa Barbara Counties, among others, removed “all of the living and dead vegetation that protected the soil beneath,” Peterson said. The land quickly eroded when there was no vegetation to hold it in place. The fire was also hot enough to “cook out” the organic matter in the soil, which helps the earth to absorb water when it rains. “When you have five or more inches of water in a day or two, it doesn’t buffer the impact of the rain on the soil,” he said, adding that the soil also became very hot from the wildfires. This results in the so-called “hydrophobic effect” which causes the soil to repel water. Additionally, different soil texture can also affect the severity of mudslides, Peterson said. As for the current situation, however, Peterson added that “the upper layer of soil got so saturated [by the rain] that it became like Jell-O and just flowed downhill.” Where do they occur? Mudslides typically occur in areas with steep hillsides, gullies and other narrow channels that make it easy for rain, mud and debris to flow through -- much like the terrain in Southern California, Peterson said. These gullies and other passageways form over millions of years. In the West, “the rains always come in the winter, flow downhill and create these big drainages,” he said. While Peterson acknowledged the devastation that the mudslides have caused, he said that occurrence is a “natural phenomena."" While the “spatial extent of this is larger, big mudslides are normal. This has happened for millions of years,” he said. Is there anything that can be done to prevent or stop mudslides? The short answer: no. “There’s nothing to prevent the magnitude of these events,” Peterson said. While dams might catch some of the sediment, he said, the structures wouldn’t be of much use for a mudslide of this size. This aerial photo provided by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department shows mudflow and damage to homes in Montecito, Calif., Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018 (Santa Barbara County Fire Department) It’s currently unclear if the Thomas Fire made the mudslides worse. Peterson suspects not. But Rengers said that the USGS is working on figuring that out. “Basically, the really high rainfall rates are what controlled the really large response that we saw. And the damage inflicted by the debris flows is proportional to the rainfall,” Rengers said. What can people do to protect themselves? Peterson cautioned those who choose to live beneath steep hillsides in Southern California. “There are many homes at the bottom of these steep drainages. But at some point mudslides will happen,” he said. He explained that when people choose to build their homes at the bottom of these steep drainages, they “decide to take on the risk because they think it’s a low probability it [mudslides] will happen to them.” Most of the stucco-style homes that are popular in California don’t have basements or subfloors -- meaning they have relatively little defense against the powerful mudslides. Since many of the stucco homes are placed on top of a cement slab, the soil from the mudslide weighs more than the house. The result? The homes become like “a little boat in the bathtub,” he said. “These are natural risks that people need to think about.” Peterson said that most people would have better luck defending their home from a fire than a mudslide. Indeed: in 2014, debris and mud from a mudslide in Oso, Washington, covered a square mile in roughly 20 seconds, Peterson said. Rengers cautioned people who do have homes in these areas to “heed all evacuation warnings.” “If they don’t evacuate and are stuck, they should try contacting local authorities,” he said. In anticipation of mudslides, California authorities ordered evacuations beneath the burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. But many people ignored the warning until it was too late. Ten to 15 percent of people in a mandatory evacuation area in Santa Barbara County heeded the warning, The Associated Press reported.

RTÉ News,"Indonesia has extended the closure of the airport on Bali as ash from a volcano swept the island, stranding thousands of tourists as authorities tried to persuade villagers to leave their homes near the erupting mountain. ""Aircraft flight channels are covered with volcanic ash,"" the transport ministry said in a statement, citing aviation navigation authorities. Bali's airport, about 60km from the Mount Agung volcano, will be closed until tomorrow morning local time, it said. Frustration at the country's second-busiest airport is starting to boil over, with an estimated 2,000 people attempting to get refunds and reschedule tickets. Ten alternative airports have been prepared for airlines to divert inbound flights, including in neighbouring provinces, the airport operator said, adding it was helping people make alternative bookings and providing food and entertainment for stranded travellers. The airport on Lombok island, to the east of Bali, had been reopened, authorities said, as wind blew ash westward, toward the southern coast of Java island. Agung towers over eastern Bali to a height of just over 3,000 metres. Its last eruption in 1963 killed more than 1,000 people and destroyed several villages when it spewed out pyroclastic material, hot ash, lava and lahar (mudflow). Life went on largely as normal in villages surrounding Agung, with residents offering prayers as the volcano sent columns of ash and smoke into the sky. Some villagers who fled in September, when the alert was last raised to the highest level, have gone home despite government warnings. Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Centre has warned that an eruption of a size similar to that seen in 1963 could send rocks bigger than a fist flying a distance of up to 8km, and volcanic gas a distance of 10km within three minutes. Monitoring has shown the northeastern part of Agung's peak had swollen in recent weeks ""indicating there is fairly strong pressure toward the surface"", the centre said. Despite a similar pattern of volcanic activity to that in 1963, which reached a peak after up to three months of ash emissions, it was not clear how long the current eruption would last, said David Pyle, a professor in earth sciences at OxfordUniversity. ""It remains possible that the eruptive crisis could continue for some time.""","Indonesia has extended the closure of the airport on Bali as ash from a volcano swept the island, stranding thousands of tourists as authorities tried to persuade villagers to leave their homes near the erupting mountain.",2017-11-28T10:36:44Z,"{'id': 'rte', 'name': 'RTE'}",Thousands stranded in Bali as volcano spews ash,https://www.rte.ie/news/asia/2017/1128/923341-indonesia-volcano-agung/,https://img.rasset.ie/000f05e7-1600.jpg,rte,RTE,mudflow,1
Phil Roberts,"Back-up quarterbacks allow football teams to replace their starters in the event of injury. Even if the back-up gets hurt, the team will always have another quarterback to fill the position. With a spare tire, a motorist can rest assured that they will not be left stranded in the event of a flat. But if the whole car were to get completely wrecked, most people would not have a back-up to replace it. The same goes for homes destroyed by natural disasters. In both of those cases, replacement only comes through insurance and that’s far from immediate. If a house cannot be immediately replaced after a natural disaster, what about a city? If something catastrophic happened in Washington D.C., London, or Paris to the point where the city was inoperable, where would the federal establishments in that city continue to function? Most national governments do have back-up plans that would allow them to continue working from a remote location should the capital be devastated. Toyko considered the idea back in 2011, and now, Manila is actually going through with it. At a cost of $2 billion, New Clark City will be home to some 1.2 million residents in the event that a natural disaster makes Manila uninhabitable and inoperable for the government of The Philippines. Only 62 miles north of Manila, New Clark City is indeed a very close back-up, but it will still be disaster proof. If there is an earthquake, none of it structures will crumble. If there is a typhoon, the winds will feel like nothing more than a breeze. When the summer and winter monsoons come, the water will drain out in a way that makes flooding impossible. If the nearby Mount Pinatubo volcano erupts 25 miles away, the hot ash and gases will hardly be a big deal. Of course, this all sounds nice, but it’s all very doubtful. Having a back-up city is not a crazy idea, but claiming that it will also be disaster-proof seems unlikely, no matter how much advanced technology and engineering are being used. After all, even the Titanic sank. Once you get over the incredulity of the idea of a disaster-proof metropolis, New Clark City actually looks like it would be a sustainable place to live. The natural landscape of the surrounding areas is already being preserved as much as possible. The main building material will be locally-sourced lahar, a volcanic mudflow that cools into a type of rock, which in turn can be mixed with concrete. New Clark City is also being planned as a pedestrian and cyclist city first, a mass transit city second, and a vehicular city third. Photovoltaic energy and energy-from-waste will be used to power the city, which will consist of government buildings, housing for public servants, a sports complex, and many other amenities. Why was this location in the country’s Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone chosen for a 23,400-acre back-up city? For one thing, it’s said to be protected from the fierce typhoon winds because of the mountain range around it. The location’s high elevation is also thought to make it flood-proof, not to mention the fact that the area already has an expansive drainage system in place. Sure, there is still the possibility of of an earthquake or Mount Pinatubo erupting like it did in 1991, but New Clark City is as close to disaster-proof as it realistically could be. The first phase of construction is estimated to be completed by 2022, but we will have to wait until 2048 to know how exactly how disaster-proof New Clark City will be as a fully developed metropolis. For the sake of the people of the Philippines, we hope Manila will be free from any devastating natural disasters for much longer than that.","Back-up quarterbacks allow football teams to replace their starters in the event of injury.

Devon Fredricksen - High Country News,"“I’m intellectually greedy,” Ruth Kirk once said during an interview, describing her insatiable curiosity about natural history, anthropology, and archaeology. Kirk has spent a lifetime learning the language of Western wilderness and ancient cultures—mapping their history and learning how to “idle back to nature’s pace.” Now, she says she is “about to put the pencil down” for good. Yet even as Parkinson’s disease increasingly compromises her motor skills, Kirk pushed to complete one final project: Ozette: Excavating a Makah Whaling Village. “I am well-equipped to write the book,” she says. It’s a beloved subject for her, the Ozette Archaeology Project on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula. Excavation at the site began in 1966, led by Richard Daugherty, archaeologist and now an emeritus professor at Washington State University. Together, she and Daugherty wrote Hunters of the Whale, chronicling the first stages of the dig through 1974. A Makah Indian village buried by an ancient mudflow, the site was a “Pompeii in mud instead of volcanic ash,” Kirk says, a phenomenon that permitted recovery of 55,000 intact wooden artifacts by the project’s close in 1981. Six years ago, Kirk married Daugherty—her friend of 40 years—in a Makah longhouse at Neah Bay, Washington. Kirk is a petite, soft-spoken woman, humble about her accomplishments. “When you have hair as gray as this, you’ve had time to do things,” she says. Yet her age hasn’t dulled the light in her eyes, or her zest for research and exploration. She began writing at age 24, when she moved with her first husband, Louis Kirk, a park ranger, and their two sons to Death Valley National Park. There she noticed how visitors looked at the valley without really seeing it, “because they didn’t know what they were looking at.” With only two rangers covering the entire park, information was not easily disseminated. Kirk thought a “paper ranger, a book” might help. After a chance encounter, Ansel Adams asked Kirk to write a brief guide section for his photo book on the valley. That eventually led her to write her own book, Exploring Death Valley. Later, as the family moved from park to park, she wrote guidebooks on Death Valley, Mount Rainier National Park, the Olympic Peninsula, Crater Lake, and Yellowstone, along with other books on topics as varied as desert ecology, snow, and Northwest Coast Indian culture. Her accolades include the John Burroughs Medal for Natural History Writing, recognition by the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Library Association, and a National Book Award nomination. I learned of Kirk a few years ago, when I began writing a hiking guidebook for the Eastern Sierra and a former neighbor told me, “You have to meet Ruth Kirk. She’s an inspiration.” At Kirk’s home in Lacey, Washington, we exchanged stories over cups of tea. Her house is filled with souvenirs from all the time she’s spent immersed in Indian culture. She showed me two Hopi pots she bought in her childhood. She paid a dime for one and a nickel for the other—her entire week’s allowance. As she talks, I notice parallels between our lives: Both of us were published authors by our mid-20s, both women entranced by the outdoors. The difference is that she forged the path for my generation of female guidebook authors, logging miles with minimal navigation tools, fewer research resources, and much heavier equipment. Kirk spent most of her career lugging three heavy film cameras slung from her neck and a “gosh-awful” Trapper Nelson pack on her back that she describes as “a couple wooden sticks on each side with a bag lashed onto it.” She once hauled a pack of cement to the summit of Mount Rainier for a new survey marker. When she wasn’t on a trail filling journals with notes, Kirk could be found poring over Ph.D. dissertations, field reports, and oral recordings. She believes in “researching deeply,” a skill that has helped her to paint thoughtful portraits of the West with a style akin to Mary Austin’s. While Kirk’s subjects lend themselves to objective description—geology, anthropology, archaeology—her sense of wonder leaves its mark on every page. “If love could shine through ink, these pages would glow,” she writes in Sunrise to Paradise: The Story of Mount Rainier National Park. While Kirk doesn’t travel much anymore, she feels at home wherever she is. “You look at Death Valley and you think, who wants a Douglas fir anyway? Then you hike through the Hoh Rainforest here and think, who needs a saguaro cactus? I’m fickle. Whatever place I’m in, that’s the place I love.” This story was produced and published by High Country News. Photo by Mary Randlett.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) Destructive waves of mud came down the hills in Southern California slamming everything in sight. The force of the mudslides was so massive that it destroyed homes, uprooted trees and washed away dozens of cars. Hundreds of first responders in Santa Barbara County waded through waist-high mud while others flew over the devastation searching for survivors. As of Wednesday, 13 people were killed and more than 160 others were injured. In Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, residents walked on streets blanketed by mud trying to understand the devastation left in the wealthy hillside enclave. ""No one could have guessed this,"" Diane Brewer said. ""I'm wondering if my friends are alive."" Muddy, debris-filled water flooded several roads, leaving the region at a standstill. The amount of debris was so massive that a stretch of 30 miles of the 101 Freeway between Montecito and Santa Barbara, is expected to remain closed for at least 48 hours, said Capt. Cindy Pontes with the California Highway Patrol. The mud came in an instant, pounding and even crashing through the walls of many homes. Ben Hyatt said his Montecito home was surrounded by 2-3 feet of mud, and a washing machine had drifted into his front yard. As the mud receded, a dark stain covering halfway up the front windows of a home in Montecito served as a reminder of the havoc caused by the heavy rain and flooding. Homeowners and first responders were searching for at least two dozen people who were unaccounted for as Tuesday afternoon. Among those looking for survivors were Riley, a search dog with the Santa Barbara County Fire, and his handler Eric Gray. The yellow Labrador Retriever was deployed to Japan during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and traveled to Nepal after the deadly earthquake in 2015, according to the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation. Most recently, the pair traveled to Puerto Rico to search for people still trapped in the rubble in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, CNN affiliate KEYT reported. After hours trapped in the rubble, a 14-year-old girl was rescued from a home in Montecito that was destroyed by the heavy rains. The girl, coated head to foot in mud, was led by firefighters from the pile of wood and debris, a photo from the county fire department shows. Dozens were trapped in cars and buildings. At least 50 people were airlifted to safety on Tuesday in emergency helicopters, according to Kevin Taylor of the Montecito Fire Department. Video footage shows how rescuers saved driver whose car was swept away by the mudflow during the rainstorm.

AP,"KARANGASEM, Indonesia -- Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the island's international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 9,800 feet into the atmosphere since the weekend. Video released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 6 miles in places from the previous 4.7 miles. It said in a statement that a larger eruption was possible. A view of Mount Agung volcano erupting from Kubu, in Karangasem, Bali, Indonesia, Nov. 27, 2017. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Passengers ask staff about their flights after Ngurah Rai airport closed their operation due to eruption of Mount Agung in Bali resort island, Nov. 27, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses are being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Mount Agung volcano is seen spewing smoke and ash in Bali, Indonesia, on Nov. 26, 2017, in this picture obtained from social media. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. He told Indonesian television on Monday morning that he did not expect a big eruption but added ""we have to stay alert and anticipate."" The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their made to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers.","Indonesia's Mount Agung spews ash and unleashes volcanic mudlflows, stranding tens of thousands of tourists on island",2017-11-27T08:02:39Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}",Volcano alert at highest level as danger zone grows,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mount-agung-indonesia-volcano-alert-highest-level-tourists-stranded/,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2017/11/27/d998e5d6-018d-4286-a5f2-d707d3bac7a0/mount-agung-bali-volcano.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,mudflow,1
Damien Sharkov,"When Russia’s weather turns cold, it can defeat entire armies, history has taught us. In preparation for working in the coming snowfalls, Moscow is arming the country’s scientists as though they are off to war, state news agency RIA Novosti reported Friday. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered the Ministry of Defense to send 68 fully-loaded howitzer artillery guns to Russia’s state meteorologists, to fire in the event that they are suddenly faced with an avalanche during their fieldwork. According to the decree Medvedev issued Friday, the military will also hand over 4,500 rounds of high-caliber ammunition to the state environmental, weather and hydrometeorology agency to use with their new 122 millimeter D-30 howitzer guns. Scientists at the agency that helps predict Russia's weather, known by the portmanteau Rosgidromet, will receive equipment to safely operate the weapons alone and in a group.

To tackle heavy snowfall in mountainous areas, Russian authorities often pre-empt a snowslide, to avoid a bigger pile-up of snow causing a larger and potentially deadly avalanche. The military or Emergency Ministry officials often use explosives or fire artillery into dangerous, snow-covered slopes to force the slide and clear some layers from the peak.

Buildings, trees, and cars in Murmansk region were also damaged. Several of Russia’s mountain ranges have been prone to massive avalanches in the past, notably in 2002 when a snowslide in the Caucasus killed more than 100 people in a North Ossetia village. The now infamous avalanche took place in September, bringing down tons of ice but also, because of the lack of snow, rolling down debris and rocks in a wave of mudflow down on the village of Karmadon. The shock event became a national tragedy, after burying and killing at least 125 people, including one of Russia’s most popular young actors at the time, Sergei Bodrov.",Winter is coming and Russia's scientists are getting loaded guns to fight deadly snowslides.,2017-11-10T16:39:17Z,"{'id': 'newsweek', 'name': 'Newsweek'}",Russia Will Fight Avalanches by Shooting Guns at Them,http://www.newsweek.com/russia-rolling-out-big-guns-fight-avalanches-708196,http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2017/11/10/1110russiaavalanches.jpg,newsweek,Newsweek,mudflow,1

Himanshu Goenka,"A deadly volcano in the Philippines is showing signs it may erupt soon, the country’s Department of Science and Technology (DOSAT) warned late Sunday. The threat associated with the Mayon Volcano was increased from Level 2 to Level 3, and by Monday morning, a pyroclastic flow was seen on the mountain’s slopes as well. In a bulletin issued 8 p.m. Sunday local time (7 a.m. EST), which raised the alert level, DOSAT’s Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PIVS) said: “After three (3) phreatic (steam-driven) eruptions and 158 rockfall events between 4:21 PM 13 January and 7:25 PM 14 January, Mayon’s summit crater is now exhibiting bright crater glow that signifies the growth of a new lava dome and beginnings of lava flow towards the southern slopes.” The glow (at top) of lava from the cloud-covered Mayon volcano as it erupts is pictured from the Philippine city of Legazpi in Albay province, early on Jan. 15, 2018. Photo: Simvale Sayat/AFP/Getty Images About 1,000 families in the vicinity of the volcano have already been evacuated. PIVS also added in the bulletin an expected timeline for the eruption, and enlarged the evacuation area. “Mayon is exhibiting relatively high unrest and that magma is at the crater and that hazardous eruption is possible within weeks or even days. It is therefore recommended that the 6-km radius Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) and a 7-km Extended Danger Zone (EDZ) on the southern flank be enforced due to the danger of rockfalls, landslides and sudden explosions or dome collapse that may generate hazardous volcanic flows. Increased vigilance against pyroclastic density currents, lahars and sediment-laden streamflows along channels draining the edifice is also advised,” it said. Mayon is an active volcano that has erupted several times since the 1980s, and the number of people killed directly because as a result is possibly fewer than 100, but indirect deaths, such as those caused by mudslides from volcanic ash are well over 1,000. This type of volcanic mudflow is called a lahar, referred to in the PIVS warning. A phreatic eruption is one that is mostly just steam and ash, while pyroclastic flows contain hot gas as well as fragmented volcanic material called tephra. PIVS also shared some photographs of the pyroclastic flow from Monday morning on its Facebook page. Local media reports said some flight operations were affected Monday, given the volcano activity and the PIVS bulletin, which said: “Civil aviation authorities must also advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit as ash from any sudden eruption can be hazardous to aircraft.” The Philippines, like many other countries in the region, is home to a large number of volcanoes, many of them active.

"Jeremy B White, Jeremy B White","At least eight people have been killed after the first major storm to hit southern California this winter unleashed flooding and mudslides that toppled homes, prompted emergency rescues — including of a teenaged girl — and evacuation orders in an area that just endured historically intense wildfires. Long-awaited rain fell on a region left vulnerable to new forms of natural disaster after spending weeks ablaze, the type of pivot from weather hazard to weather hazard that is common to a state that periodically grapples with drought, flooding, earthquakes and wildfires. By Tuesday morning, some places in the greater Los Angeles area had seen more than 10 centimetres (4 inches) of rainfall. Those heavy rains brought severe and sometimes-deadly consequences. Officials in Santa Barbara said at least eight people had died. Houses were swept away, stretches of major roads were rendered inaccessible by inundating mud and rain and and people were ordered out of their homes in areas that last month were menaced and forced to evacuate by raging blazes. ​Firefighters rescues multiple people who were trapped in vehicles and homes by water and debris. In Montecito, they extracted a mud-coated 14-year-old girl from a collapsed home where she had been pinioned for hours. Responders had to wade through waste-deep mud and avoid downed wires. “I thought I was dead for a minute there,” the girl could be heard saying on video posted by KNBC-TV before she was taken away on a stretcher. #CAStorm - Firefighters rescue a girl who was trapped in Montecito following heavy rain and mudflow in the 300 block of Hot Springs Road. pic.twitter.com/tfUw0cDbXx — SBCFireInfo (@EliasonMike) January 9, 2018 The bodies were found in Santa Barbara County, including in and around Montecito, a wealthy enclave of about 9,000 people northwest of Los Angeles that is home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey, Rob Lowe and Ellen DeGeneres. The state's Office of Emergency Services said it had deployed flood rescue teams to help pull people from the torrential cocktail of rainwater and mud. “Teams are actively engaged in life saving operations,” the office said. Hundreds killed in Brazil floods and mudslides With several routes already shut down, authorities issued a shelter-in-place warning imploring people to avoid perilous roads. “Take protective actions to stay safe which may include sheltering-in-place or seeking high ground, avoiding power lines and trees, staying off roads and highways, and do not attempt to leave and drive across flowing water or mud,” an alert warned. DeGeneres posted a photo on Twitter of a roadway choked with mud and brown water. “This is not a river,” DeGeneres wrote on Twitter. “This is the 101 freeway in my neighborhood right now. Montecito needs your love and support.” This is not a river. This is the 101 freeway in my neighborhood right now.

Residents who spent much of last month being urged to stay off roads and warned of potential evacuation orders faced the same outcomes from a different cause. Authorities in Santa Barbara County, north of Los Angeles, issued evacuation orders for areas that had burned — warning in an alert of “heavy rain, high winds and extremely dangerous flash flooding, mud and debris flows,” — and a local emergency declaration. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for areas charred by a pair of recent wildfires. “The intensity of the Thomas Fire left our mountains with little or no vegetation to prevent the slopes from sliding,” the county declaration read, referencing the record-setting inferno that consumed some 280,000 acres. “Hence, a critical watershed was burned, and following wildfire and the immediate approach of winter storms, the threat of flash floods and debris flows is now 10 times greater than before the fire – they can happen with little or no warning”.

Agence France-Presse,"Rescue workers pulled more bodies Monday from under the dust and rubble left by an explosive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, bringing the death toll to at least 69. Of them, 17 have been identified so far, said Fanuel Garcia, head of the National Institute of Forensic Sciences. In addition, there are 46 people injured, most of them seriously, more than 1.7 million being hit by the disaster, including 3,271 ordered evacuated and 1,787 in shelters in the departments of Escuintla, Sacatepequez and Chimaltenango since Sunday’s eruption. The 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano erupted early Sunday, spewing out towering plumes of ash and a hail of fiery rock fragments with scalding mud. Authorities had warned the death toll could rise after searches resumed for survivors in communities on the mountain’s southern flank. After an initial toll of 25 dead, it was revised upwards within hours as bodies were recovered from villages razed by the tumbling mud. “There are missing persons, but we do not know how many,” said Sergio Cabanas of Guatemala’s disaster management agency. A roll call of communities on the slopes of the volcano was under way. The speed and ferocity of the eruption took mountain communities by surprise, with many of the dead found in or around their homes. Cabanas said those who were killed had been overrun by fast-moving burning material discharged by the volcano Sunday. Communities located on its southern slope were the worst hit. Several of the dead were children. An AFP journalist saw at least three bodies burned in the rubble of the village of San Miguel Los Lotes, where rescue workers, soldiers and police were desperately searching for survivors. Dead dogs, chickens and ducks also lay among the mud and ash, much of it still smoking. “I do not want to leave, but go back, and there is nothing I can do to save my family,” a weeping Eufemia Garcia, 48, told AFP. She was searching for her three children, her mother, nephews and siblings. Garcia, from Los Lotes, said she escaped with the help of her husband. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was deeply saddened by the “tragic loss of life and the significant damage caused by the eruption,” and said the UN was ready to assist national rescue and relief efforts. – National mourning – President Jimmy Morales, who has declared three days of national mourning, visited the disaster zone. “The volcano has erupted before, but never like this,” said Gustavo Larius, a 27-year-old bricklayer searching the streets of his village for missing family and friends, a handkerchief pressed over his mouth and nose. The eruption sent ash billowing over the surrounding area, turning plants and trees gray and blanketing streets, cars and people. Farmers covered in ash fled for their lives as civil defense workers tried to relocate them to shelters. “This time we were saved; in another (eruption) no,” said Efrain Gonzalez, 52, sitting on the floor of a shelter in the city of Escuintla, where he arrived with his wife and one-year-old daughter. Gonzalez was overwhelmed with despair, as two more of his children, aged 10 and four, are missing. They were trapped in their home, which was flooded with hot mud that descended from the volcano. Dense ash blasted out by the volcano shut down Guatemala City’s international airport, civil aviation officials said. The eruption ended after 16.5 hours, but “there is a likelihood that it will reactivate” warned the Institute of Volcanology. – Surprising speed – The speed of the eruption took locals by surprise, and could be explained by it producing pyroclastic flows, sudden emissions of gas and rock fragments, rather than lava, said volcanologist David Rothery of Britain’s Open University. “A lava flow rarely travels fast enough to engulf people,” he said. “The videos and still images I’ve seen suggest instead one or more pyroclastic flows. This is when a violently erupted mass of rock fragments and hot gas finds itself too dense to rise as an ash column and instead cascades down the volcano’s slopes. “Pyroclastic flows or surges can move at over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, and may be hot enough to glow like molten lava. They can travel further, as well as much faster, than lava flows,” said Rothery. Fuego has been erupting since 2002, and was continuously active in 2017. There were explosions and ash plumes and a volcanic mudflow last month.","Rescue workers pulled more bodies Monday from under the dust and rubble left by an explosive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, bringing the death toll to at least 69.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) Ben Hyatt rushed to wake everyone up when rivers of mud started banging the doors and walls of his Montecito, California home. ""Seemed like just heavy rain,"" he said. ""Five minutes later, heard loud wish sound. Mud came in an instant, like a dam breaking."" Hyatt and other residents are recalling the drama that ensued as Tuesday's deadly mudslides and flooding devastated Southern California. Hundreds of rescuers and dogs continued searching for people Wednesday. They heard a ""deep rumbling"" sound Heavy rain and a ""deep rumbling"" sound preceded the massive amounts of mud that blanketed miles and killed at least 17 people. When the rain began drenching the area, Hyatt decided to stay up late to ""keep an eye on things."" Shortly, he would be moving furniture around to keep the mud from getting in his home. Streets were like rapids and it was matter of minutes before cars began moving sideways, disappearing underneath the mud and crashing into homes. Josie Gower held onto a door frame when a devastating river of mud rushed inside her Montecito, California home. The 69-year-old woman and her boyfriend were at home Tuesday when the mudslide swept through the neighborhood. ""For some reason, she opened the front door"" and was swept away, Diane Brewer, one of Gower's friends told CNN. Gower is among who have been reported dead in Santa Barbara County, Brewer said. More than a dozen people remain unaccounted for, authorities said. Families rushed to escape the raging mudflow ""We ran into the house and right then the boulders busted through the house,"" Berkeley ""Augie"" Johnson told KSBY. The muddy water was not slowly leaking into homes like rainfall does -- it came in slamming. As Johnson and his family ran up to the second level of their home, about 8-9 feet of mud followed them closely. With nowhere to go, they crawled out of a window to reach the roof, he said. Children and babies were pulled from the mud The mud and debris overwhelmed many homes and wiped some of them out. Johnson pulled a baby who was submerged in about 4 feet of mud, KSBY reported. ""We don't know where it came from but we got it out, took the mud out of his mouth. I hope that's OK,"" he said. From the rubble of another home, a crew of firefighters rescued a 14-year-old girl, who had been trapped for hours after her home collapsed. The girl, coated head to foot in mud, was led by firefighters from the pile of wood and debris that was once a house, a photo from Santa Barbara County fire department showed. The destruction was everywhere Peter Hartmann said power lines were down and aluminum poles were snapped in half. The water was flowing out of water mains also coming off from fire hydrants. ""There were gas mains that had popped, where you could hear the hissing,"" Hartmann told CNN affiliate KCAL.

The administration is proposing a two-year phaseout, claiming as justification that PBS and NPR ""primarily rely on private donations to fund their operations."" The proposal is sure to generate a backlash. ""Here we go again,"" said Enrique Cerna, who retired last Friday after 23 years with KCTS-TV. ""The Republicans have been trying to zero out CPB for years. Fortunately, the public has stepped in to stop them. ""It's not surprising that Trump would go after public broadcasting especially with his ongoing fake news claims and media battles. But you can't dispute public broadcasting's integrity, its benefits to children's education and its service to rural areas where Trump has a lot of support."" MORE FROM JOEL CONNELLY: Enrique Cerna retires after 23 years at KCTS-TV The Trump administration has abandoned longtime Republican arguments that public broadcasting is a haven for left-wing pundits. The charge is hard to sustain given the number of Republican House members appearing regularly on NPR's ""Morning Edition."" Instead, argue Trump's budget writers, CPB money comprises only 15 percent of the total amount spent on public broadcasting, money that can be made up by ""increasing revenues from corporate sponsors, foundations and members."" But Patricia Harrison, CEO of the corporation, said Tuesday that ""elimination of public funding for CPB would at first devastate, and then ultimately destroy public media's ability to provide early childhood content, life-saving emergency alerts, and public affairs programs."" ""Americans rely on public media for high-quality educational and informational programs that are proven to get their children ready to learn, and that provide opportunities for lifelong learning,"" she added. Two Northwest lawmakers, Republican Rep. Dave Reichert and Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer, last year launched a bipartisan group to support the CPB, as well as the Ready to Learn program and the public television interconnection system."" ""For nearly 50 years, public broadcasting has served as a reliable source for public safety announcements, objective news and critical educational programs for our children,"" Reichert wrote on his Facebook page. In a joint letter, Reichert and Blumenauer told House colleagues: ""The relatively small federal investment in public broadcasting is leveraged for even greater impact. Approximately 70 percent of funds appropriated to CPB go directly to the more than 1,500 public television and radio stations across the country, supporting approximately 20,000 local jobs."" Washington will have a role in whether the Corporation for Public Broadcasting survives. Three of the state's House members -- U.S. Reps. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., and Reps. Jaime Herrera Buetler and Dan Newhouse, R-Wash. -- sit on the House Appropriations Committee. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is a senior member on the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Lydia O'Connor,"At least 17 people have died and several remain missing following the powerful mudslides that swept through the Southern California community of Montecito earlier this week. It’s hard to grasp that such a deadly tragedy could strike an area that was just scorched by the largest wildfire in recorded state history, but the two disasters are linked. Here’s what you should know about the crisis unfolding: What are mudslides, and why are they so dangerous? Mudslides, referred to as debris flows by scientists, occur on hillsides and steep slopes when heavy rains pummel the soil, loosening and liquifying it into a fast-moving mud dragged down hillsides by gravity. That deluge engulfs the loose debris, trees and boulders in its path, becoming a barrage of detritus powerful enough to wipe out entire communities downstream. ″[I]t’s like the sort of mud that will suck the boots right off your feet,” Southern California Public Radio reporter Sharon McNary said Wednesday from Montecito. The flows can reach speeds of up to 35 miles per hour, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Matt Udkow/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via Reuters Mudflow and its path of damage in Montecito, California, on Wednesday. “Debris flows can be lethal because of their rapid onset, high speed of movement and the fact that they can incorporate large boulders and other pieces of debris,” the USGS explains. “They can move objects as large as houses in their downslope flow or can fill structures with a rapid accumulation of sediment and organic matter. They can affect the quality of water by depositing large amounts of silt and debris.” Landslides occur in every state but are most common along the West Coast, in the Intermountain Region, Alaska, Hawaii and hilly parts of the East Coast. How do recent wildfires increase the risk of mudslides? Mudslide risk is higher on land recently scarred by wildfires, such as the recent burns in California. Several factors are at play here. Wildfires wipe hillsides clean of vegetation that would typically anchor soil in its place. The roots of trees that are still standing were often killed in the wildfires and not as secure in the ground, allowing them to be swept up into the mudslide. Wildfires also create “burn scars” in which the ground is so scorched it becomes hydrophobic. Instead of being absorbed into the soil, the water slicks off the hill and picks up loose topsoil and debris. This phenomenon is worsened by the lack of trees, which would typically catch rain as it falls and slow its path to the ground. Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via Reuters Debris flows with the mud in Montecito. With the largest wildfire in state history still in residents’ rearview mirrors, this double whammy is about as bad as it gets. Last month’s Thomas fire, which authorities are still working to fully contain, has burned 281,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. When a forecast of heavy rain in the region emerged Sunday, meteorologists warned that mudslides could develop and become treacherous. Why weren’t people more prepared? The exact timing of mudslides is hard to predict, and they’re nearly impossible to mitigate, according to the USGS. That poses a dilemma for the residents who must decide whether to respond to warnings and to the officials who would send the warnings out. Many people in the mudslides’ path had just returned home after being forced to evacuate during the fires. Worried residents facing “disaster fatigue” might not take the emergency alerts seriously, and officials chose not to send out emergency alerts to cellphones until after the flooding had begun. There “isn’t an exact science” for predicting the scope of a disaster, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. Many residents probably couldn’t grasp the scope of how dangerous mudslides can become, McNary told PBS NewsHour. Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via Reuters A damaged Montecito house is surrounded by dislodged boulders and debris. “You can be in a place that looks perfectly safe, that looks kind of flat,” she said. “You cannot imagine what it’s like to be at the bottom of a funnel of literally acre-feet of watery mud, and it comes very, very fast. I was in a mud flow yesterday, and it went from a wash channel being 6 inches of water to being 10 feet of water full of boulders.” Even just a small misstep can be fatal. When Josie Gower, 69, opened the front door of her Montecito home, she was fatally swept downhill for miles. “I told her to stay on the second floor, but she went downstairs and opened the door and just got swept away,” her son, Hayden Gower, told KSBY. How does this mudslide stack up to others? These Southern California mudslides will likely go down as some of the worst in recent state history. By comparison, the 2005 mudslide in La Conchita, California, killed 10 people and destroyed 13 houses, while a 1995 one in the same city destroyed nine homes but caused no fatalities. The 2014 mudslides in Oso, Washington, about 60 miles north of Seattle, are regarded as among the worst in U.S. history. The disaster claimed more than 40 lives and dozens of homes and cut off a main roadway in the area for months.

CHRISTOPHER WEBER,"CHRISTOPHER WEBER Last updated 04:31, January 11 2018 Firefighters rescue a girl from a mudflow in Montecito. The death toll from the mudslides that struck Southern California climbed to 15 on Wednesday (Thursday NZ Time) as rescue crews searched for anyone trapped, injured or dead in the onslaught that smashed homes and swept away cars. The torrential rainstorm that set off the disaster cleared out and was no longer a hindrance as searchers made their way across a landscape strewn with boulders and covered in cement-like mud shoulder-high in some places. ""Right now our assets are focused on determining if anyone is still alive in any of those structures that have been damaged,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. A car and debris were smashed against a tree along Hot Springs Road. Homes were swept from their foundations as heavy rain sent mud and boulders sliding down hills stripped of vegetation by a gigantic wildfire that raged in Southern California last month. He said that several dozen homes were destroyed or severely damaged, and that there are probably many more in similar condition in areas still inaccessible.

Photo: MIKE ELIASON/Santa Barbara County Fire Department At least 25 people were injured, 50 or more had to be rescued by helicopters, and an undetermined number of others were missing, authorities said. Four of the injured were reported in severely critical condition. The search was set to expand with the arrival of a major search-and-rescue team from nearby Los Angeles County and help from the Coast Guard and the National Guard. Most of the deaths occurred in and around Montecito, a wealthy enclave of about 9000 people northwest of Los Angeles that is home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey, Rob Lowe and Ellen DeGeneres. Mud and debris flow past a damaged house in Montecito, an area which had 12.5mm of rain fall in five minutes. Winfrey's home survived the mudslides. In an Instagram post on the same day many Democrats were talking about her for president because of her rousing speech at the Golden Globes, she shared photos of the deep mud in her backyard and video of rescue helicopters hovering over her house. ""What a day!"" Winfrey said. ""Praying for our community again in Santa Barbara."" The main line of the Union Pacific Railroad through Montecito is blocked with mudflow and debris which came down hills after a storm that saw 13mm of rain fall in 5 minutes. A mud-caked 14-year-old girl was among the dozens rescued on the ground on Tuesday (Wednesday NZT). She was pulled from a collapsed Montecito home where she had been trapped for hours. ""I thought I was dead for a minute there,"" the dazed girl could be heard saying on video posted by KNBC-TV before she was taken away on a stretcher. The mud was unleashed in the dead of night by flash flooding in the steep Santa Ynez Mountains, where hillsides were stripped of vegetation last month by the biggest wildfire on record in California, a 440-square-mile blaze that destroyed 1063 homes and other structures. Authorities are still working to find and rescue people amid the mess. Burned-over zones are especially susceptible to destructive mudslides because scorched earth doesn't absorb water well and the land is easily eroded when there are no shrubs. The torrent arrived suddenly and with a thunderous sound. Thomas Tighe said he stepped outside his Montecito home in the middle of the night and heard ""a deep rumbling, an ominous sound I knew was... boulders moving as the mud was rising."" A member of the Long Beach Search and Rescue team looks for survivors in a car in Montecito. Two cars were missing from his driveway, and he watched two others slowly move sideways down the middle of the street in a river of mud. In daylight, Tighe was shocked to see a body pinned by muck against his neighbour's home. He wasn't sure who it was. Authorities had been bracing for the possibility of catastrophic flooding because of heavy rain in the forecast for the first time in 10 months. Evacuations were ordered beneath recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. A K-9 search and rescue team walks into an area of debris and mud flow. The death toll is expected to rise, with many people still missing. But only an estimated 10 to 15 per cent of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara County heeded the warning, authorities said. US Highway 101, the link connecting Ventura and Santa Barbara, looked like a muddy river and was expected to be closed for two days. The worst of the rainfall occurred in a 15-minute span starting at 3.30am on Tuesday (9.30pm NZT). Montecito got more than a half-inch (12mm) in five minutes, while Carpinteria received nearly an inch (25mm) in 15 minutes.

""All hell broke loose,"" said Peter Hartmann, a dentist who moonlights as a news photographer for the local website Noozhawk. ""Power lines were down, high-voltage power lines. The large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half. Water was flowing out of water mains and sheared-off fire hydrants."" Hartmann watched rescuers revive a toddler pulled unresponsive from the muck. ""It was a freaky moment to see her just covered in mud,"" he said.

"Madison Park and Amir Vera, CNN","(CNN) Severe storms smacked the Southeast Monday, bringing possible tornadoes, powerful winds and hailstones the size of baseballs. The damaging weather struck right before Tuesday, which is the first day of spring. ""There has been significant damage tonight in parts of Alabama,"" Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement late Monday. Possible tornadoes were reported to have torn apart homes, shredded buildings and knocked down power lines and trees. ""We are sending state resources to those affected areas, especially to Jacksonville and Calhoun County,"" Ivey said. ""We will continue to monitor and respond to needs in other areas as needed."" In Jacksonville, Alabama, at least one person was injured after a possible tornado touched down on Monday. There are people trapped in the downed debris, and crews are searching for them, said Chris Roberts, assistant fire chief with Jacksonville Fire Department. The storm also damaged the roofs of two residence halls and the sports coliseum at Jacksonville State University, which has about 8,500 students. The college is on spring break this week, but campus police are going room to room at campus apartments and halls to check on any students who may have still been there when the storm hit, said Buffy Lockette, spokesperson for Jacksonville State University. She said there weren't any confirmed injuries as of late Monday. Also in Alabama, the National Weather Service said that ""a large and extremely dangerous"" tornado had developed near Russellville. Tracy Bragwell, who lives southwest of Russellville, said the storm ripped the metal roof off of his parents' home, damaged some trees and their carport. He posted a video of the damage to Facebook. Bragwell, his wife, son and his parents went to his storm shelter about 10 minutes before the storm hit, he said. As they sheltered there for about an hour, the wind ""sounded like a roaring train coming through,"" he said. In Ardmore, Alabama, the storm collapsed roofs and entire homes. Large hail pelted down in parts of the state, shattering car windows and hammering vehicles. Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt tweeted a picture of the massive hail Monday. Severe weather was expected to continue overnight, but Tuesday will mostly see a wind threat, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. Northwest and central parts of Georgia remain under tornado watch until 4 a.m. Tuesday. As if there hadn't been enough nor'easters already, the mid-Atlantic and New England will brace for the fourth such storm to hit the region in less than three weeks. Forecast models are saying the low pressure system could move toward the coast, which would bring snow to Washington, DC, New York City, Boston, and possibly Portland, Maine, said CNN meteorologist Haley Brink. Snowfall is more likely in portions of New Jersey, the New York City area, and southern New England Tuesday night into Wednesday, according to NWS. Boston could get 2-4 inches of snow and 3-6 inches could fall on Washington, DC, Brink said. The system's exact path is still uncertain. At this point, the question is whether the system will continue east toward the coast or travel north. If it veers north, there will be significant snow in New England, but if it goes eastward, it'll mean less snow for the region. Santa Barbara County officials have issued a mandatory evacuation order for high-risk debris flow areas ahead of a midweek storm in California. ""We have no choice but do to this,"" said Santa Barbara Sheriff Bill Brown. ""It's not worth risking lives to avoid evacuation."" Because of the recent burn scars from recent fires in the area, flash flooding remains a major concern. The storm may cause severe flooding and mudflow, according to Rob Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management. The evacuation is effective Tuesday at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time for burn areas near the Thomas, Sherpa and Whittier fires. Those in affected areas have until 5 p.m. PST Tuesday to evacuate, Brown said. The National Weather Service predicts between 5 and 10 inches of rain in the foothills and mountains, reaching between half an inch to three-quarters of an inch per hour. CNN's Dave Alsup, Dave Williams, Brandon Miller, Sonya Hamasaki and Dave Hennen contributed to this report.","Severe storms smacked the Southeast Monday, bringing possible tornadoes, powerful winds and hailstones the size of baseballs.",2018-03-20T06:03:11Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",'Significant damage' in Alabama after storms hit Southeast,https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/tornadoes-storms-noreaster-severe-weather/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180319225409-alabama-storm-0319-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,mudflow,1
Antonia Blumberg,"Rescue crews continue to search wreckage for missing people two days after powerful mudslides swept through the Southern California community of Montecito, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than two dozen. The disaster took place in the same community where just weeks ago firefighters confronted the largest wildfire in the state’s history. The back-to-back disasters ― fire and flooding ― may seem like a cruel irony, but they’re directly related. A number of factors have played a role in how destructive and how lethal the mudslides turned out to be. Some Santa Barbara and Ventura county residents who had just returned to their homes after evacuating in December from the Thomas fire were reluctant to pack up and go again when they received a flood warning. Some lost their homes, others their lives, as a result. Local officials released numerous warnings in the early days of January as heavy rainfall was forecaste, but they chose not to send out emergency alerts to cellphones until after the flooding had begun. They worried that the disaster-fatigued residents might not take an alert seriously, and didn’t want to be seen as “crying wolf.” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said there “isn’t an exact science” for predicting the scope of a disaster. “Obviously, a lot depends on Mother Nature, on the magnitude of the rainfall, the magnitude of the mudslides and so forth,” the sheriff told reporters on Tuesday. But given the torrential rains that were predicted, a devastating disaster was almost inevitable. It’s no secret that drought, wildfires and mudslides ― all three of which California has witnessed of late ― are connected. The state just emerged from a five-year drought emergency, which Gov. Jerry Brown declared officially over in April of 2017. The long drought period, which experts say is among the extreme weather patterns exacerbated by climate change, made the land especially fire-prone. Not surprisingly, 2017 saw the largest and deadliest wildfires in California’s history. The Thomas fire burned through over 280,000 acres in Southern California in December, leaving the land scorched and flood-prone. Vegetation whose root systems might have held back the mudflow was destroyed, and the stage was set for deadly and fast-moving mudslides as Southern California was deluged with heavy rainfall. Aware of these environmental trends, officials warned about the potential of mudslides on local government websites and social media, as well as in news outlets and community emails. Jeff Gater, Santa Barbara County’s emergency manager, told The Los Angeles Times that over 200,000 emails warning of the possible disaster were delivered to residents who had signed up for such messages. But when it came to deciding whether or not to use a push alert system ― the same one used to sent out Amber Alerts for missing children ― county officials initially opted not to. The state’s emergency alert protocol has been under scrutiny since the October wildfire disaster in Northern California, which left more than 40 people dead. Officials in Sonoma County — where over half of the fatalities occurred — had decided not to deploy the federal Wireless Emergency Alert system, and some survivors of the 21 blazes later said they were inadequately warned. When wildfires flared in Southern California, state officials acted fast to send alerts to some 8 million smartphones in the area. But Gater said that an alert system shouldn’t be overused. “If you tell everyone to get out... the next time people won’t listen,” he said. “If you cry wolf, people stop listening.” The alert was ultimately sent out at roughly 4 a.m. local time, the L.A. Times reported, when the flooding had already began and it was clear the situation was only going to get worse. Meanwhile, Brown said sheriff’s deputies had knocked on 7,000 doors in the mandatory evacuation area ― mostly in and around Montecito ― telling residents to leave their homes. Not all of them heeded the warning. “There was evacuation fatigue from the fire,” local resident Marco Farrell told the Associated Press. Farrell and his parents had evacuated for more than a week during the fire, and decided not to leave again when a voluntary evacuation notice was issued for their neighborhood. In retrospect, he told AP, he wished they had. The mud flow burst into their home and sent a boulder plowing through the kitchen door. Thankfully, Farrell and his parents were able to escape. “I would have preferred for them to leave and in hindsight we should have left,” he said. “I don’t know how I got lulled.”","Unheeded evacuation warnings, late emergency alerts and an area primed for flooding after wildfires landslides all were factors.",2018-01-11T21:45:44Z,"{'id': 'the-huffington-post', 'name': 'The Huffington Post'}",Why The California Mudslides Have Been So Deadly,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-mudslide-factors_us_5a57a6bce4b068abc338c384,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a57be5e1f00009a00db8429.jpeg?ops=1200_630,the-huffington-post,The Huffington Post,mudflow,1
Unknown,"Tens of thousands of travellers have been stranded in Bali after the threat from a volcano closed the tourist island's international airport. Indonesian authorities raised the alert for Mount Agung to the highest level on Monday, and said the airport would be closed for 24 hours. The volcano has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. Video released by the national disaster agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. Tests indicated ash had reached the island's airspace, leaving tourists facing f light information boards showing rows of cancellations as they arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, affecting about 59,000 travellers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning, but officials said the situation would be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about five million visitors a year. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano had shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. ""We don't expect a big eruption but we have to stay alert and anticipate,"" he said on Indonesian TV. The exclusion zone around the crater was widened to six miles, from a previous three to five miles. Ash up to half a centimetre (less than half an inch) thick settled on villages around the volcano over the weekend, and soldiers and police distributed masks. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on October 29 after a decrease in activity, but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centres. AP Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency says as many as 100,000 villagers need to leave the expanded danger zone, but that less than half that number have left. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affected 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. Nugroho said about 40,000 people had evacuated but others had not left because they felt safe or did not want to abandon their livestock.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption A resident describes how he helped rescue a baby from the mud A rescue worker has tearfully described the toddler he pulled from debris following devastating mudslides in Southern California as a ""muddy doll"". Berkeley Johnson said the two-year-old girl was taken to hospital and suffered an injury to her hip. Rescue efforts are under way in Santa Barbara County for residents trapped by mudslides that overwhelmed an area scorched by wildfires last month. At least 15 people have died and more than two dozen others were injured. ""I don't know how the baby survived,"" Mr Berkeley told the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper. ""This was an hour of rain, and the house was gone,"" he said of his home in the community of Montecito. Mr Johnson said he and his wife, Karen, heard a baby crying after the flooding had subsided and they managed to climb down from the roof of their swamped home. The pair joined a fireman to dig the toddler out, scooping mud from her mouth before she was taken to hospital. ""Had we not gone over there, I don't think that kid would have [survived]"", he added. More than 50 people have been rescued already but many places are still inaccessible. Several roads are closed, including the major Highway 101. Some 163 people have been taken to hospital. Twenty had ""storm-related injuries"" and four were critically hurt. Image copyright Santa Barbara News via Reuters Image caption Fire department workers rescued a woman from a collapsed house in Montecito The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been burned by December's huge wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) says the risk of flooding stays ""significantly higher"" for up to five years after a wildfire. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. In some places mud was waist-deep, officials said. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest. Those who have stayed in the area have been warned to boil their tap water before drinking it. Image copyright EPA Image caption Boulders the size of cars rolled down hills and slammed into roadways Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason. Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent James Cook. County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said that five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito, possibly as a result of the storm. The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe, chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and broadcaster Oprah Winfrey. The US Coast Guard has sent ""multiple airships to support rescue operations"" and warned the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights would be grounded. This comes after a record-setting year of $306bn (£226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California has suffered severe drought in five out of six of the past years. In December, California Governor Jerry Brown said the state was ""facing a new reality"" as climate change meant wildfires could erupt ""every year or every few years"".

More than 16,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day. An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century. Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unawares. He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours. While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life. Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.","Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments,  and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow.",2018-04-27T11:45:50Z,"{'id': 'daily-mail', 'name': 'Daily Mail'}",WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII?,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/fb-5664741/WHAT-KNOW-DESTRUCTION-POMPEII.html,http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/12/4B9C35CA00000578-0-image-a-8_1524829527437.jpg,daily-mail,Daily Mail,mudflow,1
CHRISTOPHER WEBER,"CHRISTOPHER WEBER Last updated 09:37, January 10 2018 Authorities are still working to find and rescue people amid the muddy mess. Several people in the US are dead and homes swept from their foundations as heavy rain sent mud and boulders sliding down hills stripped of vegetation by a gigantic wildfire that raged in Southern California last month. Rescue crews used helicopters to lift people to safety because of blocked roads, and firefighters slogged through waist-high mud to pull a muck-covered 14-year-old girl out of the ruins of a home in Montecito, northwest of Los Angeles, where she had been trapped for hours. She was taken away on a stretcher. Five bodies were found in and around Montecito, Santa Barbara County Fire Department Captain Dave Zaniboni said. Mud and debris flow past a damaged house in Montecito, an area which had 12.5mm of rain fall in five minutes. Several houses were destroyed, and residents were unaccounted for in neighbourhoods hard to reach because of downed trees and power lines, he said.

Firdia Lisnawati,"KARANGASEM, Indonesia — Indonesian authorities ordered 100,000 people to flee Monday from an erupting volcano on Bali that forced the island’s international airport to close, stranding large numbers of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and gray ash about 9,800 feet into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 7 miles away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano’s alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 6 miles. It said a larger eruption is possible. The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have fled but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. ‘‘Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,’’ he said. ‘‘If needed we will forcibly evacuate them.’’ About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ‘‘will certainly spill over to the slopes,’’ Sutopo said. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation center. ‘‘We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,’’ she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano’s alert was at the highest level for several weeks but it didn’t erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived, expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure was in effect until Tuesday morning, though officials said the situation would be reviewed every six hours. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transiting flights. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches, and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. A Chinese tour service, Shenzhen PT Enjoy Bali International, had about 20 groups totaling 500 to 600 travelers from the Chinese cities of Wuhan, Changsha, and Guangzhou in Bali, according an executive, Liao Yuling, who was on the island. ‘‘They are mostly retirees or relatively high-end, so they don’t say they are especially anxious to rush home,’’ she said by telephone. The company was waiting to see whether Bali’s airport might open on Tuesday, said Liao. If not, she said buses and ferries would be arranged to take travelers to Surabaya on Java, where the company’s charter flights could pick them up. ‘‘We are not really affected, because the volcano is too far away. It is about 45 miles from us,’’ Liao said. ‘‘We only can say we saw pictures of it on television.’’ Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption. The agency’s chief said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ‘‘Ring of Fire’’ and has more than 120 active volcanoes.","Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of ash about 9,800 feet into the atmosphere and lava is welling up in the crater",2017-11-28T04:15:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bostonglobe.com'}","Indonesia volcano forces mass evacuation, shuts Bali airport",https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2017/11/27/indonesia-volcano-forces-mass-evacuation-shuts-bali-airport/FWLbV3SxmFunAH1BwA5bOO/story.html,https://www.bostonglobe.com//c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg.jpg,,Bostonglobe.com,mudflow,1
Bangkok Post Public Company Limited,"Mayon volcano erupted for the second time on Sunday and images from the Philippines show bright red lava dramatically spewing out of the mountain. (FB/Mautik P'tel) MANILA: The Philippines raised the alert level at its rumbling Mayon volcano south of Manila to Level 3 on Sunday after detecting lava flow and indications of activity that could lead to eruptions of magma. More than 900 families have been evacuated from villages near Mayon, a tourist attraction because of its near-perfect cone shape, following a ""steam-driven eruption"" on Saturday. Authorities advised people to cover their noses and mouths with a damp, clean cloth or dust mask if they were exposed to ash from the eruptions, and said aircraft must avoid flying close to the volcano's summit. Two similar phreatic eruptions occurred at the volcano in central Albay province on Sunday, unleashing more ash. ""Mayon's summit crater is now exhibiting bright crater glow that signifies the growth of a new lava dome and beginnings of lava flow towards the southern slopes,"" the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said. Phivolcs chief Renato Solidum said the volcano appeared due for another major eruption as it has been displaying abnormal behaviour since late last year. ""Alert level 3 is what we considered critical, 4 is when eruption is imminent, and 5 is eruption in progress,"" Cedric Daep, head of the Albay Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, said in a radio interview. Mayon's most destructive eruption was in February 1841, when lava buried a town and killed 1,200 people. It last erupted in 2014, spewing lava and forcing thousands of people to evacuate. The latest eruptions began on Saturday, unleashing ash, rocks and sulphur fumes and accompanied by rumbling sounds. Ash and smoke spew from the Philippine's most active volcano, Mount Mayon, as thousands of residents are told to evacuate, warned of a 'hazardous eruption' becoming increasingly likely. https://t.co/cJC0koMBIq pic.twitter.com/5lfID7NflN — ABC News (@ABC) January 14, 2018 (Video Twitter/ABC) Phivolcs had earlier raised the alert to Level 2, saying the activity was ""probably of magmatic origin, which could lead to more phreatic eruptions or eventually to hazardous magmatic eruptions."" Since Saturday's first eruption, Phivolcs said it had recorded 158 rockfall events and urged people to stay away from a 6km radius Permanent Danger Zone and a 7km Expanded Danger Zone on the volcano's southern flank. Landslides and sudden explosions or a dome collapse that may generate hazardous volcanic flows are also possible, it said. People within the slope of the volcano, but outside the danger zones, were told to take precautionary measures against possible roof collapses due to accumulated ash and rainwater, and lahar, an Indonesian term for a volcanic mudflow.

Adam Harvey,"Posted November 28, 2017 09:05:51 About 150,000 people will leave their homes on the slopes of Mount Agung, Bali's Governor says, as the volcano's eruptions grow more powerful, while the island's main airport will close for another 24 hours due to ashfall. Key points: The evacuations will cover people living within 10 kilometres of the crater Disaster officials say people will be forcibly evacuated if needed 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers Governor Made Pastika said the evacuation period for people living within 10 kilometres of the crater could easily last as long as a month. Indonesia's disaster management agency said the evacuation is so far orderly and without panic. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 meters into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometres away. Videos released by Indonesia's disaster management agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water — known as a lahar — moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and the agency warned people to stay away from rivers. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centres after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ""will certainly spill over to the slopes,"" Mr Sutopo said. Flights grounded again Bali's Ngurah Rai airport will be closed for a further 24 hours, after being closed on Monday morning due to falling volcanic ash. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled on Monday, stranding about 59,000 travellers. The airport's closure is having a disruptive effect on flights around Indonesia and the region. Bali is a hub airport in Indonesia with many flights transiting there for domestic as well as international destinations. Planes that would have flown other routes on Monday were stuck on the tarmac in Bali. Human Rights Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono said he was waiting for two hours at Jakarta's terminal 3 for his delayed flight to a domestic destination. He said other flight delays had been announced at the terminal, which serves national carrier Garuda, and the departure area was filling up with many waiting passengers. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption. The agency's chief said major ferry crossing points had been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia's Tourism Ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association would provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure.

AFP,"Dozens of Bali flights were cancelled in June when Mount Agung last erupted and shot a plume of ash and smoke more than 1,000 metre (3,300 feet) into the sky. (AFP pic)
JAKARTA: A volcano on the Indonesian holiday island of Bali erupted Sunday, belching ash high into the air and over nearby villages as officials warned tourists to keep clear of the area.
Mount Agung has been erupting periodically since it rumbled back to life in 2017, when it grounded hundreds of flights and left 120,000 visitors stranded.
On Sunday morning, the volcano — which is about 70 km from the tourist hub of Kuta — sent ash skywards as it erupted for about three minutes, according to the country’s volcanology centre.
“Residents near Mount Agung as well as climbers and tourists should not carry out any activity in the danger zone or within a four-kilometre radius from the crater,” the centre said in a statement.
On December 22, an eruption from Anak Krakatoa triggered a tsunami which hit the western tip of the neighbouring island of Java and southern Sumatra, killing at least 426 and leaving more than 7,000 injured.
In the latest eruption, several villages on Bali were covered in a thin layer of ash but no smoke or lava was detected coming from the crater and no evacuation has been ordered.
The volcanology centre also warned residents near rivers in the area to be on alert for cold lava flows — a type of mudflow that can form from rock and ash in the rainy season and which is often a prelude to the blazing orange lava of popular imagination.
In June, dozens of flights were cancelled after Agung erupted and shot a fresh plume of smoke and ash more than 1,000 metres (3,300 feet) into the sky.
Agung’s last major eruption in 1963 killed around 1,600 people. Indonesia is the world’s most active volcanic region and lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent volcanic and seismic activities.","On Sunday morning, the volcano sent ash skywards as it erupted for about three minutes.",2018-12-30T08:57:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Freemalaysiatoday.com'}",Bali’s Agung volcano spews ash in fresh eruption,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2018/12/30/balis-agung-volcano-spews-ash-in-fresh-eruption/,https://s3media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mt-agung.jpg,,Freemalaysiatoday.com,mudflow,1
hurriyetdailynews.com,"KARANGASEM - The Associated Press Authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people on Nov. 27 from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the Indonesian island’s international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. A mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar was filmed moving down the volcano’s slopes. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency raised the alert to the highest level early Nov. 27 and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous maximum of 7.5 kilometers. It said in a statement that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation.

Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until the morning of Nov. 28 though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Nov. 25 and Nov. 26 but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they’re not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali’s airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses are being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency’s chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. He told Indonesian television on the morning of Nov. 27 that he did not expect a big eruption but added ""we have to stay alert and anticipate."" The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their made to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung’s alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers.

Special Correspondent,"Even as rains continued in the eastern hill areas of the district causing damage to property and crops, flood situation improved by Friday morning as water level in the rivers started receding. According to officials, the intensity of the rain tapered off by Friday morning and the sky was not as cloudy as it had been over the past few days. The water level in the upstream of the Valapattanam river at Iritty started receding by Friday morning. Many villages in the Iritty taluk had experienced the fury of the rains and landslips in several places that caused heavy damage to property and crops. “The flood situation in the Iritty taluk has improved now as the water level in the Iritty river (which is the upstream of the Valapattanam river) has come down by 10 ft on Friday,” Iritty tahsildar K.K. Divakaran said. No landslips had been reported from any part of the taluk since Friday evening, he added. According to official figures, 205 houses in the district suffered damage in the floods and landslips and 21 of them were completely destroyed. As many as 633 people from 198 families were shifted to relief camps. Though flood water in the area has started receding, around 300 houses continue to be inundated. The floods and landslips caused greater damage at Ayyankunnu, Nuchyad, Vayathur, Chavassery, Kolari, Vilamana, Kelakam, Aralam, Irikkur, Kottiyur, Erivessi, Chengalayi, and Ulikkal villages. Crop losses at Erivessi, Ulikkal, Kelakam, and Ayyankunnu villages were estimated at ₹52,66,840. The revenue authorities ordered residents of the slopes at Kolithattu to move to safer places as they are facing danger from huge boulders in the upper parts that are likely to roll down following the landslips in the area. A team of 80 Army jawans are engaged in relief and rescue operations in this part. Officials informed that a medical team comprising three doctors and five nurses visited the relief camps and distributed medicines. In another development, the pumping of water from the Pazhassi reservoir for drinking water supply was suspended because of the high turbidity in the water caused by landslips and mudflow. The KWA authorities informed that drinking water supply for Kannur Corporation, Peralassery, and Kolacheri was disrupted because of the suspension of pumping.",Water level in Iritty river comes down by 10 ft; no landslips since Friday evening,2018-08-10T18:00:13Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Flood situation improves,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/flood-situation-improves/article24659747.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,mudflow,1
ABC News,"Guatemala's Volcano of Fire erupted over the weekend, spewing deadly clouds and rivers of ash and pulverized rock. It is one of 11 active volcanoes in the Central America country that is along the so-called Ring of Fire. Some questions and answers about the volcano: HOW BIG IS IT? At its peak, the volcano is 12,346 feet (3,763 meters) above sea level. It's an example of one of the tallest and most violent types of volcanoes in the world, its steep sides made out of accumulated layers of lava and ash. The volcano is 27 miles (44 kilometers) west of Guatemala City and only about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the colonial city of Antigua, one of Guatemala's most popular tourist destinations. HOW ACTIVE IS IT? This volcano is probably the most active in Guatemala, according to the country's National Institute for Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. Records of activity go back to the 1500s and recent reports show that the volcano has been continuously erupting since 2002. Before Sunday's eruptions, the most recent event began May 17, when a mudflow of water and rocks started moving down the slope of the volcano, followed by explosions and ash plumes that rose almost 3,300 feet (1 kilometer). The eruptions continued for at least four days but were much smaller than Sunday's major eruption, which reached almost 15,000 feet (4.5 kilometers). WAS THERE A WARNING? Authorities say they were closely monitoring the volcano after activity picked up around 6 a.m. Sunday. But there was no indication that any eruption would be any worse than previous ones, and no evacuations were ordered. The disaster agency Conred issued standard precautions, telling people to wear face masks and cover their food and water supply. A powerful explosion about 2 p.m. sent a river of red-hot ash and rock down the volcano's flanks. ""It traveled much faster. It arrived in communities right when the evacuation alerts were being generated,"" Conred spokesman David de Leon said. WHAT IS THE RING OF FIRE? It's a horseshoe-shaped region surrounding the Pacific Ocean that stretches from South America, up the western coast of North America, and rounds to Japan, the Philippines and New Zealand. Along a series of fault lines, it contains about three-quarters of the world's active volcanoes. While it's called a ring, Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University in West Virginia, says the volcanoes are not really connected. The eruption of one of them will not set off its neighbors, she said. IS HAWAII'S KILAUEA VOLCANO DIFFERENT? Yes, Kilauea is a different kind of volcano. It started as an underwater volcano and built itself up with continuous lava flows that formed a shield-like shape with gentle slopes. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983. It's not in the Ring of Fire and the possibility that it may have triggered Guatemala's Volcano of Fire is extremely small, according to Krippner. It's very rare for one volcano to trigger another, she said. ——— AP reporter E.

"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Afp, By Afp","Mount Mayon spews lava and ash from its crater -- debris that experts warn could be dislodged by heavy rain The threat of catastrophic mudflows is building on the slopes of an erupting Philippine volcano where nearly 90,000 residents have been moved out of harm's way, authorities said Tuesday. Mount Mayon has spewed millions of tonnes of ash, rocks, lava and debris in less than three weeks, much of it loosely lodged on its burnt slopes and which experts warn could be dislodged by heavy rain. Activity continued overnight with ""energetic lava effusion"", while previously extruded lava was also collapsing on the crater, only to be pushed out again as debris, the state volcanology office said in its latest bulletin. Loud booming sounds, like that of thunder, accompanied the eruptions, an AFP photographer near the mountain said. ""The public is strongly advised to be vigilant and desist from entering the eight-kilometre (five-mile) -radius danger zone, and to be additionally vigilant against pyroclastic density currents, lahars, and sediment-laden stream flows,"" the bulletin said. Steaming lava and pyroclastic deposits cascade down the slopes of Mount Mayon Pyroclastic currents are the superheated clouds of gas, ash and other volcanic debris that burn everything in their path as they speed down the slopes of the 2,460-metre (8,070-foot) mountain, located 330 kilometres southeast of Manila. The institute said these materials are building blocks for ""lahar"" -- mammoth debris flows that could find their way into streams and rivers and mow down surrounding communities. An earlier Mayon eruption passed without any casualties in 2006, but four months later a typhoon unleashed an avalanche of volcanic mud from its slopes, killing about 1,000 people. On Saturday the volcanology institute issued its first ""lahar"" warning on Mayon this year due to incessant rain that is usual in the region at this time of year. A day later the institute made a video recording of lahar flowing down a river near Daraga town south of the volcano, though it did not cause any damage or casualties.

Joseph Serna,"In the days before deadly mudslides devastated Montecito, Santa Barbara County officials released conflicting evacuation orders that left some hard-hit neighborhoods out of the warning zone. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office posted on its website and on Facebook a list of voluntary and mandatory evacuation areas for the town. But a separate map on the county’s main website included a larger voluntary evacuation zone that included dozens of homes not covered by the sheriff’s list. Of the 21 people killed in the mudslide, at least a dozen lived in areas that were covered by the county’s evacuation map but not included in the Sheriff’s Office warnings, according to records and data reviewed by The Times. In response to questions from The Times, Santa Barbara County emergency officials acknowledged the discrepancy while emphasizing the many other measures officials took to warn residents of an approaching storm that caused the mudslides, including emails, social media alerts, press releases and even deputies going door to door in some areas. “Regrettably, however, also 30 hours prior to the storms arrival, I approved a press release and Facebook that had discrepancies with the the western boundary of our intended voluntary evacuation area,” Robert Lewin, San Barbara County’s director of the Office of Emergency Management, said in a statement. Officials emphasized that all those who died were in a voluntary or mandatory evacuation zone and that the warnings probably saved more lives in what were the worst mudslides to hit California in several decades. It remains far from clear whether a broader evacuation warning would have made a difference. Officials estimated that only 15% of the residents in the mandatory evacuation zone left the area. But the discrepancy in the warnings adds to questions about whether more could have been done to get people out of harm’s way before the mudslides swallowed homes and buried residents. The Times reported earlier that the county did not send out Amber Alert-style bulletins to cellphones until the mudslides had begun. By then, it was too late for residents to flee. There were also technical snafus that prevented earlier warnings from getting to residents. County officials said it’s important to now learn from the mudslides — as well as the fires that swept through the area weeks earlier — to improve evacuation preparations and warnings. “If you’re not learning from every disaster and figuring out what to do better, than in my view you’re not doing your job,” said County Supervisor Das Williams, who represents Montecito and Carpinteria, in an interview last week. “Obviously in retrospect it would’ve helped to have more evacuated. But I don’t think there was any disagreement.” On Jan. 15, Santa Barbara County firefighters survey a wall of debris jammed under a bridge from the deadly rains and mudflow of Jan. 9 in Montecito. Blake Herman / Associated Press The county had been warning for days of the coming rains and the mudslide risk. But there has been much debate about the actual evacuation orders. At a news conference in Carpinteria on Jan. 5, Williams and others officials stood in front of a map that outlined what was possible in a 100- or 500-year storm for the county’s beach enclaves. In Montecito, the map showed that the areas that would be hit hardest ran parallel to creeks that emerged from the foothill canyons and wounds south to the ocean. The hardest hit areas would be south of Highway 192 as mud and debris became lodged under bridges and in catch basins, eventually pushing the mud into residential streets. In the end, that’s exactly what happened the morning of Jan. 9. Authorities followed boundaries of evacuation zones similar to ones that had been established weeks earlier for the Thomas fire, where homes north of Highway 192 were deemed most at risk. Homes below the highway were considered to be in voluntary evacuation areas and not vulnerable to a landslide. Sheriff Bill Brown, who ultimately makes the decision on the evacuation plan, said he approved the zones at the recommendation of local and county firefighters, emergency planners and experts from the U.S. Geological Survey, among others. In the end, the rain was worse than expected, and the mud caused destruction much farther south than the initial estimates. “The storm that was predicted, the storm that we prepared for, was not the storm that we received,” Brown said. “We knew that it was going to be bad. But looking at years gone by and where damaged occurred … the destruction was not anything close to the magnitude of this.” Los Angeles Times Ahead of the storm, Williams said many of his constituents were doubtful that the runoff would live up the hype. At the Jan. 5 news conference, Williams said that the storm posed a “very clear and present danger” to vulnerable areas. “The night of the storm I was monitoring Facebook and the tone I got from the community was, ‘If the storm doesn’t materialize, heads are gonna roll,’” he said. “We’re ready to hold people accountable for getting people all excited.” It was a skepticism that sheriff’s deputies witnessed first-hand. One resident wrote on social media that it took a 20-minute conversation with officials before they ultimately decided to leave their home for the night. “I’ve seen experts opine about how you essentially not only have to warn people but you sort of have to convince people,” Brown said. “That’s a difficult order, but one we’re obviously going to have to take a look at.” But there isn’t a lot of science available on what message will truly make people appreciate a danger they cannot see, said Art Botterell, senior emergency services coordinator with the governor’s office. “I’m afraid what makes them resonate is bitter experience,” he said. “If people haven’t experienced a hazard recently, they tend not to personalize it.” Warnings need to be repeated and reinforced with other indicators, he said. If a resident sees a warning about a landslide from the National Weather Service and looks outside and only sees drizzling rain, they won’t be convinced, Botterell said. But if other neighbors are leaving, they might take it more seriously. Or if a message from the weather service is followed up by a text alert from the county, then a broadcast on TV, radio or social media, the chances of people heeding the warning increases, he said. “It’s just like advertising — repeated impressions make a difference,” Botterell said. The danger of debris flows or floods are particularly challenging because they’re stealthy, according to experts. In most cases, people can see a fire raging over a hillside and smell it from miles away. A landslide moves in with a whisper. “People are going to evacuate when there’s a cop on every corner. They’ll stay out when there’s National Guard on every street,” said James Langhorne, who was the fire marshal for the Montecito Fire Protection District for 23 years before retiring nine years ago. “The real issue is that people have to own a piece of this thing. It’s not something you can do for them.” Jon Schleuss / Los Angeles Times County officials are eager to say their best option for messaging is their Aware and Prepare community alert initiative, a set of subscriber-based warning systems that can send timely texts, phone calls, tweets and emails to its users when a disaster is imminent or unfolding in real time. But there are clear flaws in systems like these, said Botterell. For one, visitors in a tourist-reliant community like Montecito don’t receive the messages because they haven’t signed up. Service workers who live on their employer’s property could also miss out. Records show that Santa Barbara County relied almost exclusively on its Aware and Prepare initiative to distribute information to subscribers ahead of, during and after the storm, along with social media postings and traditional news media. Officials told The Times on Friday that about 50,000 people, or barely more than 10% of the county, is enrolled in the program. Thousands of additional landline calls were made through reverse 911. It wasn’t until the storm was at its peak and homes were being washed away that the County Office of Emergency Management used a federal warning system to send a message to all cellphones in the affected area that they should take action, regardless of subscription. Currently the system only allows agencies to send out 90-character texts to phones — not enough to give accurate details on the nature and location of a threat. That will change in May 2019 when the character limit jumps to 360, Botterell said. But there needs to be a physical warning infrastructure in place too, Brown suggested, something along the lines of sirens, “because it doesn’t matter how many messages you send out if you don’t have your phone or if they’re not at their computer.” Travis Zehntner looks over the remains of destroyed homes on Glen Oaks Drive in Montecito on Jan. 11.

"James Queally, Melissa Etehad, Brittny Mejia","The death toll from a massive debris flow that buried homes and cars under a torrent of mud and boulders has risen to 15 in Montecito, where local personnel and the U.S. Coast Guard are planning to continue rescue operations Wednesday morning. About 300 people remained stuck in their homes in Montecito’s Romero Canyon neighborhood and throughout the debris field, where authorities planned to launch helicopter rescues at daybreak. The mudslides began around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, when intense rains dislodged boulders and caused heavy mudflow along hillsides that were scarred by the sprawling Thomas fire late last year. A number of homes were ripped from their foundations, with some pulled more than a half-mile by water and mud before they broke apart. “It looked like a World War I battlefield,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said Tuesday. Sources: Santa Barbara County, Mapzen, OpenStreetMap @latimesgraphics Sources: Santa Barbara County, Mapzen, OpenStreetMap @latimesgraphics The death toll rose to 15 overnight, according to Amber Anderson, a public information officer for the multi-agency response to the disaster. At least 25 other people had been reported injured, and 24 more are missing, she said. Officials have yet to publicly identify any of those killed in the mudslides. Mike Eliason, public information officer for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, said there were juveniles among the deceased. With much of the area still inaccessible, officials have said they fear the number of people killed in the mudslides could rise. PHOTOS | Thousands evacuated as first major rainstorm in a year hits Southern California » Sheriffs deputies carry a body from the debris near Hot Springs Road in Montecito after a major storm hit the burn area Tuesday. Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times Southern California was drenched Tuesday, but nowhere did the rainstorm inflict more pain than in Montecito, just weeks after the coastal community dealt with the devastating Thomas fire. Some 500 firefighters from across the state rushed to help, with crews struggling through clogged roads, waist-deep mud and downed trees throughout the day in search of victims. Dozens of survivors were hoisted to safety in helicopters. The rain overwhelmed the south-facing slopes above Montecito, flooding the creek and sending mud and boulders into residential neighborhoods, officials said. On Wednesday morning, the noise of construction crews using bulldozers to move boulders and fallen trees along Sycamore Canyon Road and Hot Springs road echoed down empty streets. Thick mud and downed power lines filled the streets. As the rescue crews tried to open pathways, some residents walked through the mud hoping to aid in the search for missing relatives and friends. With a shovel in one hand, a man who asked to be identified only as Mikey smoked a cigarette and then started shoveling mud and debris from the intersection. He had been out since 5 a.m looking for his girlfriend’s missing sisters: Morgan and Sawyer Corey. He said their house, located roughly a half mile away in Sycamore Canyon Road, had been swept away. “They are good people,” he said with tears in his eyes. “I’m hoping to find them.” As he waded through deep mud, Montecito resident Ben Ekler said his friend’s mother and two children were swept away during Tuesday morning’s deluge. The mother and one of the children were found and are recovering at an area hospital, he said. But the other child is still missing. At least 7,000 people have been evacuated from the area. As part of ongoing rescue efforts, a “public safety exclusion zone” has been established in Montecito. Residents in areas west of Sheffield Drive, East Valley Road and Ladera Lane, east of Olive Mill and Hot Springs Road, north of the ocean, and south of the U.S. Forest Service boundary are being asked to shelter in place and not move around the area. The move is designed to ease the task faced by rescue personnel, and those spotted in the area without approval could face arrest, authorities said. A number of helicopter rescues are planned Wednesday in Romero Canyon, an area where about 300 people remain trapped in their homes. Rescue officials do not believe the people stuck there are injured, but the mudslides have made the area inaccessible by ground. “So far there isn’t a concern about anybody being in any potential danger in that area,” said Rosie Narez, a spokeswoman for the multi-agency storm response. “There’s no way in or out, so I mean, at some point … you’re going to run out of stuff, so you’re going to need help.” Wednesday’s rescue efforts will focus on the aerial evacuation of those trapped in Romero Canyon, as well as clearing mud-caked roadways so emergency personnel can access homes that were hit hard by the debris flow, according to Eliason. Helicopters and rescue workers from the U.S. Coast Guard and National Guard, as well as firefighters and helicopters from fire departments in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties have all descended on Montecito, Eliason said. An airship with night-vision capabilities hovered over the damaged area through the early morning hours. With the rain stopped, Eliason said rescue crews remain hopeful they can soon reach others who are trapped. “The weather was favorable. Search and rescue is still very confident that we’re still in that window for rescue mode,” he said. “We’re actively pursuing trying to get in there as quick as we can to get those people to safety.” Deadly flooding on Santa Barbara coast as fire turns to mud » Rescuing those trapped in Romero Canyon and reaching other homes that were made inaccessible by the mudslides remains a priority, he said, because many of those people could be without crucial supplies. “A majority of Montecito and that whole area is in the Stone Age right now,” Eliason said. “There is no water. There is no gas. There is no electricity.” The storm system that hit Southern California beginning Monday dumped more than 5 inches of rain on some parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and officials had been concerned that sections of the state damaged by last month’s wildfires would be susceptible to heavy mudflows. Soil scorched by fire is less able to absorb water. Mudflows washed out a nearly 30-mile stretch of the 101 Freeway between Santa Barbara and Ventura, and also prompted evacuations in parts of Burbank and Los Angeles on Tuesday. The heavy weather also caused a surge in motor vehicle accidents across the Southland, according to the California Highway Patrol. But Santa Barbara County clearly took the brunt of the damage, where mud, boulders, husks of cars and housing frames were common sights. The section of Montecito that was hit hardest was actually south of the Thomas fire’s burn scar, and not subject to mandatory evacuation, according to Eliason. But a creek that feeds the Pacific Ocean swelled early Tuesday morning, raining boulders and flood waters onto residents as they slept. The rains were like a starter’s gun for many in Montecito and nearby Carpinteria. Peter Lapidus said the sound of droplets pummeling his home forced him out of bed around 4 a.m. Tuesday. “It was like a bomb went off,” he said. “It wasn’t raining hard, and then it was like you flipped a switch.” Maude Feil, who was traversing the mud on Olive Mill Road with a walking stick Wednesday morning, said the area looked “like an apocalypse happened” when she first emerged from her home the day before. As she walked, she made a grim discovery when she spotted what she thought was a mannequin beneath railroad tricks “It was a woman’s body,” she said. Feil had to evacuate during the Thomas fire, and said she was worried survivors who managed to get through the wildfire unscathed may have lost everything they own in Tuesday’s debris flow “I’ve never been so close to a fire in my whole entire life, then this,” she said. “People who didn’t lose their house in the fire — they just lost huge things in the mud. It’s like a war zone or something.” Etehad and Mejia reported from Montecito. Queally reported from Los Angeles.

"Breno Nunes, Senior Lecturer in Sustainable Operations Management, Aston University, Flávio Hourneaux Junior, Assistant Professor of Business Administration, Universidade de São Paulo","People learn by making mistakes. The same is true for firms and society success depends on being able to internalise lessons and behave differently in future, to avoid repeating the same errors. Firms tend to review their organisational structures and routine practises to flag problems before they occur, or respond quickly to unexpected problems to minimise their impact.
This is apparently not the case with Vale, however the fifth largest mining company in the world. Vale is the worlds biggest producer of iron ore and nickel and is also responsible for what may be the largest environmental disaster in Brazils history, after one of its tailings dams an embankment which is supposed to hold back a vast reservoir of toxic mining byproducts collapsed on January 25, 2019 at the Corrego do Feijao mine in south-eastern Brazil. 
Following the collapse, 186 people were confirmed dead and 122 are still missing. Official data from the Brazilian Environmental Agency says that the mudflow destroyed 270 hectares, of which more than half was native vegetation or protected forest. The swathe of natural habitat destroyed is equivalent to 300 football pitches. Tragically, this happened only three years after a similar accident on another of Vales dams in the southern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, near the city of Mariana, which killed 19 people.
Rescue teams continue the search for survivors.EPA-EFE/PAULO FONSECA
By any measure of business sustainability, Brumadinho has been a heavy blow to Vales performance and reputation. Since then, the company has had its credit rating downgraded, not to mention suffered crippling damage to its public image.
Vale appointed Fabio Schvartsman as CEO after the Mariana disaster in November 2015. Schvartsman took the job and announced to shareholders, employees and the Brazilian people a strong slogan: Mariana, never again. He failed miserably. 
Considering Vales recent history and the magnitude of these disasters, the corporate response to Brumadinhos tragedy seems ludicrous. Schvartsman said to the Brazilian parliament, in a session which assessed the condition of other mining dams in Brazil after the collapse at Brumadinho:
Vale is a Brazilian jewel that cannot be condemned for an accident that took place in one of their dams as much, as it was [considered] a tragedy.
Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman attends a hearing in the Chamber of Deputies, in Brasilia, Brazil on February 14, 2019.EPA-EFE/JOEDSON ALVES
Despite his confidence, questions remain unanswered. Why didnt the company move a canteen that was below the dam level and in a high risk area, according to the assessment of reports dated October 3, 2018?
The precautionary principle states that if an operation has a risk that might cause severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, that operation must be stopped even if the likelihood of it happening is low. So why wasnt this applied?
Since standards clearly hadnt improved over the last three years, how can Brazilians now trust the safety of other dams? Considering the normal course of an accident, why did sirens allegedly fail to work when the dam collapsed to alert employees and the local community to evacuate? 
Vale must account for its operational failure with the same gravity as is the standard in developed countries. The Canadian mining company Imperial Metals is still suffering from the environmental liabilities of the Mount Polley mine disaster in Canada. 
Mourners hold a vigil for victims of the tragedy at Brumadinho.EPA-EFE/Lucas Landau Scene
There is precedent for CEOs and executives to be forced to resign after serious errors, such as the former CEO of BP, Tony Hayward, who resigned after the Deepwater Horizon disaster that killed 11 people in 2010. Schvartsmans temporary resignation sends an unclear message about the companys commitments to the lives of its employees and the communities it operates in. 
Vales next CEO will need to go beyond Schvartsmans rhetoric and consider what stricter operating procedures might be necessary. Otherwise, it could only be a matter of time before the next accident. There are more than 50 similar dams still functioning under Vales operations in Minas Gerais state alone that could be another tragedy waiting to happen.
Vale cannot operate at the expense of lives and environmental destruction. Brumadinho can still be a turning point in the history of the company and show it is able to learn to better avoid accidents and tragedies. It may still transform itself into a more responsible company. For that, however, it will need to urgently embrace change as never before.","The tailing dam collapse at the Brumadinho mine has shocked the world, but can we really be sure that 'never again' truly means never again?",2019-03-08T16:11:22Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theconversation.com'}",Brumadinho dam collapse: mining industry needs radical change to avoid future disasters,http://theconversation.com/brumadinho-dam-collapse-mining-industry-needs-radical-change-to-avoid-future-disasters-112808,https://images.theconversation.com/files/262695/original/file-20190307-82669-svbnnk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C365%2C2200%2C1100&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,,Theconversation.com,mudflow,1
"Brittany Brand, Assistant Professor of Geosciences, Boise State University","Lava flow moves in the Leilani Estates subdivision near Pahoa on the island of Hawaii, May 6, 2018. USGS via AP, CC BY Volcanoes are beautiful and awe-inspiring, but the ongoing eruption of Kilauea on Hawaii’s Big Island is showing how dangerous these events can be. So far this event has destroyed dozens of homes and displaced hundreds of people, but no deaths or serious injuries have been reported. Other volcanic eruptions have had deadlier impacts. As a volcano scientist, I’m very aware of deadly volcanic eruptions can be, even the “nonexplosive” kind we’re seeing in Hawaii now. Since A.D. 1500, volcanic eruptions have killed more than 278,000 people. Today there are 1,508 active volcanoes around the world. Each year, some 50 to 60 of them erupt. Around 800 million people live within volcanic risk zones. Volcanologists study and monitor volcanoes so that we can try to forecast future eruptions and predict how widely the damage could reach. When mountains explode Volcanic eruptions can be broadly divided into two types: explosive and nonexplosive. Explosive eruptions occur when magma, which is molten rock in the ground, contains gas. These eruptions are so energetic that the magma is pulverized into small rock particles, called volcanic ash. Explosive eruptions are responsible for the highest number of volcanic-related deaths. These events can distribute volcanic ash hundreds of miles from the volcano, causing billions of dollars in air travel disruption, water supply pollution and damage to power lines, structures and machinery. Krakatoa in the Pacific (1883) and Mount St. Helens in Washington state (1980) are examples of explosive eruptions. U.S. Geological Survey scientists recount their experiences before, during and after the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57 people, including a USGS researcher. The most dangerous features of these events are volcanic ash flows – swift, ground-hugging avalanches of searing hot gas, ash and rock that destroy everything in their path. Ash flows produced during the A.D. 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy entombed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. In 1902, ash flows from the eruption of Mount Pelee on the Caribbean island of Martinique killed more than 29,000 people. Lava flows and fountains Nonexplosive eruptions occur when little to no gas is contained within the magma. These events produce small fire fountains and lava flows, such as those currently erupting from Kilauea. Nonexplosive eruptions tend to be less deadly than explosive eruptions, but can still cause great disruption and destruction. Eruptions at Hawaiian-style volcanoes can occur at the summit or along the flanks. New eruptions typically begin with the opening of a fissure, or long crack, that spews molten lava into the air and sometimes forms lava flows. As reports from Hawaii are showing, lava tends to flow rather slowly. Typically it is easy to outrun a lava flow but impossible to stop or divert it. People can escape, but homes and property are vulnerable. Lava flows and fountains consuming homes and property in Leilani Estates on the island of Hawaii. Both explosive and nonexplosive eruptions release volcanic gases, producing a hazardous blend called volcanic fog, or VOG. VOG contains aerosols – fine particles created when sulfur dioxide reacts with moisture in the air. It can cause health problems, damage crops and pollute water supplies. These particles have global consequences when eruptions eject them into the stratosphere, where they block sunlight, cooling Earth’s climate. This effect can cause widespread crop failure and famine and is responsible for many historic volcanic-related deaths. For example, the 1815 explosive eruption of Tambora in Indonesia caused 92,000 starvation-related deaths. VOG (volcanic fog), produced by gases from Kilauea, hangs low over the Hawaiian Islands on December 3, 2008, producing unhealthy sulfur dioxide concentrations. NASA Earth Observatory Snow-capped volcanoes, such as those in the Cascades and Alaska, can produce mudflows, or lahars. These hazards form when ice and snow melt during an eruption, or ash is washed loose from the surface by heavy rain. Mudflows have tremendous energy and can travel up to 60 miles per hour down river valleys. They are capable of destroying bridges, structures, and anything else in their path. A mudflow from the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia killed 25,000 people. Getting ready for the next eruption By studying past and current eruptions, volcanologists constantly refine our ability to predict and mitigate the hazards and risk associated with volcanic activity. But people who live within range of volcanic hazards also can minimize their risk. All residents of these zones should develop household plans for evacuating or sheltering in place and prepare emergency kits with first aid supplies, essential medicines, food and water. Events like the Kilauea eruption are reminders that preparing before natural disasters can make communities more resilient when these events strike.

Leslie Eastman,"A massive winter storm drenched parts of Southern California this week, leading to deadly mudslides. The city of Montecito, close to Santa Barbara, was hardest hit. Cal Fire puts the affected area at 30 square miles. Seventeen people dead, 28 injured, eight missing. Sixty-five homes confirmed destroyed and more than 400 damaged. Fourteen helicopters and four water rescue teams were aiding the effort. And rescue teams were still slogging through the mud, hunting for the missing and assessing the damage. …Marco Farrell, 45, said he was two blocks away when he saw the slide descending on Olive Mill Road. “I heard rumbling and ran for my life,” he said. “Literally. Ran for my life.” A wall of water carrying uprooted trees and boulders flowed like a river through the residential street. About a block up from Farrell’s home, firefighters were helping Devon Crail and his wife, Tiare, retrieve items from his parents’ house. This BBC video depicts a mudflow that transports a car through the city: Perhaps one of the most chilling accounts of the disaster comes from Berkeley Johnson and his wife Karen, who escaped onto the roof of their home in Montecito as mud slammed into the building. But after the flooding had subsided, they heard a baby crying and climbed down from the roof to begin searching. Mr Johnson told the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper that the pair joined a fireman to dig the toddler out, before scooping mud out of her mouth. “We got it out, got the mud out of its mouth. I’m hoping it’s okay. They took it right to the hospital.” “Had we not gone over there, I don’t think that kid would have [survived],” he added. A factor contributing to the disaster was the suite of wildfires that hit the region, rendering the soil unable to absorb the deluge that hit the region during the most recent winter storm. [I]ntense wildfires transform rich soil into a dense, water-repellent surface. To make matters worse, biologists have found that when rain hits the charred landscape, it can become even more dense and more water repellent. It’s a long-term effect, too, which means Santa Barbara County will be prone to flooding and mudslides for years to come, potentially. Another contributing factor is that alerts about potential mudslides did not go out until the flows began. Santa Barbara County officials chose not to send an emergency alert to cellphones warning of mudslides until destructive flooding had already begun in Montecito, officials said Wednesday. The message, similar to an Amber Alert for abducted children, was sent about 3:50 a.m. Tuesday to all registered cellphones in areas that were under voluntary and mandatory evacuations because of heavy rains that threatened mudflows in the wake of the Thomas fire, officials said. It’s unclear how many people actually got the alert. But by then, tons of mud, trees, rocks and other debris were rolling down hills that had been burned in the largest fire on record in California. Finally, many Montecito residents ignored the initial warnings. For days, officials advised residents in areas burned by the Thomas fire that a coming storm could bring major mudflows. The McManigals’ neighborhood was under a voluntary evacuation order. Many residents decided to stay. Some assumed the threat was overblown just weeks after the fire triggered similar calls to evacuate. But when the earth began to move, it was too late. The power of the debris flow destroyed everything in its path and there was no time to flee. There are plenty of lessons to be learned here, and I sure hope that officials in these disaster zones do more that politically posture about global warming instead of trying to develop infrastructure and response plans that will prevent another 17 deaths next fire season.","""I heard rumbling and ran for my life.""",2018-01-12T16:00:16Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Legalinsurrection.com'}",December’s California wildfires lead to January’s deadly mudslides,https://legalinsurrection.com/2018/01/decembers-california-wildfires-lead-to-januarys-deadly-mudslides/,https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/LI-83-Montecito-Mudslides.png,,Legalinsurrection.com,mudflow,1

PHOTO: AFP The speed of the eruption took locals by surprise, and could be explained by it producing pyroclastic flows, sudden emissions of gas and rock fragments, rather than lava, said volcanologist David Rothery of Britain’s Open University. “A lava flow rarely travels fast enough to engulf people,” he said. “The videos and still images I’ve seen suggest instead one or more pyroclastic flows. This is when a violently erupted mass of rock fragments and hot gas finds itself too dense to rise as an ash column and instead cascades down the volcano’s slopes. Residents carry the coffins of seven people who died following the eruption of the Fuego volcano, along the streets of Alotenango municipality, Sacatepequez, about 65 km southwest of Guatemala City, on June 4, 2018. Rescue workers Monday pulled more bodies from under the dust and rubble left by an explosive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, bringing the death toll to at least 62. PHOTO:AFP “Pyroclastic flows or surges can move at over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, and may be hot enough to glow like molten lava. They can travel further, as well as much faster, than lava flows,” said Rothery. Fuego has been erupting since 2002, and was continuously active in 2017. There were explosions and ash plumes and a volcanic mudflow last month.

jespinosa,"GUINOBATAN, Albay — Residents from villages at the foot of Mayon Volcano, collectively called Mayon Unit, who are vulnerable to mud or lahar flow were evacuated to this town’s center in anticipation of Tropical Depression “Amang.”
Teresita Alcantara III, Guinobatan disaster officer, said that there were already 865 families or 2,946 persons evacuated as of 9 a.m. Sunday. The pre-emptive evacuation started Saturday.
The evacuees came from the villages of Maninila, Tandarora, and Sitio (sub-village) Basiao in Muladbucad Grande.
Guinobatan mayor Ann Gemma Ongjoco ordered the mandatory pre-emptive evacuation to residents living within 6 kilometer permanent danger zone of Mayon Volcano particularly in the villages that frequently experience mudflow during heavy downpour.
Meanwhile, in Polangui and Libon towns, mandatory pre-emptive evacuations were also ordered by mayors Cherilie Sampal and Das Maronilla to residents of areas prone to landslide and flood in order to attain the “zero casualty goal.” /je

FIRDIA LISNAWATI and STEPHEN WRIGHT,"FIRDIA LISNAWATI AND STEPHEN WRIGHT Last updated 06:51, November 28 2017 Indonesia has closed the holiday island's airport and told residents around Mount Agung volcano to immediately evacuate as it raised its warning to the highest level. Indonesian authorities ordered 100,000 people to flee on Monday from an erupting volcano on Bali that forced the island's international airport to close, stranding large numbers of travellers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3000 metres into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12km away. If you are in Bali, send us your reaction, photos and videos to newstips@stuff.co.nz Mount Agung volcano is spewing smoke and ash. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. READ MORE: * Bali volcano: Is it still safe to travel? * Tradition pulls some to Bali volcano * Thousands flee 'imminent' Bali volcano eruption When Mount Agung last erupted in 1963 it killed more than 1000 people and razed several villages. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early on Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10km in places from the previous 7.5km. It said a larger eruption is possible. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1100 people. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. Bali's airport is closed, with hundreds of flights cancelled. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centres after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ""will certainly spill over to the slopes,"" Sutopo said. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation centre. Smoke and ash from Mount Agung rises over eastern Bali at a height of just over 3000 metres. ""We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just three miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,"" she said. The family had stayed at the same sports centre in September and October when the volcano's alert was at the highest level for several weeks but it didn't erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. ""If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I'll just accept it if our house is destroyed,"" she said. Ash up to half a centimetre thick has settled on villages. Bali's airport was closed on Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers. The closure was in effect until Tuesday morning, though officials said the situation would be reviewed every six hours. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali's I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transitting flights. An officer with the disaster management agency BPBD places a mask on child at a shelter for residents. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about five million visitors a year. A Chinese tour service, Shenzhen PT Enjoy Bali International, had about 20 groups totaling 500 to 600 travellers from the Chinese cities of Wuhan, Changsha and Guangzhou in Bali, according an executive, Liao Yuling, who was on the island. ""They are mostly retirees or relatively high-end, so they don't say they are especially anxious to rush home,"" she said by telephone. The company was waiting to see whether Bali's airport might open on Tuesday, said Liao. If not, she said buses and ferries would be arranged to take travellers to Surabaya on Java, where the company's charter flights could pick them up. ""We are not really affected, because the volcano is too far away. It is about 70km from us,"" said Liao. ""We only can say we saw pictures of it on television."" Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia's tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and disrupted daily life outside the immediate danger zone.

AP,"Karangasem, Indonesia: Indonesian authorities raised the alert for a rumbling volcano on Bali to the highest level on Monday, stranding tens of thousands of travellers as ash clouds forced the closure of the tourist island’s international airport. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 metres into the atmosphere since the weekend. Video released by the national disaster agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after tests indicated ash had reached its airspace and authorities raised the volcano’s alert to the highest danger level. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. However he said he’s still not expecting a major eruption. “We don’t expect a big eruption but we have to stay alert and anticipate,” he said on Indonesian TV. The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. The exclusion zone around the crater was widened to 10 kilometres. Previously it ranged between 6 and 7.5 kilometers. Ash up to half a centimetre thick has settled on villages around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend.

AP,"By: AP | Published: January 14, 2018 12:33 pm Santa Barbara County Fire Capt Adam Estabrook and Engineer Rick Pinal search through a debris pile behind a home destroyed by mudflow and debris in Montecito, California, US, January 13. (Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire/Handout via Reuters) Recovery crews are slowly making progress digging away masses of mud, boulders and toppled trees in a California community that was ravaged by deadly mudslides, but officials said they’ve removed enough debris from creek canals to prevent another potential disaster when the next rainstorm hits. Workers were using backhoes, jackhammers and chain saws to clear the debris in Monticeto, nearly a week after a powerful storm sent flash floods cascading through mountain slopes that were burned bare by a huge wildfire in December. At least 19 people were killed and five others remained missing. In addition to trying to find those who are still missing after Tuesday morning’s storm, crews have made it a top priority to clear out debris basins and creek canals before another rainstorm. Long-range forecasts gave the crews about a week before the next chance of rain – and potential new mudslides – although the precipitation was expected to be disorganized and light. Another system was possible two days later. “If we don’t get those debris basins cleaned out, then we’re not going to be prepared for the storm and we don’t know what that storm is going to look like,” said Robert Lewin, Santa Barbara County’s emergency management director. The mudslides ravaged the tony community, destroying at least 65 homes and damaging more than 460 others, officials said. Firefighters went door to door along several blocks, checking the structural integrity of the damaged homes. The rest of the community’s infrastructure was also damaged. Some streets were cracked in half and authorities closed bridges and overpasses because they were unstable. “The bridges, the roads, they all need help,” Lewin said. SEE PHOTOS | California Mudslide: After Wildfire, State Devastated By Rains Eight large excavators were being used to clear the debris from Montecito Creek, Tom Fayram, the deputy director of the county’s flood control district, said. “Two days ago I passed by an area where there was no creek and today I went by and the creek was fully restored,” he said. “We are making great progress and we have several days before that next storm.” More than 2,000 searchers and recovery workers remained in the community late Saturday, carrying out backbreaking work in the summerlike weather that has made the stretch of Santa Barbara County coast about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles a haven for the wealthy, celebrities and tourists. Much of the community of about 9,000 remained under mandatory evacuation orders, even unscathed areas, as crews both removed debris and worked to restore water, sanitation, power and gas.

Bangkok Post Public Company Limited,"This aerial photo provided by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department shows mudflow and damage to homes in Montecito on Wednesday. (Matt Udkow/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via AP) MONTECITO, California: Hundreds of rescue workers slogged through knee-deep ooze and used long poles to probe for bodies Thursday as the search dragged on for victims of the mudslides that slammed this wealthy coastal town. Seventeen people were confirmed dead and eight others were missing. Another 28 people were injured. Twelve remained hospitalized, four in critical condition. Family members anxiously awaited word on loved ones who hadn't been heard from since the onslaught early Tuesday. ""It's just waiting and not knowing, and the more I haven't heard from them - we have to find them,"" said Kelly Weimer, whose elderly parents' home was wrecked. The couple, Jim and Alice Mitchell, did not heed a voluntary evacuation warning and stayed home to celebrate Jim Mitchell's 89th birthday. Santa Barbara County authorities sent a shudder through the community early Thursday when they reported that the number of people unaccounted for had surged from 16 to 48. But later in the morning, they said they had made a clerical error, and the actual number of missing was down to eight. As search dogs clambered on heaps of wood that used to be homes, mud-spattered rescue teams from all over California worked their way through the ruins of Montecito, an enclave of 9,000 people northwest of Los Angeles that is home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey. It was left covered with thick muck, boulders, wrecked cars, splintered lumber and tree limbs in a scene Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown likened to a World War I battlefield. Downtown, a quaint stretch of cafes and galleries normally bustling with tourists and locals was a staging area for fire trucks and heavy equipment Thursday. Fire and sheriff's officials hovered over a map spread across the hood of a truck while a fire crew made up of inmates loaded trucks for another day of debris removal. On the edge of the disaster zone, John Flynn looked dazed as he stood in the driveway of his home. Fallen power lines criss-crossed a neighbour's yard, trees lay like bowling pins, and the air smelled of wet ash and sewage. ""We came through OK. We are the lucky ones,"" he said, shaking his head with the knowledge that one stray boulder on a different trajectory could have taken out his hillside home. Down the block, just the crushed roof of a home stuck out of a sea of dark brown mud. After a better look at the damage, officials lowered the number of destroyed homes from 100 to 64 and raised the number of damaged ones from 300 to 446. By Wednesday, some 500 searchers had covered about 75 percent of the inundated area, authorities said. They had a long slog ahead, filled with hazards seen and unseen. ""A lot of the street signs are gone, the roads are impassable. It all has to be done on foot,"" said Deputy Dan Page, chief of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department rescue team. A firefighter stands on the roof of a house submerged in mud and rocks. (AP photo) Rescue crews worked up to 12 hours a day and risked stepping on nails or shattered glass, or being exposed to raw sewage, or dealing with leaking gas, Page said. ""We've gotten multiple reports of rescuers falling through manholes that were covered with mud, swimming pools that were covered up with mud,"" said Anthony Buzzerio, a Los Angeles County fire battalion chief. ""The mud is acting like a candy shell on ice cream. It's crusty on top but soft underneath, so we're having to be very careful."" Crews marked where bodies were found, often far away from a home, and used that information to guess where other victims might have ended up as the surging mud carried or buried them. People in Montecito had counted themselves lucky last month after the biggest wildfire in California history spared the town. But it was the fire that led to the mudslide, by burning away vegetation. ""We totally thought we were out of the woods,"" said Jennifer Markham, whose home escaped damage in both disasters. ""I was frozen yesterday morning thinking, 'This is a million times worse than that fire ever was'."" The mudslides were already occurring when Santa Barbara County officials first sent emergency alerts to cellphones in the area, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday. For days, the county had issued repeated warnings via social media, news media and emails about the potential for mudslides. But county emergency manager Jeff Gater said officials decided not to use the cellphone push alert system until 3:50 a.m. Tuesday out of concern it might not be taken seriously. Only an estimated 10 to 15 percent of residents fled when ordered, and much of the damage occurred where evacuations were voluntary. It could take days or even longer before the work is finished. ""That's always our mentality: 'Hey, we're going to find someone alive,'"" Page said. ""You never really know. You never know exactly what the human body is capable of."" In 2014, a mudslide in rural Oso in Washington state killed 43 people. The last body was found four months later.","MONTECITO, California: Hundreds of rescue workers slogged through knee-deep ooze and used long poles to probe for bodies Thursday as the search dragged on for victims of the mudslides that slammed this wealthy coastal town.

"Associated Press, By Associated Press","KARANGASEM, Indonesia — Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the island's international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travelers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it's rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7.5 kilometers. It said that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ""will certainly spill over to the slopes,"" Sutopo said. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that's serving as an evacuation center. ""We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,"" she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano's alert was at the highest level for several weeks but didn't erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. ""If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I'll just accept it if our house is destroyed,"" she said. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia's tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes.

CBC Archives,"For most people, decorating the house for Christmas involved putting up a tree and stringing some lights on the eavestrough, so CBC Midday host Kevin Newman told viewers in 1993.
But for Calgary resident Bob Found, the job was a little more elaborate, involving a ""complex series of computers, timers and high voltage."" 
Pointing to two panels connected by a profusion of power cords, Found explained ""all the equipment on the right-hand side here is essentially power supplies that convert house current into direct current for all my computers.""
The timer in the centre of one board simplified the process  ""all the relays are activated, all the power is supplied to all the computers and all the lights outside, all simultaneously without me having to be here and without any breakers being blown,"" he laughed.
And the end result was a show-stopping display, fired up with the help of a list of components that reporter Jennifer Webber read like a high-tech version of The Twelve Days of Christmas song: ""6 micro-controllers, 3 computers, 12 motors, 6 power supplies, 9 relays and over 5,000 lights.""
 Since it took 2,000 hours to build, she asked the obvious question, ""why do it?""  
 ""It started off as just an experiment to demonstrate principles of digital electronics to my students when I was teaching ... and from there it just grew,"" Found said. 
But the system wasn't just for show, as his use of discarded objects was innovative. As Found explained, ""I really think I'm ... a king of the recyclers, other people call me a junk collector but I do find a use for most of this stuff.""
The proof was in the elements of the computer system and the lights themselves  ""I made that computer, and I made these three boards from junk material.""
Outside, he showed how one figure was lit up  ""the angel's halo here is a platter from a hard disc, and the little blue part is a backlight from a little LCD TV, the lights ... are from an old mudflow computer used in oil drilling."" 
And for the crowning touch, ""the cover is a margarine container.""
The downside of all this complexity? ""If a bulb goes out I don't know if it's a problem with the computer, with the computer program, with one of my interface boards or any one of my wires.""
""But once running,"" added Webber, ""it's a high-tech Christmas dream.""","Back in 1993, Calgary tech teacher Bob Found turned a lesson plan into a show-stopping display of Christmas lights.",2018-12-20T13:30:00Z,"{'id': 'cbc-news', 'name': 'CBC News'}",FROM THE ARCHIVES | The Calgary Xmas light display that gave Clark Griswold a run for his money,https://www.cbc.ca/archives/the-calgary-xmas-light-display-that-gave-clark-griswold-a-run-for-his-money-1.4925476,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4925867.1545313803!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bob-found-s-house-in-calgary-was-a-showcase-for-his-computer-skills.jpg,cbc-news,CBC News,mudflow,1

https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"What happened? Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow. Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano in continental Europe and is thought to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. Every single resident died instantly when the southern Italian town was hit by a 500°C pyroclastic hot surge. Pyroclastic flows are a dense collection of hot gas and volcanic materials that flow down the side of an erupting volcano at high speed. They are more dangerous than lava because they travel faster, at speeds of around 450mph (700 km/h), and at temperatures of 1,000°C. An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century. His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unaware. Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours. While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life. Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. The Orto dei fuggiaschi (The garden of the Fugitives) shows the 13 bodies of victims who were buried by the ashes as they attempted to flee Pompeii during the 79 AD eruption of the Vesuvius volcano As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000. What have they found? This event ended the life of the cities but at the same time preserved them until rediscovery by archaeologists nearly 1700 years later. The excavation of Pompeii, the industrial hub of the region and Herculaneum, a small beach resort, has given unparalleled insight into Roman life. Archaeologists are continually uncovering more from the ash-covered city. In May archaeologists uncovered an alleyway of grand houses, with balconies left mostly intact and still in their original hues. A plaster cast of a dog, from the House of Orpheus, Pompeii, AD 79. Around 30,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day Some of the balconies even had amphorae - the conical-shaped terra cotta vases that were used to hold wine and oil in ancient Roman times. The discovery has been hailed as a 'complete novelty' - and the Italian Culture Ministry hopes they can be restored and opened to the public. Upper stores have seldom been found among the ruins of the ancient town, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius volcano and buried under up to six metres of ash and volcanic rubble. Around 30,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day.","The blast near Naples, which is thought to have killed 16,000 people, buried the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii in rock and deadly hot ash.",2018-10-09T15:05:17Z,"{'id': 'daily-mail', 'name': 'Daily Mail'}","Eruption of Mount Vesuvius may have killed people by EXPLODING their heads, ancient skulls reveal",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6256747/Eruption-Mount-Vesuvius-killed-people-EXPLODING-heads-ancient-skulls-reveal.html,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/09/15/4889116-0-image-a-31_1539095092069.jpg,daily-mail,Daily Mail,mudflow,1

When Mount Agung last erupted in 1963 it killed more than 1000 people and razed several villages. At Bali's airport flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali's I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transitting flights. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about five million visitors a year. Smoke and ash from Mount Agung rises over eastern Bali at a height of just over 3000 metres. A Chinese tour service, Shenzhen PT Enjoy Bali International, had about 20 groups totaling 500 to 600 travellers from the Chinese cities of Wuhan, Changsha and Guangzhou in Bali, according an executive, Liao Yuling, who was on the island. ""They are mostly retirees or relatively high-end, so they don't say they are especially anxious to rush home,"" she said by telephone. The company was waiting to see whether Bali's airport might open on Tuesday, said Liao. If not, she said buses and ferries would be arranged to take travellers to Surabaya on Java, where the company's charter flights could pick them up. Ash up to half a centimetre thick has settled on villages. ""We are not really affected, because the volcano is too far away. It is about 70km from us,"" said Liao. ""We only can say we saw pictures of it on television."" Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to Java and then traveling by land to the nearest airports.

Kristine Phillips,"Footage captured by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology shows lava fountains shooting out of the Mayon volcano on the night of Jan. 21. (Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology) Thousands of Filipino families have been evacuated in the Philippine province of Albay as the country’s most active volcano inches toward a possibly major eruption. A thick gray cloud of ash billowed high above the summit of Mount Mayon on Monday, when officials raised the alert level to four, an indication that hazardous eruption is imminent. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the volcano has been “exhibiting increased seismic unrest, lava fountaining and summit explosions.” The agency also has extended what it calls the “danger zone” to an eight-kilometer radius (nearly five miles) from the volcano’s vent. Footage captured by the agency showed bright orange lava fountains shooting out of the volcano’s summit Sunday night. Renato Solidum, the agency’s director, described two possible scenarios during a news conference Monday. Mayon will either continue to ooze out lava with small eruptions in between, like what happened in 2006 and 2009. Or we’re seeing the early stages of a major, and far more catastrophic, blast or pyroclastic flow, a deadly combination of lava, pumice, ash and volcanic gas barreling down a volcanic slope and into residential areas. [ Bali volcano has a history of explosive eruptions and global climate impacts ] Compounding the threat is what’s called lahar, a potentially deadly mudflow of volcanic material that can happen even without a major explosion. Solidum said heavy rain could drive mud flow in the region and cause landslides near already swollen bodies of water. Romina Marasigan, spokeswoman for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, told reporters last week that nearly 8,300 families — or more than 34,000 people — in the Albay province have been moved to 30 evacuation centers. These include families in areas far from the danger zone but who could be affected by mud flow. Marasigan said it could be weeks before families can return to their homes. Officials have allotted about 5.5 million pesos (about $100,000) worth of assistance, some in the form of food items, for evacuees, Marasigan said. Classes in several cities and municipalities and flights to and from some areas of the province have also been suspended, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara announced Monday on Facebook. Bichara also urged people to stay indoors and wear face masks. Mayon first showed signs of unrest Jan. 13, when the volcano produced a grayish ash plume, about a mile and a half high, that drifted southwest and sent ashes down on nearby areas. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised its alert level to two the following day and then to three hours later. A state of calamity was declared last Tuesday in the Albay province, about 300 miles from the capital city of Manila in the southeastern part of Luzon island. Mayon, which draws tourists because of its symmetrical cone shape, rises more than 8,000 feet above the Albay Gulf. It has erupted 47 times since 1616. The deadliest, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and buried a village. The most recent deadly eruption was in 1993, when more than 70 people were killed. The eruption continued for two months. Perhaps a close comparison to recent events was an eruption in 2001, Solidum told reporters, according to CNN Philippines. Mayon is one of the Philippines’ 22 active volcanoes. Smoke and ash erupted from the Philippines's Mayon volcano on Jan. 22. Officials raised the alert level to a four, meaning an explosive eruption could be imminent, and thousands of villagers were evacuated.

Joseph Serna,"The first in a series of winter storms that will soak Southern California through next week triggered the expected rain-related traffic issues, including one fatal crash Saturday morning, but otherwise left the landscape mostly unscathed, officials said.
Burn scars from the recent Woolsey and Hill fires in Ventura and Los Angeles counties received more than a half-inch of rain through the morning but it fell at such a light, steady pace that it did not trigger any serious mud or debris flows, the National Weather Service said.
California Department of Transportation workers are patrolling the Malibu area, with more crews on standby in case mud or rocks tumble onto Pacific Coast Highway, said Caltrans spokesman Marc Bischoff.
Storms last weekend sent mud from the burned landscape of the Woolsey fire onto the highway, trapping three cars and shutting down traffic for two days.
This weekend, straw wattles have been installed along the road’s shoulders to divert runoff and fencing has been erected on nearby mountain passes to limit rock falls and mudslides, Bischoff said.
Despite those efforts, a small mudflow did briefly close the coastal route Saturday morning. Bischoff said drivers should avoid PCH if they can during the next week of storms.
“That whole stretch … is still susceptible because of the Woolsey fire,” he said.
No serious issues were reported in Santa Barbara County near the Thomas fire burn area. As more time passes, it will take increasingly heavier downpours to trigger mudflows there, experts say.
“It’s a good, typical winter storm; we just didn’t have constant inundation,” said weather service meteorologist Tom Fisher.
It had rained nearly an inch in Pasadena and more than a half-inch in Burbank and downtown Los Angeles by Saturday morning, he said. Orange and San Diego counties were also soaked. Newport Beach received 1½ inches of rain, while Oceanside got about half an inch, the weather service said.
The downpours brought with them the regular rain-related issues that Southern California has come to expect.
The California Highway Patrol was busy clearing up crashes on several freeways and at one point had five separate Sigalerts in effect. A three-car crash on U.S. 101 killed one passenger, authorities said.
Traffic on the westbound 105 Freeway next to Los Angeles International Airport was stopped multiple times Saturday morning for stalled vehicles and traffic crashes.
Forecasters say Southern Californians can expect the wet weather to continue for the next several days, which means teachers striking in the Los Angeles Unified School District are in for days of rain-soaked demonstrations. Saturday brought the first of four storms due to hit the area.
“It almost won’t seem to end,” Fisher said. “All of them are fairly strong systems.”
Though the storms aren’t expected to be as severe as the one that unleashed devastating mudslides in Montecito in 2017, killing 23 people and destroying 130 homes, officials warned that deadly flows of mud and debris can still happen, even in a comparatively milder storm. A burst of rain over a small geographic area could be deadly.
“People should still be cautious. Sometimes you can get these deluges that last about an hour, but that’s all you need to shake loose those hillsides,” climatologist Bill Patzert said.","The first in a series of winter storms that will soak Southern California through next week triggered the expected rain-related traffic issues, including one fatal crash Saturday morning, but otherwise left the landscape mostly unscathed, officials said.

Joseph Serna,"A wall of sandstone boulders, some the size of RVs, barreled through Montecito, followed by a growing tail of water, mud and debris. On its way to the ocean, the mudflow's momentum shifted as it choked local creeks and slammed into curbs, walls and buildings. Attempting to make sense of the flow's path, which left more than 20 people dead and destroyed scores of homes on Jan. 9, scientists surveyed the area days after the slide. They noted that a predicted rainstorm's unexpected ferocity combined with the community's unusual geological makeup to maximize devastation. Unlike other communities singed by fire and then visited by rain, the hills above Montecito are almost exclusively made up of large rocks or fine, sandy dirt without much in between, said U.S. Geological Survey research hydrologist Jason Kean. So when a once-in-200-year storm cell dropped a half-inch of rain in five minutes early that morning, it created what Kean called ""a moving dam."" The largest parts of the mudflow — the boulders — naturally rolled to the front, creating a wall that let the river behind it grow in height and force instead of dispersing its energy wider across the landscape. ""It had really big tools to do destruction and a lot of fine grain material to keep them mobile,"" Kean said. ""It's definitely bad."" When the storm and mudflow subsided, the destruction was worse than anyone had predicted. That's something that Kean and his colleagues at the USGS, California Geological Survey, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and Santa Barbara County Fire Department want to change. Current USGS maps show only which hillsides are prone to debris flows, but not where those flows will go. Should something like this happen again — a very real possibility for at least the next five years in areas below the Thomas fire burn area — scientists want to be able to accurately predict where a debris flow will go. ""Though a lot of sediment has been evacuated, there's still a lot there,"" Kean said. ""It's tough for residents to hear, but there's plenty of ammunition left there."" After measuring everything they can about the debris flow, scientists will attempt to recreate the event using computer models. They will use the speed of the flow, its geological makeup, boulder size and the trajectories that occurred when it hit natural and artificial barriers such as hills and houses. ""It's tricky,"" Kean said. ""It's computationally more demanding to model flows downstream. … A small thing like topography can really change where the flow goes."" But if scientists can successfully create formulas to map out what happened in Montecito, or something close to it, emergency planners can better inform their communities of the risks they face before a storm. Authorities in Montecito were criticized after last month's storm for limiting mandatory evacuations to an east-west zone above the town's main highway, even though the area's creeks run north-south. Officials said the storm they planned for was not the storm they received. A map of potential debris flows showing what could happen in 100- or 500-year storms was provided by a private company before the Jan. 9 storm and proved remarkably accurate. Kean said a USGS model would offer additional scenarios. The model could show different scales of a potential disaster zone, depending not only on the level of rainfall, but what stands in the path of a debris flow. The group plans to compare what was in place in Montecito with Carpinteria, where a mudflow also occurred but was successfully contained in large catch basins. ""One thing we learned from this event is that structures, especially bridges and culverts, played a big role in determining where the flows went,"" Kean said. ""Our hope is to have maps that show the broad-scale potential for inundation and reasonably reflect where the flow could be substantially diverted by man-made structures or natural/constructed topography."" Kean said Southern California offers the best locations to model potential disaster zones because of its high frequency of fires followed by rain, the region's steep terrain and dense population centers. ""It's the most acute here,"" he said. ""That said, the problems exist beyond. … More people are asking for our help."" The study results should be published later this year.","A wall of sandstone boulders, some the size of RVs, barreled through Montecito, followed by a growing tail of water, mud and debris.

AFP,"After an initial toll of 25 dead, it was revised upwards within hours as bodies were recovered from villages razed by the tumbling mud. A view of the Fuego volcano as seen from the community of San Miguel Los Lotes in Escuintla, Guatemala. (Reuters pic) ALOTENANGO: Rescue workers pulled more bodies Monday from under the dust and rubble left by an explosive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, bringing the death toll to at least 65. Disaster Relief Agency spokesman David de Leon told a briefing that after hours of searching for survivors, the number of dead had hit at least 65. In addition, there are 46 people injured, most of them seriously, more than 1.7 million being hit by the disaster, including 3,271 ordered evacuated and 1,787 in shelters in the departments of Escuintla, Sacatepequez and Chimaltenango since Sunday’s eruption. The 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano erupted early Sunday, spewing out towering plumes of ash and a hail of fiery rock fragments with scalding mud. Authorities had warned the death toll could rise after searches resumed for survivors in communities on the mountain’s southern flank. After an initial toll of 25 dead, it was revised upwards within hours as bodies were recovered from villages razed by the tumbling mud. “There are missing persons, but we do not know how many,” said Sergio Cabanas of Guatemala’s disaster management agency. A roll call of communities on the slopes of the volcano was under way. The speed and ferocity of the eruption took mountain communities by surprise, with many of the dead found in or around their homes. Cabanas said those who were killed had been overrun by fast-moving burning material discharged by the volcano Sunday. Communities located on its southern slope were the worst hit. Several of the dead were children. An AFP journalist saw at least three bodies burned in the rubble of the village of San Miguel Los Lotes, where rescue workers, soldiers and police were desperately searching for survivors. Dead dogs, chickens and ducks also lay among the mud and ash, much of it still smoking. “I do not want to leave, but go back, and there is nothing I can do to save my family,” a weeping Eufemia Garcia, 48, told AFP. She was searching for her three children, her mother, nephews and siblings. Garcia, from Los Lotes, said she escaped with the help of her husband. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was deeply saddened by the “tragic loss of life and the significant damage caused by the eruption,” and said the UN was ready to assist national rescue and relief efforts. National mourning President Jimmy Morales, who has declared three days of national mourning, visited the disaster zone. “The volcano has erupted before, but never like this,” said Gustavo Larius, a 27-year-old bricklayer searching the streets of his village for missing family and friends, a handkerchief pressed over his mouth and nose. The eruption sent ash billowing over the surrounding area, turning plants and trees gray and blanketing streets, cars and people. Farmers covered in ash fled for their lives as civil defence workers tried to relocate them to shelters. “This time we were saved; in another (eruption) no,” said Efrain Gonzalez, 52, sitting on the floor of a shelter in the city of Escuintla, where he arrived with his wife and one-year-old daughter. Gonzalez was overwhelmed with despair, as two more of his children, aged 10 and four, are missing. They were trapped in their home, which was flooded with hot mud that descended from the volcano. Dense ash blasted out by the volcano shut down Guatemala City’s international airport, civil aviation officials said. The eruption ended after 16.5 hours, but “there is a likelihood that it will reactivate” warned the Institute of Volcanology. Surprising speed The speed of the eruption took locals by surprise, and could be explained by it producing pyroclastic flows, sudden emissions of gas and rock fragments, rather than lava, said volcanologist David Rothery of Britain’s Open University. “A lava flow rarely travels fast enough to engulf people,” he said. “The videos and still images I’ve seen suggest instead one or more pyroclastic flows. This is when a violently erupted mass of rock fragments and hot gas finds itself too dense to rise as an ash column and instead cascades down the volcano’s slopes. “Pyroclastic flows or surges can move at over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, and may be hot enough to glow like molten lava. They can travel further, as well as much faster, than lava flows,” said Rothery. Fuego has been erupting since 2002 and was continuously active in 2017. There were explosions and ash plumes and a volcanic mudflow last month. Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Samantha Wilson,"Mount Agung, a massive volcano in Bali, is erupting for the first time in over 50 years, causing chaos on the Indonesian island. Learn more here. 1. Mount Agung first erupted on Saturday, November 25 : the first eruption came at 5:30pm local time, and has happened two times since. Authorities in Bali warn that a massive eruption, spilling lava over the sides of the volcano, could be on the way. Authorities have been warning that there was increased seismic activity in the volcano for two months, as magma moved deep from within the earth to the top of the crater. Last week, steam rose from the volcano, something typical from the seismicity, as the earth shook in the surrounding area. The volcano is now spitting out plumes of smoke and ash over five miles into the sky, and eyewitnesses can see lava glowing at the surface of the crater. The seismicity has caused rivers of cold mud with the consistency of wet concrete to flow down the sides of the mountain into river valleys below. 2. Why the eruption is happening: the seismic activity is pushing the magma toward the surface, and it’s building rock as it moves. As the magma moves, the water inside the volcano heats up and starts steaming. The steam builds up so much pressure that the rock can’t contain it. Agung is now blasting rocks, glass, and crystals into the air, forming what we can see as ash. Since the plumes of steam and ash are flowing straight into the air, unaffected by wind, it means velocity is very high. If the pressure gets any higher, and another eruption occurs, the magma could push past the surface of the crater and become lava, racing down the sides of the mountain to the ground below. That’s when people need to be worried. 3. Authorities have issued the highest alert level possible for the eruption: the National Agency for Disaster Management has issued a Level 4 alert for Bali, warning that a massive eruption could occur. They’ve advised that nobody should go within 8 to 10 kilometers from the volcano, trying to deter curious tourists from getting too close to get a selfie — and perishing. 4. Bali has evacuated 29,000 people: anyone within the 8 to 10 kilometer area in Bali has been evacuated by the government — tens of thousands of people, according to theBali Provincial Board for Disaster Relief. This follows a similar evacuation in September, when the seismic activity first occurred. However, officials are now warning that people could be seriously harmed by the massive eruption they feel is on the way. Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation has also raised its aviation alert notice to Red, the highest level, causing Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali to shut down for 24 hours, starting the morning of Monday, November 27. The shutdown has reportedly stranded about 59,000 people in Bali. “While the sun is shining and there is little sign of volcanic ash in the southern regions of Bali, evidence of volcanic ash at higher altitudes on aviation approach and departure paths has prompted the decision to close the airport,” Bali Tourism Board Chairman Ida Bagus Agung Partha Adnyana said in a statement. Officials are especially concerned about the mudflow raging down river banks. They’re warning people to stay away from rivers, where rapidly-moving, thick mud is tearing down trees and dislodging boulders. “The pyroclastic material of (the) Mount Agung eruption will continue to grow. The rain will increase during the rainy season. Potential lava floods will increase. Do not do (engage in) activities around the river,” Adnyana said on his official Twitter. 5: This is Mount Agung’s first eruption in 50 years: the last time Mount Agung erupted was in 1963, when the plumes of ash launched 16 kilometers into the air. The evacuation zone was created based on what happened during the massive eruption, when more than 1700 people were killed, and villages were destroyed.

Enrico Dela Cruz,"The Philippines raised the alert level at its rumbling Mayon volcano to ""level 3"" on Sunday after detecting lava flow and indications of activity that could lead to eruptions of magma. More than 900 families have been evacuated from villages near Mayon, a tourist attraction because of its near-perfect cone shape, following a ""steam-driven eruption"" on Saturday. Authorities advised people to cover their noses and mouths with a damp, clean cloth or dust mask if they were exposed to ash from the eruptions, and said aircraft must avoid flying close to the volcano's summit. Story continues below advertisement Two similar ""phreatic"" eruptions occurred at the volcano in central Albay province on Sunday, unleashing more ash. ""Mayon's summit crater is now exhibiting bright crater glow that signifies the growth of a new lava dome and beginnings of lava flow towards the southern slopes,"" the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said. Phivolcs chief Renato Solidum said the volcano appeared due for another major eruption as it has been displaying abnormal behaviour since late last year. ""Alert level 3 is what we considered critical, 4 is when eruption is imminent, and 5 is eruption in progress,"" Cedric Daep, head of the Albay Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, said in a radio interview. Mayon's most destructive eruption was in February 1841, when lava buried a town and killed 1,200 people. It last erupted in 2014, spewing lava and forcing thousands of people to evacuate. The latest eruptions began on Saturday, unleashing ash, rocks and sulphur fumes and accompanied by rumbling sounds. Phivolcs had earlier raised the alert to ""level 2"", saying the activity was ""probably of magmatic origin, which could lead to more phreatic eruptions or eventually to hazardous magmatic eruptions."" Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Since Saturday's first eruption, Phivolcs said it had recorded 158 rockfall events and urged people to stay away from a 6-kilometre (3.7 mile) radius Permanent Danger Zone and a 7-km Expanded Danger Zone on the volcano's southern flank. Landslides and sudden explosions or a dome collapse that may generate hazardous volcanic flows are also possible, it said. People within the slope of the volcano, but outside the danger zones, were told to take precautionary measures against possible roof collapses due to accumulated ash and rainwater, and ""lahar"", an Indonesian term for a volcanic mudflow.

It had been believed the 35-year-old man was beheaded by a falling rock as he tried to escape the eruption when his headless body was discovered earlier this year. Archaeologists have now discovered his skull nearby, with a wide open mouth - and say it wasn't ripped off his body until relatively recently. Scroll down for video It had been believed the 35-year-old man was beheaded by a falling rock as he tried to escape the Pompeii eruption, but now his skull has been found intact. 'Now we know that the death was not due to the impact of the block, but presumably from probable asphyxiation due to the pyroclastic flow,' wrote the Pompeii Archaeological Park. Director Massimo Osanna revealed the find. 'We have just found the skull too, with the mouth open wide in an amazing way', he told an archaeological forum. 'He did not die of heat shock or because of the rock that fell on him, but from suffocation,' Osanna told the forum. It had been believed the 35-year-old man was beheaded by a falling rock as he tried to escape the eruption when his headless body was discovered earlier this year. 'In the early phase of the excavation it appeared that the upper part of the thorax and the skull, which had not yet been found, had been severed and dragged downwards by a stone block which had struck the victim: this preliminary hypothesis arose from the observation of the position of the boulder compared to the empty space of the body impressed into the cinerite,' the team wrote. In fact, they say, part of the surrounding buildings 'slipped' as a tunnel collapsed, 'His death was presumably not, therefore, due to the impact of the stone block, as initially assumed, but likely to asphyxia caused by the pyroclastic flow' they say. The identified skeletal remains consist of the upper part of the thorax, the upper limbs, the skull and jaw. The skeleton was discovered at a recently uncovered area of the Pompeii archaeological site, near Naples, Italy. An earlier analysis of his right foot suggested he was disabled due to an injury that left him unable to escape when the volcano blew in 79 AD, burying the city in rock and ash. The skeleton was discovered at a recently uncovered area of the Pompeii archaeological site, near Naples, Italy. The doomed city's Regio V area was found as part of new excavation work and scientists are exploring the region to find out more about life in ancient Pompeii. Discovered lying on his back, at first it appeared the man's skeleton was pinned down by the rock that killed him almost 2,000 years ago. The director general of the Pompeii archaeological site, Massimo Osanna, called the discovery 'dramatic and exceptional'.

As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000. Of the 1,150 bodies recovered by archaeologists at Pompeii, 394 were killed by falling pumice and debris from collapsed buildings. The remaining 756 victims were killed by a column of superheated gas and ash called a pyroclastic surge. The skeleton of a child who tragically perished in the eruption was uncovered in the ruins of a public baths in Pompeii in February. Workers restoring the ancient thermal recreational area discovered the body, believed to belong to a child aged seven or eight at the time. The crouching child is thought to have been trying to take shelter from the ensuing cataclysm when they were overwhelmed by deadly volcanic gases, experts said.

During the conservation work, new finds have been uncovered at a private house known as the 'House of Jupiter' (Casa di Giove) in the Regio V part of the ancient city. The house was already partly excavated between the 18th and 19th centuries but archaeologists have uncovered yet more frescoes and ornate remains that give us an insight into everyday life thousands of years ago. The 2,000 year-old works of art are in good condition, despite surviving one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in written history. Scroll down for video Archaeologists have uncovered new findings in the house of a wealthy man who lived in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii that was buried by ash and rock following the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD The name of the house comes from a small picture depicting Jupiter found on a shrine placed in the garden. It was believed to belong to a wealthy and educated man and is decorated in first Roman style (primo stile pompeiano). The house has a central atrium surrounded by several decorated rooms with fake marble painted in bright shades of red, yellow and green. 'The rooms in the back, reserved for the family, had been restored with more contemporary decor', said the director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, Massimo Osanna.

Archaeologists excavating an unexplored part of Pompeii have discovered a street of houses with intact balconies that were buried when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. The culture ministry's Pompeii authority announced the discovery of the balconies back in May. It said the balconies were a 'complete novelty' for this part of the buried city, which hasn't yet been fully excavated. Upper stores have seldom been found among the ruins of the ancient town, which was destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius volcano and buried under up to six metres of ash and volcanic rubble.

The Alley of Balconies was uncovered in previously unexcavated area in Pompeii. Almost two thousand years after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, the buildings will be restored and will become a part of a route at the Pompeii. A statement said the balconies will be restored and the area included in a tour open to the public. 'This type of find is a novelty for this area of Pompeii,' a spokesperson for the archaeological site said in a statement shared to social media. 'Almost two thousand years from the eruption of 79 AD, Pompeii continues to give us treasures.' Archaeologists found a series of buildings with three large balconies, in an area of Regio V which has been the focus of excavations. 'On one of the balconies we have also discovered toppled over wine amphorae, which were likely left out to dry in the sun,' the team said. 'The balconies will be restored and included in an all new visitor itinerary which will connect Via di Nola with Vicolo delle Nozze d'Argento,' they added.

Their work prompted conservators of the Unesco world heritage site to start their own digs, in order to put a stop to their activities and protect its remaining artefacts. Researchers used laser scanning to map a 200ft (60m) long network of illegal tunnels dug by the robbers and began excavating. They recreated the complete outline of the horse they discovered using plaster casting, the first time this has happened at the site.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) The storm was being closely watched Wednesday in Santa Barbara County, where a January storm unleashed debris-laden flash floods that ravaged the community of Montecito, killing 21 people. County spokeswoman Suzanne Grimmesey says debris catch-basins that filled up in January were completely cleared and have so far been fully functioning in the current storm. Grimmesey says that forecasters expect rainfall to intensify through Wednesday morning. Many California communities are at risk of storm runoff damage because of large wildfires that have left barren landscapes. ___ 11:06 p.m. A powerful Pacific storm is moving across central and southern parts of California, drenching communities previously ravaged by wildfires and mudslides. Thousands of residents evacuated their homes ahead of the storm while others were waiting it out and hoping for the best. Late Tuesday, Los Angeles County authorities told thousands more to be ready to evacuate from neighborhoods in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, which have also been badly hit by wildfires. Many residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings. A January storm unleashed mudslides that inundated hundreds of homes in their community of Montecito and killed 21 people.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) County emergency manager Jeff Gater tells the Los Angeles Times that the alert issued around 3:50 a.m. Tuesday was sent because of deteriorating conditions and followed one issued by the National Weather Service. For days beforehand, the county had issued repeated warnings through social media, news media and community information emails about the potential for mudflows from the huge wildfire scar in the hills above neighborhoods. Gater tells the Times more than 200,000 emails and other warnings were issued, but the county decided not to use the push alert system to cellphones out of concern that it might not be taken seriously. Authorities also say only a small percentage of residents heeded mandatory and voluntary evacuation warnings. ___ 11:42 p.m. Hundreds of searchers are still hunting for survivors of the flash flooding and mudslides near Santa Barbara, California. They slogged through ooze and poked long holes into the mud on Wednesday as they searched for victims a day after the massive debris flow passed through. The death toll from Tuesday's pre-dawn flash flood rose to 17 as more bodies were found. Another 17 were still reported missing. Authorities are hoped to find them alive. By Wednesday, some 500 searchers had covered about 75 percent of the inundated area in the search for victims.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) The suit filed Tuesday in Santa Barbara County Superior Court targets Southern California Edison and the Montecito Water District. The utilities did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment. The lawsuit was brought by individuals injured in flash floods and a business that sustained property damage. It claims Edison's equipment caused the enormous fire and said that mudslides only occurred because vegetation that held soil back was burned in the blaze. The water district is accused of negligent actions surrounding its equipment, leading to a catastrophic break of a major water line. ___ 7:40 a.m. Officials say seven people remain hospitalized a week after they were injured in mudslides that devastated the coastal California town of Montecito, killing 20. Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital says that as of Monday evening, two of the seven still undergoing treatment were in critical condition. Twenty-eight patients have been treated and released. The mudslides were triggered Jan. 9 by a powerful storm that dumped heavy rain on mountain slopes that had been burned bare by a huge wildfire in December. More than 500 homes were damaged or destroyed. Three people including a 2-year-old girl remain missing. Officials say the U.S. 101 freeway is not expected to reopen until Jan. 22.

The question is based on the denudational processes of weathering and mass wasting. 
Key demands of the question:
The answer must first elaborate on the concept in detail and write their geomorphic importance.
Directive word
Explain Clarify the topic by giving a detailed account as to how and why it occurred, or what is the  particular context. You must be defining key terms where ever appropriate, and substantiate with relevant associated facts.

What is mass movement and its types soil creep, Solifluction, slumping or sliding.
Present the above types with suitable diagrams and examples wherever possible.
discuss their geomorphic significance.
Conclusion 
Conclude with their significance in Earth building activities.
Introduction:
Weathering is defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate. As very little or no motion of materials takes place in weathering, it is an in-situ or on-site process.
Mass wasting or Mass movement is the movement of weathered material down a slope due to gravitational forces. Mass movements are very active over weathered slopes rather than over unweathered slopes. Usual geographic agents like running water, glaciers, wind, waves etc do not have much role to play in mass movements, and it is the gravity, which is the main driving force.
Both are exogenic forces, i.e. they derive their strength from the earths exterior or originate within the earths atmosphere. Their actions results in wearing down, hence known as land wearing forces.
Body:
Weathering is of two kinds
Chemical Weathering: basic process by which denudation occurs. Extremely slow and gradual decomposition of rocks due to exposure to air and water. Solution, Oxidation and Decomposition by Organic Acids are few processes.
Physical or Mechanical weathering: physical disintegration of a rock by the actual prising apart of separate particles. Repeated temperature changes, Repeated wetting and drying, Frost action and Biotic factors are processes.
Significance of weathering
Weathering is the first step in formation of soils.
Weathering of rocks and deposits helps in the enrichment and concentrations of certain valuable ores of iron, manganese, aluminium, copper etc.
Weathering helps in soil enrichment.
Without weathering, the concentration of the same valuable material may not be sufficient and economically viable to exploit, process and refine. This is what is called enrichment.
Mass wasting is of two types:
Slow movements:Soil Creep: It occurs on moderate steep, soil-covered slopes (doesnt need to be lubricated with water as in solifluction). The movement is extremely slow and imperceptible except through extended observation.
Solifluction: It is the process of slow down slope flowing of soil mass or fine-grained rock debris saturated or lubricated with water. It can be said as a type of creep with lubricated water influences the movement. It mainly occurs in permafrost regions as the layers of ground water are occupied in between permanently frozen soil and rocks.
Rapid movements:Earthflow: Movement of water-saturated clayey or silty earth materials down low angle terraces or hillsides is called earthflow.
Mudflow: In the absence of vegetation and cover and with heavy rainfall, thick layers of weathered materials get saturated with water and either slow or rapidly flow down along definite channels is called as mudflow.
Debris avalanche: It is more in humid regions with or without vegetation. It occurs in narrow tracks on sleep slopes and is similar to snow avalanche.
Landslides (slumping or sliding): These are very rapid kinds of movement and occur when a large mass of soil or rock falls suddenly. Land-slides usually occur on steep slopes undercut by a river or the sea so that it falls by gravity. Slumping is particularly common where permeable debris or rock layers overlie impermeable strata such as clay. Water sinking through the permeable material is halted by the clay. The damp clay provides a smooth slippery surface over which the upper layers easily slide.
Significance of Mass-wasting:
The topography of the earth’s surface, particularly the morphologies of mountain and valley systems, both on the continents and on the ocean floors.
The character/quality of rivers and streams and groundwater flow.
The forests that cover much of the earth’s sub-aerial surface.
The habitats of natural wildlife that exist on the earth’s surface, including its rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Large amounts of geologic materials enter streams as sediment as a result of this landslide and erosion activity, thus reducing the potability of the water and quality of habitat for fish and wildlife.
Mitigation of Mass-Wasting:
Afforestation
Re-Afforestation
Terracing steps on slopes or, more generally, re-modelling its shape
Slope stabilization
Conclusion:
The interaction of these constructive and destructive forces gives rise to great diversity of present day landforms.
Topic-Salient features of worlds physical geography.
2) How are tidal currents different from tidal bores? Discuss the importance and uses of tidal current.(250 words)
Why this question: 
Question is about the concepts of tidal currents and tidal bores and  how they are different from each other. One is expected to throw some light upon the importance and utility of tidal bores.
Demand of the question:
This question seeks to examine the concept of Tidal bores, how they differ from regular tidal currents, and their specific uses.
Directive word: 
Discuss– This is an all-encompassing directive which mandates us to write in detail about the key demand of the question. we also have to discuss about the related and important aspects of the question in order to bring out a complete picture of the issue in hand. 
Structure of the answer:
Introduction
Start with what are tidal currents and their significance in the oceanic ecosystem.
Body
Discuss the following points in detail:
What are tidal bores – body of water that, during exceptionally high sea tides, rushes up some rivers and estuaries near a coast where there is a large tidal range and the incoming tide is confined to a narrow channel.
What causes tidal bores? – natural phenomenon in which an incoming tide creates a wave of water that travels up along a river or a narrow bay causing water to flow against the river’s current.
Where are tidal bores most common? their range
How are they different from Tidal currents?
Explain the importance of tidal currents.
Conclusion 
Conclude with their importance in oceanic ecosystem.
Introduction:
Tidal currents can be defined as the periodic movement of water driven principally, though not necessarily exclusively, by a head difference created by out-of-phase ocean tides at each end of a restriction. Tidal currents occur in conjunction with the rise and fall of the tide.
A tidal bore is a phenomenon in which the leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travels up a river or narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay’s current. It occurs along a coast where a river empties into an ocean or sea.
Body:
Tidal bore:
It is a strong tide that pushes up the river, against the current. A tidal bore is a true tidal wave. A tidal bore is a surge.
A surge is a sudden change in depth. When a channel suddenly gets deeper, it experiences a positive surge.
When a channel suddenly gets shallower, it experiences a negative surge. Tidal bores are positive surges.
Two key features of a tidal bore are the intense turbulence and mixing generated during the bore propagation, as well as its rumbling noise.
A tidal bore creates a powerful roar that combines the sounds caused by the turbulence in the bore front and whelps, entrained air bubbles in the bore roller, sediment erosion beneath the bore front and of the banks, scouring of shoals and bars, and impacts on obstacles
Tidal Currents:
The vertical motion of the tides near the shore causes the water to move horizontally, creating currents. When a tidal current moves toward the land and away from the sea, it floods. When it moves toward the sea away from the land, it ebbs. These tidal currents that ebb and flood in opposite directions are called rectilinear or reversing currents.
Rectilinear tidal currents, which typically are found in coastal rivers and estuaries, experience a slack water period of no velocity as they move from the ebbing to flooding stage, and vice versa.
Tidal currents are the only type of current affected by the interactions of the Earth, sun, and moon. The moons force is much greater than that of the sun because it is 389 times closer to the Earth than the sun is.
Tidal currents, just like tides, are affected by the different phases of the moon. When the moon is at full or new phases, tidal current velocities are strong and are called spring currents. When the moon is at first or third quarter phases, tidal current velocities are weak and are called neap currents.
Importance of Tidal Currents:
Fishing: Fish may concentrate during ebb tides. Commercial fishermen follow the tides and learn to fish during levels of highest concentration to improve their economic investment and to make more efficient use of their time.
Recycling of Nutrients:Tides affect other aspects of oceanic life, including the reproductive activities of fish and ocean plants.
Floating plants and animals ride the tidal currents between the breeding areas and deeper waters.
The tides help remove pollutants and circulate nutrients ocean plants and animals need to survive.
Tidal Zone FoodsCrabs, mussels, snails, seaweed and other edible sea life inhabit the tidal zone. Small tide pools may also contain small fish and sea vegetables.
The sea life found in these regions is often harvested for food. Without the regular washing of the tides, these complex and abundant creatures would die and food resources would diminish.
WeatherTides and tidal currents affect the weather by stirring the ocean waters.
The tides and tidal currents mix arctic water that cant absorb lots of sunlight with warmer topic water that does.
The stirring produces more predictable and habitable climate conditions and balances temperatures on the planet.
Tidal EnergyTwo high tides and two low tides occur during every 24-hour period.
The predictability of the tides, fast movement of water during the inflow and outflow can provide a source of renewable energy to communities living along the coast.
Hydroelectric plants can exploit the water flow in ways similar to those used on rivers.
Conclusion:
Tidal bores are seen in the rivers of Ganga, Krishna, Mahanadi etc. According to Ministry of New and Renewable energy, Total identified potential of Tidal Energy is about 12455 MW, with potential locations identified at Khambat &amp; Kutch regions, and large backwaters, where barrage technology could be used. The Gulf of Kutch region is all set to develop Indias first 50MW tidal energy plant.

Key demand of the question:
The answer must discuss in detail the scenario of urban employment unemployment in Urban India. Causes and consequences and why and how it has turned into a political tool for parties.
Directive word: 
DiscussThis is an all-encompassing directive you have to debate on paper by going through the details of the issues concerned by examining each one of them. You have to give reasons for both for and against arguments.
Structure of the answer
Introduction:
write a few introductory lines about the  current ongoing debates of political parties, brief the context.
Body:
Answers must discuss the following aspects :
Discuss the present scenario of urban employment, quote some facts here to justify the findings using reports such as – Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).
idea of an urban employment programme pros and cons.
Why we need ways to promote the sustainable development of Indias small and medium towns.
Associated problems in detail skilling, livelihood, population -resource conflict etc.
Conclusion 
Conclude by suggesting a way forward.
Introduction:
India is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis. The unemployment rate has reached a 45-year high (6.1%) in 2017-18 as per leaked data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). According to the PLFS report, the unemployment problem is especially aggravated in Indias cities and towns. Aside from unemployment, low wages and precarity continue to be widespread. In urban India the majority of the population continues to work in the informal sector.
Body:
Problems associated with Urban Employment in India:
Polarized view: Both State and Central governments tend to treat towns as engines of growth for the economy rather than spaces where thousands toil to make a living.
Programmes such as the Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (1997) that included an urban wage employment component have made way for those focussed on skilling and entrepreneurship.
Undermining of Small and Medium towns:Indias small and medium towns are particularly ignored in the States urban imagination.
National-level urban programmes such as the Smart Cities Mission and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) only benefit a fraction of them.
Most ULBs are struggling to carry out basic functions because of a lack of financial and human capacity.
Further, with untrammelled urbanisation, they are facing more challenges due to the degradation of urban ecological commons.
Rising Informal Sector:The huge influx of job seekers has led to a sprawling unorganized sector of unskilled labourers.
Poor pay:They are paid less than market standards with no social security benefits.
Congested Urban areas:Migration is mostly concentrated to a few metropolitan cities breaching the carrying capacities of the cities.
This has led to urban sprawl, rise of slums and unhygienic settlements.
Skilling and Apprenticeship is the need of the hour:
Another novel aspect is the creation of a skilling and apprenticeship programme for unemployed youth with higher education who can sign up for a contiguous period of 150 days (five months), at Rs.13,000 a month for five months.
These employed workers can assist with administrative functions in municipal offices, government schools, or public health centres, and for the monitoring, measurement, or evaluation of environmental parameters.
While the first category of work is aimed at providing additional employment opportunities and raising incomes for those in low-wage informal work.
The second category is to provide educated youth experience and skills that they can build-on further.
There is an estimate that such a programme will cost between 1.7-2.7% of GDP per year depending on design, and can provide work opportunities to around 30-50 million workers.
In light of the 74th Amendment, this programme should be administered by the ULB in a participatory manner by involving ward committees.
Way forward:
Consider introducing an employment guarantee programme in urban areas.
Bring in much-needed public investment in towns to improve the quality of urban infrastructure and services, restoring urban commons, skilling urban youth and increasing the capacity of ULBs.
ULB should receives funds from the Centre and the State at the beginning of each financial year so that funds are available locally
Urban informal workers with limited formal education can undertake standard public works such as building and maintenance of roads, footpaths and bridges for a guaranteed 100 days in a year, at 500 a day.
A new set of green jobs which include the creation, restoration/rejuvenation, and maintenance of urban commons such as green spaces and parks, forested or woody areas, degraded or waste land, and water bodies can be created.
A set of jobs that will cater to the care deficit in towns by providing child-care as well as care for the elderly and the disabled to the urban working class can be created.
Strong transparency and accountability structures, proactive disclosure of information based on Section 4 of the RTI Act, proactive measures through mandatory periodic social audits, public hearing and reactive measures through a Right to Timely Grievance Redressal for workers.
Conclusion:
An urban employment guarantee programme not only improves incomes of workers but also has multiplier effects on the economy. It will boost local demand in small towns, improve public infrastructure and services, spur entrepreneurship, build skills of workers and create a shared sense of public goods. Hence, the time is ripe for an employment guarantee programme in urban India.

Introduction:
The Union Cabinet has recently approved the National Mineral Policy 2019. The aim of National Mineral Policy 2019 is to have a more effective, meaningful and implementable policy that brings in further transparency, better regulation and enforcement, balanced social and economic growth as well as sustainable mining practices. It replaces the extant National Mineral Policy 2008. The impetus to review NMP 2008 came about by way of a direction from the Supreme Court vide its judgment in Common Cause v/s Union of India &amp; Others.
Body:
Key features of National Mineral Policy (NMP) 2019 are:
Higher Production:The latest mineral policy, which pertains to non-coal and non-fuel minerals, says that a major outcome expected from the policy proposals is to increase the production of major minerals by 200 per cent in 7 years.
Right of first refusal:Introduction of Right of First Refusal for reconnaissance permit (RP) or Permanent Licence holders
Private sector participation:This will give more opportunity to the private sector for participation in mining activities.
The Policy also mentions rationalize reserved areas given to PSUs which have not been used and to put these areas to auction, which will give more opportunity to private sector for participation.
Industry status:It proposes to grant status of industry to mining activity to boost financing of mining for private sector and for acquisitions of mineral assets in other countries by private sector..
Export Import:It proposes a Long term import export policy for mineral will help private sector in better planning and stability in business.
Transportation:It focuses on use of coastal waterways and inland shipping for evacuation and transportation of minerals.
It also encourages dedicated mineral corridors to facilitate the transportation of minerals.
Fund:The policy also underlines the need to harmonise Indias tax, levy and royalty rates to global benchmarks to draw higher private participation.
It calls for the utilization of the district mineral fund for equitable development of project affected persons and areas.
Regulation:For regulation of the Minerals sector, E-Governance, IT enabled systems, awareness and information campaigns will be incorporated.
Online public portal with provision for generating triggers at higher level in the event of delay of clearances by the state has been put in place.
Sustainable development:It introduces the concept of Inter-Generational Equity that deals with the well-being of both the present generation and future generations.
It also proposes to constitute an inter-ministerial body to institutionalize the mechanism for ensuring sustainable development in mining.
Issues with the NMP-2019:
The NMP 2019 misses out on providing necessary guidance on some fundamental things that would have made it a guiding document to ensure environmentally and socially responsible mining.
While the document mentions that mining should be environmentally sustainable and equitable, there remain serious questions on how effective this Policy will be to ensure environmental protection, ecological conservation and protect peoples rights in the mining areas.
With a focus to ramp up mineral production massively, the new Policy is largely guided by the penchant for ease of doing businesses and attracting investments.
Creating exclusive mining zones and simplifying clearances:A key proposal that has been introduced in the NMP is the creation of Exclusive Mining Zones. These zones will come with approved, in-principle clearances to curtail delay in commencement of mining operations. In-principle clearance is tied to forest land diversion for non-forestry purposes.
Most major mining activities involve such land diversion, this will help to open up huge tracks of forest land to multiple companies and investors for mining in one go.
The proposal will also create major loopholes in obtaining successive clearances and permits by mining companies who will be part of the exclusive mining zone, and also in compliance of clearance and permit conditions.
Serious concerns arise about the impact of this proposal on forest ecology, wildlife corridors and forest-dependent communities.
Weak on controlling environmental pollution:Environmental pollution from mining activities is a major problem in most mining areas. This arises from unscientific and rampant mining (and related) activities, poor pollution standards and pollution monitoring, and improper mines management and mine closure practices.
Air, water and soil pollution problems in almost all key mining districts of India have severely affected peoples health and their livelihood. However, the Policy provides little effective guidance to improve this.
There is no specific standard on environmental pollution from mining under our umbrella environmental legislations the Environment (Protection) Act (1986), the Water Act (1974) and the Air Act (1981).
Among non-coal minerals, pollution standards have only been developed for iron-ore mining under Environment Protection Rules, 2010. Also, baseline pollution monitoring data in most mining areas is nearly non-existent or extremely poor.
Way forward:
Two main pre-conditions for achieving sustainability are good governance and self-regulating mining enterprises which are economically viable, financially profitable and technically efficient.
Proper Environmental Impact Assessment and Social Impact Assessment needs to be carried despite easing the clearances for mining activities.
Scientific techniques of mining needs to be adopted to curb the pollution.
Specific standards on environmental pollution from mining should be brought in for all minerals
Mining operations must be carried out with concerns for the carrying capacity of the environment and other infrastructural limitations.
Occupational safety of the mining workers along with protection of the rights of local residents and the biodiversity needs to be taken into account.
Conclusion:
Striking the balance between Development and Environment is a difficult task. A sustainable way of utilizing the resources needs to be adopted. The loopholes in the policy need to be rectified at the earliest to carry on sustainable mining.

5) Strengthening adaptation is must to protect human health in face of climate change.comment.(250 words)
Reference
Reference
Why this question:
The article provides a detailed analysis on the effect of climate change on Human health. During the Second Global Conference on Health &amp; Climate, participants warned that without adequate mitigation and adaptation, climate change poses risks to public health.
Key demand of the question:
The question expects us to first discuss the alarming climate change scenario and its impact on human health, the discussion should center around the importance of mitigation necessary to overcome the issue. 
Directive word:
Comment– here we have to express our knowledge and understanding of the issue and form an overall opinion thereupon.
Structure of the answer:
Introduction: 
Begin with brief introductory lines on importance of interrelationship between public health and climate change.
Body:
State facts from various report and re-assert the statement in question about alarming issue of climate change and its impact on human health.
Take cues from the article and quote reports.
Then move on to discuss the effectiveness of the global fight against climate change amidst increasing effect on public health.
Discuss the effect and what needs to be done to mitigate the challenge the world is facing  in the health paradigm.
Conclusion:
Conclude with importance of immediate attention to mitigate the threats of mounting climate change.
Introduction:
Climate scientists argue that global warming is exacerbating extreme weather events. And natural disasters are often the source of health crises, particularly in fragile settings. Strengthening adaptation is a must in the face of climate change. This includes plans to protect the human health from air pollution, heat waves, floods, droughts and the degradation of water resources. At present, more than 7 million deaths occur worldwide every year due to air pollution.
Body:
Alarming issue of climate change and its impact on human health:
The World Health Organization estimates that climate change is causing tens of thousands of deaths every year.
These deaths arise mainly from epidemics such as cholera, dengue and extreme weather events such as heat waves and floods.
Experts predict that by 2030, climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths each year from malaria, diarrhoeal disease, heat stress and undernutrition alone.
Certain groups have higher susceptibility to climate-sensitive health impacts owing to their age (children and elderly), gender (particularly pregnant women), social marginalization (associated in some areas with indigenous populations, poverty or migration status), or other health conditions like HIV. The socioeconomic costs of health problems caused by climate change are considerable.
Many infectious diseases, including water-borne ones, are highly sensitive to climate conditions.
climate change and air pollution share many major common sources (fossil fuel and biomass burning), climate-driven changes in weather patterns and higher carbon dioxide levels could also worsen air quality in many regions of the world.
Elevated CO2 levels in occupied buildings are a well-known indoor air quality concern, with studies reporting associations with declines in cognitive performance and increased risk of sick building syndrome in office workers and schoolchildren.
Climate change lengthens the transmission season and expands the geographical range of many diseases like malaria and dengue.
Climate change will bring new and emerging health issues, including heatwaves and other extreme events. Heat stress can make working conditions unbearable and increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory and renal diseases.
Additionally, it is estimated that 5 million people are displaced annually by climate or weather-related disasters, and these figures are expected to increase in the future. Climate-induced human mobility has a socioeconomic cost and can affect mental and physical health.
Malnutrition and undernutrition are highlighted as a concern for a number of developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, which discussed the impacts of climate change on food security, particularly in relation to floods and drought. Climate change threatens food and nutrition security
Strengthening Adaptation measures are the way forward:
Adaptation means anticipating the adverse effects of climate change and taking appropriate action to prevent or minimise the damage they can cause. Mitigation is an intervention to reduce the emissions sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.
new building codes to adapt future climate change.
Developing drought tolerant crops and setting aside land corridors to help species migrate.
More secure facility locations and infrastructures
Landscape restoration (natural landscape) and reforestation
Flexible and diverse cultivation to be prepared for natural catastrophes
Research and development on possible catastrophes, temperature behavior, etc.
Preventive and precautionary measures (evacuation plans, health issues, etc.)
Moving on to more sustainable food production and healthier diets to improve the environment and reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases. One way to do this would be to promote diets rich in fruits and vegetables, including local in-season varieties.
Measures undertaken in India towards combating climate change:
The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) is a Central Sector Scheme which was set up in the year 2015-16. The overall aim of NAFCC is to support concrete adaptation activities which mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. The projects related to adaptation in sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, water, forestry, tourism etc. are eligible for funding under NAFCC
National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC): The Action plan covers eight major missions on Solar, Enhanced Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Habitat, Water, Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, Green India, Sustainable Agriculture and Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change.
International Solar Alliance (ISA): ISA was jointly launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the then President of France, Francois Hollande in Paris on the side-lines of CoP 21 in 2015. The vision and mission of the alliance is to provide a dedicated platform for cooperation among solar resource rich countries that lie completely or partial between the Tropics of Capricorn &amp; Cancer.
State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC): State governments have drafted climate strategies aligned with the eight National Missions under the NAPCC. The strategies focus on issues ranging from climate mitigation, energy efficiency, and resource conservation to climate adaptation.
FAME Scheme for E-mobility: Union Government in April 2015 launched Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles (FAME) India Scheme with an aim to boost sales of eco-friendly vehicles in the country. It is a part of the National Mission for Electric Mobility.
Atal Mission for Rejuvenation &amp; Urban Transformation (AMRUT) for Smart Cities.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana: The scheme provides LPG connections to five crore below-poverty-line beneficiaries. The connections are given in the name of women beneficiaries to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and conventional fuel like cow dung for cooking food, thus reducing air pollution.
UJALA scheme: The scheme was launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2015 with a target of replacing 77 crore incandescent lamps with LED bulbs. The usage of LED bulbs will not only result in reducing electricity bills but also help in environment protection.
Swachh Bharat Mission: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Movement) is a campaign that was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 2, 2014. The campaign seeks to clean the streets, roads and infrastructure of the countrys 4041 statutory cities and towns.
Conclusion:
Unprecedentedly, today, the world population is encountering unfamiliar human-induced changes in the lower and middle atmospheres and world-wide depletion of various other natural systems (e.g. soil fertility, aquifers, ocean fisheries, and biodiversity in general). Adaptation and Mitigation together will help in tackling the health impacts of Climate change.
Extra information: inspiring examples of adaptation solutions for health worldwide:
The Climate Adaptation Management and Innovation Initiative of the Word Food Programme develops climate-induced food insecurity analyses and practices to inform programming and decision-making. The initiative focuses on16 countries across Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern, Central and Northern Africa.
In France, the Tiger Mosquito Surveillance Network monitors the tiger mosquitos movements.
The Smart Health Facilities Initiative and Smart Hospitals Toolkit is being implemented through the Pan American Health Organization in the Caribbean with the aim of supporting the governments of the selected countries to assess and prioritize vulnerability reduction investments in their health facilities.
Some countries integrate health into their national adaptation plans (NAPs) and programmes. For example, Macedonia and six additional countries are part of an initiative of WHO and the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety that brings health into adaptation plans.
There are also a number of training and awareness-raising activities, including the Self-Learning Course on Climate Change and Health, developed by Mexicos National Institute of Public Health in line with the joint Pan American Health Organization/WHO Strategy and Plan for Action on Climate Change. The training aims at raising awareness and improving knowledge on the health effects of climate change among the general public and other sectors.

6) The easy drift in inflation is anticipated to continue, raising hopes of a promising policy shift by the RBI. Suggest what according to you should be the role of RBI in such a  scenario?(250 words)
Livemint
Why this question:
Following its hasty shift in monetary policy stance, RBI is in a tight spot currently. It is now looking for a respectable way out, thus the question in this context expects us to evaluate the role of RBI in such a scenario.
Key demand of the question:
Provide for detailed analysis of the current fix RBI is in, discuss in detail the situation of rising inflation vis-à-vis role of RBI and suggest what needs to be done.
Structure of the answer:
Introduction: 
Brief upon the recent trends in the RBI policy , highlight the shifts..
Body:
Discuss the following aspects : 
Explain in short the causes and consequences of inflation recently in the country.
Discuss the policies adopted by the RBI off late – the unusual move of change in its monetary stance from accommodative to neutral.
Take hints from the article and suggest what should be the ideal role of RBI in such a scenario.
Conclusion:
Conclude with optimism and suggest how the issue is not beyond  RBIs control and can be resolved with suitable steps in the right direction.
Introduction:
RBIs tight monetary policy has kept real interest rates high, impacting investment flow and job creation. Bridging liquidity gapbank loans vs bank depositsis necessary as it would work against RBIs intention to soften interest rates. RBI is trying to fill the liquidity deficit through all possible liquidity tools, even adding a new one by doing a forex swap auction
Body:
Causes for inflation in India:
Inflation can take place as a result of a rise in aggregate demand or a failure of aggregate supply or both.
Increase in public expenditure: Public expenditure has risen from 18.6% of GDP in 1961 to around 28% in 2012- 13. Around, 40% of the government expenditure in India is on non-developmental activities like defence, law and order, etc.
Deficit financing: Deficit financing means financing of budget deficits either by borrowing from the banks or by printing of more currency. The Government of India has frequently resorted to deficit financing in order to meet its developmental expenditure. The budgetary deficit was 20,000 crores in the eighth plan, but the actual deficit was around 33,000 crores. In the ninth, tenth and eleventh plans, the Government decided not to raise money through deficit financing.
Erratic agricultural growth: Agriculture is mainly dependent on monsoons and thus, crop failures have been a regular feature of agriculture. During times of scarcity of food grains, not only do the prices of food articles increase, but also the general price levels.
Inadequate rise in industrial production: There is a huge demand for industrial good due to increase in money supply in the economy but the rise in industrial growth has been inadequate there by raising the prices of industrial products. This has led to cost-push inflation.
Large scale tax evasion and avoidance: Failure of the Government to bring the increasing income of the people within the ambit of taxation.
Black marketing and hoarding of essential commodities; Unused capacity in industries
Consequences of inflation:
Inflation causes decrease in the real value of money and other monetary items over time.
Inflation causes uncertainty over future and this may discourage investment and savings.
High inflation may lead to shortages of goods if consumers begin hording out of concern that prices will increase in the future.
To tackle the inflation, there are host of direct and indirect measures. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) controls the policy rates which indirectly affects the inflation.
Recent Policy adopted by RBI:
Banks are giving out more loans than they are getting deposits; Indians are withdrawing more cash as the nation goes to polls within a fortnight; and the government has tightened its purse strings at the fiscal year-end to meet its target.
The result is a growing deficit of funds within the banking system, which RBI is trying to fill through all possible tools.
RBI added a new one by doing a forex swap auction earlier this week, which released rupee liquidity of 34,561 crore.
Forex Swap is the exercise where the dollars with banks will be swapped with rupee by RBI. This is being done in order to increase liquidity and also control the likelihood of rupee appreciation.
Way forward:
Bridging the liquidity gap is necessary as it would work against RBIs intention to soften interest rates
The central bank needs to keep infusing liquidity if it wants its benign policy to reflect in market rates.
After a rate cut in the previous policy, RBI cannot afford to allow market rates or even bank lending rates to rise.
Conclusion:
RBIs liquidity management needs a deft touch, even as it uses all of the tools in its arsenal to make liquidity neutral in line with its policy stance.

Ethics by Lexicon 
Reference
Why this question:
The question is in the context of codes of conduct and quality of service delivery and their significance in governance.
Key demand of the question:
The answer must discuss in detail the aspects of codes of conduct and quality of service, their essence and how they are centric to the core of Governance.
Structure of the answer:
Introduction: 
Briefly discuss what you understand by code of ethics and quality of service delivery.
Body:
Explain the following 
What is code of conduct ? it is an internal guideline and an external statement of corporate values and commitments.
Quality of service – comparison of expectations with performance. A customers expectation of a particular service is determined by factors such as personal needs and past experiences. The expected service and the perceived service sometimes may not be equal, thus leaving a gap.
Discuss their importance in Governance in detail.
Conclusion:
Conclude with importance of these values in public services and Governance in general.
Introduction:
Code of conduct represents the set of enforceable rules that should be followed by a person in an organisation. A Code of Conduct applies the Code of Ethics to a host of relevant situations. A particular rule in the Code of Ethics might state that all employees will obey the law, a Code of Conduct might list several specic laws relevant to different areas of organizational operations, or industry, that employees need to obey.
Service quality is a comparison of expectations with performance. A customers expectation of a particular service is determined by factors such as personal needs and past experiences. The expected service and the perceived service sometimes may not be equal, thus leaving a gap.
Body:
Code of conduct is necessary because:
The Code of Conduct outlines specific behaviours that are required or prohibited as a condition of ongoing employment. Example: It might forbid sexual harassment, racial intimidation or viewing inappropriate or unauthorized content on company computers.
It is used in an attempt to regulate behavior in very different ways.
Code of conduct is a set of guidelines that influence employees actions.
Code of Conduct originated from the code of ethics, and it converts the rules into specific guidelines, that must be followed by the members of the organisation.
Code of Conduct is focused on compliance and rules. Example: It would have avoided and punished instances like recent Nirav Modi scam where ethics of the bank employees was under question.
The organizations desire is to obtain a narrow range of acceptable behaviors from employees
Conduct regulations assert that some specific actions are appropriate, others inappropriate.
Quality service delivery is imperative due to:
Governance and the quality of public services can impact a countrys economic growth.
The objective of public services is to deliver social protection to the poor and vulnerable and to alleviate poverty.
Public services reduce inequitable distribution of resources and correct historical inequities, such as caste based discrimination and gender inequities
The Sevottam model developed with the objective of improving the quality of public service delivery in the country.
Direct Cash transfer to facilitate disbursements of Government entitlements.
The Digital India programme to ensure that Government services are available to citizens electronically.
Conclusion:
Code of conduct helps in channelizing the efforts of the employees to give the best quality of service delivery. Both are vital for good governance of a country.",SECURE SYNOPSIS: 29 MARCH 2019 NOTE: Please remember that following ‘answers’ are NOT ‘model answers’.

"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Associated+Press, By Associated Press and Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com","Archaeologists excavating an unexplored part of Italy's volcanic ash-covered city of Pompeii have discovered a street of houses with intact balconies that were buried when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. Some of the balconies even had amphorae - the conical-shaped terra cotta vases that were used to hold wine and oil in ancient Roman times. The culture ministry's Pompeii authority announced the discovery Thursday. Scroll down for video A detail of a fresco that was found during excavation works in the archaeological site of Pompeii, Thursday, May 17, 2018. Archaeologists excavating an unexplored part of Pompeii have discovered a street of houses with intact balconies that were buried when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. It said the balconies were a 'complete novelty' for this part of the buried city, which hasn't yet been fully excavated. A statement said the balconies will be restored and the area included in a tour open to the public. 'This type of find is a novelty for this area of Pompeii,'a spokesperson for the archaeological site said in a statement shared to social media. 'Almost two thousand years from the eruption of 79 AD, Pompeii continues to give us treasures.' A man points at a detail of a fresco that was found during excavation works in the archaeological site of Pompeii, Thursday, May 17, 2018. Archaeologists excavating an unexplored part of Pompeii have discovered a street of houses with intact balconies that were buried when Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. 'A series of buildings with three large balconies have emerged in an area now being excavated. 'On one of the balconies, pots of wine lying on their side [were also found, which were] probably put out to dry in the sun,' the statement continued. Experts will now restore the houses, which will be open to the public as part of a new tour route at the popular site once the necessary work has been completed. Earlier this week the ancient remains of a military horse that died 2,000 years ago in the inferno that obliterated Pompeii were discovered - thanks to the help of tomb raiders. Criminals had been using tunnels they dug to search for valuables in the ruins of a Roman villa, located in a suburb of the long destroyed city. Their work prompted conservators of the Unesco world heritage site to start their own digs, in order to put a stop to their activities and protect its remaining artefacts. Researchers used laser scanning to map a 200ft (60m) long network of illegal tunnels dug by the robbers and began excavating. They recreated the complete outline of the horse they discovered using plaster casting, the first time this has happened at the site. The remains of humans, mules, donkeys and other animals that were victims of the eruption of Mt Vesuvius' in AD 78 have previously been restored using the technique. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF POMPEII? Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow. More than 16,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day. An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century. Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unawares. He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours. While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life. Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000.

AFP,"Alotenango (Guatemala): Rescue workers pulled more bodies Monday from under the dust and rubble left by an explosive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, bringing the death toll to at least 65. Disaster Relief Agency spokesman David de Leon told a briefing that after hours of searching for survivors, the number of dead had hit at least 65. In addition, there are 46 people injured, most of them seriously, more than 1.7 million being hit by the disaster, including 3,271 ordered evacuated and 1,787 in shelters in the departments of Escuintla, Sacatepequez and Chimaltenango since Sunday’s eruption. The 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano erupted early Sunday, spewing out towering plumes of ash and a hail of fiery rock fragments with scalding mud. Authorities had warned the death toll could rise after searches resumed for survivors in communities on the mountain’s southern flank. After an initial toll of 25 dead, it was revised upwards within hours as bodies were recovered from villages razed by the tumbling mud. “There are missing persons, but we do not know how many,” said Sergio Cabanas of Guatemala’s disaster management agency. A roll call of communities on the slopes of the volcano was under way. The speed and ferocity of the eruption took mountain communities by surprise, with many of the dead found in or around their homes. Cabanas said those who were killed had been overrun by fast-moving burning material discharged by the volcano Sunday. Communities located on its southern slope were the worst hit. Several of the dead were children. An AFP journalist saw at least three bodies burned in the rubble of the village of San Miguel Los Lotes, where rescue workers, soldiers and police were desperately searching for survivors. Dead dogs, chickens and ducks also lay among the mud and ash, much of it still smoking. “I do not want to leave, but go back, and there is nothing I can do to save my family,” a weeping Eufemia Garcia, 48, told AFP. She was searching for her three children, her mother, nephews and siblings. Garcia, from Los Lotes, said she escaped with the help of her husband. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said he was deeply saddened by the “tragic loss of life and the significant damage caused by the eruption,” and said the UN was ready to assist national rescue and relief efforts. President Jimmy Morales, who has declared three days of national mourning, visited the disaster zone. “The volcano has erupted before, but never like this,” said Gustavo Larius, a 27-year-old bricklayer searching the streets of his village for missing family and friends, a handkerchief pressed over his mouth and nose. The eruption sent ash billowing over the surrounding area, turning plants and trees gray and blanketing streets, cars and people. Farmers covered in ash fled for their lives as civil defense workers tried to relocate them to shelters. “This time we were saved; in another (eruption) no,” said Efrain Gonzalez, 52, sitting on the floor of a shelter in the city of Escuintla, where he arrived with his wife and one-year-old daughter. Gonzalez was overwhelmed with despair, as two more of his children, aged 10 and four, are missing. They were trapped in their home, which was flooded with hot mud that descended from the volcano. Dense ash blasted out by the volcano shut down Guatemala City’s international airport, civil aviation officials said. The eruption ended after 16.5 hours, but “there is a likelihood that it will reactivate” warned the Institute of Volcanology. The speed of the eruption took locals by surprise, and could be explained by it producing pyroclastic flows, sudden emissions of gas and rock fragments, rather than lava, said volcanologist David Rothery of Britain’s Open University. “A lava flow rarely travels fast enough to engulf people,” he said. “The videos and still images I’ve seen suggest instead one or more pyroclastic flows. This is when a violently erupted mass of rock fragments and hot gas finds itself too dense to rise as an ash column and instead cascades down the volcano’s slopes. “Pyroclastic flows or surges can move at over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, and may be hot enough to glow like molten lava. They can travel further, as well as much faster, than lava flows,” said Rothery. Fuego has been erupting since 2002, and was continuously active in 2017. There were explosions and ash plumes and a volcanic mudflow last month.","Since Sunday’s explosive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, at least 65 people have died, 46 injured—most of them seriously, and more than 1.7 million being hit by the disaster",2018-06-05T07:11:29Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Livemint.com'}",Toll rises in Guatemala volcano as more bodies recovered,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/dNGcN33TVAlccI4lKwRJgK/Toll-rises-in-Guatemala-volcano-as-more-bodies-recovered.html,https://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2018/06/06/Photos/Processed/fuego-ka6F--621x414@LiveMint.jpg,,Livemint.com,mudflow,1
Bangkok Post Public Company Limited,"Ashes from Mount Kusatsu-Shirane are seen near its summit after its eruption in Kusatsu, Gunma prefecture, central Japan, on Tuesday. (AP photo) Volcanic tremors forced police and firefighters to suspend search operations on Wednesday at a ski resort near a volcano in eastern Japan that erupted the day before, officials said. The sudden eruption of Mt. Moto-Shirane in Gunma Prefecture on Tuesday morning rained volcanic rocks onto people at the Kusatsu Kokusai Ski Resort, killing a 49-year-old Ground Self-Defense Force sergeant major training there and injuring 11 others. The Japan Meteorological Agency said it observed the tremors, caused by movements of lava or heated water underground, four times Wednesday and warned that the 2,171-metre mountain could erupt again and spew large volcanic rocks. Kenji Nogami, a professor of geochemistry at Tokyo Institute of Technology who has been surveying the mountain, said the latest eruption was a ""typical phreatic eruption"", in which groundwater heated by lava turns into vapour and explodes. The land ministry sent experts to survey the eruption by helicopter but they were unable to conduct work due to bad weather. They instead analysed aerial footage taken on Tuesday and said the risk of landslides occurring at the mountain is believed to be low at the moment. Local police and firefighters were searching by land to make sure there were no other victims left behind, before the operation was called off for the day. (Video YouTube/BBC News) The central government indicated it could alter how volcanoes are monitored, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga saying at a press conference in Tokyo that ""security cameras failed to capture the latest eruption."" Weather agency officials have said they were unable to visually confirm the eruption and were only able to notify people on the mountain about an hour later that an eruption seemed to have occurred. ""We will review how to respond in the future by thoroughly reviewing the matter at the Japan Meteorological Agency,"" Suga, the top government spokesman, said. Japan, prone to volcano eruptions and earthquakes, currently monitors 50 of 111 active volcanoes across the country. Mt Moto-Shirane had been dormant for the past 3,000 years, although another of the peaks comprising the Kusatsu-Shirane mountain cluster erupted in 1983. The Kusatsu-Shirane cluster has been among those under constant surveillance, although the weather agency had assessed a crater 2 kilometres away was the most likely to erupt. The number of volcanic earthquakes surpassed 400 in the first five hours of the eruption but none were observed from midnight to 9am Wednesday, according to the agency. Volcanic mudflow often accompanies an eruption at a snowy mountain. When massive amounts of melted snow mixes with soil, it can turn into a huge mudflow that can travel at speeds of over 60 kilometres-per-hour and damage a wide area, requiring quick evacuations by people downhill. Yasuo Ishizaki, a volcanic geology professor at the University of Toyama, said although the likelihood of volcanic mudflow occurring at the mountain appears to be low, ""if a large-scale eruption accompanying excretion of lava occurs, it would increase the risk.""","Volcanic tremors forced police and firefighters to suspend search operations on Wednesday at a ski resort near a volcano in eastern Japan that erupted the day before, officials said.",2018-01-24T09:21:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bangkokpost.com'}",Volcanic tremors hinder search after deadly eruption in Japan,https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/1401254/volcanic-tremors-hinder-search-after-deadly-eruption-in-japan,https://www.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20180124/c1_1401254_620x413.jpg,,Bangkokpost.com,mudflow,1
Adan Salazar,"The death toll from a massive debris flow that buried homes and cars under a torrent of mud and boulders has risen to 15 in Montecito, where local personnel and the U.S. Coast Guard are planning to continue rescue operations Wednesday morning. About 300 people remained stuck in their homes in Montecito’s Romero Canyon neighborhood and throughout the debris field, where authorities planned to launch helicopter rescues at daybreak. The mudslides began around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, when intense rains dislodged boulders and caused heavy mudflow along hillsides that were scarred by the sprawling Thomas fire late last year. A number of homes were ripped from their foundations, with some pulled more than a half-mile by water and mud before they broke apart.

Photo: Michael Owen Baker, AP Deadly 'debris flows' carved destructive California slides LOS ANGELES (AP) — Torrents like the ones that carved deadly and destructive paths through Montecito, California, during a powerful storm early are commonly described as mudslides, but geologists and emergency workers call them debris flows. Debris flows pose a significant threat when rain falls in the aftermath of wildfires such as the inferno that scorched more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers) in two Southern California counties last month and destroyed and damaged hundreds of homes and other structures. Tuesday's debris flows killed at least 13 people and injured at least 25. They happened when water that would have otherwise been absorbed or at least slowed by vegetation instead instantly ran down creeks and other drainage areas, picking up soil, rocks, trees — and potentially growing powerful enough to carry massive boulders and vehicles. Their speed can exceed 35 mph (56 kph), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The aftermath in Montecito showed the destructive power of the debris flows: Home foundations swept bare, tangled piles of shattered debris, head-high boulders strewn about and the deaths of residents. ""Water is very powerful,"" said Amber Anderson, a spokeswoman for Santa Barbara County. ""This is a massive amount of debris carried by water."" The geological survey said many deaths from debris flows occur when people are asleep, just as happened in Montecito, where heavy rain fell in a short period of time a few hours after midnight. The geological survey urges people to stay awake when conditions may be dangerous, monitor broadcast storm reports and listen for unusual sounds that could indicate something is moving. That's what caught the ear of Thomas Tighe, a Montecito resident who was outside around 3:30 a.m. checking his home's downspouts during a downpour. ""I came around the house and heard a deep rumbling, an ominous sound, that I knew was the boulders moving as the mud was rising,"" he said. The amount of material that can be transported in a debris flow can be staggering. After a 2009 wildfire burned more than 250 square miles (647 square kilometers) in the San Gabriel Mountains above foothill suburbs of Los Angeles, a geological survey study found that some of the burned watersheds could release up to 100,000 cubic yards (76,500 cubic meters) of material — enough mud and rock to cover a football field 60 feet (18 meters) deep. Among dramatic historic examples in the mountains of Southern California, a 1934 storm unleashed runoff so intense that 30 people were killed, more than 480 homes were destroyed and a nearly 60-ton (54-metric ton) boulder was pushed out of a canyon. On Christmas Day in 2003, a storm over mountains scarred by wildfires unleashed a debris flow that killed 16 people gathered at a church facility in a canyon. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Torrents like the ones that carved deadly and destructive paths through Montecito, California, during a powerful storm early are commonly described as mudslides, but geologists and emergency workers call them debris flows.

Christo A number of Irish people are receiving consular assistance from the Department of Foreign affairs in Bali as a volcano threat has closed the only international airport. Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali on Monday as the island's international airport was forced to close, stranding tens of thousands of travellers. A major eruption is 'imminent' according to reports. A spokeswoman for Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) told Independent.ie the DFA is providing consular assistance to a number of Irish citizens currently in Bali. The department's travel advice in respect of Bali has also been updated. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 9,800ft (3,000m) into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 7.5 miles (12km) away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season, and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early on Monday and expanded the danger zone to 6 miles (10km) in places from the previous 4.7 miles (7.5km). It said a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said some 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or do not want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centres after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ""will certainly spill over to the slopes"", Mr Sutopo said. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation centre. ""We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just three miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,"" she said. The family had stayed at the same sports centre in September and October when the volcano's alert was at the highest level for several weeks but did not erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. ""If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I'll just accept it if our house is destroyed,"" she said. Bali's airport was closed early on Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning, although officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about five million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were cancelled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighbouring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighbouring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia's tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district, which surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the mountain, which prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on October 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centres.

Amber Hicks,"Tourists in Bali are being warned to stay away from the island's Mount Agung volcano after it began spewing smoke.
The eruption, which lasted around three minutes, covered nearby villages with a thin layer of ash and residents have been urged to keep clear of the 'danger zone.'
According to the countrys volcanology centre, white clouds were sent more than 700 metres into the air.
Residents near Mount Agung as well as climbers and tourists should not carry out any activity in the danger zone or within four-kilometre radius from the crater, the centre said in a statement.

  The eruption occurred at 4.09am local time but the height of the ash column could not be measured because of the heavy fog.
""The eruption was recorded on a seismograph with a maximum amplitude of 22 millimeters and a duration of three minutes and eight seconds.""
Officials have confirmed that flights are operating as normal, and nearby villages have not seen an evacuation order.
However, residents and tourists are being told to be on the alert for cold lava flows, which is a type of mudflow that can form from mud and ash, reports News.com.au.

  The volcano's last major eruption was in 1963 and killed almost 1,600 people.
Mount Agung is in the Karangasem Regency in East Bali, about 75 kilometres from the tourist hub of Kuta.
It sits 3,142 metres above sea level, and along with Mount Batur, is one of the largest on the island.
Authorities have forbidden climbing on Mount Agung since its volcanic activity increased in 2017.
Volcanic activities in the danger zone are dynamic and can change at any time, according to the condition of the mountain, the observatory added.

Enrico Dela Cruz,"Manila: The Philippines has raised the alert level at its rumbling Mayon volcano to ""level 3"" after detecting lava flow and indications of activity that could lead to eruptions of magma. More than 9000 people have been evacuated from villages near Mayon, a tourist attraction because of its near-perfect cone shape, following a ""steam-driven eruption"" on Saturday. Lava cascades down the slopes of Mayon volcano as seen from Legazpi city, Albay, around 340 kilometers south-east of Manila on Monday. Photo: Earl Recamunda People within the slope of the volcano, but outside the established ""danger zones"", were told to take precautionary measures against possible roof collapses due to accumulated ash and rainwater, and ""lahar"", an Indonesian term for a volcanic mudflow. The provincial government suspended Monday's classes from kindergarten to senior high school in some areas. More than 9000 people have evacuated the area around the Philippines' most active volcano as lava flowed down its crater on Monday in a gentle eruption that scientists warned could turn explosive. Photo: Earl Recamunda Authorities advised people to cover their noses and mouths with a damp, clean cloth or dust mask if they were exposed to ash from the eruptions, and said aircraft must avoid flying close to the volcano's summit. Two similar ""phreatic"" eruptions occurred at the volcano in central Albay province on Sunday, unleashing more ash. ""Mayon's summit crater is now exhibiting bright crater glow that signifies the growth of a new lava dome and beginnings of lava flow towards the southern slopes,"" the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said. Phivolcs chief Renato Solidum said the volcano appeared due for another major eruption as it has been displaying abnormal behaviour since late last year. An orange glow is seen at the cloud-shrouded crater of Mayon on Sunday. Photo: Earl Recamunda ""Alert level 3 is what we considered critical, 4 is when eruption is imminent, and 5 is eruption in progress,"" Cedric Daep, head of the Albay Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, said in a radio interview. Mayon's most destructive eruption was in February 1814, when lava buried a town and killed 1200 people. It last erupted in 2014, spewing lava and forcing thousands of people to evacuate. The latest eruptions began on Saturday, unleashing ash, rocks and sulphur fumes and accompanied by rumbling sounds. The institute had earlier raised the alert to ""level 2"", saying the activity was ""probably of magmatic origin, which could lead to more phreatic eruptions or eventually to hazardous magmatic eruptions."" Since then, the institute said it had recorded 158 rockfall events and urged people to stay away from a 6-kilometre radius Permanent Danger Zone and a 7-km Expanded Danger Zone on the volcano's southern flank. Landslides and sudden explosions or a dome collapse that may generate hazardous volcanic flows are also possible, it said. Meanwhile Mount Agung on the Indonesian island of Bali has spewed thick plumes of ash 2500 metres into the sky in the latest eruption, the country's disaster management agency says. Monday's eruption was brief and there were no casualties, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, adding that the resort island's international airport was operating normally. Authorities raised the alert to the highest level on November 27 and ordered the evacuation of nearly 100,000 people. The 3031-metre Mount Agung last erupted for a period of almost a year in 1963 and 1964, leaving about 1200 people dead.

An atmospheric river — a huge plume of subtropical moisture — took aim at the state's central and southern coast, where the wealthy community of Montecito near Santa Barbara is still trying to recover from a January storm that unleashed mudslides from a vast burn area, swamping homes and killing 21 people. The storm was expected to arrive during the night and last through Thursday, bringing 2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 centimeters) of rain to coastal areas and valleys, and 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) in foothills and mountains, the National Weather Service said. Authorities told as many as 30,000 people to leave communities on the south coast of Santa Barbara County, where mudslides from a Jan. 9 deluge destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes in Montecito, killed 21 people and left two children missing. Authorities also ordered evacuations in parts of neighboring Ventura County. Many residents of both counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history. It scorched more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers), destroyed 1,063 buildings and damaged 280 others. That blaze and previous fires dating to mid-2016 set up the potential for extreme danger from storms. Montecito resident Molly Rosecrance said she now keeps emergency rations and clothing in the trunk of her car. ""I'm tired of moving it,"" she told Santa Barbara news station KEYT-TV on Monday. ""So if there is anything that comes down of any consequence, I might be out of my house for two weeks. I have groceries in the car to take to a friend's house and clothes."" The National Weather Service said forecasting models of the atmospheric river indicated the first 24 to 36 hours of the storm would target southern Santa Barbara County, western Ventura County and farther up the coast in San Luis Obispo County. No evacuations were ordered elsewhere, but with burn scars scattered statewide, authorities urged people to be prepared for the storm and made sandbags available. Away from the coast, flash flood watches were to go into effect Wednesday for areas of the Sierra Nevada and mountains in the interior of Southern California. Along with the hazards, the storm had the potential to help boost water supplies in the central coast region, where drought conditions have recently gone back to extreme or severe levels. In the Sierra, where snowpack is a key portion of the state's water supply, U.S. Drought Monitor classifications range from abnormally dry to moderate drought. The most recent state measurement of the snowpack found its water content 39 percent of normal early this month, before storms brought blizzard conditions and even avalanche danger.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities ordered tens of thousands of people to flee their homes as a powerful storm headed toward California, where many communities on Tuesday face the threat of flooding and destructive debris flows from areas burned bare by huge wild…",2018-03-21T03:04:02Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sfgate.com'}",Powerful storm threatens to swamp hard-hit California towns,https://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/Evacuations-ordered-as-powerful-storm-nears-12767148.php,https://s.hdnux.com/photos/72/15/26/15259047/5/rawImage.jpg,,Sfgate.com,mudflow,1
"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Associated+Press, By Associated Press","LOS ANGELES (AP) - More than $421 million in claims have been filed since deadly mudslides tore through the coastal community of Montecito during extremely heavy January rains, California's insurance commissioner said Monday. Insurers have received more than 2,000 claims for residential and commercial losses, commissioner Dave Jones announced. Those include $388 million for residential personal property, $27.2 million for commercial property and $6.7 million for auto and other lines of insurance. Recently burned by California's largest recorded wildfire, the hillsides of Montecito northwest of Los Angeles could not absorb the rainstorm with an epic downpour of nearly an inch (2.5 centimeters) in 15 minutes early on Jan. 9. FILE - In this Jan. 10, 2018, file aerial photo provided by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, mudflow and damage to homes in Montecito, Calif. California's insurance commissioner says more than $421 million in insurance claims losses have been filed since deadly mudslides blasted through the community of Montecito during extremely heavy January rains. (Matt Udkow/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via AP, File) ""Once the rains hit, the water runs down, begins to take mud with it, and before you know it you have a 30 or 35-foot high wall of mud demolishing Montecito,"" Jones said. Twenty-one people were killed and two remain missing. The mudslide insurance claims come on top of California wildfire claims that topped $12 billion in 2017, making it the most expensive series of fires in state history, Jones said. That exceeds the total insurance claims from the top 10 previously most costly wildfires in California. Most of last year's claims were connected to Southern California's fires in December and October's devastating blazes in wine country north of San Francisco. Jones said he fears the staggering number of insurance claims represent a ""new normal"" for California. ""It used to be we could talk about a wildfire season. Now that's simply not the case. Wildfires are year-round, and Californians need to protect themselves accordingly,"" he warned. In Montecito, 1,415 residences were damaged and 107 were destroyed, in some cases swept completely off their foundations, Jones said. Five commercial properties were demolished and 235 others suffered damage when torrents of water flowed down hills carrying mud, boulders and debris. Jones recalled the experience of touring the devastation zone as ""extraordinarily chilling."" The commissioner predicted that the $421 million total will climb as additional claims are made and existing ones are adjusted. Few residents in Montecito, with 3,200 households, had flood or mudslide insurance prior to the destruction. But the Department of Insurance has instructed insurers to honor claims if they had fire coverage, Jones said. That's because the debris flow's ""proximate cause"" was the enormous Thomas fire that scorched a huge swath of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties starting in December and loosened hillsides that became vulnerable to mudslides weeks later. Jones said insurers have enough reserves to pay the massive claims. But he said the fires and subsequent debris flows may prompt them to re-evaluate the fire risk and raise premiums, especially for California homes in high-risk areas. ___ Follow Weber at https://twitter.com/WeberCM.

Jean Folger,"As a landlord, you operate a rental property business. As with any business, you need to keep good records; file taxes and report income and expenses to the IRS; comply with local, state and federal laws; maintain various insurance policies and obtain legal services when needed. Accounting and Recordkeeping An important part of your business will be accounting and recordkeeping. You must keep accurate records of all income and expenses, and you must be able to provide documentary evidence – such as receipts, canceled checks and bills – that supports your expenses. You’ll use these records to monitor your rental property activities, prepare financial statements and provide evidence in case you are ever the subject of an IRS audit. (For more, see How Do IRS Audits Work? ) You can maintain your accounting records by using inexpensive journals and ledger sheets to track income and expenses, or you can use computer programs such as Microsoft Excel and Intuit's Quicken. There are also commercially available software packages – such as AppFolio and Buildium – developed specifically for property management. Regardless of which method you choose, it’s to your benefit to maintain up-to-date records from day one. It’s much easier to record a few income and expense lines each day than to play catch-up when tax time approaches. Because tax laws are fairly complicated regarding rental property and rental income, it’s helpful to hire a qualified tax accountant to prepare your tax return and provide guidance for the favorable handling of current and future income and expenses. Taxes As a landlord, you can claim certain tax benefits when you file your yearly income tax return and when you sell the property. To take advantage of the special tax treatments that are available to landlords, you must be aware of the benefits and understand how they work, taking them into consideration when you plan your rental property activities and expenses. You should be able to deduct the interest payments on your rental property mortgage, as well as the following expenses: advertising (to find both tenants and people to help you maintain the property) depreciation (for the home and the cost of major improvements that add value to the property) expenses for rental items for tenants' use insurance premiums losses from casualties or thefts (excepts for amounts reimbursed by insurance) outdoor painting property taxes rental losses (a deduction up to $25,000 is available to non-real estate professionals who own at least a 10% interest in a rental property they actively manage and that operates at a loss during the tax year) repair and routine maintenance costs tax preparation travel and transportation utilities wages and fees paid to people you hire to help maintain the property To be eligible to take these tax deductions, you must be able to prove that you intend to rent out the property for the long term, rather than for a short period of time (such as while you are waiting to sell the home). Signed long-term leases and copies of advertisements you placed supporting your intention to find long-term tenants can help provide the evidence you need if you are audited by the IRS. Local, State and Federal Compliance It may well be worth the money to consult with a qualified attorney to determine how to comply with local, state and federal laws and permitting and licensing requirements. A qualified attorney will be an expert in landlord-tenant law (i.e., don't consult a criminal defense lawyer for advice regarding your rental property, even if he or she is your pro bono friend). You shouldn't skimp on this expense: Hire the right professional for the job. Local housing codes determine requirements for the structure, facilities and essential services including water and heat. Local laws may also cover the same standards as state laws, such as raising rents, the handling of security deposits and the eviction of tenants. Your local building or housing authority may have copies of local laws and ordinances that affect landlord-tenant relationships. You can also check online or with your local public library, city manager or mayor's office. State laws generally regulate landlord-tenant matters such as evictions, housing standards, landlord's right of entry, repairs and maintenance, and security deposits. You can contact your state's consumer protection agency or attorney general's office to obtain copies of pamphlets or brochures that describe state laws regarding landlord-tenant relationships. Because laws change periodically, it’s important to request updated information on rental laws and statutes. Federal laws that pertain to landlord-tenant relationships cover discrimination and landlord responsibilities regarding environmental health hazards, including asbestos and lead paint. Landlords must follow the Civil Rights Act, which specifically prohibits race-based discrimination. They must also comply with the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, which prohibit discrimination based on the following: race or color religion national origin familial status or age (including families with children and pregnant women) disability handicap gender In addition, the acts prohibit landlords from doing any of the following: advertising or making statements that show a preference or limitation based on a protected class (such as race or gender) falsely stating that a rental unit is unavailable setting different or more restrictive standards for certain tenants (such as requiring a larger security deposit) refusing to rent to members of certain groups setting different terms or conditions for certain tenants, before or at any time during the tenancy ending a tenancy for any reason that can be attributed to discrimination You can read about federal laws in the U.S. Code, available in many public libraries, or in the Code of Federal Regulations. While no landlord is exempt from the Civil Rights Act, federal fair housing laws don’t apply in certain situations: owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer rental units single-family housing that is rented out without advertising or the assistance of a real estate agent/broker (provided the landlord owns three or fewer such homes) housing operated by certain religious organizations and private clubs who rent solely to their own members housing that specifically serves senior citizens (including ""62 and older"" and ""55 and older"" communities) Even if you’re exempt from federal fair housing laws (for example, you have an owner-occupied building with three rental units), you may still be required to comply with similar state laws, and all landlords must follow the fair housing laws that prohibit discrimination in advertising. It’s your responsibility to know, understand and comply with all local, state and federal laws. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Legal Services Before you rent your property, it’s a good idea to consult with an attorney who specializes in landlord-tenant law to confirm that you are in compliance with all local, state and federal laws. Your attorney can also review the lease that you plan to use to make sure it protects you and contains the proper language – it’s possible for a novice landlord to be outfoxed by a professional tenant. Remember, a lease is a legal document that specifies the terms of the landlord-tenant relationship. Your attorney can make sure the document provides a legal basis for enforcing rental policies. In the event a tenant files a lawsuit against you, your attorney can provide guidance to help protect you and your assets. And if you need to evict a tenant, it’s helpful to consult with an attorney who can help you successfully navigate through the process and avoid mistakes. Insurance A standard homeowner's insurance policy covers owner-occupied residences and probably won't cover losses sustained while a tenant occupies the property. You’ll need a landlord-specific insurance policy, and you should expect to pay a bit more for it than a homeowner's policy because your tenants are viewed as higher risk than you are. That's because the typical homeowner takes better care of his or her home than a tenant will. In addition, a homeowner is more likely to notice and respond to maintenance needs – such as a leaky faucet or roof – before they turn into bigger problems. You should buy adequate insurance before renting out your property. At a minimum, it’s recommended that you have landlord liability insurance to protect you in case someone is hurt while on your property, and basic landlord property insurance to cover losses arising from fires, storms, theft and vandalism. Lenders typically require you to have basic property insurance on mortgaged property. Since your landlord policy will only cover losses related to your property and belongings, you should advise your tenants to purchase their own renter’s insurance to protect their personal property. (For related reading, see Renter’s Insurance: A Comprehensive Guide.) In addition to liability and basic property insurance, there may be other policies – such as flood insurance – that are required if your rental property is located in certain areas. Even if these are optional, they may be worth considering. In most cases, a policy is very affordable compared to the potential financial losses you could sustain without the coverage. The various insurance companies may have different names for the policies, so it is important to find out exactly what you are purchasing – know what the policy covers and what is excluded. If your rental property is located in an area deemed a ""special flood hazard area"" by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), your lender will require you to have flood insurance on the property. A flood insurance policy is separate from your basic property insurance (which doesn’t cover losses resulting from floods). A ""flood"" is defined as an excess of water on land that is usually dry. Flood insurance protects you against losses from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, runoff of surface water, mudflow (i.e., landslides or mudslides) or erosion caused by water. Many losses due to floods occur in low-risk areas where you think you wouldn’t need the coverage. Tenant relocation insurance covers your costs to move tenants to a different location if your property becomes uninhabitable due to damage caused by a fire or other disaster. Rent loss insurance protects you against the loss of rental income in the event that a fire or other disaster makes your rental property uninhabitable. Bonding protects you against losses if you or someone you hire is the victim of a robbery after collecting rents. ​ Becoming a Landlord: Finding Tenants","Landlords need to keep good records; file with the IRS; comply with local, state and federal laws; maintain various insurance policies; and obtain legal services.",2017-11-21T15:27:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Investopedia.com'}",The Complete Guide To Becoming A Landlord: Operating As A Landlord,https://www.investopedia.com/university/the-complete-guide-to-becoming-a-landlord/operating-as-a-landlord.asp,https://i.investopedia.com/facebook/investopedia-facebook-image.gif,,Investopedia.com,mudflow,1

""Our community is going through something it has never gone through."" Those at the vigil included the family of 30-year-old Pinit Sutthithepa, whose body was discovered Saturday afternoon. His 2-year-old daughter, Lydia, remained missing. His 6-year-old son, Peerawat, nicknamed Pasta, and his 79-year-old father-in-law, Richard Loring Taylor, also were killed in the mudslides. Family members said they were too distraught to speak. ""This family is one of several that lost multiple family members,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. ""And we know that the suffering of those who knew and loved all of the victims is immense."" The list of those still missing in the mudslides has shrunk to four. In the disaster area, firefighters went door to door on Sunday to check the structural stability of the houses damaged by a powerful rainstorm that preceded the mudslides and scoured what's left of toppled homes and mangled cars as they searched for the missing. Search and rescue operations ended Sunday and authorities transitioned to a search and recovery phase, Brown said. The move allows officials to release resources that are no longer needed and allow search operations to slow to a safer pace, he said. The storm sent flash floods cascading through mountain slopes that were burned bare by a huge wildfire in December. Workers used backhoes, jackhammers and chain saws to clear away masses of mud, boulders and toppled trees. Crews have made it a priority to clear out debris basins and creek canals before another rainstorm. Long-range forecasts gave the crews about a week before the next chance of rain — and potential new mudslides — although the precipitation was expected to be disorganized and light. Another system was possible two days later. The mudslides on Jan. 9 ravaged the tony community, destroying at least 65 homes and damaging more than 460 others, officials said. They also forced the indefinite shutdown of U.S. 101, the only major freeway between Santa Barbara and points east. The rest of the community's infrastructure also was damaged. Some streets were cracked in half, and authorities closed bridges and overpasses because they were unstable. Amtrak said it was adding rail cars to each of its five daily roundtrip trains between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to accommodate commuters grappling with the ongoing closure of U.S. 101. But despite the damage in the neighborhood, Montecito residents still have hope their community will recover. ""They're exhausted but they find ways to try to live life as normally as they can,"" Williams said. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Weber contributed to this report from Los Angeles.","MONTECITO, Calif.

Bella, I’m sorry you were inconvenienced,"" Lowe chided. ""We will try to move out our dead quicker."" Up to 43 people were still missing in Montecito Thursday evening and at least 17 people were killed when heavy rains caused rivers of mud and debris to wash away cars and homes in the area, which was recently ravaged by wildfires. Emergency crews continue to search the area for those who couldn't escape the deadly mudslides. The mudslides also washed away large stretches of the 101 freeway, which serves as the main freeway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.

Rescuers used dogs and helicopters to search for victims of powerful mudslides which left at least 15 people dead in a southern California community that is also home to major celebrities including Oprah Winfrey.

Mike Eliason/AP Heavy rain is drenching fire-ravaged southern California. And thousands of people are evacuating their homes because the rain is raising the risk of mudslides on hills stripped by the flames. Some 21,000 people have evacuated in large swathes of southern California, according to The Associated Press, including vulnerable areas of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. That's where the Thomas wildfire raged last month. It was the largest in California's history, burning more than 280,000 acres and destroying more than 1,000 structures. In Los Angeles County, several canyon areas are also under mandatory evacuation orders due to the heavy rains. Just an inch of rain fell in southern California last month, drying out the ground, as reporter Danielle Karson tells our Newscast unit. In areas where the fire burned, there's almost no ground vegetation. Meteorologist Joe Sirard tells Danielle that this can cause problems. ""When we get short-term heavy rain like we're getting right now, it will build up debris in the mud in these areas and it comes right down the mountain,"" Sirard says. ""So it could be a dangerous situation."" The National Weather Service is warning of the potential for flash flooding ""for much of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles Counties,"" with rainfall rates as high as an inch and a half per hour.

,"MONTECITO, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on the California mudslide disaster (all times local): 7:10 a.m. The number of people missing after the deadly mudslides in Montecito, California, has surged to 48. Santa Barbara County spokeswoman Amber Anderson says the new number tallied Thursday follows sheriff's investigations of missing-persons reports. The number of missing persons has fluctuated since the disaster hit early Tuesday morning and had been as low as 16 on Wednesday evening. Anderson says the number of confirmed fatalities remains at 17. ___ 6:26 a.m. The deadly mudslides that hit Montecito, California, were already occurring when Santa Barbara County officials first sent emergency alerts to cellphones in the area. County emergency manager Jeff Gater tells the Los Angeles Times that the alert issued around 3:50 a.m. Tuesday was sent because of deteriorating conditions and followed one issued by the National Weather Service. For days beforehand, the county had issued repeated warnings through social media, news media and community information emails about the potential for mudflows from the huge wildfire scar in the hills above neighborhoods. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-10', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 10', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-15', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 15', target_type: 'mix' }); _taboola.push({flush: true}); A firefighter walks among the rocks and mud left by a mudslide Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018, in Montecito, Calif.

AP | PTI,"Authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the Indonesian island's international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travellers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. A mudflow of volcanic debris and water are known as a lahar was filmed moving down the volcano's slopes. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency raised the alert to the highest level on Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometres in places from the previous maximum of 7.5 kilometres. It said in a statement that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centres after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were cancelled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighbouring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home, unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses are being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighbouring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. The geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano has shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. He told Indonesian television on Monday morning that he did not expect a big eruption but added: ""we have to stay alert and anticipate."" The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to their schools. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on October 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centres.

"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Reuters, By Reuters","By Ronn Bautista LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Residents around an erupting volcano in central Philippines have should prepare to flee to safer areas because of risks from huge debris that could be swept from slopes by heavy rains, state volcanologists said on Saturday. The most active volcano in the poor Southeast Asian country has been spewing lava and ash for the last two weeks and may have a major eruption within days, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said. The provincial government has expanded its danger zone to a 9 km (5.6 miles) radius of Mount Mayon in Albay province from the 8 km radius set by volcanologists. More than 75,000 people had been moved out from the danger zone to sheltered areas but many farmers and quarry workers were defying evacuation orders to work in stone quarries, on farms, and to tend livestock. ""It's a real threat so we are urging everyone to prepare and evacuate when told by authorities,"" said Mariton Bornas, head of the volcanology agency's monitoring and eruption prediction, adding there are fresh lahar (mudflow) deposits in the 2,462 metre (8,977 feet) Mayon's slopes. ""It's really a dangerous combination for the communities. Lahar from Mayon can carry huge boulder and it can bury communities, wash away people and everything in its path, but also because of impact."" She said boulders as huge as cars and houses could roll down Mayon´s slopes swiftly in minutes. Heavy rains poured in central Philippines, flooding shelter areas and raising risks of lahar flows. In Salvacion village, many farmers were sneaking inside the danger zone to plant and look after farm animals saying they need to earn a living. ""I don't think the volcano will erupt,"" Istong Jayvee told Reuters. ""It already let out fire. It will quiet down soon."" Farm worker Edna Medina said they are ready anytime to flee when the volcano erupts. ""When the volcano does erupt, we'll get out of here using our motorcycle then head straight for the main road out,"" she added. Volcanologists have raised Mayon´s alert to level 4, one notch below the highest level. (Reporting by Ronn Bautista Writing by Manuel Mogato Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.)

AP,"By: AP | Published: October 9, 2018 9:17:14 am A mosque damaged during last week’s earthquake in the Balaroa neighbourhood of Palu, Indonesia, Oct. 6, 2018. (Adam Dean/The New York Times) When the violent shaking from a massive magnitude 7.5 earthquake finally stopped, Selvi Susanti stood up and realized something strange was happening. First, she saw the ground suddenly begin to sink. Then the pavement split beneath her feet like a broken dinner plate and started to rise. Terrified, she clung to a small sliver of asphalt and surfed a river of fast-moving mud as it swallowed entire neighborhoods, carrying her higher than coconut trees for a quarter of a mile. “What I saw _ oh my God! Houses were tumbling. They started to roll like waves. It’s like a tsunami, but the difference was they were waves of soil,” said Susanti, 38, weeping at the memory of seeing so many people simply disappear into the earth as they screamed for help. “It felt like I was in a boat, moving around. But the difference is I was not in water, but in the mud.” Many, like Susanti in the devastated village of Petobo, had no idea they were in an area already identified by the government as a high-risk zone for the devastating geological phenomenon that causes the soft ground to liquefy during earthquakes. But Indonesian scientist Gegar Prasetya wasn’t surprised by any of the events that occurred at dusk on Sept. 28, killing nearly 2,000 people and leaving possibly thousands more missing. He had warned people for years that the area around Sulawesi island’s Palu Bay had been struck before and was due for another potential combination of factors to create a perfect storm capable of unleashing earthquakes, landslides, tsunami waves and soil liquefaction. “I knew right away,” said Prasetya, co-founder of the Tsunami Research Center Indonesia, who had met with government officials and residents in the area to try to raise awareness about the threat. “I posted in our group, and I said, `It’s happened.”’ Disaster-prone Indonesia, part of the Pacific Basin’s “Ring of Fire,” is an archipelago of about 17,000 islands sitting atop numerous fault lines that have produced some of the largest and most deadly earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions in recorded history. Other scientists around the world wondered how this type of earthquake _ on a strike-slip fault, which typically does not produce dangerous tsunamis _ could generate waves that surged as high as 6 meters (20 feet). Again, Prasetya knew. He had published a paper nearly two decades ago highlighting six other tsunamis recorded in the Makassar Strait in the past century, predicting that a repeat event could be expected roughly every 25 years. The last one occurred in a region north of the city in 1996. Before that, Palu Bay was hit in 1968 by a very similar magnitude 7.4 quake that generated waves 10 meters (33 feet) high. “This one complete village went to the sea,” he said of the 1968 event. “You can still see the trees from the top of the water.” Some experts theorize that the Sept. 28 quake, by itself, didn’t generate a big wave despite being shallow and near the coast. They’re convinced it was instead the area’s soft soil that served as the real catalyst for disaster. The temblor’s long, violent shaking likely triggered one or more underwater landslides due to unstable sediment deposited on the seafloor by rivers. This disruptive movement may have created the large wall of water that raced across the open ocean until being squeezed into the long, narrow bay that surrounds Palu, forcing the wave to grow higher. “Imagine what happens if you drop a brick in a flat pond _ ripples spread in all directions,” said Robert Hall, a geologist at Royal Holloway University of London, who has studied the area. “Now drop the same size object in a bathtub. The waves can reflect off the sides, can amplify, and may get larger in the direction of the length of the bath.” But it wasn’t just weak sediment in the ocean that gave way. Wet, sandy soil also separated and came alive through liquefaction in some areas due to the earthquake’s radical vibrations. The ground simply lost its strength and turned to mush beneath people’s feet, creating mud that acted like quicksand. People, houses, cars and streets were swallowed and covered by a thick carpet of what _ just seconds earlier _ had been solid earth. Fast-moving landslides also were launched above ground, possibly causing even more localized tsunami waves. “We wouldn’t necessarily expect to get all the worst possible factors occurring together,” said Willem De Lange, a scientist from the University of Waikato in New Zealand who co-authored research on the area with Prasetya in 2001. “Unfortunately this does happen.” Many questions remain about exactly what happened in this complex disaster. Prasetya will begin field work with the Indonesian navy this week to try to better understand what occurred underwater, and a team of international experts are expected to arrive soon to survey the area. Palu’s population has exploded in many high-risk areas since the 1968 event, which killed 200 people and also turned soil to mud in places, leaving many newcomers vulnerable with no local history. However, the central government did produce a map in 2012 identifying large swaths of Palu, a city of 380,000 people, where liquefaction could occur. The area of Petobo, for instance, was classified as having high-risk potential. The report also recommended that housing and industrial areas should best be built in areas with low liquefaction risk. It suggested mitigation efforts, including building structures with deep foundations anchored into firmer layers of earth. Good urban planning is ultimately the key to saving lives, said Sri Hidayati, head of earthquake mitigation at the Energy Ministry’s Geology Agency, which produced the report that was shared with the provincial and district governments in Sulawesi. She said it’s her agency’s responsibility to provide the mapping, but it’s up to local authorities to “use it or not.” Calls Monday to Palu’s vice mayor and the mayor’s aid went unanswered. “If everything in the future is planned based on this, I think maybe we will only experience a small number of casualties in case such a disaster occurs again,” Hidayati said. “Or probably no casualties at all.” At a news conference in Jakarta on Monday, the head of the country’s disaster agency also confirmed that soft soil areas in Palu are not fit for housing. “It is impossible to rebuild in areas with high liquefaction risk such as Petobo and Balaroa,” said Willem Rampangilei, adding that people still living there will be relocated. Indonesia has been criticized for lifting the tsunami warning it issued for Sulawesi’s coast too soon. The earthquake knocked out power and telecommunication towers, meaning sirens didn’t wail and alerts didn’t light up mobile phones. Online video showed an unsettling scene as cars and motorbikes drove at normal speeds on a coastal road and oblivious people milled about on the beach while the large, fast-moving wave could be seen racing closer before exploding onshore. “It’s almost impossible for a tsunami warning system to predict what we saw the other day,” said Adam Switzer, an expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. “The earthquake is the warning. If you’re anywhere in southeast Asia and you’re on the coast and you feel an earthquake, move inland and move to higher ground and stay there.” But it’s also not a matter of only warning people just before something happens. Prasetya said the history and geology of Palu Bay must be considered in plans to rebuild. He said soil investigations should be carried out to determine if deep piles are needed to stabilize buildings. Local knowledge should also be considered as a cheap way help to save lives, such as constructing houses out of wood with thatched roofs, instead of concrete and tile. In Petobo, tsunami warnings would not have helped because there was no time to respond to the waves of mud. All that remains of the village, located about 30 minutes from the center of Palu, is a muddy wasteland where only the very tips of roofs remain above ground in places. Satellite images show a heavily populated area stretching more than 100 hectares (250 acres) being devoured by what looks like a giant layer of chocolate milk. In mobile phone videos, buildings are seen sliding like pucks across a slab of ice. Some people spent hours trying to find their homes after the disaster, locating them about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from where they once stood. “It felt like we were spinning in a blender,” recalled Susanti, who survived by leaping to solid ground and running after the mudflow finally slowed down. “I saw houses change position. Houses which were located at the east moved to the west and vice versa.

Insurers have received more than 2,000 claims for residential and commercial losses, commissioner Dave Jones announced. Those include $388 million for residential personal property, $27.2 million for commercial property and $6.7 million for auto and other lines of insurance. Recently burned by California's largest recorded wildfire, the hillsides of Montecito northwest of Los Angeles could not absorb the rainstorm with an epic downpour of nearly an inch (2.5 centimeters) in 15 minutes early on Jan. 9. ""Once the rains hit, the water runs down, begins to take mud with it, and before you know it you have a 30 or 35-foot high wall of mud demolishing Montecito,"" Jones said. Twenty-one people were killed and two remain missing. The mudslide insurance claims come on top of California wildfire claims that topped $12 billion in 2017, making it the most expensive series of fires in state history, Jones said. That exceeds the total insurance claims from the top 10 previously most costly wildfires in California. Most of last year's claims were connected to Southern California's fires in December and October's devastating blazes in wine country north of San Francisco. Jones said he fears the staggering number of insurance claims represent a ""new normal"" for California. ""It used to be we could talk about a wildfire season. Now that's simply not the case. Wildfires are year-round, and Californians need to protect themselves accordingly,"" he warned. In Montecito, 1,415 residences were damaged and 107 were destroyed, in some cases swept completely off their foundations, Jones said. Five commercial properties were demolished and 235 others suffere d damage when torrents of water flowed down hills carrying mud, boulders and debris. Jones recalled the experience of touring the devastation zone as ""extraordinarily chilling."" The commissioner predicted that the $421 million total will climb as additional claims are made and existing ones are adjusted. Few residents in Montecito, with 3,200 households, had flood or mudslide insurance prior to the destruction. But the Department of Insurance has instructed insurers to honor claims if they had fire coverage, Jones said. That's because the debris flow's ""proximate cause"" was the enormous Thomas fire that scorched a huge swath of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties starting in December and loosened hillsides that became vulnerable to mudslides weeks later. Jones said insurers have enough reserves to pay the massive claims. But he said the fires and subsequent debris flows may prompt them to re-evaluate the fire risk and raise premiums, especially for California homes in high-risk areas. ___ Follow Weber at https://twitter.com/WeberCM.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — More than $421 million in claims have been filed since deadly mudslides tore through the coastal community of Montecito during extremely heavy January rains, California's insurance commissioner said Monday.

"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Associated+Press, By Associated Press","MONTECITO, Calif. (AP) - A storm that slammed a California coastal community is over. The search for its victims is not. Authorities in Santa Barbara County were still trying to reach new areas and dig into the destruction to find dead, injured or trapped people after a powerful mud flow swept away dozens of homes. At least 13 people were confirmed dead Tuesday, at least 25 were injured and at least 50 had to be rescued by helicopters. A structure is smashed against a tree along Hot Springs Road in Montecito, Calif. after getting hit by a flash flood and debris flow on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2018. Several homes were swept away before dawn Tuesday when mud and debris roared into neighborhoods in Montecito from hillsides stripped of vegetation during a recent wildfire. (Daniel Dreifuss) Those numbers could increase when the search is deepened and expanded Wednesday, with a major search-and-rescue team arriving from nearby Los Angeles County and help from the Coast Guard and National Guard along with law enforcement. They'll focus first on finding survivors. ""Right now our assets are focused on determining if anyone is still alive in any of those structures that have been damaged,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. The sheriff said ""at least several dozen homes that have been either destroyed or severely damaged, and likely many other ones are in areas that are as-yet inaccessible."" He said it's likely they'll find more people amid that destruction. The search for the missing - whose numbers are uncertain - will continue through the night and then intensify after daylight Wednesday, authorities said. Most deaths were believed to have occurred in Montecito, said Santa Barbara County spokesman David Villalobos. The wealthy enclave of about 9,000 people northwest of Los Angeles is home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey, Rob Lowe and Ellen DeGeneres, Winfrey's home survived the storm and slides. In an Instagram post she shared photos of the deep mud in her backyard and video of rescue helicopters hovering over her house. ""What a day!"" Winfrey said. ""Praying for our community again in Santa Barbara."" A mud-caked 14-year-old girl was among the dozens rescued on the ground Tuesday. She was pulled from a collapsed Montecito home where she had been trapped for hours. ""I thought I was dead for a minute there,"" the dazed girl could be heard saying on video posted by KNBC-TV before she was taken away on a stretcher. Twenty people were hospitalized and four were described as ""severely critical"" by Dr. Brett Wilson of Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. The mud was unleashed in the dead of night by flash flooding in the steep, fire-scarred Santa Ynez Mountains. Burned-over zones are especially susceptible to destructive mudslides because scorched earth doesn't absorb water well and the land is easily eroded when there are no shrubs. The torrent arrived suddenly and with a sound some likened to a freight train as water carrying rocks and trees washed away cars and trashed homes. Thomas Tighe said he stepped outside his Montecito home in the middle of the night and heard ""a deep rumbling, an ominous sound I knew was... boulders moving as the mud was rising."" Two cars were missing from his driveway and he watched two others slowly move sideways down the middle of the street ""in a river of mud."" In daylight, Tighe was shocked to see a body pinned by muck against his neighbor's home. He wasn't sure who it was. Authorities had been bracing for the possibility of catastrophic flooding because of heavy rain in the forecast for the first time in 10 months. Evacuations were ordered beneath recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. But only an estimated 10 to 15 percent of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara County heeded the warning, authorities said. U.S. Highway 101, the link connecting Ventura and Santa Barbara, looked like a muddy river and was expected to be closed for two days. The worst of the rainfall occurred in a 15-minute span starting at 3:30 a.m. Montecito got more than a half-inch in five minutes, while Carpinteria received nearly an inch in 15 minutes. ""All hell broke loose,"" said Peter Hartmann, a dentist who moonlights as a news photographer for the local website Noozhawk. ""Power lines were down, high-voltage power lines, the large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half. Water was flowing out of water mains and sheared-off fire hydrants."" Hartmann watched rescuers revive a toddler pulled unresponsive from the muck. ""It was a freaky moment to see her just covered in mud,"" he said. Hartmann said he found a tennis trophy awarded in 1991 to a father-son team his wife knows. ""Both of them were caught in the flood. Son's in the hospital, dad hasn't been found yet,"" he said, declining to name them. The first confirmed death was Roy Rohter, a former real estate broker who founded St. Augustine Academy in Ventura. The Catholic school's headmaster, Michael Van Hecke, announced the death and said Rohter's wife was injured by the mudslide. Montecito is beneath the scar left by a wildfire that erupted Dec. 4 and became the largest ever recorded in California. It spread over more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers) and destroyed 1,063 homes and other structures. It continues to smolder deep in the wilderness. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.

Sperling thought she, her husband and their 11-year-old daughter would be perfectly safe. But the storm unleashed mudslides that inundated hundreds of homes in their community of Montecito and killed 21 people, including a dear family friend. Now the Sperlings don't question evacuation orders. They just go. ""It's a matter of life and death,"" Sperling said from Santa Barbara, where her family was staying with good friends after evacuating Tuesday ahead of a powerful Pacific storm that's likely to be the worst this winter for parts of the state. The storm, a so-called atmospheric river, began moving into central and southern parts of California on Tuesday, dropping rain as communities besieged by wildfires and mudslides braced for the worst. The Sperlings' home wasn't damaged by January's mudslides but the family needed to be rescued after losing electricity, gas and water, and all the roads out of town were destroyed. ""We're just not willing to take that kind of chance anymore,"" the 48-year-old Sperling said. ""What happened in January was just all of our worst nightmares."" Between a quarter and a third of an inch of rain (less than a centimeter) was recorded throughout San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties through Tuesday evening. Trace amounts had begun to fall in some parts of Los Angeles County. The worst of the storm is expected between midday Wednesday through Thursday, bringing 2-5 inches (5-13 centimeters) of rain to coastal areas and valleys, and 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) in foothills and mountains. ""Everybody's clenched a bit waiting,"" said Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Hoxsie said there's also potential for isolated thunderstorms, which can dump large amounts of water over short periods of time. ""That gets everybody more concerned,"" she said. The Sperlings are among tens of thousands of people in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties who've been ordered to flee their homes as the storm approached. Los Angeles County authorities put thousands more on notice late Tuesday to be ready to evacuate from neighborhoods in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, which have also been badly hit by wildfires. Many residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings. Montecito resident Garrick Hyder evacuated for the December wildfire but not ahead of the January mudslides, which destroyed items in his garage that included a motorcycle and thousands of dollars' worth of snowboarding and scuba-diving equipment. Hyder watched as rescuers retrieved several bodies over several days from in front of his house. Mudslides had swept the dead from their homes miles away to the coast. Hyder evacuated four days after the mudslides and then again when another storm threatened the area a week ago. ""I'm on No. 4 now,"" Hyder said Tuesday as he packed his car. ""It's pretty crazy. It's kind of the price of living in paradise."" Hyder was planning to stay in Los Angeles overnight and then head up north to Lake Tahoe to make the most of his latest evacuation. ""I'm getting used to this,"" he said. ""It's kind of desensitizing."" Both Hyder and the Sterlings know several neighbors who are opting to stay, many who are older and less mobile, some who are tired of the repeated evacuations and others who just think their homes will be safe. Camille Joos-Visconti, her husband and their three children were staying in their home in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles. For now. ""We have three dogs, two newborn kittens, a 20-pound iguana, a 5-foot snake, three young kids, and I'm pregnant,"" said the 32-year-old Joos-Visconti. ""It's just so much to deal with."" The family's area has also been burned bare from recent wildfires and their home is prone to flooding. Their area is on notice to evacuate Wednesday. Joos-Visconti said the family has evacuated three times since September and can be out of the house with everything they need in five minutes if necessary.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — When sheriff's deputies told Kristine Sperling and her family they should evacuate their Southern California home because of an approaching storm in January, they didn't listen.

Scientists are expressing shock and elation over a new fossil-find that revisits life half a billion years ago—and may just shake up our view of evolution, the Guardian reports. Reported in Science, the Qingjiang site in China includes at least 4,351 fossils representing 101 species, 53 of them new to science. These primitive sponges, algae, jellyfish, and other creatures are also captured in incredible detail, with visible details of their mouths, eyes, muscles, and gills. And they're from a vital period called the Cambrian explosion when animal life erupted on Earth, spawning many creatures and rooting the tree of life. The fossils ""help us to tease apart how complex organs such as brains could be assembled through blind evolutionary processes,"" says Martin Smith, a paleontologist not involved in the project.
Like all Cambrian life, these small, squishy blobs lived in the sea, but were forever changed when a mudflow swept them to colder, deeper water, leaving them buried in sediment with little oxygen to cause decomposition, per Phys.org. The ""preservational quality is mindblowing,” says Martin, who describes the fossils as having ""detail finer than a human hair."" Study author Dongjing Fu and coauthor Xingliang Zhang found the site in 2007 when digging through shale on a riverbank and spent four years unearthing the fossils, National Geographic reports. Now the find is being compared to two earlier Cambrian fossil sites, the 508-million-year-old Burgess Shale in Canada and 518-million-year-old Chengiang site in China. ""I can see a bright future,"" says Fu. ""Qingjiang will be the next Burgess shale.""

Criminals had been using tunnels they dug to search for valuables in the ruins of a Roman villa, located in a suburb of the long destroyed city. Their work prompted conservators of the Unesco world heritage site to start their own digs, in order to put a stop to their activities and protect its remaining artefacts. Researchers used laser scanning to map a 200ft (60m) long network of illegal tunnels dug by the robbers and began excavating. They recreated the complete outline of the horse they discovered using plaster casting, the first time this has happened at the site. The remains of humans, mules, donkeys and other animals that were victims of the eruption of Mt Vesuvius' in AD 78 have previously been restored using the technique.

This is the first time that the complete outline of a horse has been recreated at the site using plaster casting Criminals had been using tunnels to search the ruins of a Roman villa, in a suburb of the now destroyed city. Researchers used laser scanning to map a 200ft (60m) long network (pictured) of illegal tunnels dug by the robbers The horse was found in an area now known as Civita Giuliana, to the north of the ancient city and outside of its protective walls. Archaeologists say a distinct imprint in the ground created by the creature's ear as it lay on its left side confirms this was a horse, and not another form of equine. While none of the creatures muscles or bones remained, plaster was used to fill in these gaps to create a full body cast of the animal. Pompeii's director Massimo Osanna said the find was an 'extraordinary' discovery while Culture Minister Dario Franceschini called it 'exceptional'.

While none of its muscles or bones remained, plaster was used to fill in these gaps to create a full body cast Experts believe that the horse - uncovered in a stables alongside the villa - was used in military parades, according to the Italian news agency Ansa. They also discovered the body of a man, aged 40 to 55, who died after the eruption, suggesting that people continued to make the area their home. In a statement to Ansa, Professor Osanna added: 'This is a sign that people continued to grow crops and live here even after the eruption, producing on top of the layer of ash and stone that covered and destroyed the entire city.' Alongside these major finds were a number of interesting artefacts, including amphorae, kitchen utensils, and part of a wooden bed.

Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow. More than 16,000 people are believed to have died in the chaos, with bodies still being discovered to this day. An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century. Mount Vesuvius erupted in the year AD 79, burying the cities of Pompeii, Oplontis, and Stabiae under ashes and rock fragments, and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unawares. He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours. While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life. Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000. This is not the first time in recent months that remains have been uncovered at the site. The skeleton of a child who tragically perished in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius found in the ruins of a public baths at Pompeii was revealed in April. Workers restoring the ancient thermal recreational area discovered the body, believed to belong to a child aged seven or eight at the time. Vesuvius is believed to have killed more than 16,000 people - with bodies still being discovered to this day. The crouching child is thought to have been trying to take shelter from the ensuing cataclysm when they were overwhelmed by deadly volcanic gases, experts say. The tragic skeleton of a child who perished in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius was uncovered in the ruins of a public baths complex in February. Workers restoring the ancient thermal baths in Pompeii discovered the body, believed to belong to a child aged seven or eight at the time Professor Osanna said in a statement at the time that the skeleton was found during work in February to shore up the main ancient baths in the sprawling archaeological site. The skeleton was removed from the baths' area for study, including DNA testing to determine its sex. Professor Osanna said it appears the skeleton might have been first spotted during a 19th-century excavation of the area, since the leg bones were orderly placed near the pelvis, but - for reasons unknown - wasn't removed by those earlier archaeologists. Speaking to La Repubblica newspaper at the time, he said: 'This is an extraordinary find, in an area which we thought had been fully excavated in the 19th century. 'What we can say from an early analysis is that the child was between seven and eight years old.' Vesuvius, which erupted almost 2,000 years ago in in AD 79, is believed to have killed more than 16,000 people, with bodies still being discovered to this day. This image shows the body of a child found at the site The crouching child (pictured) is thought to have been trying to take shelter from the ensuing cataclysm when they were overwhelmed by deadly volcanic gases, experts say Experts at the Applied Research Laboratory of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii will now search the body for clues about it. They hope to determine the state of health of the inhabitants of Pompeii in AD 79, including the presence of any diseases. During the first phase of study, scientists will take bone measurements and evaluate muscular impressions on the skeleton. These can be used to measure traces of any physical activity, including lifting heavy weights as well as the time the child spent walking.

Establishing the sex of the individual will not be possible at this stage, as typical male and female characteristics are not visible from the bones during childhood. These may be possible during a second phase of research using DNA analysis, if enough genetic material of a decent standard has been preserved.

No damage was found dating from the skeleton's experiences with the group of nineteenth-century archaeologists who uncovered part of it. In a written statement, Alberta Martellone, head of the laboratory, added: 'In the unique case of Pompeii we are faced with human remains of individuals in the fullness of their vitality, who died as a result of natural disasters.

Bangkok Post Public Company Limited,"PARIS - The eruption of the Fuego volcano in Guatemala was likely a ""pyroclastic surge"" similar to the one that destroyed the ancient city of Pompeii, says volcanologist David Rothery of The Open University in England. Handout picture released by the National Disaster Relief Agency of Guatemala showing the Fuego volcano erupting on June 3, 2018 The word pyroclastic is derived from the ancient Greek for ""fire"" and ""fragments"". Rothery analysed for AFP the latest eruption which has killed at least 25 people: Q: What type of an eruption was this? A: ""The cause of most deaths at the current eruption of Fuego (Guatemala) is being widely reported as a 'river of lava'. This is probably an inexpert description or a mistranslation. Fuego does not characteristically produce long fluid lava flows like those currently erupting from Kilauea (Hawaii). They are unlikely to reach inhabited areas, and are not the main hazard at this volcano. ""A lava flow (molten rock) rarely travels fast enough to engulf people... ""The videos and still images that I've seen suggest instead one or more pyroclastic flows. This is when a violently erupted mass of rock fragments and hot gas finds itself too dense to rise as an ash column, and instead cascades down the volcano's slopes. ""Pyroclastic flows (or surges) can move at over 100 kilometres (62 miles) per hour, and may be hot enough to glow like molten lava. They can travel further, as well as much faster, than lava flows. This is the phenomenon that claimed many lives during the famous AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed Pompeii."" Q: Why now? A: ""No particular reason. There is no link to any recent earthquakes or to the eruption in Hawaii. It takes a LONG time for magma to accumulate at depth and rise toward the surface before it can erupt. The volcano 'plumbing' system below Fuego feels no influence whatsoever from events in Hawaii."" Q: Why was this eruption not predicted? A: ""I don’t know. Fuego has been erupting since 2002, and was continuously active in 2017. On 17 May a 25-metre (82-foot) wide lahar (volcanic mudflow) came down the mountain, and there were explosions and ash plumes during 19-21 May. ""Given the activity... it might have been wise to declare an evacuation zone around the volcano."" Q: Is it over? A: ""The Guatemalan volcano monitoring authority (Insivumeh) is now reporting the eruption as over, although lahars remain a hazard when rain falls on newly-deposited ash... When rain falls on new ash it can turn into a dense slurry (like wet concrete) and devastate alleys (bridges can be destroyed.","PARIS - The eruption of the Fuego volcano in Guatemala was likely a ""pyroclastic surge"" similar to the one that destroyed the ancient city of Pompeii, says volcanologist David Rothery of The Open University in England.",2018-06-04T14:45:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bangkokpost.com'}",A volcanologist's take on Fuego eruption,https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/1478809/a-volcanologists-take-on-fuego-eruption,https://www.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20180604/2795233.jpg,,Bangkokpost.com,mudflow,1

"By CHRISTOPHER WEBER and ANDREW DALTON, Associated Press","MONTECITO, Calif. (AP) — A storm that slammed a California coastal community is over. The search for its victims is not. Authorities in Santa Barbara County were still trying to reach new areas and dig into the destruction to find dead, injured or trapped people after a powerful mud flow swept away dozens of homes. At least 13 people were confirmed dead Tuesday, at least 25 were injured and at least 50 had to be rescued by helicopters. Those numbers could increase when the search is deepened and expanded Wednesday, with a major search-and-rescue team arriving from nearby Los Angeles County and help from the Coast Guard and National Guard along with law enforcement.

The sheriff said ""at least several dozen homes that have been either destroyed or severely damaged, and likely many other ones are in areas that are as-yet inaccessible."" He said it's likely they'll find more people amid that destruction. The search for the missing — whose numbers are uncertain — will continue through the night and then intensify after daylight Wednesday, authorities said. Most deaths were believed to have occurred in Montecito, said Santa Barbara County spokesman David Villalobos. The wealthy enclave of about 9,000 people northwest of Los Angeles is home to such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey, Rob Lowe and Ellen DeGeneres, Winfrey's home survived the storm and slides. In an Instagram post she shared photos of the deep mud in her backyard and video of rescue helicopters hovering over her house. ""What a day!"" Winfrey said. ""Praying for our community again in Santa Barbara."" A mud-caked 14-year-old girl was among the dozens rescued on the ground Tuesday. She was pulled from a collapsed Montecito home where she had been trapped for hours. ""I thought I was dead for a minute there,"" the dazed girl could be heard saying on video posted by KNBC-TV before she was taken away on a stretcher. Twenty people were hospitalized and four were described as ""severely critical"" by Dr. Brett Wilson of Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. The mud was unleashed in the dead of night by flash flooding in the steep, fire-scarred Santa Ynez Mountains. Burned-over zones are especially susceptible to destructive mudslides because scorched earth doesn't absorb water well and the land is easily eroded when there are no shrubs. The torrent arrived suddenly and with a sound some likened to a freight train as water carrying rocks and trees washed away cars and trashed homes. Thomas Tighe said he stepped outside his Montecito home in the middle of the night and heard ""a deep rumbling, an ominous sound I knew was... boulders moving as the mud was rising."" Two cars were missing from his driveway and he watched two others slowly move sideways down the middle of the street ""in a river of mud."" In daylight, Tighe was shocked to see a body pinned by muck against his neighbor's home. He wasn't sure who it was. Authorities had been bracing for the possibility of catastrophic flooding because of heavy rain in the forecast for the first time in 10 months. Evacuations were ordered beneath recently burned areas of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties. But only an estimated 10 to 15 percent of people in a mandatory evacuation area of Santa Barbara County heeded the warning, authorities said. U.S. Highway 101, the link connecting Ventura and Santa Barbara, looked like a muddy river and was expected to be closed for two days. The worst of the rainfall occurred in a 15-minute span starting at 3:30 a.m. Montecito got more than a half-inch in five minutes, while Carpinteria received nearly an inch in 15 minutes. ""All hell broke loose,"" said Peter Hartmann, a dentist who moonlights as a news photographer for the local website Noozhawk. ""Power lines were down, high-voltage power lines, the large aluminum poles to hold those were snapped in half. Water was flowing out of water mains and sheared-off fire hydrants."" Hartmann watched rescuers revive a toddler pulled unresponsive from the muck. ""It was a freaky moment to see her just covered in mud,"" he said. Hartmann said he found a tennis trophy awarded in 1991 to a father-son team his wife knows. ""Both of them were caught in the flood. Son's in the hospital, dad hasn't been found yet,"" he said, declining to name them. The first confirmed death was Roy Rohter, a former real estate broker who founded St. Augustine Academy in Ventura. The Catholic school's headmaster, Michael Van Hecke, announced the death and said Rohter's wife was injured by the mudslide. Montecito is beneath the scar left by a wildfire that erupted Dec. 4 and became the largest ever recorded in California. It spread over more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers) and destroyed 1,063 homes and other structures. It continues to smolder deep in the wilderness. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.

prolly,"Idahome: Bikepacking in God’s Country – Aimee Gilchrist Idahome: Bikepacking in God’s Country Words by Aimee Gilchrist, photos noted in Gallery Captions God’s Country Day 1: Captain’s Log The pain felt like a feathery flame, arriving fierce and lacing itself into the layers of fibers in my quads. I bend over my bars to stretch and shake the lactic acid bath pooling in my legs. My chest strains to keep air in my lungs when it desperately wants to escape. I glance around to see if the others show similar conditions to help calm my mind. Although I had fared well earlier in the day when we were sticking to the fire roads, now the steep grade of this narrow, rutted trail has me feeling worked. I’m barely keeping my inner dialogue silenced. The steeper and higher we climb up the pass, the weaker my mental fortitude becomes. Maybe you’re familiar with how this internal battle begins. It starts with the harmless unspoken inquisition, “How much farther?” and when left unhinged, it will eventually escalate to “Why the hell am I doing this?” and “Who thought this was a good idea?”. Never to be spoken aloud, of course, this questioning can consume the adventure itself if left to its own discretion. I remind myself of all the jokes we make about Type 2 fun and then settle into the recipe that usually quiets my self-deprecation. I look out at the sweeping mountain view and remind myself how lucky I am to have two arms and two legs that can pedal me to this very place and two eyes that can see these beautiful views. And that I have a heart pounding in my chest that allows me the endurance to get to the far reaches like this. I remind myself to be grateful. Next thing I know, my breathing is slowing, and some of the others have caught up. Adam, our trusty trip photographer, cracks a joke right on cue to break the silence and I’m reminded I’m in good company. Once the laughter floats away, it’s time to start kicking steps into the fresh mud to keep the pace. Fourteen of us are in a single file line of hike-a-bike and have been for at least 5 miles, and an undetermined distance left to go. We’re following a steep backpackers trail to the historic Custer Fire Lookout, built in 1933 at some 9,700 feet in elevation, in a remote part of Idaho’s Salmon River Range. My good friend Todd Gillman, who heads up Marketing at Coal Headwear in Seattle, has been with me on some solid bikepacking trips in the past, so when he lassoed me into this project with 12 strangers, I was quick to say “heck yes, my brother”. Todd wanted to share a storytelling piece in partnership with Tenkara Rod Co, Latigo Coffee and Swift Industries in honor of the annual Swift Campout. His hair-brained ideas are always adventurous, sometimes fun and a week after you’re back in your cozy bed, you realize they were a good choice. We all have a friend like Todd. Let me take a quick second to catch my breath and introduce you to our badass crew: Todd Gillman, Seattle, Washington- Ringleader and Scout Master Drew Hollenback, Boise, Idaho Lars Reber, Salt Lake City, Utah Steve Bretson, Bozeman, Montana Katie Cook-Bretson, Bozeman, Montana Amanda Hankison, Salt Lake City, Utah Kevin McClelland, Salt Lake City, Utah Sean Hamilton, Seattle, Washington Mark Finster, Los Angeles, California Alicia Rhoades, Seattle, Washington Bo Thunell, Portland, Oregon Adam Concannon, Denver, Colorado Kyle McCarty, Seattle, Washington Aimee Gilchrist, Yours Truly, Los Angeles, California Let’s Rewind to Day 0 Just 36 hours ago, I was boarding a flight from LAX to Boise with Mark, founder of Latigo Coffee and all-around good dude, anticipating this very journey. Although this present moment of full-body mountain bike Crossfit at altitude isn’t what I had expected, I am aware that I signed up for just about anything when I said ‘YES’ to a 4-day bikepacking traverse through Central Idaho in the middle of June on an unpublished route that no one had attempted. Mark and I had hitched a ride from the Boise Airport with Drew, co-owner of Tenkara Rod Co. and Boise local, in his well-suited road trip mobile, a faded denim blue ‘89 Vanagon. If nothing else, this mountain commute would be entertaining, as Drew warned that his van is prone to breakdowns once it leaves Boise city limits. I found myself humming Cat Stevens “Oh Very Young” with the windows down and the motor purring as we sputter into the forested outskirts. Our anxious chatter fueled the 3-hour drive to Stanley and as we rounded the final bend from the Payette River canyon into a breezy, grass valley, we were gifted one of the best panoramic views this side of the Colorado. Jagged peaks with snow-capped edges soared high, each creating their own wispy cloud patterns. If I had spent more time with the Ride With GPS route, I would have known right then that in less than 24 hours, we would be knee deep in that very snow 9,600 ft. above sea level, attempting to cross over the pass. There is a delicate beauty and humor in leaving some things to the unknown. Back to God’s Country Day 1: Captain’s Log Drew had put together a clever game to preoccupy our numb brains into counting 50 steps then taking a 30-second break to breathe. He knew none of us were counting so he slipped in 100 or 150 steps and we didn’t know the difference. Our Swift Campout crew hailed from popular adventure towns like Bozeman, Salt Lake City, Portland and Seattle and I was impressed to see we all held the sacred “thou must not complain about pain while bikepacking and tarnish the group morale” code dear to our hearts. For the last 10 miles, we had encountered about 50 fallen trees making the route seem impassable at times. One after another, we were lifting our loaded bikes over waist high mature trees that had tumbled over in the recent winter storms. It was like doing 50 curl reps with 50- pound weights. I was peeking ahead looking for the tree line boundary, so we could find our pedaling freedom. But instead of seeing a vast open mountaintop, I saw a 15 ft. fortification of snow reaching to both sides of the trail. As Robert Frost said, “The only way out is through”. Those ahead of us had already dug a route through this wall of the North and had an efficient system of passing bikes and bodies over and down. This is the most intense first day I have had, maybe ever. I’m wondering if the others are feeling the same, but I keep it to myself. Attitudes seemed tired but positive. Another affirmation that these rad humans will keep me in line. The clock says 7pm on this fine summer solstice day and the sun is unwavering. We were officially into the Idaho backcountry and going and the feeling of being committed to the remoteness was coming in hot as we stepped over fresh bear scat. When I caught up to the front of the pack, the boulders had grown to the size of watermelons on steroids and it was impossible to ride uphill over them. But who am I kidding really? The past 5 miles had been hike-a-bike and an actual pedal stroke occurred once every 10 minutes or so if skilled and lucky. Seeing my fellow riders discussing the plan with their bikes laying on the summit scree meant that I could take a quick breather. The deliberation had begun prior to my arrival: “How much further to the Custer Lookout vs how much daylight was remaining?”. I feel it is a good time to introduce the novel idea of dinner to the group, as it was now after 8pm and it felt almost impossible to eat another piece of dry jerky. When the meeting adjourned, it is decided that a Kevin and Steve would go beyond the summit following our route in search of Custer Lookout, and the growling stomachs would be satiated while we wait for them to return. Todd and Mark backtrack to look for a dry, flat surface to set up camp as a backup plan, and shortly after dinner the sun is sinking, and we determine this would officially be Camp 1. I think about that bear poop again and scour the forest for a tree I can climb to hang my food bag. I’ve been robbed by the furry friends before and going the next 3 days without food is not high on my list. I am arming my tent for evening winds when the guys came back to say the high snow would make Custer Lookout unreachable. I think we were all beginning to consider that might be the case, so no one seems too shocked. So, the time to work on a Plan B route for Day 1 will wait until the morning, as we had more pressing campfire-whiskey-hot cocoa things on the agenda. Thanks again for the whiskey, Katie. And Bo, thanks for the cocoa magic. These are my people. Day 1: 35 miles, 1 flat tire, 1 hot spring, 2 fish caught (and released), 1 porcupine (not caught), 1 pile of bear poop, 4500ft. give or take. God’s Country Day 2: Captain’s Log God bless Mark for preparing camp coffee any and every time possible. I had just finished crawling out of the tent into the damp, frosty morning air when Mark appeared with a steaming mug of joe and confirms I am the last one to wake. Before the end of the day today, he will have brewed 5 batches of Latigo coffee (lakeside, trailside, tent side…you name it) which has become the lifeblood of our group. The official map holders have already pieced together what we hope was a less intense Day 2, but it will be impossible to tell. It would be a safe choice to backtrack the way we had come up, but, Amanda said it best when she said, “No one was willing to back out.” Everyone commits to think on it over coffee. As we are finishing our last bites of breakfast, the rumbles of thunder reach our camp in a deep echo and the dark clouds that were loitering in the distance are now racing our way. We scatter like a flock of pigeons after thrown breadcrumbs. The snap of lightning gives us a warning shock and we don’t have much time to make an escape plan. Alicia and I tighten a few straps on our bike bags for good measure and I tuck my Ritchey Timberwolf under the canopy to keep dry, grabbing my trusty flask at the last minute from the side pocket. Mark yells from his tent for us to hurry inside because the hail is really coming down. When I look behind me, no one was there. Where are the others? The hail eventually turns to sleet, and temperatures drop considerably. Todd, Katie, and Steve are our last-minute house guests and we greet them cheerily with tequila. We are told the others are in gas station ponchos hiding and shivering under the nearby trees, ready to bolt like minutemen when it lets up. When the lightning and thunder rolled past, we saw an opportunity to get going. Remember, we are north of the wall, so as legend has it, it is just as hard climbing up as it was going over the day before. The trail is as wide as my hips and at least 2 inches deep of quicksand mud. To my right was a sheer drop off down the edge of the mountain into nothingness and to my left is a steep wall of dripping water and falling rocks. This is not the time to look away. My feet are sliding like a newborn deer on ice, downward towards the edge in the mudflow and I am severely spooked of sliding off the mountainside. Alicia appears behind me and seeing my fear and pushes my bike through the most dangerous section, and now I’m able to regain my footing and begin walking again. When the storm lets up, the sun immediately breaks through the clouds with a few slow drops still falling like little rainbow drips. I’m already covered in mud like Pigpen from Charlie Brown, and I luckily have Katie to help get the mud and loose straps cleared away from my wheels, so I can pedal freely again. Day 2 is proving to have its own set of absurd obstacles, but it is too early to get discouraged. We hadn’t even finalized our route yet. We will later find out that our choice is a double black diamond descent back to the Yankee Fork. Steve and Katie run a bike shop in Bozeman called Alter and they were truly our trail angels. I realize my seat clamp nut is stripped on Day 2 and my seatpost sinks little by little over each bump. Enter Steve to save the day with a replacement nut as well as an extra hand to lift my bike over another barrage of fallen trees. The trail today is much like an obstacle course which involves rock climbing with the left hand up a steep face with a loaded bike over the right shoulder. One misstep would land you in the flowing water just off to the right. My mantra of the day: Stay cool and take it easy on the brakes. I might have forgotten to mention most of my heavy load was in my giant yellow dry bag given the morning conditions, and I never made time to redistribute the weight. My mistake. My bike doesn’t have rack mounts, so panniers aren’t an option. So, the front wheel sinks with the weight and propels me all sorts of directions. Amanda and I have a few good belly laughs as we take turns self-ejecting. Be sure to watch the film because she captured a great one on camera. The group is pretty spread out at this point because the trail clears and becomes an actual MTB single track until the massive scree field at the bottom. Watching Bo on the bike during that decent is like having a front row seat to watch an Olympic ice skater. This was an all-time descent. I am living vicariously through the others hearing their shouts and hollers and I’m happy to get down safely with a huge grin on my face. And lo and behold, there is Mark to offer another steaming cup of dark roast coffee. Could life get any better? The switchbacks crossed the creek several times like the trails at home in the San Gabriel Mountains of LA. I felt homesick for a quick minute and then let myself daydream of staying in Idaho forever. My slice of Idahome. When we all regroup on the dirt highway, it seems clear that the hot springs are necessary, so we take off sailing back towards Stanley like a group of muddy tire flaps. We may have missed the ghost towns and abandoned mines and a badass lookout tower (dang it!) but we have all our limbs and good spirits. The Sawtooths are looking fondly upon us. Day 2: 26 miles, 0 flat tires, 1 hot spring, 4 cold beers, ½ bag of gummy bears, 1 hot shower. 1000ft. God’s Country Day 3: Captain’s Log I would be remiss to not tell you that we lost one of our crew back on Day 1 and didn’t locate him until Day 3. Sorry to leave that out earlier. It is Kyle, our cameraman who was driving logging roads to meet us at predetermined checkpoints. He was waiting for us at Camp 1, but, as you know, we never made it there. So, he moves onto Camp 2 for the next night, and we never make it there either. And during the process, the truck slides off the road going around a snowbank 18 miles off the highway without any cell service or location device. So, on Day 3 he begins the slow hike back, carrying a heavy load including all his expensive camera gear. Meanwhile, back in Stanley, Todd and Alicia are gearing up to head out to search for Kyle while the rest of us head over to the amazing Stanley Bakery for a world class breakfast and a Day 3 planning session. Mark’s idea is that Stanley is the El Chalten of North America and I’m in complete agreement. Amazing peaks, rivers, valleys and a charming town to boot. Stanley has a way of charming you into wanting to stay forever. The KSAR or Kyle Search and Rescue squad made up of Kevin, Amanda and Todd, respectably, locates him between the truck and the highway and then spends most of the rest of the day bartering with locals to extricate him out of the remote mountainside snowbank, while the rest of us ride 10 miles out to Stanley Lake for a day of fishing lessons with Drew and Lars from Tenkara Rod Co. and some old-fashioned dockside beer drinking. When the signal comes that the troops are back, we all jump onto our saddles and pedal onward toward Camp 3. Our band of misfits was reunited at last, Kyle and all. We got some good laughs out of everyone’s missteps. Right after sunset, the group decides to get a little rowdy. With some on bikes and the camera crew and others loaded up in the van, we take off for the summit about 8 miles into the backcountry to catch a few shots of our last Sawtooth sunset on top of the ridge. I am in the backseat of the van and we are tailing the mischievous riders with the camera crew hanging out the back hatch when, out of nowhere, the local sheriff rounds the corner ahead of us one a one lane gravel road and turns on his lights. Oh shit. I look down at all the “evidence” rolling around in the van and hit the mental panic button. After all our crazy hair-brained ideas this weekend, are we finally getting busted for this joyride? Our driver, who will remain anonymous for this article backs down a narrow, windy gravel road with the sheriff on his loudspeaker ushering us. Those of us nearest to the “evidence” begin disposing of it immediately. When the road widened, we are prepared and all waiting the worst outcome, but the sheriff just waves and thanks us for moving out of the way and continues down the road with his lights flashing. HOLY HECK. A flood of relief paralyzes us momentarily and we take a moment to assess our losses, and head back up the road to the summit to catch the riders. To recap, we had climbed with bikes to the top of a snowy peak at 9700ft, but are forced to bail due to conditions, then a hail lightning storm creates a crazy, muddy descent, and the whole time, our camera guy and friend is lost and missing having his own crazy time. And then a handful of us thought we were ending up at the Stanley jail for the night making our one phone call. The good news is that we survived and now we are enjoying the quiet open night sky. We could barely see the lights of town in the distance. The solstice weekend was kind to us and throughout, a group of strangers would be bonded together forever. It’s a special moment when a few good brands bring great people together in an adventurous, social experiment and everyone leaves better for it. Good ‘ol Idahome. Much gratitude to Todd Gillman, the Marketing Manager of Coal Headwear for introducing the idea and recruiting a great group of humans and to Tenkara Rod, Latigo Coffee, and Swift Industries for supporting these efforts in the best way possible. Day 3: 15 miles, 0 flat tires, 1 lake swim, so many cold beers, 1 run in with the sheriff, 14 new friends in their happy place, 100% fun. 800ft. “…And though you want them to last forever you know they never will. And the goodbye makes the journey harder still…” –‘Oh Very Young’, Cat Stevens As a disclaimer and a defender of all, I wanted to add that Todd spent a ton of time studying the route &amp; talking to locals &amp; the only snow warnings I got had to do with leaving Hyndman Lk. via the high route. So he wasn’t leading us blind and carelessly into the mountains. This story, as with all stories, are, …well, stories. I hope you enjoyed it. ____ Follow Aimee on Instagram.","Idahome: Bikepacking in God’s Country Words by Aimee Gilchrist, photos noted in Gallery Captions God’s Country Day 1: Captain’s Log The pain felt like a feathery flame, arriving fierce and lacing itself into the layers of fibers in my quads.

esafranwgntv,"MONTECITO, Calif. – A 14-year-old girl who was trapped for hours inside a California home destroyed by mudflows was safely pulled out of the rubble by firefighters Tuesday morning, according to KTLA. A photo posted by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department shows firefighters helping the girl sit up after she was pulled from the debris. The girl’s house was just one of several destroyed in the coastal community of Montecito, home to many of Santa Barbara County's most affluent residents. At least six homes were ""wiped away from their foundations"" by mudflow and debris, Santa Barbara County fire spokesman Mike Eliason said. Heavy rain has pounded areas charred by recent wildfires, triggering warnings of flash flooding and mudslides because vegetation that otherwise would hold hills together and make the terrain flood-resistant have burned away. Several people have died in Santa Barbara County, but it's unclear how many were in Montecito. Officials did not provide any further information on the girl’s condition or if any of her family members had been trapped. Firefighters have rescued at least eight people in Montecito, and the “numbers are expected to go up significantly,” Eliason said. CNN contributed to this report.","MONTECITO, Calif. – A 14-year-old girl who was trapped for hours inside a California home destroyed by mudflows was safely pulled out of the rubble by firefighters Tuesday morning, according to KTLA.

"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Press+Association, By Press Association","Tens of thousands of travellers have been stranded in Bali after the threat from a volcano closed the tourist island’s international airport. Indonesian authorities raised the alert for Mount Agung to the highest level on Monday, and said the airport would be closed for 24 hours. The volcano has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend. Passengers read flight information at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali (Ketut Nataan/AP) Video released by the national disaster agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. Tests indicated ash had reached the island’s airspace, leaving tourists facing flight information boards showing rows of cancellations as they arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, affecting about 59,000 travellers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning, but officials said the situation would be reviewed every six hours. Mount Agung erupts in Karangasem, Bali (Firdia Lisnawati/AP) Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about five million visitors a year. Geological agency head, Kasbani, who goes by one name, said the alert level was raised because the volcano had shifted from steam-based eruptions to magmatic eruptions. “We don’t expect a big eruption but we have to stay alert and anticipate,” he said on Indonesian TV. The exclusion zone around the crater was widened to six miles, from a previous three to five miles. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination (Firdia Lisnawati/AP) Ash up to half a centimetre (less than half an inch) thick settled on villages around the volcano over the weekend, and soldiers and police distributed masks. The volcano’s last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Indonesia sits on the “Pacific Ring of Fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung’s alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the volcano, which doubled the exclusion zone around the crater and prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on October 29 after a decrease in activity, but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centres. Residents work at a market near the volcano (Firdia Lisnawati/AP) Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency says as many as 100,000 villagers need to leave the expanded danger zone, but that less than half that number have left. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affected 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. Nugroho said about 40,000 people had evacuated but others had not left because they felt safe or did not want to abandon their livestock.

"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Associated+Press, By Associated Press","LOS ANGELES (AP) - When sheriff's deputies told Kristine Sperling and her family they should evacuate their Southern California home because of an approaching storm in January, they didn't listen. Sperling thought she, her husband and their 11-year-old daughter would be perfectly safe. But the storm unleashed mudslides that inundated hundreds of homes in their community of Montecito and killed 21 people, including a dear family friend. Now the Sperlings don't question evacuation orders. They just go. This undated family selfie by Kristine Sperling shows herself, from left, daughter Alice, 11, her husband Daniel, 48, and their dog King at their home in Montecito, Calif. The Sperlings evacuated from Montecito on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, ahead of a powerful storm that that is predicted to sweep through California in the next few days. (Kristine Sperling via AP) ""It's a matter of life and death,"" Sperling said from Santa Barbara, where her family was staying with good friends after evacuating Tuesday ahead of a powerful Pacific storm that's likely to be the worst this winter for parts of the state. The storm, a so-called atmospheric river, began moving into central and southern parts of California on Tuesday, dropping rain as communities besieged by wildfires and mudslides braced for the worst. The Sperlings' home wasn't damaged by January's mudslides but the family needed to be rescued after losing electricity, gas and water, and all the roads out of town were destroyed. ""We're just not willing to take that kind of chance anymore,"" the 48-year-old Sperling said. ""What happened in January was just all of our worst nightmares."" Between a quarter and a third of an inch of rain (less than a centimeter) was recorded throughout San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties through Tuesday evening. Trace amounts had begun to fall in some parts of Los Angeles County. The worst of the storm is expected between midday Wednesday through Thursday, bringing 2-5 inches (5-13 centimeters) of rain to coastal areas and valleys, and 5-10 inches (13-25 centimeters) in foothills and mountains. ""Everybody's clenched a bit waiting,"" said Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Hoxsie said there's also potential for isolated thunderstorms, which can dump large amounts of water over short periods of time. ""That gets everybody more concerned,"" she said. The Sperlings are among tens of thousands of people in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties who've been ordered to flee their homes as the storm approached. Los Angeles County authorities put thousands more on notice late Tuesday to be ready to evacuate from neighborhoods in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, which have also been badly hit by wildfires. Many residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings. Montecito resident Garrick Hyder evacuated for the December wildfire but not ahead of the January mudslides, which destroyed items in his garage that included a motorcycle and thousands of dollars' worth of snowboarding and scuba-diving equipment. Hyder watched as rescuers retrieved several bodies over several days from in front of his house. Mudslides had swept the dead from their homes miles away to the coast. Hyder evacuated four days after the mudslides and then again when another storm threatened the area a week ago. ""I'm on No. 4 now,"" Hyder said Tuesday as he packed his car. ""It's pretty crazy. It's kind of the price of living in paradise."" Hyder was planning to stay in Los Angeles overnight and then head up north to Lake Tahoe to make the most of his latest evacuation. ""I'm getting used to this,"" he said. ""It's kind of desensitizing."" Both Hyder and the Sterlings know several neighbors who are opting to stay, many who are older and less mobile, some who are tired of the repeated evacuations and others who just think their homes will be safe. Camille Joos-Visconti, her husband and their three children were staying in their home in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles. For now. ""We have three dogs, two newborn kittens, a 20-pound iguana, a 5-foot snake, three young kids, and I'm pregnant,"" said the 32-year-old Joos-Visconti. ""It's just so much to deal with."" The family's area has also been burned bare from recent wildfires and their home is prone to flooding. Their area is on notice to evacuate Wednesday. Joos-Visconti said the family has evacuated three times since September and can be out of the house with everything they need in five minutes if necessary.

The Sperlings evacuated from Montecito on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, ahead of a powerful storm that that is predicted to sweep through California in the next few days. (Kristine Sperling via AP) ""It's a matter of life and death,"" Sperling said from Santa Barbara, where her family was staying with good friends after evacuating Tuesday ahead of a powerful Pacific storm that's likely to be the worst this winter for parts of the state. The storm, a so-called atmospheric river, began moving into central and southern parts of California on Tuesday, dropping rain as communities besieged by wildfires and mudslides braced for the worst. The Sperlings' home wasn't damaged by January's mudslides but the family needed to be rescued after losing electricity, gas and water, and all the roads out of town were destroyed. ""We're just not willing to take that kind of chance anymore,"" the 48-year-old Sperling said. ""What happened in January was just all of our worst nightmares."" The rain began on the central coast in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties and spread south across adjacent Ventura and Los Angeles Counties by early Wednesday. There were no initial reports of flooding or debris flows, but Santa Barbara County spokeswoman Suzanne Grimmesey said forecasters warned that rainfall was expected to intensify later in the morning. In the meantime, debris basins that had filled during the January storm were functioning after being completely emptied, she said. The county has said 50,000 truckloads of debris were removed. ""Everybody's clenched a bit waiting,"" said Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Hoxsie said there's also potential for isolated thunderstorms, which can dump large amounts of water over short periods of time. ""That gets everybody more concerned,"" she said. The Sperlings are among tens of thousands of people in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties who've been ordered to flee their homes as the storm approached. Los Angeles County authorities put thousands more on notice late Tuesday to be ready to evacuate from neighborhoods in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, which have also been badly hit by wildfires. Many residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings. Montecito resident Garrick Hyder evacuated for the December wildfire but not ahead of the January mudslides, which destroyed items in his garage that included a motorcycle and thousands of dollars' worth of snowboarding and scuba-diving equipment. Hyder watched as rescuers retrieved several bodies over several days from in front of his house. Mudslides had swept the dead from their homes miles away to the coast. Hyder evacuated four days after the mudslides and then again when another storm threatened the area a week ago. ""I'm on No. 4 now,"" Hyder said Tuesday as he packed his car. ""It's pretty crazy. It's kind of the price of living in paradise."" Hyder was planning to stay in Los Angeles overnight and then head up north to Lake Tahoe to make the most of his latest evacuation. ""I'm getting used to this,"" he said. ""It's kind of desensitizing."" Grimmesey said law enforcement officers knocked on doors in the extreme-risk areas of Montecito on Tuesday. ""For those that were home, we had a very good cooperation rate with people leaving,"" she said. However, both Hyder and the Sterlings know several neighbors who are opting to stay, many who are older and less mobile, some who are tired of the repeated evacuations and others who just think their homes will be safe. Camille Joos-Visconti, her husband and their three children were staying in their home in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles. For now. ""We have three dogs, two newborn kittens, a 20-pound iguana, a 5-foot snake, three young kids, and I'm pregnant,"" said the 32-year-old Joos-Visconti. ""It's just so much to deal with."" The family's area has also been burned bare from recent wildfires and their home is prone to flooding. Their area is on notice to evacuate Wednesday. Joos-Visconti said the family has evacuated three times since September and can be out of the house with everything they need in five minutes if necessary.

(AP) - The Latest on deadly California mudslides (all times local): 11:20 a.m. The difficult search goes on in Montecito, California, five days after storm-spawned mudslides roared down from fire-stripped hillsides and smashed through dozens of homes, killing at least 18 people and leaving others missing.

(Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via AP) The army of search-and-rescue crews and recovery workers swelled to more than 2,100 on Saturday in the coastal enclave about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles. The number of missing has fluctuated but stands at seven. Crews are using backhoes, jackhammers and shovels to look for victims and clear roads. Weather is good, but forecasters say there's a slight chance of light rain by next Friday. New inspections are underway. Officials say there could be changes in the assessments that report 65 single-family homes and eight businesses destroyed and 462 homes and 20 businesses damaged. Much of the community remains under mandatory evacuation orders. ___ 10:35 p.m. Frustrations and dark discoveries mounted for a California town ravaged by a deadly and destructive mudslide. Most of the people of Montecito are now under orders to stay out of town for two weeks. And search-and-rescue workers found the 18th person killed in the disaster, an 87-year-old man discovered Friday in his home. Other crews toiled to clean up the massive wreckage of the slide and to repair power, water and gas lines. The order to stay away was another difficult turn for those living in the Southern California town that has been subject to repeated evacuation orders in recent weeks, first because of a monster wildfire last month, then because of downpours and mudslides.

Dr. Andrew A. Snelling,"Insisting that the earth and the universe are young, only 6,000 years old or so, does not make the biblical view popular in todays enlightened scientific culture. It would be so easy just to go along with the view believed and followed by the overwhelming majority of scientistsand taught in nearly all universities and museums around the worldthat the universe is 1314 billion years old and the earth 4.5 billion years old. After all, many Christians and most scientists who are Christians believe in such a vast antiquity for the earth and universe. Consequently, they even insist the days in Genesis 1 were not literal days, but were countless millions of years long. Also, they claim the Genesis account of creation by God is just poetic and/or figurative, so it is not meant to be read as history. Why a Young Age for the Earth? Of course, the reason for insisting on a young earth and universe is because other biblical authors took Genesis as literal history and an eyewitness account provided and guaranteed accurate by the Creator Himself ( 2 Timothy 3:16a; 2 Peter 1:21 ). Jesus also took Genesis as literal history ( Mark 10:69; Matthew 19:45; Luke 17:27 ). So, the outcome of letting Scripture interpret Scripture is a young earth and universe. ""The outcome of letting Scripture interpret Scripture is a young earth and universe."" The Hebrew language and context used in Genesis 1 can only mean literal (24 hour) days. 1 Furthermore, as history, the genealogies in Genesis 5 and 11 provide an accurate chronology, so that from the creation of the first man, Adam, to the present day is only about 6,000 years. Since the earth was only created five literal days before Adam, then on the authority of Gods Word, the earth is only about 6,000 years old. Does the Earth Look Old? Nevertheless, most people, including Christians, would still claim dogmatically that the earth looks old. But why does the earth supposedly look old? And how old does the earth really look? If we rightly ask such questions, then we are likely to get closer to the right answers. The use of the word looks gives us the necessary clue to finding the answers. Looking at an object and making a judgment about it requires two operations by the observer. There is first the observation of the object with ones eyes. Light impulses then go from the eyes to be processed by ones brain. How ones brain interprets what has been seen through ones eyes is dependent on what information is already stored in the brain. Such information has been progressively acquired and stored in our brains since birth. So, for example, as a child we learn what a rock is by being shown a rock. We observe that a sandstone is made of sand cemented together, and we see a trilobite fossil inside the sandstone (figure 1), so we wonder how the trilobite came to be fossilized in the sandstone and how both the sandstone and the trilobite fossil formed. However, we never actually observed either the trilobite being buried by sand and fossilized or the deposition of the sand and its cementation into sandstone. Therefore, we dont really know how and when the trilobite fossil and the sandstone formedso just by looking at them we really dont know how old they are. How, then, can we work out how old they might be and how they formed? Because we cant go back to the past, it seems logical to think in terms of what we see happening around us todayin the present. Today, rivers slowly erode land surfaces and gradually transport the sand downstream to their mouths where they build deltas. The sediments also are eventually spread gradually out on the seafloor, where bottom-dwelling creatures like trilobites could perhaps be occasionally buried and then fossilized. So with this apparently logical scenario in our minds, based on our everyday experience, when we look at that piece of sandstone with the trilobite fossil in it, it seems totally reasonable to conclude that, because it took such a long time to erode and transport the sand and then deposit it to bury and fossilize the trilobite, the sandstone and trilobite fossil must be very old. Perhaps they may even be millions of years old. However, it needs to be remembered that there are no particular intrinsic features of the sandstone and the trilobite fossil that are incontestably diagnostic of any supposed great age. The conclusion that they must be old wasnt because they actually look old, but because it was assumed they took a long time to form based on present-day experience. Long Age Reasoning Questioned Now lets extend this reasoning to the earth itself. Why is it that most people think the earth looks old? Isnt it because they assume it took a long time to form based on their present-day experience of geological processes ? After all, volcanic eruptions only occur sporadically today, so the vast, thick lava flows stacked on top of one anotherfor example, in the USAs Pacific Northwest must have taken a long time to accumulate. However, this reasoning is wrong for three very valid reasons: First, it ignores the fact that we cannot go back to the past to actually verify by direct observations that vast, thick stacks of lava flowsand sandstones with trilobite fossilstook a long time to form millions of years ago. The inference that the present is the key to the past is only an assumption, not a fact. Second, that assumption deliberately ignores the fact that we do have direct eyewitnesses from the past who have told us what did happen to the earth and how old it really is. The Bible claims to be the communication to us of the Creator God who has always existed. Its authenticity is overwhelmingly verified by countless exactly fulfilled predictions, archeological and scientific evidences, corroborating eyewitness accounts, and the changed lives and testimonies of Bible-believing Christians. In Genesis 111, it is revealed how to calculate the age of the earth, and how rock layers and fossils were rapidly and recently formed in the year-long, global, catastrophic Flood. And third, there is now abundant scientific evidence that rock layers and fossils can only form rapidly due to catastrophic geological processes not usually seen today, and not on the scale they must have occurred at in the past. 2 Catastrophism Today Geologists are always studying present-day geological processes, including rare catastrophic events, such as floods, earthquakes, and violent volcanic eruptions. Such processes have been observed to produce and change geological features very rapidly; so geologists have learned not to ignore such currently rare catastrophic events when interpreting how the earths features were produced in the past. Further examples of why most people think the earth looks old are river valleys and canyons. Because the rivers in most valleys and canyons today seem to only slowly and imperceptibly erode their channels, even during occasional floods, most people assume it must have taken millions of years to erode valleys and canyons. However, the observational realities are more instructive than such an erroneous assumption. For example, since the Colorado River today does not erode its channel, the only truly viable explanation for the carving of the Grand Canyon is rapid catastrophic erosion on an enormous scale by dammed waters left over from the global Genesis Flood. 3 Such rapid catastrophic erosion carving canyons has even been observed. As a result of the 1980 and subsequent eruptions at Mount St. Helens, up to 600 feet of rock layers rapidly accumulated nearby. A mudflow on March 18, 1982, eroded a canyon system over 100 feet deep in these sediment layers, resulting in a one-fortieth scale model of the real Grand Canyon (figure 2). 4 Uniformitarianism Predicted In 2 Peter 3, we read a prediction that Peter made around AD 62 that scoffers would arise who would challenge and deny that God created the earth and subsequently destroyed the earth by the cataclysmic global Flood. Peter says they would be willingly ignorant and deliberately reject the evidence for a created earth and the year-long global Flood. They would claim instead that the present is the key to the past, that present-day geological processes have always operated at todays snails pace, and that they alone are necessary to explain how rock layers and fossils formed and how old the earth is. This prediction was actually fulfilled about 200 years agoabout 1,750 years after the prediction was made. James Hutton, a doctor and farmer-turned-geologist, claimed in his 1785 Royal Society of Edinburgh paper and 1795 book Theory of the Earth that he saw no vestige of a beginning for the earth because present-day geological processes have slowly recycled rock materials over vast eons of time. This was a deliberate rejection of the biblical account of the recent, catastrophic global Flood, up until that time accepted by most scholars to be the explanation for fossil-bearing rock layers. Indeed, Hutton insisted that the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be seen happening now (emphasis mine). 5 It was Charles Lyell, a lawyer-turned-geologist, with his three-volume Principles of Geology (183033) who eventually convinced the geological establishment to abandon the biblical Flood in favor of this principle he called uniformitarianism. Lyell openly declared that he wanted to remove the influence of Moses (the human author of Genesis) from geology, revealing his motivation was spiritual, not scientific. 6 He insisted on the uniformity through time of natural processes only at todays rates, a belief that was later encapsulated in the phrase the present is the key to the past. This is the belief that now underpins virtually all modern geological explanations about the earth and its rock layers. And it is a belief because it cannot be proved that only todays geological processes can explain the earths history and determine its age. No one has ever observed past geological processes, except for Godand Noah and his familyduring the Flood when these processes were definitely catastrophic on a global scale. Yet most people today, even Christians, have unwittingly imbibed this uniformitarian belief, having been brainwashed by the constant barrage of teaching globally over many decades by the worlds education systems (schools, colleges, and universities), museums, and media (newspapers, magazines, television, and even Hollywood). Indeed, most people automatically see the earth as old because they have accepted it is a proven scientific fact that it is old! Using the Right Glasses However, based on the authority of Gods Word, we can dogmatically say they are absolutely wrong. Looking at the world through glasses that are based on human reasoning alone (mans word) makes people wrongly think the earth looks really old. On the other hand, when we as Christians see the world through the biblical glasses provided by Gods inerrant Wordso that we see the world as God sees itwe can assert unashamedly that the earth does not really look that old at all, being only about 6,000 years old (which, of course, is young). Indeed, the earth we see today is the way it looks because it is the destroyed remains of the original earth God created, still marred by the subsequent Curse. Furthermore, not only should we understand that the Bible provides the true history of the earth, but that history tells us the earth only looks the way it does today because of what happened in the past. In other words, the past is the key to the present! Conclusion Paul, in 2 Corinthians 11:3, warns us about the way Satan subtly beguiled the mind of Eve in the Garden of Eden by questioning and twisting Gods Word. Today, Satan has subtly beguiled so many people, including Christians, by twisting the clear testimony of Gods Word that the past is the key to the present into the present is the key to the past. And just as he used the appealing look of the fruit on that tree to entice Eve, so he uses the snails pace of geological processes today to make people doubt or deny what God has told us about the young age of the earth and His eyewitness account of the formation of the rock layers and fossils. It also must be emphasized that even though we must trust God and His Word by faith alone ( Hebrews 11:3 ), it is neither an unreasonable nor a subjective faith. This is because God is not a man that He should lie, so the evidence we see in Gods world will always ultimately be consistent with what we read in Gods Word. Thus, when we put on our biblical glasses, we should be able to immediately see and recognize the overwhelming evidence that the earth looks (and is) young and that the earths fossil-bearing rock layers are a product of the catastrophic global Flood. After all, if the Genesis Flood really did occur, what evidence would we look for? Genesis 7 says all the high hills and mountains under the whole heaven were covered by the water from the fountains of the great deep and the global torrential rainfall so that all land-dwelling, air-breathing creatures not on the Ark perished. Wouldnt we, therefore, expect to find the remains of billions of plants and creatures buried in rock layers rapidly laid down by water all around the earth? Yes, of course! And thats exactly what we findbillions of rapidly buried fossils in rock layers up on the continents, rapidly deposited by the ocean waters rising up and over the continents all around the earth. This confirms that the rocks and fossils arent millions of years oldand neither is the earth. So how old does the earth look? If we look at the earth through the glasses of human reasoningthat only snail-paced present geological processes can explain the pastthen the earth does indeed look old. However, that autonomous human reasoning blatantly denies what Gods Word clearly tells us about the true age of the God-created earth and about what happened in the recent past during the cataclysmic global Flood, which is the key to understanding why the earth looks the way it does today.","Most people, including Christians, would still claim dogmatically that the earth looks old.

"Firdia Lisnawati - The Associated Press,Stephen Wright","KARANGASEM, INDONESIA—Indonesian authorities ordered a mass evacuation of people Monday from an expanded danger zone around an erupting volcano on Bali that has forced the island’s international airport to close, stranding tens of thousands of travellers. Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 metres into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometres away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano’s slopes. It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano’s alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometres in places from the previous 7 ½ kilometres. It said a larger eruption is possible. Spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don’t want to abandon their livestock. “Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,” he said. “If needed we will forcibly evacuate them.” About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centres after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that is serving as an evacuation centre.

We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,” she said. The family had stayed at the same sports centre in September and October when the volcano’s alert was at the highest level for several weeks but it didn’t erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. “If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I’ll just accept it if our house is destroyed,” she said. Bali’s airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancellations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesperson Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled, stranding about 59,000 travellers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. It had a ripple effect across Indonesia, causing delays at other airports because Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai airport is a national hub with many transiting flights. Bali is Indonesia’s top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were cancelled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighbouring island of Lombok. “We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they’re not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,” said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen, who was stranded at Bali’s airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia’s Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali’s international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption. The agency’s chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighbouring Java and then travelling by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia’s tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night’s free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano, and soldiers and police distributed masks over the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to school. Indonesia sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung’s alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the mountain, which prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity, but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centres.","Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 metres into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, which “will certainly spill over to the slopes,” a spokesperson said.",2017-11-27T14:35:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thestar.com'}",Indonesia orders mass evacuation as threat from erupting Bali volcano continues,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/11/27/indonesia-orders-mass-evacuation-as-threat-from-erupting-bali-volcano-continues.html,https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/11/27/indonesia-orders-mass-evacuation-as-threat-from-erupting-bali-volcano-continues/mount_agung.jpg,,Thestar.com,mudflow,1
