Mariella Moon,"Graeme Stephens, director of the Center of Climate Sciences at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, explained: ""We don't have any way of measuring how water and air move in thunderstorms globally. We just don't have any information about that at all, yet it's so essential for predicting severe weather and even how rains will change in a future climate."" While small, the RainCube isn't so tiny that scientists can let loose a bunch inside a raging hurricane à la the sensors in Twister. It works by using radar to see storms in the same way a bat uses sonar to fly around in the dark. RainCube has an umbrella-like component that sends out chirps or radar signals, which then bounce off raindrops to paint a picture of what the inside of a storm looks like. The RainCube team created it as an experiment to see if it's possible to create a weather radar in the form of a tiny low-cost satellite. ""The radar signal penetrates the storm, and then the radar receives back an echo,"" Principal Investigator Eva Peral said. ""As the radar signal goes deeper into the layers of the storm and measures the rain at those layers, we get a snapshot of the activity inside the storm."" In the future, multiple units could work together to monitor hurricanes/typhoons in real time and send back updates every few minutes. Scientists could then use the data they gather to enhance weather models, so we can improve our ability to predict the movement of rain, snow, sleet and hail and make more accurate weather forecasts.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Alabama search and rescue teams on Tuesday were combing through the wreckage of houses flatted by weekend tornadoes, looking for seven or eight people who remained unaccounted for in the wake of the deadliest U.S. twister outbreak since 2013. 
The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, was beginning to mourn the 23 people confirmed killed by the storms, which included four children and seven people from one family, officials said on Tuesday. 
The victims ranged in age from 6 to 93 years old, Bill Harris, coroner for storm-ravaged Lee County, told a morning news conference. 
“Just keep these families in your prayers,” Harris said. 
Most of the deceased were found in close proximity to their homes. The four children were age 6, 8, 9 and 10, officials said. 
County Sheriff Jay Jones said on Tuesday that search crews had narrowed their scope down to “the most affected areas” after scouring much of the county on Monday. He said he hoped the search and rescue effort would become a recovery effort by the end of the day. 
The tornadoes, stirred up by a late-winter “supercell” thunderstorm, toppled mobile homes and uprooted massive trees on Sunday with 170 mile-per-hour (274 km-per hour) winds. Forecasters ranked the worst of the outbreak at step four of the six-step Enhanced Fujita scale of tornado strength. 
The Beauregard community in the twister’s path might have had as few as eight or nine minutes to seek shelter from the time the warning was issued, National Weather Service chief meteorologist Chris Darden said. 
In addition to 23 confirmed deaths, more than 50 people were reported injured, authorities said, making this the deadliest tornado outbreak since a massive tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, killing 24 people and injuring 375 others.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - A pair of tornadoes killed at least 23 people on Sunday in Alabama, causing infrastructure damage with at least 150 miles per hour (241 kph) winds in the deadliest twister to hit the United States in almost six years. 
The following is a list of some of the deadliest single tornadoes and tornado outbreaks in the United States over the last quarter century: 
* A so-called Super Outbreak of 362 tornadoes hit the southeastern United States over three days in April 2011, killing an estimated 321 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Three of the tornadoes were rated EF-5, the top of the five-step Enhanced Fujita scale that meteorologists use to measure tornado strength. The system struck Alabama the hardest, wrecking Tuscaloosa and Birmingham and causing about $11 billion in damages across 12 states. 
* The deadliest tornado to hit the United States in the last several decades struck Joplin, Missouri on May 22, 2011 and killed at least 158 people, NOAA said. Damage from the storm exceeded $3 billion, the most of any single tornado in U.S. history. 
* The so-called Super Tuesday Outbreak of 87 tornadoes in the southeastern United States on Feb. 5, 2008, killed 57 people, according to NOAA. It had the longest footprint of any tornado in U.S. history, according to private forecaster Accuweather, touching down continuously for 122 miles (196 km) through Arkansas. 
* A tornado outbreak in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, metropolitan area on May 3, 1999, spawned 61 tornadoes and killed 55 people, with one single tornado responsible for 36 deaths, according to the Weather Channel. 
* An outbreak of seven tornadoes in central Florida in February 1998 killed 42 people and injured 260 others in the state’s deadliest tornado outbreak since 1962, the National Weather Service reported. 
* In April 2014, an outbreak of dozens of tornadoes stirred up by a powerful storm system hit the Southeast and Midwest over a three-day period and killed 32 people in Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee, according to NOAA. 
* A tornado killed 24 people on May 20, 2013 in Moore, Oklahoma. The tornado had winds over 200 miles per hour (322 kph), giving it the most severe rating of EF-5. It lasted about 40 minutes, and caused billions of dollars worth of damage, according to NOAA.

Elliot Williams,"We’ve got a small box of microcontroller programmers on our desktop. AVR, PIC, and ARM, or at least the STMicro version of ARM. Why? Some program faster, some debug better, some have nicer cables, and others, well, we’re just sentimental about. Don’t judge. [Dmitry Grinberg], on the other hand, is searching for the One Ring. Or at least the One Ring for ARM microcontrollers. You see, while all ARM chips have the same core, and thus the same SWD debugging interface, they all write to flash differently. So if you do ARM development with offerings from different chip vendors, you need to have a box full of programmers or shell out for an expensive J-Link. Until now. [Dmitry] keeps his options open by loading up the flash-specific portion of the code as a plugin, which lets the programmer figure out what chip it’s dealing with and then lookup the appropriate block size and flash memory procedures. One Ring. He also implements a fast printf -style debugging aid that he calls “ZeroWire Trace” that we’d like to hear more about. Programming and debugging are scriptable in Lua, and it can do batch programming based on reading chip IDs. You can build your own CortexProg from an ATtiny85, two diodes, and two current-limiting resistors: the standard V-USB setup. The downside of the DIY? Slow upload speed, but at least it’ll get you going. He’s also developed a number of fancier versions that improve on this. Version four of the hardware is just now up on Kickstarter, if you’re interested. If you’re just using one vendor’s chips or don’t mind having a drawer full of programmers, you might also look into the Black Magic Probe. It embeds a GDB server in the debugger itself, which is both a cool trick and the reason that you have to re-flash the programmer to work with a different vendor’s chips. Since the BMP firmware is open, you can make your own for the cost of a sacrificial ST-Link clone, about $4. On the other hand, if you want a programmer that works across chip families, is scriptable, and can do batch uploads, CortexProg looks like a caviar programmer on a fish-bait budget. We’re going to try one out soon. Oh and if you think [Dmitry Grinberg] sounds familiar, you might like his sweet Dreamcast VRU hack, his investigations into the Cypress PSOCs, or his epic AVR-based Linux machine.","We’ve got a small box of microcontroller programmers on our desktop.

Kate Gray,"Theres something very saucy about playing sexy board games. It feels like redefining innocent childhood memories, like reading Harry Potter slash fiction where Ron and Malfoy get busy on the roof of the Hogwarts Express, or finding out that The Hunchback of Notre Dame was about Frollo having a raging anger-boner for Esmeralda. NSFW Warning: This post contains explicit cartoon imagery. This is how I felt when booting up Pretzel After Dark, a browser game by Tim milkymilkface Snowdon thats a naughty take on Twister. Instead of directing limbs to colored circles, Pretzel After Dark replaces the Twister board with your partners body, making it less left hand blue and more left hand boob. There are two modes: underwear on, and underwear off. Perhaps the implication is that the players will match the state of the in-game models, or maybe its just an aesthetics thing. Pretzel cycles through randomly-chosen pairings of body parts, sexy ones mixed in with regular ones, so youll get instructions like mouth to bum and right hand to crotch. Its up to the players whether these instructions are set on a timerfor a hands-free approachor whether they want to manually trigger the next one by pressing the spacebar. Theres even an option to turn off certain body parts, so if youre playing at a party, maybe you want to turn off the crotch option. Or maybe you dont, I dont know what kind of parties you go to. Or perhaps youre not super into the idea of feet being pressed up against your most delicate parts. At first, the idea of mushing your various areas together is exciting, titillating, even, but its not long before the mundanity settles in. Im not talking about the mundanity of trying to sex up your partner after decades together, or the mundanity of defaulting to the missionary position after it turns out that every other position is kind of awkward, actually. Its the mundanity that you also get from sex dice, if youve ever tried those. It turns out that a large part of sexual enjoyment seems to come from the spontaneity of it all. Its not so much that Pretzel After Dark is a turn-offits more that it never turns you on in the first place. Thats not to say that it doesnt have a purpose, though. Pretzel After Dark was originally designed as part of XXXHIBITION, a curation of sexy games shown off in Melbourne, and given that the exhibition was held in the Australian video game-themed bar, Bar SK definitely a regular bar and not a sex club its safe to assume that Pretzel After Dark was intended as more of a party game than a tango for two. I dont think I have enough willing friends to test this out at a party, but I imagine that, with the right group of people, it could be quite fun, in the same way Twister is fun even if you end up with your nose pressed up against someones nipples. Pretzel After Dark is also about normalizing queer sexual interactions: the two on-screen avatars are never shown in full, but both possess penises. It is a little disappointing to not be able to input the genders of the players at first, because theres definitely a disconnect when crotch to crotch comes up and features a configuration of bits that you dont have, or the fact that boobs and nipples arent involved at all, but otherwise its refreshing and good to see a sexual depiction of a couple that doesnt default to cis heterosexuality. At the end of the day, Im not sure if Pretzel is truly designed to be sexy, because theres a world of difference between, for example, licking your way into mutual bliss, and just mashing your mouth against your partners crotch. I guess the instructions are open to interpretation, but when youre trying to juggle elbow to back and head to right foot, sexiness often takes a back seat. But intimacy isnt all about jumping straight to humping. A game like Pretzel After Dark can help tear down the boundaries of awkwardness and unfamiliarity with each others bodies. And isnt that what sex is all about? Probably?","There’s something very saucy about playing sexy board games.

MELENA RYZIK,"Mr. Cave, a gay artist whose projects have recently become more personal — he also has an exhibition, “ Weather or Not,” at Jack Shainman Gallery in Chelsea this month — can sneak depth into even the most lightweight elements of his work. In “The Let Go,” the colors of the curtain, which he titled “The Chase,” represent gay pride and minorities being chased by police. Though Ms. Harper, the movement director, created the “Let Go” line dance and a few other distinct phrases, she also wanted her dancers to improvise, and stay connected to the crowd. “We want to include all people, even people that are shy,” she said. “I had this woman who was like, ‘I can’t dance, I can’t dance,’ and I said, O.K., can you walk with me? We walked around the Chase, and I took her hand, and we were laughing by the end.” On Wednesday night, well-heeled patrons and young creative types declared themselves dazzled. “We wish all openings were this engaging,” said Juan Hinojosa, a mixed media artist, as the tinsel curtain twirled past him and a friend. “It’s magical.” At a rehearsal earlier in the week, attended by schoolchildren, there were cartwheels and chants of “rock it out!” A 9-year-old Brooklyn boy named Jayden showed off a fast move he called the Twister, which he created for the room (another was inspired by Fortnite, the video game). “I want a hug!” he called as the Soundsuited performers filed past him. One of the thrills for Mr. Cave is that, in its long run, “The Let Go” can be transformed. It’s an “ongoing sketch,” he said. “Nothing stays the same.” And don’t be surprised to see him out on the floor, recharging with the crowd. “I will definitely be dancing,” he said. “And it’ll come out of the birth of the project — it’s that ahhh, that sigh of relief. Now I can just sort of let go.”","Charles Grant, one of the performers, dances with the crowd at Nick Cave’s “The Let Go” at the Park Avenue Armory.

The rare twister touched down Tuesday in Port Orchard, Washington. It damaged several homes and toppled trees.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
The National Weather Service crew will determine just how powerful the storm was.
The Kitsap County sheriff’s office told local media the damage was “catastrophic” and contained to neighborhoods east and south of a Walmart in Port Orchard.
The sheriff’s office says power lines were down and roads were closed in the area.
About 50 buildings were affected.
Port Orchard is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Seattle, across Puget Sound on the Kitsap Peninsula.

DAVID LEONHARDT,"The net result will be fewer middle- and low-income people signing up for insurance. Because fewer of them will sign up, the federal government will spend less money on their medical care. And because the federal government will spend less on them, it will have more money to spend on — you guessed it — tax cuts for the wealthy. For more on the mandate, I recommend this piece by Margot Sanger-Katz of The Times and a nother by Dylan Scott and Sarah Kliff of Vox. They explain an additional problem with scrapping the mandate: Insurance premiums will rise, because the pool of the insured will be sicker. Some Democrats believe the Republican leaders have made a tactical mistake, because progressive activists are more passionate about health care than tax policy. “This is turning a tax bill into a health care bill,” Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, said yesterday. “The Bat signal has gone out to the Obamacare activists,” tweeted Democratic strategist Brian Fallon. Related, in a conversation about the future of conservatism, Henry Olsen tells Ross Douthat : “The G.O.P. remains intellectually wedded to dying dogma. The congressional party really wants to do nothing other than cut taxes for businesspeople and the top bracket based on what can only be called religious devotion to supply-side theory.” And Sahil Kapur of Bloomberg notes that the new version of the Senate tax bill, released last night, has yet more bad news for the non-wealthy. “Big deal: New Senate GOP tax bill sunsets middle-class tax cuts—rate reductions, standard deduction increase, child tax credit hike,” he writes. “However, the corporate tax cut from 35% to 20% is permanent.” In The Times. Jeff Sessions spent much of a congressional hearing yesterday “as he has all the others he’s sat through this year — by not recalling things that one would think most people would,” argues The Times’s editorial board. Besides contacts with and conversations about Russian officials during the 2016 campaign, the editorial asks, “What else are you forgetting, Mr. Attorney General?” America tied for first. I recommend a column by David Ignatius in today’s Washington Post, about President Trump’s Asia trip. “Trump’s trip may indeed prove to be historic, but probably not in the way he intends,” Ignatius writes. “It may signal a U.S. accommodation to rising Chinese power, plus a desire to mend fences with a belligerent Russia — with few evident security gains for the United States.” Uwe Reinhardt.

But the majority of us tinker away with our basic setups and slowly improve our equipment. Research showed me that 100mm tube is available as ground pipework and the connectors weren't too expensive. Flexible tube, if semi rigid, was OK but the construction creates drag. Cheap plastic flexi duct work tube is a definite 'no' as it wouldn't last. There's also various warnings about static electricity build up and fires - there's plenty on the internet about this so, if concerned, research it more.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","A tornado rips through a residential area after touching down south of Wynnewood, Okla., on May 09, 2016. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images) It's been the quietest start to a tornado season ever recorded in Oklahoma, one of the nation's most twister-prone states. But a severe weather outbreak is possible next week. As of Friday, not a single tornado has been reported in the state so far in 2018. That's the longest Oklahoma has ever gone without a tornado to start the year, AccuWeather said. The previous record for the latest start to tornado season in Oklahoma was April 26, which occurred in 1962, the Weather Channel said. On average, the Sooner State gets 56 tornadoes per year, with May typically the most active month. Kansas also has not reported any tornadoes in 2018, the National Weather Service reported, but that state's record earliest tornado was in late May. And it's not just Oklahoma and Kansas that have been quiet: Across the U.S., only about 229 tornadoes have been reported in 2018, the Storm Prediction Center said. That's about 100 fewer than in a typical year. Warm, humid air is one of the ingredients need for tornadoes to form, and that's been lacking in the central U.S. this year. Frequent rounds of chilly air from Canada, thanks to a persistent southward dip in the jet stream over the eastern U.S., helped to keep temperature and humidity surges to a minimum, AccuWeather meteorologist Richard Schraeger said.

Severe storms, including the risk of tornadoes, are forecast to blast Oklahoma, Kansas and other parts of the Plains, South and Midwest during the first few days of May. The Weather Channel calls it ""a classic early May setup for severe thunderstorms in the nation's heartland.""

Ford is getting in the St. Patrick's Day spirit by announcing on Thursday that 2020 Mustang models, including the GT350 and GT500, will be available in a particularly eye-searing hue that it's calling ""Grabber Lime.""
In addition to Grabber Lime, Ford is planning to offer the 2020 Mustang in some other vaguely retro-inspired tones like Twister Orange, Iconic Silver and Red Hot Metallic. With color names like that, it's like we're living in the late-sixties all over again! Right? Guys?

""Aspirational and confident, they are fun, youthful colors that make a statement of how you want the world to see you and who you want to be.""

Sam Rutherford,"A few weeks ago, a leaked video of an intriguing, dual-folding bendy phone hit the net, and since then Ive wanted to know everything about it. Then today, in a post on Weibo, Xiaomi president Lin Bin released a teaser clip for an upcoming device that seemingly confirms Xiaomi as the maker of the gadget that originally leaked. 
While Xiaomi didnt provide a lot of details about its flexible creation, in a brief description alongside a video of the device (full text posted below via Google Translate) Bin claims it perfectly merges the experience of a tablet and phone.
The curious thing is that Bin describes the yet-unnamed device as having a four-way folding hinge, even though the phone has only been shown to expand outwards to become fully open, or bend back behind itself when the extra screen real estate isnt needed. 
Also, it seems that in order to give the phone more familiar controls, Xiaomi moved the devices power button to its top-side, similar to where phones like the HTC One M7 had them back in 2013, so that its easily reachable both when the devices screens are folded up or fully expanded.
For now, Xiaomi says it doesnt officially have plans to sell this device. However, Bins post was quick to say that based on feedback and customer response, Xiaomi would consider releasing its bendy creation for real in the future. In the meantime, Xiaomi is taking suggestions on names, with Bin offering up two possibilities: either the Mi Dual Flex or the Mi Mix Flex. To me, the latter sounds like a mini tongue twister, so Id go for something even simpler, like the Xiaomi Mi Flex.
Regardless of what this thing ends up being called, while we continue to wait for Samsung to officially announce its upcoming flexible phone, Xiaomis creation remains the most interesting bendy screen concept yet. 
Xiaomis double folding mobile phone is coming! After conquering a series of technical problems such as flexible folding screen technology, four-wheel drive folding shaft technology, flexible cover technology, and MIUI adaptation, we made the first folding screen mobile phone, which should be the worlds first double folding mobile phone. This symmetrical double-folded form perfectly combines the experience of the tablet and mobile phone, which is both practical and beautiful. Although it is still an engineering machine, it is sent out for everyone to see. Welcome everyone to forward / comment / like. If you like it, we will consider making a mass production machine in the future. 
 In addition, we want to give this engineering machine a name, what do you think is good? I think of two: Xiaomi Dual Flex, Xiaomi MIX Flex. Welcome everyone to make suggestions!

"Carl Wilson, Carl Wilson","Kacey Musgraves and Ashley McBryde. Taylor Swift’s early career blew like a twister through country music, leaving practically no chart or sales records untouched. Yet after Swift fully decamped to pop music in 2014 with her album 1989, the edifices of the Nashville, Tennessee, Music Row seemed to smack right back down intact, almost as if Swift had never happened. Unlike when Hurricane Shania Twain hit Nashville in the mid-1990s, there seemed to be no tail wind behind Swift sweeping in more woman-centric and crossover-minded country. Quite the opposite: The “ bro country ” wave that dominated country charts for most of this decade seemed nearly like a calculated effort to put Swift-style girl power in its place, i.e., looking pretty with its bare feet up on the dashboard of some dude’s pickup. There was a growing cohort of forceful gender- and class-conscious female singer-songwriters—names such as Brandy Clark, Angaleena Presley, Cam, Brandi Carlile, Maren Morris, Margo Price, and Kacey Musgraves—but they mostly stood outside the mainstream, combining up-to-the-moment social observations with a twangy traditionalist sound. The past two years, though, have brought changes that could be read in part as a delayed Swift effect. Hits by guys such as Sam Hunt and Thomas Rhett were softening the machismo and picking up post-Drake beats from the heights of the pop charts. Kelsea Ballerini, Swift’s most obvious Nashville heir, achieved her fourth Country Airplay No. 1 single this winter with “ Legends.” The backlash appeared to be ebbing. (Hopeful darkest-before-dawn forecasts about Donald Trump’s fortunes waning along with the post-Obama backlash would be an analogy too far, but run with it if it makes you happy.) Golden Hour sees Musgraves blissfully releasing herself from the how-country-is-it trap. Still, until now, no one in Nashville managed to follow up Swift’s past skill at appealing to the country and pop worlds simultaneously—to offer the “red” and “blue” Americas some common musical ground. “ The Middle,” Maren Morris’ single with EDM producer Zedd and the duo Grey, is in the pop top 10 and could go to No. 1. But musically, Morris seems like a hired hand there, lending her vocal muscle but not much of her punchy Southern style. Conversely, “ Meant to Be,” pop vocalist Bebe Rexha’s single with Florida Georgia Line, has broken Swift’s own record for a woman-led song’s longevity atop the country chart —but with a squarely bro-style song in which the male vocalist takes the first verse. All of which makes Kacey Musgraves’ new, third album Golden Hour an unexpected milestone. Ever since the then–24-year-old Texan’s debut single “Merry Go ’Round” surprised observers by entering the Country Airplay top 10 in 2013, her role as a potential country modernizer has been under constant debate. She’s won Grammys and country awards, but her cleverly tart Willie Nelson – and John Prine –influenced songs about hypocrisy and tolerance (notably the casually queer-friendly “ Follow Your Arrow ”) made country programmers skittish as much for their overly rootsy sounds as for their liberal sentiments— although the tendency for outsiders to use Musgraves to score anti-Nashville points couldn’t have helped. After 2015’s Pageant Material, a hurried second album that seemed stuck in a holding pattern, Golden Hour sees Musgraves blissfully releasing herself from the how-country-is-it trap. Instead, she’s gone for a radiant pop makeover. But not in Swift’s competitively triumphal mode. Instead, the record summons up the 1970s soft-rock and disco crossovers of Dolly Parton, Olivia Newton-John, and Anne Murray, not to mention ’90s Shania and Sheryl Crow. (The album was actually recorded in Crow’s home studio, upstairs from her horse stable.) There’s also a wink in the more contemporary directions of Daft Punk and Imogen Heap, with the disco of “High Horse” and the vocoder effects of “Oh, What a World.” Musgraves has referred to it as “ galactic country,” a term that recalls hippie-country pioneer Gram Parsons’ invocations of “ Cosmic American Music.” The brightness of ’60s pop is here too, not to mention some light psychedelia, fittingly enough—Musgraves acknowledges the influence of some very millennial LSD microdosing on songs such as “Mother,” on which she weeps empathetic tears made out of notes and colors. But her main drug of choice on Golden Hour is love. Musgraves got married in October to fellow country songwriter Ruston Kelly, and along with the contact high with that newlywed glow the album’s pop sheen provides, the experience seems to have realigned the 29-year-old’s whole perspective. The barbed critical wordplay of her first two albums has given way to a more generously spacious embrace of the world as a panoply of possibility. She’s still forthright and philosophical. But her worries are more about being “the kinda person who starts getting kinda nervous/ when I’m having the time of my life” (on “Happy &amp; Sad”) than about her old feuds with moralistic busybodies. Even the couple of diss tracks here, “Space Cowboy” and “High Horse,” find their wry jabs channeled through funky grooves (one woozy, the other lighting up the neon-flashing dance floor) that turn the antagonism harmlessly antic. When Musgraves calls a guy a “ Velvet Elvis ” on Golden Hour, she’s not mocking him as ersatz and chintzy but teasingly praising him as crushable, soft, and sparkly, a delight to have around the house. To make that shift, Musgraves has moved previous key co-writers such as Shane McAnally and Luke Laird, among other whip-smart Music Row word-slingers, to the back benches. Her main collaborators here are the multi-instrumentalist producers Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian—listen to Tashian’s own locally beloved dream-pop band, the Silver Seas, for some precedents to Golden Hour ’s sound. But their contributions are secondary to the way Musgraves has lowered her own defenses, willing to risk a little cheesiness (and a couple of these songs do have a whiff of Velveeta) if it lets her explore and share a fuller emotional spectrum. Where she used to preach against snobs, now she’s let go of her own variety of snobbery. And her voice seems to have opened up along with her heart, becoming richer and stronger than ever. Now the question is how broad a listenership, inside and outside of country, might follow. Meanwhile, for more irredeemably hard-bitten listeners who miss Musgraves’ old piss and vinegar (and I do at least a bit), there’s an exciting Nashville newcomer to fill that space. The twist is that Ashley McBryde is no kid. The Arkansas-raised singer is in her mid-30s and has spent years hacking out a musical living in—as the title track of her new album, Girl Going Nowhere, puts it—“a whole lot of basement dives and county fairs.” But it’s only fairly recently that she caught a break. First, in 2017, country star Eric Church declared himself a fan and brought the diminutive, sleeve-tattooed, “whiskey-drinkin’ badass” onstage to duet with him on her tear-jerking tribute to her preacher-rancher dad, “Bible and a.44.” She scored a record deal (after a couple of independent releases) and later that year released her single “ A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega,” which earned a heap of year-end attention from critics, including me, for its crackling invocation of a “makin’-the-best-of-a-worst-day kinda night.” Recently, it cracked the country top 40. McBryde’s backed by her band Deadhorse (as in “beating a”), which has the riffs and crunch to win over the biker-bar crowds they’ve often played to. And her pipes are salt-crusted but loaded with steam, evocative by turns of Bonnie Raitt, Lucinda Williams, and Reba McEntire. To hear her roar about craving a love affair with the passion of “Kennedy and Mon-roooooooooe” on the album’s advance single “ American Scandal ” is to feel like you’re being hollered out of your recliner to a muddy-booted stomp in a rainstorm. Endearingly funny and no-fucks-given indomitable, McBryde’s rise provides a rejoinder to country’s recent fetish for the gruff chug of Chris Stapleton (another longtime local Nashville hero who finally got a spotlight of his own), that authenticity is not about testosterone. McBryde’s rise provides a rejoinder to country’s recent fetish for the gruff chug of Chris Stapleton, that authenticity is not about testosterone. The other constant pleasure for me of Girl Going Nowhere also comes out of McBryde’s veteran performing history: its view of the world as made out of music. What matters about the “breakdown wrong turn that takes ya” to the Dahlonega dive bar (in Georgia, by the way) is that it’s where you’ll “hear a song from a band that saves ya.” The tender but fierce opening title track is a little bit of payback to the small-minded folks back home who predicted she’d “crash and burn.” (It was written for the night she made her Grand Ole Opry debut.) Then comes “Radioland,” a kind of Tom Petty/Springsteen-esque anthem about growing up somewhere remote enough that its access to the world was mostly through the radio dial, which offered everything from ballgames and sermons to “Johnny and June” and “Jack &amp; Diane.” The slinky “Southern Babylon” finds her in an afterlife where she’s condemned to sing hellish Top 40 covers forever in an infernal nightclub—“Got a band up there been dyin’ to play a little ‘Devil Went Down to Georgia’ ” and later, “a little ‘Hotel California.’ ” When she sings about the opioid addict next door, or maybe on your own living-room couch (“stealing cable”), in “Livin’ Next to Leroy,” she does it to a chord pattern that smacks of “Sweet Home Alabama.” More than any other song I know on that subject, she manages to make it intimate, lighthearted and nonjudgmental, while still getting across the tragedy as Leroy steals the neighbor’s bike, hocks his old class ring, and one day just doesn’t wake up any more. And the album closes with an ode to another kind of addiction, “Home Sweet Highway”—because when McBryde finds herself staying home too long, she gets “homesick” for the tour bus. Even a tune that sounds like the album’s most straightforward love song, the battle-of-the-sexes truce ballad “Andy (I Can’t Live Without You),” turns out instead to be about McBryde’s friendship with her band’s guitarist, Andrew Sovine, who’s also her roommate.

Associated Press,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — Forecasters say 90 people were injured in the tornado that also killed at least 23 people in the small community of Beauregard, Alabama.
The number of injured comes in a Tuesday report from the National Weather Service, forecasters say the tornado’s damage path was nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide and kept gaining intensity before slamming into Beauregard, Alabama.
Survey crews from the weather service documented how the deadly twister shredded manufactured homes, emptying their contents into the woods.
Forecasters said in the report that the tornado was strong enough to bend the frame of a car around what remained of a large tree. Based on the damage, they’ve determined that it was EF-4 tornado with 170 mph (274 kph) winds.

"Marissa Martinelli, Marissa Martinelli","On Monday, Seth Meyers zeroed in on the Trump administration’s new strategy for defending the president, after Rudy Giuliani “lurched out of a fog bank” last week to try to discredit Michael Cohen during media appearances. “At some point, everyone’s who close to Trump turns on him,” noted Meyers, listing the many members of his administration who have betrayed him, including Omarosa and John Kelly. But that lack of loyalty works both ways. Remember, for instance, how Trump called in to Fox &amp; Friends in April to distance himself from Cohen? Here’s an excerpt from the transcript: Michael is in business. He’s really a businessman. A fairly big business, as I understand it. I don’t know his business. But this doesn’t have to do with me. Michael is a businessman. He’s got a business—he also practices law, I would say probably the big thing is his business, and they’re looking into something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business. “Trump says the word business like Hodor says Hodor,” said Meyers. “At his next rally, Trump’s gonna show up carrying Vladimir Putin on his back.” As it looks more and more likely that Cohen will cooperate with prosecutors, Giuliani is scrambling to undermine his credibility— though he doesn’t seem to think the president, who lies openly and often, has a similar credibility problem. Meyers disagrees: “He’s a liar whose lawyer is lying about his lying lawyer’s lies. This whole story is like a Dr. Seuss book called The Lie-ax.” In trying to get ahead of whatever information Cohen has on Trump, Giuliani seems to have forgotten that just a few months ago he literally called Cohen “honest” and “honorable.” (Not to mention that just weeks ago he said that he didn’t expect Cohen to lie.) “Oh my god,” said Meyers. “You don’t need to secretly tape these guys to catch them in a lie.

"USA TODAY, Nicquel Terry Ellis, USA TODAY","SMITHS STATION, Ala. Kim Serda didnt think she would make it out alive.
As she took cover in a bedroom closet with her two dogs, Serda could feel the pressure building up around her.
Suddenly, Serda said she heard the back window of the room blow out. Then, the attic access door in the closet blew off causing Serdas entire body to be lifted and nearly sucked out.

I thought I was gone, said Serda, as she sat at her kitchen table, just a few steps away from the tree that had fallen through the ceiling of her living room.
The Serdas are among 24 families in Smiths Station, Ala. left homeless after the deadly tornado that swept through Lee County on Sunday.
The twister is being blamed for at least 23 deaths
On Monday, residents near Lee County Road 294 in Smiths Station were outside assessing the damage as contractors cleaned up debris.
Yards were littered with tree branches, roof shingles, vinyl siding from homes and glass bottles. Dozens of trees were uprooted, including one that smashed a mobile home.
The nearby West Smiths Station Elementary School was also damaged. Parts of the schools roof had blown into a neighbors yard and the playground was mostly destroyed.
Volunteers were organizing clean-up efforts Monday for this small, rural and tight-nit community.
The Serdas said their home is a complete loss and they will have to rebuild.
As long as we are safe, thats all that really matters, said Roberto Serda, who was hit with a piece of a storm door as he tried to grab the couple's third dog during the storm. ""We didn't have any damage to us, it was just material things."" 
Some residents didnt suffer as much property damage but said Monday they were still shaken up.
Ferson Luke, who lives next door to the Serdas, said he was in the kitchen with his granddaughter Sunday when he heard a loud noise that sounded like a train. He looked outside and saw power lines falling and trees blowing.
It happened so fast I didnt have time to take cover, Luke said. I wasnt scared for my property, I was scared for my life.
Luke said he feels lucky  all he needs is a new roof and the debris in his yard picked up.

Earl Washington, who lives across from West Smiths Station Elementary, was raking up branches in his yard Monday.
Though Washington had a large uprooted tree on his property, he planned to spend his evening helping others who were hit harder.
When I saw this I was like wow, said Luke. But when I went over behind the school, my heart dropped. They need help over there.

Maddy Myers,"Jeff Kornberg’s YouTube channel, The Dragon’s Tomb, does not stand out from the throng of other channels hosting tutorials for board games. Like his peers, Kornberg explains the rules in a slow, gentle voice with frequent cutaways to each game’s pieces, cards, and setup. The difference between Kornberg’s channel and the others is that every single one of his tutorials is completely fake. Kornberg’s channel kicked off two months ago with a tutorial for Settlers of Catan, in which Kornberg explained that “gameplay is focused around an eccentric billionaire named Mr. Catan who wants to build a tower.” Players use the resource tiles to construct Mr. Catan’s tower, each competing to be the one to place the “tower hat” (the final tile) on top of the completed structure. Except, uh, those aren’t the rules to Settlers of Catan. But maybe they should be? Since the initial Settlers video, Kornberg has released five other tutorials for well-known party games, such as Twister and Ticket To Ride. Twister, of course, requires one player to use the “spinner of devastation” to determine when the tornado chasers (the other players) will lose each of their limbs over the course of their quest to find the location of an F5 tornado. Ticket To Ride, as we all know, encourages players to take on the roles of waste collectors picking up trash from the plastic train cars—err, dumpsters—strewn all over the streets of North America. Some of the videos work better than others. Kornberg’s redesign for Codenames has a transmisogynistic premise (players’ teams get brainwashed by the government into becoming women, at which point they lose), but the host concludes the video by lampshading it all, deadpanning to the camera that “whoever came up with the concept for this game should really be ashamed of themselves.” One of the commenters pipes up that players could make their own remix on Kornberg’s version by switching the gender cards according to their preference, at which point Kornberg responds in character to advise the commenter against changing board game rules. We can’t have that. It would be madness! In every video, Kornberg wears the same bright blue T-shirt that reads “Cards. Deal With It.” He concludes every review with the same overused platitude: “All in all, this game is a blast to play.” The channel’s title and logo, The Dragon’s Tomb, are so mundane and forgettable that it took me weeks after first seeing the Settlers of Catan tutorial video to even find the channel again. (Searching for “mr. catan dragon’s cave” did the trick.) The channel’s unassuming appearance allows it to disguise itself in the related sidebar alongside reams of earnest board game tutorials. It’s much funnier if you watch it without knowing what you’re getting into, but after a week of laughing at all of these by myself, I just didn’t want to leave this hidden gem buried anymore. I hope he does Monopoly next. I’ve always wanted to know how to play it.","Jeff Kornberg’s YouTube channel, The Dragon’s Tomb, does not stand out from the throng of other channels hosting tutorials for board games.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26. And for good reason: Fire tornados are among the rarest weather phenomena on Earth, and this vortex had the added distinction of possibly being the strongest tornado-like thing in California’s history. But more interesting than what we know about the wild-sounding event is what we don’t. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther there have been references to fire tornados since the 19th century, but only one other such event has been well-documented to date. Consequently, we have only a basic understanding of how and why fire tornadoes form. We know a lot more about their garden-variety cousins, fire whirls, which form by the dozens on wildfire fronts. (A rather spectacular one was captured by firefighters battling a blaze near Derbyshire, England on Tuesday.) Similar to dust devils, these whirls develop when turbulent, rotating air gets stretched vertically by an updraft. They only last a few minutes, and top out at about 150 feet in height, according to Weather Underground meteorologist and blogger Bob Henson, who penned a detailed explainer about the recent fire vortex. “They’re basically wind shear that gets tilted up,” Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, told Earther. A fire tornado shares some features with a fire whirl but quite literally takes things to new heights. These rotating columns of air are, by definition, connected both to a cloud system above and the ground below. So-called pyrocumulous clouds (and pyrocumulonimbus thunderclouds) form as hot air rises above a wildfire’s smoke plume, cools, and condenses, creating the potential for a tornado to form. But these clouds typically only emerge at high altitudes due to the intense heat of the flames. What that means is that any vortex connected to both a fire-generated cloud system and the ground is going to be big. According to Clements, the one that formed inside the Carr Fire on the evening of July 26 was associated with a pyrocumulonimbus system that extended tens of thousands of feet up into the stratosphere. Exactly how the tornado-like vortex spun up is still being worked out, and we may never be totally sure. University of Nevada Reno atmospheric scientist Neil Lareau put together an analysis based on Doppler radar data that suggests it formed like a landspout tornado, with an area of horizontal wind shear near the ground getting stretched vertically by a powerful updraft, and eventually connecting with the cloud system above. Others have described the firenado’s formation as similar to that of a more powerful supercell tornado, which are generated by rotating updrafts within thunderstorms. Henson told Earther he thought the vortex could have had elements of both supercell and landspout tornado. “This is definitely about as strong as you’d expect a landspout-type tornado to get,” Henson said. “That’s why it feels like a hybrid to me.” Either way, the vortex was a beast. A preliminary analysis by National Weather Service and CalFire estimated maximum wind-speeds in excess of 143 mph, making it the equivalent of an EF-3 on an intensity scale of 0-5. The twister lasted over an hour, toppling power lines and uprooting trees. To some, the freak event felt like an harbinger of a hotter, more dangerous future. But while climate change is having a clear impact on fire season, connections to rare fire tornado events are more tenuous. As Clements put it, “if it was just climate and fuel driving tornados, every fire would have a tornado.” He suspects that fire tornados come from some combination of loads of vegetation fuel—which generates the intense heat needed to create powerful updrafts—and the right topography. In the case of the very large, very intense Carr Fire (which is still only about 50 percent contained ), air flows racing through gaps in the mountains near Redding in the late afternoon on July 26 might have provided the necessary wind shear to set things off. Clearly, there are a lot of unanswered questions. But future research could help fill in the gaps. Clements’ group uses a mobile weather lab —a 4x4 pickup truck outfitted with a scanning Doppler LIDAR instrument, weather balloon sounding system, and a portable meteorological station—to study fire weather up close. The system has revealed never-before-seen structures inside wildfire plumes and offered insight how pyrocumulous clouds form. And it’s getting an upgrade this fall, with the addition of a Doppler radar-equipped pickup truck that will allow them to detect plumes from farther away and at a higher resolution. But what exactly spawned the Carr Fire’s epic display last month could be an enduring mystery. Clements lamented that by the time his team got to the scene several days later, they were only able to snap photographs. “If we were there [during the tornado], wow,” he said. “That would be a dataset for a lifetime.”","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26.

Emily Petsko,"Thousands of people in Sweden have opted to trade in their plastic credit cards for tiny microchips implanted underneath their skin, Lund University digital culture lecturer Moa Petersén writes in Quartz. The chips, which use near-field communication (NFC) technology, stand in place of credit cards, key cards, and rail cards—and future applications of this technology are likely to be developed as it gains popularity. The chips are typically the size of a grain of rice and are implanted just under the skin between the thumb and forefinger. While they're commonly used in pets, some critics say any human application of the technology starts to cross over into dystopian territory. So why have they caught on in Sweden? Some suggest that Sweden's strong social welfare programs have made Swedes too trusting of their government—a view Petersén disagrees with. ""The factors behind why roughly 3500 Swedes have had microchips implanted in them are more complex than you might expect,"" she writes, noting that the country fosters a highly technological society. Skype and Spotify were both founded in Sweden, and its citizens tend to place a lot of faith in the latest technologies. The country also has a thriving biohacking scene that promotes bio-digital experimentation. A video by Dezeen shows passengers on Sweden’s SJ Railways, who have had microchips containing their membership number implanted under their skin, simply holding up their hands for the ticket collector to scan. This trend isn’t just happening in Sweden. Thousands of Germans have gotten microchip implants in recent years, including one man whose microchip contained a link to his last will and testament. In Australia, a technology festival called Pause Fest attracted media attention for giving VIP guests injectable microchips that would grant them access to all areas of the festival, while also unlocking special digital features and allowing them to exchange business cards with ease. And in the U.S., a software company in Wisconsin announced last year it would give its employees the option of getting microchip implants that could be used to unlock doors, log into their computers, and even purchase vending machine snacks. As for whether microchip implants will go mainstream in the U.S., only time will tell.

Devin Coldewey,"Updating the federal government’s digital infrastructure seems like a Herculean task akin to cleaning out the Augean stables. Where do you even start shoveling? Former Googler and current head of the U.S. Digital Service Matt Cutts says it’s not quite that hard but he’s had to leave his Silicon Valley startup outlook at the door.
“In the Valley and San Francisco, they’re geared to move fast and break things. And that’s fantastic to explore a space,” Cutts told me in an interview. “But the government has to move purposefully and fix things. It’s more about finding the right decision, achieving consensus, creating good communication.”
The USDS is a small (and actively recruiting) department that takes on creaking interfaces and tangled databases of services for, say, veteran benefit management or immigration documentation, buffing them to a shiny finish that may save their users months of literal paperwork.
Some notes from the USDS’s work on modernizing the Medicare payment system.
Recently, for instance, the USDS overhauled VA.gov, which is how many veterans access things like benefits, make medical appointments, and so on. But until recently it was kind of a mess of interconnected sub-sites and instructional PDFs. USDS interviewed a couple thousand vets and remade the site with a single login, putting the most-used services right on the front page. Seems obvious, but the inertia of these systems is considerable.
“Oftentimes we build a front end and it still talks to an abysmal, or maybe antiquarian, system in the back end,” Cutts said. “VA.gov required a special version of Internet Explorer!”
There are always paper alternatives, but those can be so slow and clunky that they might take three or four months to complete, and can be so complex that people will hire a lawyer to do them rather than risk further delay. These are ostensibly free and open services available to all vets but they weren’t in practice. And there were accessibility problems all over the place, Cutts noted, which is especially troubling with a disability-heavy population like veterans.
These projects are often short-term, putting modern web and backend standards to work and handing the results off to the agency or department that requested it. The USDS isn’t built for long-term support but acts as a strike team putting smart solutions in place that may seem obvious in startup culture but haven’t yet become standard operating procedure in the capitol.
The work they do is guided by impact, not politics, which is likely part of the reason they’ve managed to avoid interference by the Trump administration, which has treated many other Obama-era initiatives like pests to be exterminated. Yet the nature of the work is in a way fundamentally progressive, in that it is about bottom-up accessibility and helping under-represented or unprivileged groups.
For instance, they’ve been hard at work on immigration issues that would expedite both asylum seekers and seasonal farm workers at the Mexican border. That’s a political live wire right now, even if the decision to do it was strictly based on helping a large population frustrated by outdated digital tools.
The new farmers.gov, built for the Department of Agriculture, vastly streamlines the H-2A visa application process, centralizing documentation and services that were previously spread across several other major departments and websites. That’s unarguably a good thing, but like anything relating to immigration and foreign labor it is possible it could get swept up in the partisan twister. Fortunately that doesn’t seem to have happened.
The new, improved and simplified farmers.gov provides app integration and straightforward design.
“The fact is we get good support,” Cutts said when I asked him about the current political environment. It may not be loud in that support, but quiet actions like appointing former USDS officials and engineers to important roles within administration are common, he said.
There are plenty of other programs looking to modernize federal as well as state systems, he pointed out; it’s a rising tide and it’s lifting a lot of boats.
“I signed up for a three month tour, and that was three years ago,” he said. “It’s really a whole civic tech movement here, there are a ton of people sort of holding hands and working together. There’s also stuff happening at the state and local level, at the international level, from the UK to Estonia and Singapore everyone’s starting to realize this matters.”
Recruitment, however, is more difficult than he’d like, perhaps partly because of self-imposed hiring practices made to reflect the diversity of the country.
“We get the best results when we represent all of America,” said Cutts. “So I go to Microsoft and Ann Arbor, regular events, but also like, Lesbians Who Tech or Grace Hopper Fest.”
Still, startups and big tech companies regularly poach talent or otherwise lure them away. “They’re just better at recruiting,” he said. And there’s some kind of fundamental disconnect at work, too, perhaps the comfortable contempt many young people have for the government but he suggested that those seeking to do good might want to do a more serious evaluation of the tech landscape.
“I joined Google because I wanted to make the world a better place,” he said. “But if you look at the #metoo movement, how the tech industry has been acting lately… everyone at those companies has to ask that question, am I really having that impact?”
If you’re not sure, you might consider doing a tour at the USDS. They’re launching products and helping people just like startups aim to do, but they’re beholden to ordinary citizens in need, not investors. That sounds like a step up to me.",Updating the federal government's digital infrastructure seems like a Herculean task akin to cleaning out the Augean stables. Where do you even start shoveling?

Associated Press,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 93. One family lost seven members.
The 23 people killed in the nation’s deadliest tornado in nearly six years came into focus Tuesday when the coroner finished identifying them and released their names.
“Just keep those families in your prayers,” Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster. “It’s a tragic situation.”
The search for victims in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continued, with crews using heavy equipment to lift large chunks of wreckage. But Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of missing people had shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
“We are still conducting some searches, sifting through piles of debris where there may be people or animals,” said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather. “We haven’t given up hope.”
The dead included 53-year-old David Wayne Dean, whose body was found in a neighbor’s yard after the twister demolished his mobile home Sunday afternoon. He was known as “Roaddog” for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
“Our son found him,” his widow, Carol Dean, said between sobs. “He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.”
After the tornado passed, she rushed home from work at Walmart and pushed past sheriff’s deputies to be with husband one last time. Picking through the ruins of their home, she found her wedding dress and a Father’s Day note to her husband that read, “Daddy, I love you to pieces.”
The tornado was an EF4 packing winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and chewed a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama for nearly 27 miles (43 kilometers), the National Weather Service said. Ninety people were injured, it said.
Around Beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where the pines were snapped in half.
Law enforcement teams searching for victims used dogs and heat-detecting drones.
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
Government teams surveying storm damage confirmed Tuesday that at least 18 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina alone.

Gina Martinez,"A Wyoming resident captured some amazing images of a tornado touching down in the plains Wednesday. The National Weather Service office in Cheyenne tweeted out a warning to residents asking them to take shelter. “Tornado north of Laramie is still on the ground. As picturesque as it may look, we ask that you take shelter now. No picture is worth getting hurt.” the tweet read. But that’s didn’t stop Aaron Voos from shooting breathtaking photos of the tornado on his phone, a Kyocera E6810 Duraforce Pro, as he was driving home. “I am not normally a storm chaser,” Voos told TIME. “We live 7,200 feet over sea level so tornados are very rare. We see a lot of storms and lightning but never a tornado like that, thats for sure. Hopefully it’s the first and the last.” The tornado touched down near Laramie, Wyoming just before 5 p.m. and was on the ground for 45 minutes, according to the National Weather Service. Voos said the storm was far enough from his house that his wife and older son were able to leave instead of hunkering down. He said most neighbors did the same. Despite the warning, the National Weather Service in Cheyenne posted several pictures and videos from resident who captured shots of the twister. According to the Albany County Sheriffs Office, the tornado caused minimal damage to some structures, power poles, power lines, and fencing. There were no injures reported.","“I am not normally a storm chaser,” Aaron Voos said",2018-06-07T19:25:33Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",This Guy Snapped Some Spectacular Pictures of a Tornado in Wyoming (With His Phone!),http://time.com/5304766/wyoming-tornado-photos/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/wyoming-tornado.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,twister,1
AP,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Fathers Day note to her husband reading, Daddy, I love you to pieces. But the storm took the 53-year-old husband and father.
Dean was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband was home in Beauregard. As forecasters warned stormy weather was heading toward the Alabama-Georgia line, she said, David Wayne Dean sent a text message cautioning a friend to keep up with the weather on the news.
Then the storm hit and David Dean didnt make it out. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbors yard.
Our son found him, Dean said between sobs Monday. He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.
The tornado that struck the area where the Deans lived packed winds estimated at 170 mph and chewed a path of destruction nearly a mile wide. Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half.
On Monday, the storms toll stood at 23 people dead in this rural community in Lee County. According to the sheriff, dozens remained missing after the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years. Rescue crews using dogs and drones searched for victims amid splintered lumber and twisted metal.
Im not going to be surprised if we dont come up with some more deceased. Hopefully we wont, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris told a news conference. He said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academys Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.
An unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, Beauregard is in the same county as Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway.
On the day after the disaster, volunteers used chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers. Neighbors and friends helped one another sift among the ruins.
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the remnants of Morrisons home, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage the couples safe, her husbands motorcycle boots and her embossed Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub her husband jumping in at the last minute as the twister lifted their house off its foundation and swept it into the woods.
We knew we were flying because it picked the house up, Morrison said, figuring that the showers fiberglass enclosure helped them survive.
The National Weather Service said one and possibly two tornadoes struck the area. A powerful EF-4 twister was blamed for most of the destruction on a path about 24 miles long, meteorologist Chris Darden said. Darden said the monster tornado was the deadliest twister to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF-5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground, Sheriff Jay Jones said. Most of the fatalities occurred with a square-mile area, he said.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was pretty sure tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings. But authorities were busy with the search-and-rescue and had not yet looked into the question.
The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
An early March tornado outbreak in the Alabama-Mississippi area is not unusual, tornado experts said.
The weather services Storm Prediction Center posted forecasts for higher tornado activity in the region Thursday, three days before the disaster. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters were all over it.
An EF-5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people. And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama.
For Beauregard, days of mourning lies ahead. The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.
After the storm, Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to her husband, a man others called Roaddog for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriffs deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husbands body lay.
They took me down to him, Dean said, and I got to spend a little time with him before they took him away.

Melissa Chan,"A 10-year-old girl who died Sunday after a powerful tornado slashed through a tight-knit community in rural Alabama was remembered by friends and family members as a “little, precious, happy child” whose life was taken too soon.
Taylor Thornton was one of at least 23 people killed in Lee County, Ala. after at least one twister with estimated 170 mph winds injured dozens of people, destroyed homes, tore down trees and utility poles and separated several families, authorities said. The tornado, which touched down around 2:20 p.m. local time, was the deadliest in the U.S. in nearly six years, National Weather Service officials said.
Among the fatalities were at least three children, aged 6, 9 and 10, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris tells TIME. On Monday, family and school officials confirmed one of them was Taylor, a fourth-grader who easily made friends wherever she went.
Taylor loved her 10-month-old brother almost as much as she loved animals, especially horses, said Stan Cox, head of the Lee-Scott Academy, a private Christian school in Auburn, Ala., where Taylor attended. Cox added that the young student “always had a smile on her face.” Recently, she took home an honorable mention at the school’s art show for a clay fish sculpture she made.
“She loved learning. She was inquisitive—always had something to contribute to the lesson,” Cox said. “She just brought a lot of life into the classroom. Our school feels empty without her now.”
Taylor’s uncle, James Thornton, tells TIME that “she loved her family and she loved God.” “That’s what we’re asking the world to remember her for,” her uncle said.
In January, Taylor had just started attending the new school. But in just three months, she had made multiple friends—some of whom quickly grew close to her, according Cox.
“She didn’t miss a beat,” Cox said. “She came right in and made friends very easily.”
Several people are still unaccounted for and rescue efforts to find survivors and the missing were underway Monday but appeared grim. Lee County, Ala. Sheriff Jay Jones said at a news conference Monday morning that he anticipated that the death toll would rise. “This is a very trying time,” he said. “I have not seen this type of level of destruction ever.”
Officials have not yet released the victim’s identities but planned to later Monday evening. The youngest victim was 6, and the oldest victims were in their 90s, the coroner said.
“Some were pretty close to being whole families,” he said.
The roughly 24-mile-long storm wreaked havoc on anything in its path, while moving at about a mile per minute, officials said. “It looks almost as if someone took a giant knife and just scraped the ground,” Sheriff Jones said, describing what he called “catastrophic” damages from the storm. “It hurts my heart to see this.”
It is thought to have been the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when a twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma, according to Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center.
As of Monday evening, Bunting said it was still unclear whether two tornadoes had hit Alabama.

"USA TODAY, Trevor Hughes and Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","The tornado that ripped through parts of Alabama was the deadliest in the U.S. since May 2013, when a tornado killed 24 people in Oklahoma.
 Wochit, USA TODAY
BEAUREGARD, Ala.  Lee County authorities on Tuesday morning will release the names of the 23 people killed when a tornado tore through the rural area Sunday shredding homes, trees and power lines.
County coroner Bill Harris on Monday night said he expected the death toll to be higher, based on the devastation. The twister packing 170-mph winds cut a mile-long swath through the area.
""I can't believe it,"" Harris said Monday. ""I thought we'd see more.""
The victims ranged in age from a nine-year-old boy who died at a hospital from his injuries, to a woman in her 90s who died near her home. The storm also killed an entire family of three and a family of four. Most of the victims suffered extensive blunt-force trauma, Harris said, and many were sucked out of their homes.
Sunday's tornado was the deadliest twister since 2013, when 25 people were killed in Oklahoma.
Last SlideNext Slide
About 10,000 people live in the Beauregard community, which is about 60 miles east of Montgomery and has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department along the main highway. 
Everybody in Beauregard is a real close-knit family, said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. Everybody knows everybody around here. Everybody is heartbroken.
Steve Whatley's wife, daughter and mother-in-law, Vicki Braswell, hunkered under a mattress in their mobile home as the tornado sucked their home into the air. Whatley said his mother-in-law died when the mobile home collapsed. 
We heard it coming but by the time we knew what it was, it hit us. Thats when all hell broke loose, said Whatley, 36. It picked us up and dumped us back down 50 feet away. Watleys wife was still hospitalized Monday with multiple injuries.

Of the injured, Harris said two people remained in intensive care. The coroner called in help from the state to assist his staff of four with body recovery, identification and cause of death.
He then sat with the families for about four hours on Monday, formalizing IDs and explaining how their loved ones died.  
""I thought I could handle this but I found out right quick it was beyond my scope,"" Harris, 64, said Monday night as a stream of hearses and minivans collected the bodies for transport to funeral homes.

Patrick Allan,"You’re probably aware the U.S. has a missile defense system, and the thought alone makes you feel (relatively) safe and cozy here in the states. But do you know how these systems work? Or how effective they are? They’re not the impenetrable shield you think they are. North Korea always seems to be in the news right now thanks to their aggressive threats and missile … Read more Read North Korea recently tested another missile, which has experts convinced the entire U.S. mainland is now range of their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), assuming the missile carries a light payload. That’s drawing more spotlight to the U.S.’s missile defense systems and whether or not they actually work. After an alleged failed defense attempt in Saudi Arabia with a U.S. supplied Patriot missile system, people are starting to wonder “Are we safe?” But before we get into how effective these things are, let’s talk about how they work. How Missile Defense Systems Work via NATO The basic functions of a missile defense system are simple—you use ballistic missiles to shoot down other missiles—but there’s a lot going on during this process. Here’s a play-by-play of how midcourse missile defense systems—like the U.S. Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System (GMD) and the U.S. Navy’s SM-3 Aegis BMD system—are supposed to stop an incoming ICBM similar to what North Korea recently tested: The threat missile is launched. Satellites using infrared technology and radar detect the launch and track the missile’s trajectory. Threat missile releases a warhead and decoys (known as the “threat cloud”). Ground-based and sea-based radar continuously track the threat cloud, trying to identify the warhead (where the payload is). The missile defense system launches an interceptor missile. The interceptor’s payload, the “kill vehicle,” separates from the missile body. The kill vehicle spots the threat cloud and attempts to intercept high above in the atmosphere. If everything goes according to plan, the threat payload is destroyed in space before it can reach its target below. via Fox News These systems differ, however, from the Patriot, Arrow, and Iron Dome terminal-phase within-the-atmosphere missile defense systems (talk about a tongue twister). These systems work in a similar fashion, using radar and atmospheric guidance for tracking, but are only designed to intercept short and medium range missiles that move at much slower speeds and lower altitudes than ICBMs. They only cover areas tens of kilometers in size, so they’re nice to have on hand as a backup to midcourse systems, but they’re probably more useful in areas like South Korea and Japan than here in the states (assuming the launch comes from North Korea). The U.S. Army’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is classified as terminal-phase system, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve. It works more like a midcourse system, and can destroy targets via direct collision in the upper atmosphere or above. Check the news and you’re guaranteed to hear to about conflict in some part of the world. But… Read more Read Okay, So How Effective Are They? Successful GMD test, May 2017, via AiirSourceMilitary When it comes to midcourse ICBM defense, we have no idea. Maybe they’ll work, maybe they won’t. Why? As George N. Lewis, a physicist and senior research associate at the Judith Reppy Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies at Cornell University, explains in his paper “Ballistic Missile Defense Effectiveness,” there is no real-world experience with the use of midcourse ballistic missile defenses. Our GMD systems have been tested, of course, and been successful, but current midcourse defense intercept tests are few and far between, and tend to be a highly-scripted demonstration that reflect more on the reliability of these systems and not their actual effectiveness in a real-world scenario. You see, attacking enemies are likely to employ “countermeasures” when firing a missile. These countermeasures include mechanisms, like decoys or a cooling shroud, designed to confused or disrupt the defense system so it fails. We don’t test our defense systems with these in mind, even though the technology to develop such countermeasures is widely known. Our GMD system is highly effective at detecting missile launches and tracking multiple targets at long ranges, but it is not great at knowing which objects are warheads and which are decoys. The system’s primary discrimination sensor in Honolulu, Sea-Based X-band (SBX) radar, has significant operational limitations. That said, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences book Making Sense of Ballistic Missile Defense suggests that countermeasures that are theoretically possible are not always easy to deploy, citing the U.S. and U.K.’s own experience attempting to develop such penetration aids during the Cold War. There’s also a good chance such countermeasures would reduce a missile’s payload, range, or reliability. Nevertheless, while our GMD defense system is theoretically capable of protecting all fifty states from an ICBM missile attack, it is still largely untested against real threats, and its test stats are not exactly comforting: As you can see, the GMD system succeeds only about half of the time, and it doesn’t seem to be improving. The Navy’s Aegis BMD systems fare better in their tests: Not only do they have higher success rates, but they’ve been tested both during the day and night; tested against short, medium, and intermediate range targets; tested against both intact missiles and separated warheads; and been tested against two simultaneous targets. But unfortunately, Lewis says their lower speed prevents them being able to cover enough territory to be useful as a defense here in the homeland. Next year, the U.S. hopes to deploy new SM-3 Block IIA interceptor missiles that may be able to get the job done ( though they also suffered a recent test failure in June ). On Sunday, North Korea detonated what they claimed to be a hydrogen bomb and the weapon test has… Read more Read So are we safe from a missile attack here in the U.S.? It’s hard to say, but we’re probably not as safe as you think. The U.S. military has a history of claiming success rates much higher than reality. During the Gulf War, the U.S. Army claimed a 96% success rate against Iraqi modified Scud missiles, then later reduced that claim to 61%. Further analysis from experts suggested the success rate was very low and possibly 0%. After the recent missile attack in Saudi Arabia, President Trump was quoted as saying : “Our system knocked the missile out of the air… That’s how good we are. Nobody makes what we make, and now we’re selling it all over the world.” But further evidence analysis suggests the Patriot missile system failed, and that the warhead nearly hit the airport it was targeting where people heard and witnessed an explosion. In regards to our home front GMD defense, Lewis points out that U.S. officials have overstated those success rates as well : Statements from U.S. officials suggest, however, that a system intended to counter nuclear-armed missiles could be considered effective if its predicted effectiveness is greater than about 90%. On June 16, 2009, just a week after Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told Congress that the current GMD NMD system was “fully adequate to protect us against a North Korean threat,” General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate committee that he assessed the effectiveness of the GMD system against a North Korean missile as “ninety percent, plus.” A year later, amid continuing statements by U.S. officials about their confidence in the effectiveness of the GMD system, MDA Director Lt. Gen. Patrick O’Reilly told the House Armed Services Committee that the probability that the system could counter a single ICBM launched by Iran “would be well over into the high nineties.” But here’s the rub: even if the GMD and Aegis BMD systems manage an 80% to 90% success rate down the road, that still might not be good enough. After all, a failure rate of 10% to 20% is not adequate against a small barrage of nuclear-armed missiles. As the U.S. has proven in the past, it just takes one to decimate an area. But to improve these defenses and even get that far would require a lot more testing (ideally real-scenario testing), and that requires more focus and money. These tests aren’t cheap— the recent test in May cost $244 million —but they’re necessary if we’re going to rely on these systems. Though, perhaps we’re better off trying to avoid any conflicts where we’d need such defenses to begin with.","You’re probably aware the U.S. has a missile defense system, and the thought alone makes you feel (relatively) safe and cozy here in the states.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","When your alarm clock goes off at 6 a.m. World Cup favorite Brazil is through to the knockout stage after a 2–0 win over Serbia, with national barometer Neymar turning in another understated but solid performance, which is to say: a few great touches, a corner-kick assist to the head of Thiago Silva, and a couple of big old dives. It’s been that latter part of Neymar’s game that has distinguished his minutes at the World Cup so far, and nobody knows it better than Brazilians, who have been teasing their superstar with jokes and memes about how often he falls. One line going around after Wednesday’s victory? Hoje eu vou beber até Neymar, or “Today I’m going to drink until Neymar.” Until I fall down. Another, after Brazilian coach Tite tumbled over celebrating Philippe Coutinho’s late winner against Costa Rica, was a jab at the country’s unelected and extremely unpopular president, Michael Temer, who has persisted in office despite being implicated in a bribery scheme. Neymar falls. Tite falls. How about Temer? One meme gave Neymar training wheels. Another had Neymar replacing Ben Franklin on the $100 bill. The dollar’s strength has hurt Brazil’s commodity exports and dampened foreign investment. Want to make the dollar fall? Put Neymar on the hundo. The most widely shared photo was a macro of Neymar in various throes of agony after the game against Switzerland, which lent itself to all kinds of gags, including “When the alarm clock goes off at 6 a.m.” and “Neymar plays Twister.” neymar jogando twister pic.twitter.com/7bcWTwjBU6 — 𝐛𝐚𝐫𝐛𝐨𝐬𝐚 𝐝𝐞 𝐚𝐛𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐚 (@georgemacedo) June 18, 2018 Buzzfeed Brazil ran a quiz, “Which falling Neymar are you?” Generally speaking, Neymar memes are a national pastime. Even his girlfriend, the telenovela star Bruna Marquezine, has said she loves memes of her boyfriend—and has special WhatsApp groups for just that purpose. When Brazilians mock Neymar’s diving, it’s a loving mockery. They also know that teams do tend to beat up on their superstar. And no one has forgotten what happened before Brazil’s 7–1 national disgrace at the hands of Germany in the 2014 World Cup semifinal: a nasty tackle from Colombia’s Zuniga fractured a vertebra in Neymar’s lower back, ending his tournament and leaving him unsure he would play soccer again. And so Brazilians manage to hold two ideas in their head about Neymar: He is both a football genius and a flopper. It’s an idea that might challenge the Manichean fandom of Americans whose allegiances and hatreds tend to be fanatical. (Some sporting heroes are complex! One man could be both a steroid user and the greatest hitter of all time.) And so when Neymar goes down, they look on with the worried eyes of Simba nudging the fallen Mufasa. A meme in the making is the best-case scenario.

Quentyn Kennemer,"Just Cause 4 is the first game in the series made solely for current generation consoles. That gave Avalanche the perfect excuse to juice their formula up with an exciting new gameplay engine that has the potential to change the expectations of what a physics engine should be. To understand what we mean, let your eyes scan the contents below. This is everything you need to know about Just Cause 4. What is Just Cause 4? Ever wanted a game where you could just blow stuff up in the wildest ways possible? Have you ever wanted to send a baddie sky high on the tip of a missile? Have you ever wanted to use a freaking tornado to destroy a militant mercenary base? That's what Just Cause 4 is. It's over-the-top, raunchy, violent, and fun. And Avalanche's winning formula is getting even better with some highly innovative additions. What's the story so far? If you happen to be in it for the story, Just Cause 4 has a little bit to offer you. You play as long-time series protagonist Rico Rodriguez, a fearless man who seems to have developed a knack for tearing things up. His latest musings take him to the fictional South American country of Solis, where a leader named Gabriella is mobilizing her Black Hand mercenary organization to take control of the country. Rodriguez wants to liberate the country from that damning fate. This wouldn't be the first time Rico has gone against Black Hand, but it is the first time he's gone to their home turf. They have a bit of a home-field advantage because of it, but you can bet he'll find a way to mitigate that. Expect the mercenary group to field a vicious army, including foes with deployable machine guns and even invisible stealth suits. We're sure you'll find some highly appropriate way to take care of them. An amazing weather engine With Just Cause 4, Avalanche saw fit to throw out their old engine to use an upgraded version of APEX. This engine boasts highly powerful physics rendering, and it's not just to simulate the effects of those wacky ragdoll animations we've come to love. It's to power the craziest weather system we've ever seen in a video game. Just Cause 4 has weather, and we're not talking about a slight drizzle of rain. There are tornadoes, blizzards, sandstorms, lightning storms, and more. And they are all backed by a more realistic wind engine that'll significantly change how you approach the game. Early gameplay demos show that a tornado is nothing to sneeze at. The massive twister can rip and roar through the environment and, in real time, rip pieces from structures, suck up and toss out debris, and other things tornadoes are infamous for. It can even pull an airplane in from the sky if it's close enough. The beauty of this being a real-time physics-based phenomenon is that there may be some cases where you can actually control said weather. In at least one mission, you do so by destroying wind machines that are designed to keep a tornado from being able to rip through specific areas. Black Hand uses these machines to keep their base safe, and Rico can destroy them to wreak a whole new type of havoc on his enemies. It's not quite the God hand you might have hoped for, but it's close enough. We're not sure how other types of storms will look or be handled, but if as much time were put into them as they were into tornadoes, we're in for a treat. Avalanche's developers supposedly spent tons of time studying wind and weather patterns, so much so that they might even be able to pass a crash course in meteorology. On the less crazy side of things, the weather system also shines in the form of diverse biomes. There are four biomes within the massive world of Solis, including jungle, planes, snow, and desert. Each of the biomes has two sub-biomes. We're not exactly sure how that'll be presented in the game just yet, but it sounds like there will be a great variety of conditions to behold as you make your way from one corner of the map to another. Classic Just Cause gameplay Despite the substantial changes to the game engine, this is still a Just Cause game at its core. That means this game is still all about finding creative, insane ways to kill your enemies, move across the map, and get into general nonsensical activities. So, yes, that means your parachute and wingsuit are still vital pieces of your kit. Things become a lot more dynamic, however, when you have to factor heavy winds into your base jumping equations. If you're not careful, you might even find yourself sucked in by one of those tornadoes. The grappling hook also returns, and it's getting a whole new suite of abilities to play around with. Mods allow you to change how certain things on your grappling hook works. The retractor ability, for instance, can be augmented by an electricity mod to make for an electrical blast when you make two objects collide. You can also use it to attach booster rockets and balloons to, well, whatever it is you want. And that naturally includes humans. Early gameplay demos have shown the ability to send a shipping container into the sky using balloons, and then blast it across the map by activating the thrusters on the booster rockets. Creative gamers will find no shortage of ways to bring destruction to Black Hand, though even the casuals will have the chance to make some noise thanks to an upgraded weapons system. You'll have a ton of different weapons to use in the game, and some of them now have alternate firing modes, attached grenade launchers, and more. Vehicles also remain a vital piece to the puzzle, and they're more important than ever before. Your best friend will be the Stormchaser, a yellow truck that can somehow withstand the pull of that twister we talked about earlier. But if you really wanted, you could choose to drive right into the tornado and launch your car into the air to pull off a stunt that's truly special. Other vehicles won't be so forgiving, so if you find yourself hopping into a jet, a hovercraft, or whatever else you want to use, make sure you aren't taking them straight into the belly of the storm (unless, of course, you really want to). Pre-order details Pre-order the standard Just Cause 4 to get the Day One Edition, which includes the Neon Racer Pack. You'll get neon versions of your Stormchaser, wingsuit, and parachute. See at Amazon The $89.99 Gold Edition is also available. With it, you'll get the Neon Racer Pack, plus the expansion pass that gives you access to all three expansion packs when they become available. There's also the Golden Gear Pack, which contains a golden shotgun that has a ricochet tracer ability, a golden parachute, and a golden wingsuit. You can even get your hands on some of Black Hand's weaponry, including the Stealth Micro JET that features retractable wings and stealth optic camouflage, as well as a wingsuit that improves your missile capabilities. Finally, you'll get to play the game one day early. See at Amazon When can you play it? Just Cause 4 launches December 4th, 2018 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","The death toll is expected to rise as authorities continue recovery efforts in Lee County, Alabama, after the deadliest tornado outbreak in years.
 USA TODAY
People in the path of the deadly tornado that ripped through Lee County, Alabama, had 8 to 9 minutes of warning before touchdown, according to Holly Allen, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service in Birmingham.
This is below the national average: Typically, the tornado warning lead time the time between when a warning is issued and when the tornado hits ground is about 14 minutes, the weather service has said. (The longer the lead time, the better, of course.)
On average in Alabama, theres about a 15 minute lead time for warnings, according to National Weather Service data.
This is a vast improvement since 1990, when the national lead time was 5 minutes. 
Though Sunday's tornado had an 8-9 minute lead time, the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, posted forecasts for higher possible tornado activity in the region on Thursday, three days before the killer twister struck.
Also that day, the weather service in Birmingham issued its first forecast about possible tornadoes on Sunday. 
At least 23 people were killed by a tornado in Alabama, near the Georgia line.

On Saturday afternoon, one day before the twister hit, both the weather service and the prediction center upgraded the risk for severe weather.
Finally, Sunday morning at 11:04 a.m. CST, about three hours before the tornado hit, the weather service issued a tornado watch for south-central Alabama, Allen said. Awatch means conditions are ripe for tornadoes to form.
The specific warning for the deadly tornado was issued at 1:58 p.m. CST. At about 2:06 to 2:07 pm CST, the tornado roared between Marvyn and Beauregard, Alabama, producing EF-4 (170-mph wind) damage and killing dozens of people.
University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd praised the warnings from the weather service and its prediction center, saying they were all over it in the days and hours before the storms.
As for tornado sirens in Lee County, there are still conflicting reports as to whether or not they sounded. More information about sirens will come in the days ahead.

Tuesday, December 18, 2018, 8:47 PM -A powerful tornado tore through a Seattle-area town on Tuesday afternoon, damaging homes and vehicles along its path.
The twister touched down just before 2 p.m. local time, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), raking through the Puget Sound community of Port Orchard, about 13 miles west of Seattle.
Images of significant damage to homes and trees in the area quickly started appearing on social media as well as via local news agencies. There are no reports of any injuries at this time.
(Related: Tornado safety tips)
The NWS will send a survey team on Wednesday morning to asses the damage and classify the intensity of the storm. ""Until we conduct a tornado survey tomorrow morning, we can not speculate on the strength of the tornado,"" the weather agency said via Twitter.
National Weather Service in Seattle can confirm that a tornado touched down near Port Orchard just before 2pm on December 18.

RARE STORM
While tornadoes occur in every month of the year in the United States, they aren't particularly common in the Pacific Northwest, and especially not in December. Washington averages only 2.5 tornadoes per year. If Tuesday's tornado is rated EF-2 or higher, it would become the first 'significant' tornado (those EF-2 or higher) in Washington state since 1986, and the first significant December tornado in the state since 1969. Even more unusual: if the storm is rated EF-2 (or higher), Washington state will match Texas for the number of EF-2 storms in December -- 1. Washington state has no EF-4 or EF-5 tornadoes on record. 
TORNADO TOUCHES DOWN NEAR SEATTLE
Within the affected area, trees are down and power lines are in the roadways. Please avoid the area. PUD is working to clear lines and restore power. 
No injuries have been reported so far, but we are continuing to contact residents. #PortOrchardTornadopic.twitter.com/wA6w84CTXF

Isobel Asher Hamilton,"Epic Games, the publisher behind the wildly popular battle-royale game ""Fortnite,"" suspended its pre-roll advertising on YouTube after its ads were being featured on suggestive videos of young girls, Wired reports. 
 A video by YouTuber Matt Watson recently pointed out that YouTube's algorithm was prompting users down a ""wormhole"" of inappropriate content showing young girls. 
 He said the algorithm continually directs users towards similar videos, which had racked up hundreds of thousands of or even over a million views and seemingly amassed an audience of pedophiles. 
 Wired conducted its own investigation into the videos, which included girls doing gymnastics, playing Twister, and playing in pools. It found some of the videos had millions of views. 
 Comments underneath the videos seemed to show a ring of people congregating, often leaving timestamps marking moments in the videos where the childrens' exposed genitals or nipples can be seen. 
 Wired found that they sometimes exchanged WhatsApp or Kik details, promising to send each other more videos. It said it looked like a ""network of pedophiles is hiding in plain sight.""

 Watson originally pointed out that some of these videos were being monetized, and featured adverts from major brands including Disney. Wired found pre-roll adverts for Alfa Romeo, Fiat, ""Fortnite,"" Grammarly, L'Oreal, Maybelline, Metro: Exodus, Peloton and SingleMuslims.com. 
 A spokesperson for Epic Games told Wired that it had suspended all pre-roll advertising on YouTube. ""Through our advertising agency, we have reached out to YouTube to determine actions they'll take to eliminate this type of content from their service,"" they added. 
 When contacted by Business Insider, a YouTube spokesman said: ""Any content — including comments — that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. 
 ""We took immediate action by deleting accounts and channels, reporting illegal activity to authorities and disabling violative comments. There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly."" 
 Epic Games was not immediately able to respond when contacted by Business Insider.

But alas, this is everyones problem nowthe 18-year-old third-overall pick out of Finland is only going to become more and more prominent as this season goes on. Kotkaniemiwhom we can maybe all just call The Eagle because thats what Kotka means in Finnish?wowed desperate Canadiens fans in preseason and then had a reasonably solid October, picking up four assists. But on Thursday, he got not just one, but his first two career NHL goals in a thrilling 6-4 home win against the Capitals, while playing on a brand new Finnish Connection line alongside Artturi Lehkonen and Joel Armia. The first goal opened the scoring on the night just two-and-a-half minutes into the game. Kotkaniemis known more for his intelligence and vision than his speed, and he doesnt turn on the jets here, but with space on the left side during a 3-on-2 attack, the kid executes perfectly when he gets the puck, coldly finishing a short side wrister past Braden Holtby. In the third, with time winding down and his team losing 4-3, Kotkaniemi took advantage of a defensive mistake from Dmitry Orlov, who turned it over behind his own net. Artturi Lehkonen did a good job of forcing the puck right in front of goal, and The Eagle was there to pounce on it, rising above the chaos for his second of the night. That goal tied the game at 4, and the Habs went on to seal their two points in dramatic fashion with two goals in two seconds in the final minute of the game. (Empty netters shouldnt count towards any record, but this was still kind of cool.) To the delight of the fans, who are enjoying a surprisingly fun 7-3-2 start from what looked to be a basement-dwelling Canadiens team, Kotkaniemi was the games first star. Hes already a (fan) favourite, said his coach, Claude Julien. I think everybody sees the talent that he has. I think they see the potential that he has. Right now, I can tell you hes never looked out of place since Day 1. Kotkaniemi hasnt quite taken over the league yet, but his promising start in this rookie season is beyond anything that could have been expected of a guy who was mostly seen as a long-term project on draft day. I dont think hes NHL ready right now, said Pierre McGuire after the Habs picked him.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","There were several reports of tornadoes (Red Ts) in central and southern Virginia on Monday, Sept.17, 2018. (Photo: Storm Prediction Center) Several tornadoes were reported Monday afternoon in central and southern Virginia, the Storm Prediction Center said, but there have been no reports of injuries or fatalities. Just west of Richmond, tornadoes damaged homes and toppled trees, the National Weather Service said. The Richmond Times-Dispatch said thousands of customers lost power in the Richmond metro area. Earlier on Monday, in Mecklenburg, near the border with North Carolina, at least one tornado touched down and damaged three properties. Although there were 10 reports of tornadoes Monday afternoon in Virginia, the Storm Prediction Center said, some of those could be duplicate reports of the same twister, so the final number won't be known right away. The tornadoes and severe weather were related to the decaying remnants of what's now Tropical Depression Florence, which continues to spin to the north after battering the Carolinas for days.

AP,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 89. Relatives said one extended family lost 10 members.
The 23 people killed in the nations deadliest tornado in nearly six years came into focus Tuesday with the release of their names by the coroner.
They included 6-year-old Armando Hernandez Jr., known as AJ, torn from his fathers arms two days after singing in his first-grade class musical; 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who loved horses and was visiting a friends home when the twister struck; and Jimmy Lee Jones, 89, who perished along with his wife of six decades, Mary Louise, and one of their sons.
Just keep those families in your prayers, Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster.
The search for victims, pets and belongings in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continued amid the din of beeping heavy machinery and whining chain saws. But Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of the missing had shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
Weve got piles of rubble that we are searching just to make sure, said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather Jr. We dont think well find nobody there, but we dont want to leave any stone unturned.
Four children were killed, ages 6, 8, 9 and 10.
The youngest, AJ, had taken shelter in a closet with his father and older brother when the tornado hit, said Jack Crisp, the boys uncle. The punishing winds tore the familys home apart, Crisp said, and pulled both boys from their fathers arms.
He had them squeezed tight, and he said when it came through, it just took them, Crisp said. It just demolished the house and took them.
The boys father and brother both survived. AJ did not.
Jackie Jones said she and her siblings rushed to her parents house after the storm passed and nobody answered the phone. They usually answer on the first ring, she said.
The siblings found the home reduced to its foundation. One of their two brothers who lived at the house survived and was taken to a hospital. But Jimmy Lee and Mary Louise Jones, married for more than 60 years, had died along with their 53-year-old son Emmanuel.
Those three deaths meant cousins Cordarrly and Demetria Jones lost their grandparents and an uncle. They said seven others killed were their cousins by blood and marriage.
Everybody in this area just about was related, said Demetria Jones, 28. Its devastating.
The body of David Wayne Dean, 53, was found by his son in a neighbors yard after the twister demolished his mobile home. He was known as Roaddog because of his love for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
He was done and gone before we got to him, said his sobbing widow, Carol Dean, who was at work at Walmart when the storm hit. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.
The tornado was an EF4 with winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and carved a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama, scraping up the earth in a phenomenon known as ground rowing, the National Weather Service said. It traveled a remarkable 70 miles or so through Alabama and Georgia, where it caused more damage.
Ninety people were injured in the Beauregard area, authorities said. Most have been released from the hospital.
President Donald Trump said he will visit Alabama on Friday to see the damage. Its been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done, he said at the White House.
Along the two-lane country road where some of the victims died, firefighters used heavy machinery to overturn pieces of houses that were blown into a gulley. A car sat atop the remains of one house. A red-brick foundation was all that was left at another lot.
The search took its toll around Beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia line. Church chaplain Ike Mathews walked down a road lined with broken trees and debris as he went to check on members of his congregation and emergency workers.
Yesterday I talked to some team members who had found bodies. Theyre hurting. The community is torn up. They started crying talking about it, said Mathews, an associate pastor at Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church.
Many of the people living in the area are senior citizens who moved to the country after retiring from textile mills or an old magnetic-tape manufacturing plant that closed years ago, Mathews said.
They start with a mobile home and hope they can build a house someday. They invest in their homes, and they have a sense of legacy. Its something to leave their kids and grandkids, he said.
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
Government teams surveying storm damage confirmed that at least 20 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
Cindy Sanford said one of her neighbors in Beauregard died in the storm, and another neighbor remained missing Tuesday.
I pray to God that they find her, Sanford said as picked through remains of her home, which tumbled in the wind and is now scattered across neighbors land.
Sanford said she left home with her 5-year-old grandson about five minutes before the storm struck after she got a feeling it was unsafe.
It was God, she said. And then I heard the siren.

ABC News,"Sandbags were holding back floodwaters in parts of Michigan as a storm system moved across several Midwest and Great Plains states on Wednesday, bringing heavy rain, snow and ice to the region. The weather has already been blamed for hundreds of car crashes and several fatalities, including the deaths of four people in a crash along a slippery interstate in Nebraska. Melting snow and heavy rain prompted the National Weather Service to issue flood warnings for parts of northern Illinois and northern Indiana, as well as southern Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Flood warnings also were issued for parts of Missouri and Texas. Flooded streets in Michigan stranded motorists and a school bus in Flint, while residents in Mattawan, in the southwestern part of the state, used sandbags to protect homes and businesses as the Mattawan Creek rose above its banks. ""We just got to wait for it to go down,"" Mattawan resident Terry Teeter, who installed pumps to keep water away from his house, told WOOD-TV. ""It's going to be a couple of days like this."" In Illinois, the fear of rising water along the Illinois River forced the evacuation late Tuesday of the LaSalle County Nursing Home in Ottawa. In Indiana, homes and streets were flooded in the South Bend area, and forecasters predicted the local St. Joseph River wouldn't crest until Thursday. Flood watches were issued for several states, while winter weather advisories were in effect Wednesday for an area stretching from southwestern Illinois to Texas, including parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansasm The weather stretched as far south as Arkansas, where strong winds toppled power lines and damaged some buildings late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Two days of rain in southern Wisconsin swelled waterways, prompting road closures. Police and firefighters rescued people from vehicles stranded in high water Tuesday at two sites in Janesville. In western Michigan, officials said a washout from heavy rains may have caused two engines from a freight train to derail near Grand Rapids. No injuries were reported. A 52-year-old woman from Bourbonnais, Illinois, was found dead Tuesday in a submerged car in Peotone, south of Chicago. The woman apparently lost control of her car on southbound Illinois Route 45 and ended up in a rain-filed ditch, Peotone Fire Protection District Deputy Chief Bruce Boyle said. In eastern Nebraska, speed and slippery pavement caused a crash between a pickup truck and a semitrailer Tuesday that killed four people on Interstate 80, police said. The three men and one woman killed were from Colorado, authorities said. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a 38-year-old woman died and two other people were injured in a collision on an icy highway late Monday. In Minnesota, state police said winter weather contributed to 400 crashes and 250 spinouts, including two fatal accidents. The storm system stretched to Texas, where weather service officials said three tornadoes hit. One struck early Tuesday in a rural area near Joshua, destroying at least two mobile homes and severely damaging several others. A mother and her disabled daughter were injured when one twister demolished their mobile home.","ABC News States face flooding, other problems in Midwest amid storms ABC News A mobile home is seen destroyed after a tornado struck an area outside Joshua, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Fort Worth, Texas, Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018.

Al Jazeera,"A powerful tornado that ripped through the Cuban capital leaving at least three people dead and 172 others injured.
The tornado, which hit Havana on Sunday, was classified as an EF4 with winds touching 300kph. It is the first tornado to hit the city in decades.
The twister uprooted trees, damaged buildings, cut power in poor areas and caused coastal flooding with heavy rains.
Regla, the worst-hit borough in Havana, bore the brunt of the impact.
Almost all the buildings were damaged to some degree. Locals were seen clearing debris and packing personal belongings to seek refuge with their relatives and friends.
Local resident, Francisco said it was the first disaster he saw in his life.
""It was like a science fiction or thriller, it's terrible. The strong wind blew away the front door and the roof. All these buildings were damaged in a flash. I fell down by the wind as it blew the door open and pushed me onto the wall. I still felt the pain.""
The local power sector sent workers to clear away fallen trees and erect utility poles with cranes in order to resume electricity as soon as possible.
""Now water carts have come and tents will be put up and food will be given out. Power supply will resume as electricians are repairing. The people are working together to solve this big problem,"" said Luis Villalobos, a local official.

Ted S. Warren/AP
The National Weather Service said on Wednesday a rare tornado that touched down near Seattle was the strongest to hit Washington state since 1986 and carried winds up to 130 mph.
The service gave the twister an EF-2 rating on the Fujita scale, indicating it caused considerable damage. It touched down about 15 miles west of Seattle, on the outskirts of Port Orchard, Wash., on Tuesday shortly before 2 p.m. local time, the weather service said. 
""It's very, very fortunate no one was injured and no one was killed,"" Logan Johnson, meteorologist in charge at the service's Seattle office, told NPR.
This is the strongest tornado to hit Washington state since 1986. #wawx

""One family narrowly escaped being injured by trees that actually were falling on the house after the tornado passed by,"" Logan told NPR, adding that several homes ""suffered pretty significant damage.""
Logan said he was part of a team that spent much of the day surveying the damage from what was the first tornado in Washington state this year. 
He said the weather service could not yet put a dollar amount on the damage. 
Emily Silverman told Seattle's KOMO-TV she got caught in the storm while in her car with her husband and 2-year-old son. 
""Our car back windows blew out, our side windows blew out,"" Silverman said. ""There were things flying everywhere. I thought I was a goner.""
Dana Stone first heard a loud pop. Then the power went out and a loud hum arose, she told The Seattle Times. 
""Her grill was flying about the backyard. The roof of her deck had been ripped off. Tables and chairs had been tossed away. Something crashed through her bedroom window,"" The Seattle Times reported. 
Stone called her neighborhood ""a disaster,"" but told the paper she and her neighbors came through the ordeal fine. 
Despite all the rain Washington gets, the state generally doesn't experience the kind of atmospheric instability that gives rise to tornadoes, meteorologist Jacob DeFlitch, who's also with the weather service in Seattle, told NPR.
How rare are tornadoes in Washington? On average, the state averages 2.5 tornadoes a year. December tornadoes are even more rare, averaging just 0.1 a year. #wawx

Washington averages about 2.5 tornadoes annually, with an average of only 0.1 occurring in December, according to weather service statistics. 
The storm was shallow, about 10,000 feet high, whereas big tornadoes in the Midwest are typically 50,000 feet. And it developed quickly, giving the weather service no time to issue a warning, DeFlitch said.","The Port Orchard twister was extremely rare, especially for December, says the National Weather Service.

Andrew Liszewski,"Before you go on a rant about the over-use of visual effects ruining the film and TV industries, watch this behind-the-scenes breakdown of HBO’s Big Little Lies. Computer graphics and digital compositing have actually become so prevalent as a filmmaking tool that your eyes probably don’t realize they’re being fooled 90 percent of the time. There are certainly a few films that seemingly only exist to serve as a demo reel for large visual effects studios; Twister, DragonHeart, and every single one of the Transformers movies come to mind. But you’ll be hard-pressed to find a single show on TV, even dramas like Big Little Lies, that don’t take advantage of modern VFX techniques in some way. As visual effects supervisor Marc Côté explains, shooting actors on a greenscreen, and then swapping out the background so it looks like they’re on an oceanside cafe in Monterey Bay, is not only cheaper than filming on location, it also ensures the weather never complicates things, and the sun never disappears behind a cloud. It also makes stuntwork a lot easier, and a lot safer, when you can dangle in front of a big green pillow, instead of the edge of a cliff.

Cecilia D'Anastasio,"In the category of “gross anime things,” let’s talk a little about an increasingly popular gross anime thing commonly referred to as “Really 700 years old.” That’s when a 700-year-old demon occupies the body of a prepubescent girl who, somehow, finds herself in a sexually compromising position. Yep. Historically, the trope has referred to otherworldly spirits like Koenma from Yu Yu Hakusho who, although he’s 700, looks like a toddler (complete with a pacifier). There’s also classics like the badass fighter Lady Kayura, whose hundreds-year-old lifespan isn’t apparent with her 12-year-old looks. It’s not always sexual. And it’s not always young girls. But lately, there’s been a lot of that, and oh man is it gross. Now, there are, for example, childlike goddesses who are literally referred to as “loli big boobs”—I see you, Is It Wrong To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?. I see what you did there. It still doesn’t fly. Nope. Here are some examples, all from 2017: UQ Holder (2017): There’s a 700-year-old vampire who appears 10. Moments after she’s introduced, the viewer sees up her skirt. Soon after, the viewer learns she’s acquired magic that increases her apparent age, and, of course, her cup size. Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid (2017): There’s a dragon girl who appears and behaves like an eight-year-old but, in truth, is very old. In one scene, she throws herself onto a classmate’s bed with her legs spread wide open. Then, they play Twister. (“It’s for kids,” the classmate points out.) The two—both in short skirts—tangle themselves together in a series of shots that hint strongly at a sexual connection. Afterward, the classmate is red and her heart is racing. Grimoire of Zero (2017): A very old witch appears to be a child. There’s sexual tension between herself and a mercenary tiger-man she travels with. The Silver Guardian (2017): The female love interest’s online game avatar is a childlike girl with large breasts, but maybe, she’s just drawn in the traditional “chibi” style. And some borderline stuff from this year, too: WorldEnd (2017): There’s a race of childlike leprechauns. At one point, the protagonist, who is surrounded by them, gives a 15-year-old fairy (who has been reincarnated) a pretty sensual back massage. The Seven Deadly Sins (2017): A 1,000 year-old child develops feelings for an adult man. Saga of Tanya the Evil (2017) : An 11-year-old mage who used to be a Tokyo salaryman leads armies into battle. She isn’t really sexualized, though. It’s in games, too. League of Legends recently introduced a flirty child champion named Zoe who is several thousand years old, although she couldn’t be considered sexualized. With every new anime season, I yell, Please, no, into the void, and the void just winks back and dishes out more of this crap. Among anime fans, it’s become part laughing-matter and part cringe-instigator. And now that we’ve established that this is not just a thing, but a thing that is happening quite often, I’m going to clear my Google search history, heave a big sigh and hold my breath when I wade through next season’s anime.","In the category of “gross anime things,” let’s talk a little about an increasingly popular gross anime thing commonly referred to as “Really 700 years old.” Read more...",2017-11-29T19:56:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kotaku.com'}","Come On, Anime",https://kotaku.com/come-on-anime-1820848313,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ACZmzd_Y--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/kaprfadz9rnvypesa2u9.png",,Kotaku.com,twister,1
Sam Rutherford,"Even though I know all these retro consoles are largely an effort turn my nostalgia into big-time corporate profits, theyre damn hard to resist. Theres just something about gray plastic and the old school boot up sound that hits a deep part of my brain as few things do, so when I heard Sony was making a retro revival of the original PlayStation, I thought Great, another mini console to add to the collection. But after getting to check out Sonys take on a throwback gaming machine, I feel a bit shortchanged. PlayStation Classic What is it? A mini retro console with 20 bundled games Like Comes with two controllers, solid build, controllers are USB Don't Like So many good PSX games are MIA, doesn't come with a power adapter, very few options or settings, controller cords are relatively short Before we get to the PS Classics scattershot list of bundled games, lets talk about its hardware. Like the NES and SNES Classic, the PlayStation Classic is a pint-sized version of the original from 1995 (or 94, if you lived in Japan) thats just under half the size, which makes it kinda cute. All the buttons on top are functional, though some have been repurposed due to changes made to the system itself like the CD tray being permanently shut. On the PS Classic, the Reset button is actually more of a home button that brings you back to the systems main list of games, while the Open button is there to switch between disks in games like Final Fantasy 7 that originally shipped on multiple CDs. Sadly, like the CD tray, the PS Classics memory card slots dont open either, though Sony does provide a virtual memory card so you can save your games on blocks just like you used to. But in what seems like a weird affront, the PlayStation Classic doesnt come with a power adapter. In the box, you get two controllers, an HDMI cable, and a micro USB cord, but youll still need a brick to plug into the wall. Luckily, the PS Classics power requirements are relatively minimal (Sony says you need 5V, 1A adapter), so itll work with pretty much any old smartphone power brick you might have lying around. But as one of the most expensive mini retro consoles at $100, not including one seems like a weird omission. The controllers, on the other hand, are probably the best part of the entire kit. While they feel a tiny bit lighter than their 20-year-old counterparts, theyre arguably even more solid, and the buttons have a nice tactile punch to them. Some people probably wish that Sony had gone with Dual Shock controllers instead of the vanilla models, which is fair, but the PS Classic does make up for that somewhat by including two controllers in the box. Also, as a nice bonus, since the controllers use cords with standard USB Type-A connectors, you can plug them into a PCwhere they show up as generic controllersand then easily configure them for use in Steam via Big Picture mode. So at the very least, the PlayStation Classics controllers could see extra lives when used to play other retro games on PC. OK, now back to the systems bundled games. (For a full list, scroll to the bottom or click here.) For the kind of library the PSX has, the PS Classics choice of games is pretty disappointing. The only way it makes sense to me is that Sony is treating this thing as a PlayStation origin story instead of a greatest hits collection (Or, you know, it couldnt secure the rights to better titles). While you do get some gems like Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid (which totally hold up), theres no Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Tomb Raider, or Crash Bandicoot to be found. Instead, you get titles such as Intelligent Qube and Jumping Flash which speak to the awkward birth of 3D graphics but dont quite hold your attention in 2018. Then are weird choices like the original Grand Theft Auto, which I tend to associate more with the PC, or (nearly unplayable) Twisted Metal, and Syphon Filter. These were all fine in their own time but have more engaging sequels that were also available on the original PSX. And when you look at the PS Classics 20 bundled games to the 21 titles available on the SNES classic, Sonys console is burdened with more throwaways or niche titles that wont hit with a lot of people, which is sad, because back in the day, the PSX had one of the biggest and deepest libraries ever. Another minor gripe is that unlike the SNES Classic, theres no option to add old-school scan lines to games or to cover up the unused portion of todays widescreen TVs with a PlayStation themed background. Even the PS Classics save state support is incredibly minimal. After youre done playing a game, you can back out by hitting the Reset button, at which point the system will automatically create a resume save so you can pick up where you left off. But thats it, theres only one save state you can resume from, and theres no rewind functionality like you get on the SNES Classic either. Still, thanks to the PS Classic, I was able to instill a new love for Mr. Driller in my girlfriend, and I am thankful for having a decent way to replay Wild Arms. But wheres Suikoden (Id take either one), Tony Hawks Pro Skater (again, you cant wrong with 1 or 2), my boy Parappa or Silent Hill ? Seriously, why Destruction Derby and not Gran Turismo 2 ? In the end, your ability to appreciate the PS Classic will boil down to three main things: What you think of its hit-or-miss game lineup, whatever mileage you can get out of classic PlayStation Controllers with USB cords, and how much money youre really willing to fork over for a smaller, cuter PSX body to display on a shelf somewhere. But if you step back a bit, between the PlayStation Classics general lack of extras, minimal save state functionality, and missing power brick, its hard to view Sonys retro console as much more than a minimum effort to capture some old-school gaming nostalgia. Sure, $100 isnt that much compared to modern consoles, but I still think the PSX deserves better than this. README The PS Classic doesnt come with a power brick, so hopefully, you have a spare smartphone charger you dont need anymore. There are almost no bonus features, and the save state system leaves a lot to be desired. The PS Classic comes with two controllers, and they even have USB ports so you can plug them into a PC. The 20 included games are very hit or miss. GAMES LIST Battle Arena Toshinden Cool Boarders 2 Destruction Derby Final Fantasy VII Grand Theft Auto Intelligent Qube Jumping Flash!

Gael Fashingbauer Cooper,"Although Carrie Fisher died in the final days of 2016, her untimely death at 60 still feels numbing and recent to many Star Wars fans, especially as Fisher appears on the big screen again in "" Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" Her death, quickly followed by that of her mother, singer and actress Debbie Reynolds, put a sad capper on 2016, a year so full of unexpected losses some on social media dubbed it "" the year of death."" But there are losses every year. While 2016 stands out because so many big names died -- Fisher, Prince and David Bowie among them -- 2017 brought its own share of devastating losses. We've focused only on those from the fields of sci-fi, superhero, fantasy and horror entertainment, as well as those in space and science. Here's a look back. Adam West's suave and charming ""Batman"" is a camp classic. Getty Images Batman forever One of the biggest names lost in 2017 was Adam West, who died in June at age 88, and is best known for his role as the most gentlemanly superhero ever to don cape and cowl. His 1960s Batman was courtly and confident, and the hero remembered as the Bright Knight will forever be the epitome of the character to many. Magical role For fans of the BBC's ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" based on James Herriot's popular books about life as a Yorkshire vet, Robert Hardy will forever be Herriot's cranky boss, Siegfried Farnon. But Harry Potter fans recall Hardy, who died in August at age 91, as Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the Potter films. (Fantasy and literature buffs should also know Hardy studied under C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien at Oxford -- now those are teachers to remember.) Bloody good Nelsan Ellis ' character Lafayette Reynolds on HBO's ""True Blood"" was killed off early in Charlaine Harris' book series. But Ellis made the character such a fan favorite that the show ignored the literature and kept him on as a regular. Ellis long struggled with substance abuse and died at just 39 in July. Moore. Roger Moore. Sir Roger Moore had the daunting task of following in Sean Connery's shaken-not-stirred footsteps as James Bond, and not only did it (seven times) but made the character his own. Moore, who died in May at age 89, was also an advocate for children's causes and a UNICEF goodwill ambassador. Stormy weather Bill Paxton 's resume is varied, with several of his movies, including "" Aliens,"" "" Apollo 13 "" and "" Twister,"" making the science-and-space film fan's list of favorites. Paxton was just 61 when he died in February, and he was honored that same month in a novel way. Storm spotters paid tribute to the actor who put their pastime on the map in ""Twister"" by spelling out his initials on a map of Tornado Alley. The doctor is in Some know Warren Frost as George Costanza's would-be father-in-law in ""Seinfeld,"" but it was another family connection that gave him fame with a supernatural twist. Frost's son Mark is co-creator of the mysterious ""Twin Peaks,"" and Warren Frost played physician Doc Hayward on that 1990s cult classic and its revival. The World War II D-Day veteran died at 91 in February. Richard Hatch as Captain Apollo in 1978's ""Battlestar Galactica."" Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET Always Apollo CNET's own Bonnie Burton remembers Richard Hatch of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame as a geeky and charming star who always made time for his fans. Those fans remember him as dashing Captain Apollo, nominated for a Golden Globe for his debonair and charming portrayal. Hatch, who discovered his own acting talents at one of history's saddest moments -- by sharing his emotions about the loss of John F. Kennedy -- died at age 71 in February. Bionic boss Richard Anderson 's character Oscar Goldman on ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman"" had no bionics of his own, but he still was granted his own action figure, complete with exploding briefcase. That tells you just a little bit about the respect Anderson earned. The best boss of the bionic era died at age 91 in August. Quirky and charming Harry Dean Stanton 's roles varied greatly, from Molly Ringwald's sad-sack dad in ""Pretty in Pink"" to doomed engineer Brett in the sci-fi-horror classic ""Alien"" to his part in the bizarre David Lynch movie universe. But his parts always had something in common: Fans were unable to forget the quirky, memorable roles he played, even if a more glamorous major character with a bigger part was casting a shadow over him. Stanton died in September at age 91. Being Bela Martin Landau won his Oscar for playing a dying Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's 1994 ""Ed Wood,"" but his other roles are myriad. From Woody Allen to Francis Ford Coppola to Alfred Hitchcock, Landau worked with everyone who was anyone in Hollywood. He was almost Mr. Spock on the original ""Star Trek,"" but opted for ""Mission: Impossible"" instead, earning Emmy nominations three years in a row. Landau died in July at age 89. 'I am a man' Acting is difficult enough without having to do it while buried under pounds of prosthetics. Yet Sir John Hurt managed to do just that in David Lynch's acclaimed ""The Elephant Man,"" winning a BAFTA award and a nomination for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for playing the physically deformed John Merrick. Hurt also won praise for his roles in ""Midnight Express,"" ""Alien"" and as wand maker Mr. Ollivander in the Harry Potter series. Hurt died in January at age 77 after a 50-year career. Eugene ""Gene"" Cernan was the 11th man to walk on the moon, as well as the last. NASA Last man on the moon Astronaut Gene Cernan was the second man to walk in space, and the last man (so far) to step foot on the moon. All in all, he spent 73 hours on the moon's surface, and as he departed that day in 1972, he expressed hopes humans would one day go back. ""We leave as we came, and, God willing, we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind,"" he said. Cernan died in January at age 82. King of the zombies George A. Romero 's ""Living Dead"" franchise brought moviegoers a whole new vision of zombies, and created a classic horror-movie monster that's still staggering today. The director had strong opinions on his creations too, saying, ""Zombies cannot run. Their ankles would snap. What did they do, go and join a spa the moment they rose from the dead?"" Romero died in July at age 77. Kindest man in horror Director Tobe Hooper remembers exactly why he made chainsaws terrifying. He was stuck in a crowded hardware store when he spotted the tool, and envisioned himself starting on up to clear his way through the mob. Later, ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was born, and it has since passed into horror-movie legend. Hooper also made televisions and swimming pools things of terror thanks to his acclaimed ""Poltergeist."" But the man himself was praised for his unfailing kindness. He died in August at age 74. Iconic and eclectic Jonathan Demme couldn't be pigeonholed. The director's most famous film was probably the chilling ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but you didn't have to appreciate that eerie story to be a fan of Demme's work. He also made ""Melvin and Howard,"" ""Stop Making Sense,"" ""Rachel Getting Married"" and ""Philadelphia,"" among other acclaimed movies. And ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" fans will always lovingly recall Demme's minor role as a victim of ""The Incredible Melting Man"" in a classic scene from that not-so-classic film. Demme died in April at age 73. Marvel-ous partner Marriages in comic books are often short-lived, but Marvel Comics creator Stan Lee and wife Joan were wed for nearly 70 years, and reportedly devotedly so. Joan Lee was also a writer, and played voice roles in the ""Spider-Man"" and ""Fantastic Four"" TV series of the 1990s. Stan Lee credits her with coaxing him to keep at the comics business when he was about to give up, and with her encouragement, he went on to create the Fantastic Four. Joan Lee was in her 90s when she died in July (media sources are split on whether she was 93 or 95).

"Marissa Martinelli, Marissa Martinelli","Pictured: The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, with potato peel pie, in The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Netflix’s new movie, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, is a bit of a tongue-twister, and even its characters know it: “Crikey, that’s quite a mouthful,” says one, when confronted with the words on a page. The film borrows its clunky title from Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows’ beloved novel of the same name, about a fictional book club on the Nazi-occupied island of Guernsey. That book club is created by accident after a handful of islanders hold an illicit dinner party featuring a dish made with the only ingredients available to them: potatoes, potatoes, and, of course, their peels. When they’re confronted by German soldiers for breaking curfew, the revelers pretend they’ve been reading, and so the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is born. That’s a fine name for a fake literary gathering, but as a title, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is cumbersome and a little bit twee, which is probably why the movie was being shopped around at one point under the shortened title Guernsey. When it came time for the film’s release, however, the filmmakers restored the unabridged name, perhaps out of a newfound appreciation for long-winded titles in the spirit of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Or maybe they realized that hooking the book’s fanbase by using the original title was more important than trying to broaden the movie’s appeal. Either way, Netflix, which is distributing the film in the U.S. and other regions, is leaning into the absurdity. But The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is just the story’s English title. The book is a worldwide phenomenon, and now the movie is poised to follow suit, which has required tweaking the moniker for overseas audiences. In some cases, this is as simple as translating the title exactly (at least, as exactly as the language barrier will allow) and the results are as delightfully wordy as the original. xIn Italy, for example, you’ll find yourself watching Il Club del Libro e Della Torta di Bucce di Patata di Guernsey, or, literally, The Club of the Book and of the Cake of Peels of Potato of Guernsey. The Portuguese- and Spanish-language titles will similarly leave you out of breath by the time you reach the end of them: respectively Guernsey - A Sociedade Literária da Tarte de Casca de Batata and La Sociedad Literaria y del Pastel de Cáscara de Papa de Guernsey. The Polish title, Stowarzyszenie Miłośników Literatury i Placka z Kartoflanych Obierek, is another mouthful, but it could have been even longer than it already is, given that it leaves out the society’s location. Google Translate interprets the Chinese title, 納粹鐵蹄下的密函情書, as the perplexing Love Letters Under the Nazi Iron Hoof (though frankly, it’s not all that much more perplexing than the English-language original). When I asked a Chinese speaker about the phrasing, she explained that that the “iron hoof” is more literary than literal, a symbol of military oppression, and that a more nuanced translation might be The Secret Love Letters Under (the Influence) of the Nazi Occupation. That title is still somewhat misleading, given that the letters in the movie are exchanged after the occupation has already ended, but she points out that it stands a better chance of appealing to Chinese audiences, who are unlikely to be familiar with Guernsey. In some other countries, translators have found ways to refer to the film that won’t leave locals gasping for air. A bookstore worker in Reykjavík told me that the novel’s Icelandic title, Bokmennta- og Kartöflubökufélagið, translates roughly to Literature and Potato Pie Club, which is still an unmanageable number of syllables but at least saves considerably on cover space. France has done away with all mention of tubers in its version, leaving the more dignified title Le Cercle Littéraire de Guernesey, or “The Literary Circle of Guernesey,” using the French spelling for the island’s name, as is appropriate. Belgium and the Netherlands have taken a similar route, except they didn’t bother with a translation at all, just a truncation of the English version: The Guernsey Literary Society. It’s Germany, however, that wins for the most creative title alteration. Its version of the film does away entirely with any mention of Guernsey, literature, letters, societies, or potato peel pies. Rather than humor that kind of whimsy, the film has simply been renamed Deine Juliet, or Your Juliet, which is how Lily James’ character signs off on her letters.

Jada Wong,"The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Even though I've been writing about beauty for several years, I haven't tried any color-correcting makeup in fear that I'll wind up looking like a Twister map with multi-colored dots all over my face. 
 But I finally decided to try this color-correcting moisturizer from Dr. Jart+ after several recommendations and seeing more than 1,000 reviews on Sephora — and I'm so glad I did. 
 Color-correcting is a makeup technique that uses color wheel principles to help neutralize redness and dark spots, brighten up dark undereye circles, or perk up a dull complexion. Products range from primers, moisturizers, concealers, foundations, and more in shades of green, peach, purple, and yellow to neutralize discoloration before you apply makeup. 
 When done correctly, color-correction can help make your skin look like you slept 10 hours and drank a gallon of water. But if you use too much product or don't blend completely, you might end up looking patchy. 
 ""I don't think it's super necessary to use so much color-correction daily, but it helps brighten under the eyes, and for redness,"" makeup artist Deanna Melluso says. ""Just remember to keep it super light."" 
Dr. Jart+ 
One of the more common color-correctors on the market are green-tinged products meant to counter redness.
 Cue Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment SPF 30. It's light green in the jar, but transforms into a beige color as you blend the product onto your skin. 
 After my usual skin-care routine of cleanser, essence, toner, and serum, I'll use a bit of the Dr. Jart moisturizer all over my face, focusing on my cheeks and around my nose where I have some redness. It's slightly thick so a little goes a long way, and I have to work the product into my skin well otherwise I wind up looking like a ghost. But the extra 15 seconds of work is worth it for me because I can skip foundation and concealer afterwards. It also has SPF 30 so my skin is protected from sun damage too. 
 Most (if not all) mornings, I'm running late so I'm always looking for ways to streamline my beauty routine. This little green tub of magic takes care of my moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation, and concealer — so yea, it's pretty clutch. 
 I have a fair skin tone so the beige color (once the product is blended) works for me, but I can see how this moisturizer might not work for everyone. It contains titanium dioxide, an ingredient that powers mineral sunscreen and dries opaque. According to Emmy award-winning makeup artist Andrew Sotomayor, titanium dioxide can look gray or ashy on deeper skin tones. If you have a deeper skin tone but still want to use this moisturizer to help cut down on redness, you might find that you still need to use your regular foundation or concealer afterwards. 
 There are a ton of green color-correctors out there if you're looking for one, but this moisturizer from Dr. Jart+ checks all the boxes for me. It's easy to use, it simplifies my beauty routine, and because a little bit goes a long way, the $52 investment will last me for a while.","The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Associated Press,"TAYLORVILLE, Ill. -- The Latest on tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. (all times local): 5:55 p.m. Meteorologists in Arkansas have confirmed that at least three tornadoes developed from severe thunderstorms on Friday night. The National Weather Service said Sunday that a strong tornado touched down in Van Buren, Arkansas, about 130 miles (212 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. The tornado was rated an EF2, which indicates wind speeds as high as 135 mph. About 10 minutes later, a second weaker tornado was confirmed less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away near the town of Rudy, Arkansas. Damage surveys for the two tornadoes are ongoing but officials said dozens of homes were damaged. Early Saturday morning a third tornado with estimated peak winds of 107 mph traveled about 8.5 miles (13.5 kilometers) through Spring Hill in southwest Arkansas, about 110 miles (178 kilometers) from Little Rock. Its path was intermittent and mostly caused damage to trees and to some structures. No injuries or fatalities were reported as a result of the tornadoes. ___ 5:25 p.m. The National Weather Service says a rare wintertime tornado that struck Taylorville in central Illinois was half-a-mile-wide and stayed on the ground for at least 10 miles (16 kilometers). Weather service meteorologist Chris Miller told The Associated Press on Sunday the agency was able to give Taylorville an advanced warning of 41 minutes that the powerful tornado was headed the community's way. The Saturday warning estimated the twister would arrive at 5:20 p.m. and it struck at 5:21 p.m. The warning helped residents take cover and may have saved lives. Around 20 people were injured, but there were no deaths. December tornadoes are rare. At least 12 were reported in Illinois on Saturday. If most are confirmed as tornadoes, Miller said that would be the most tornadoes in Illinois in a December storm since Dec. 18-19, 1957, when there were 21. ___ 1:25 p.m. The National Weather Service has confirmed two tornadoes touched down in eastern Oklahoma and is chasing reports of multiple other tornadoes as part of severe thunderstorms Friday night. Meteorologists said Sunday a tornado with peak winds of 115 to 125 mph caused severe damage in northwestern Sequoyah County. Multiple homes, boats and power lines were destroyed. The tornado traveled at least 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast, though investigators are still determining its end location. Another smaller tornado developed earlier in the evening near Webbers Falls which uprooted trees and damaged irrigation systems and barns. That tornado traveled about 7 miles (11 kilometers) just past the town of Gore. Up to three other tornadoes are being investigated in eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. No injuries have been reported. Severe thunderstorms also raked Illinois and Missouri on Saturday. One person was killed in Missouri. ___ 12:50 p.m. Residents in central Illinois are assessing damage from rare December tornadoes that ripped roofs off homes, downed power lines and injured at least 20 people. The Springfield Journal Register reports the National Weather Service sent crews Sunday to survey the hardest-hit areas, including Taylorville, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Springfield. Assistant Fire Chief Andy Goodall spoke to reporters Saturday night after the storms raked the city of 11,000. He said at least 100 homes had major damage, including his own. A Taylorville Memorial Hospital spokesman said 21 people, from age 9 to 97, arrived for treatment Saturday. Most were discharged within hours. No deaths have been reported in Illinois. One death was reported in southwest Missouri early Saturday after thunderstorms there. The National Weather Service says peak months for tornadoes in much of the Midwest are April and June.","Chicago Daily Herald The Latest: 3 tornadoes confirmed in Arkansas storms Chicago Daily Herald TAYLORVILLE, Ill. -- The Latest on tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. (all times local):. 5:55 p.m..

Paige Cerulli,"Why you'll love it: Quiet, powerful, and designed to last for years, the Miele Complete C3 Cat &amp; Dog Canister Vacuum is a top-of-the-line option for homes with pets. 
 The Miele Complete C3 Cat &amp; Dog Canister Vacuum is a German-made vacuum designed to offer top-quality performance and functionality. The canister is lightweight and easy to maneuver, and although the vacuum is plenty powerful, the motor is quiet — particularly ideal if you have pets who are nervous about vacuum cleaners. 
 A 36-foot cord gives you plenty of reach without having to move from outlet to outlet, and the adjustable wand height ensures you won't have to strain your back while vacuuming. Best of all, Miele engineered and tested this vacuum to last an average of 20 years. 
This vacuum comes with an Electro Plus Electrobrush dusting brush, upholstery tool, and crevice nozzle, as well as a mini turbo brush that is designed to remove pet hair from furniture. You can operate the motor's six-speed settings with a push of the foot-operated controls, and the five-level height adjustment on the Electrobrush allows you to customize the height as you move across different flooring surfaces. 
 This vacuum is also equipped with technology to deal with bad smells. The AirClean filter includes a charcoal cassette that neutralizes odors, so your vacuum doesn't develop that musty dog scent. The AirClean filtration system captures over 99.9% of particles, ensuring the air that's released back into your home is free of dust and pet hair. 
 If you're looking for a vacuum that's effective and easy to use, the Miele C3 Cat &amp; Dog Canister Vacuum may be right for you — provided you can afford its premium price. The streamlined design and flexibility of the entire unit eliminate much of the cumbersome usage that's so common in other vacuums. 
 The foot-switch controls allow for uninterrupted operation without requiring you to stop and bend down to make adjustments. Additionally, the Parquet Twister offers 180-degree rotation for agile cleaning in tight crevices, underneath furniture, and in other spaces that are often difficult to access. 
 You can see how easy it is to maneuver this vacuum in this video. 
 The Miele C3 Cat &amp; Dog Canister Vacuum has a 4.3 out of 5-star Amazon rating based off of 198 reviews. Max S. wrote a highly positive, detailed review of this vacuum: ""It is nowhere near as loud as other vacuums. The Electro Plus brush is a bit louder when it is switched on, but it is nice that you can turn it off at the handle quickly. I love how I can use my foot to easily remove the Electro Plus brush-head and quickly move to using the hose."" 
Chris also appreciated this vacuum's performance: ""Heavy-duty and quality product. The air in my home smells and looks cleaner when I am done vacuuming. I finally switched to a canister vac after going through so many uprights over the years The Miele is quiet, powerful, and gets around and under furniture ..."" 
Pros: Designed to hold up for up to 20 years, quiet pet-friendly operation, powerful suction, adjustable features, foot-controlled speed settings 
Cons: High price point","Insider Picks writes about products and services to help you navigate when shopping online.

 (Photo: Special to the Register)
DES MOINES  Corey Brown, the missing 13-year-old Iowa boy who was found dead Sunday, died of blunt force trauma after he apparently fell from a communication tower, police said Wednesday.
The body of Brown was found by a search team near the tower in a secluded area on the west side of Marshalltown, Iowa, authorities said. He had suffered a significant head injury.
Brown went over a secured fence and climbed onto the tower before he fell from an undetermined distance, authorities said their preliminary investigation showed. Police again said no criminal activity was suspected in Brown's death. 
The state medical examiner performed Brown's autopsy Tuesday. Toxicology results would not be available for as many as eight weeks, police said.

Temperatures dipped below zero for three days after Brown disappeared. He left his parents home on the city's south side after they had a ""disciplinary discussion"" with him and took his phone away, police chief Michael Tupper said. 
When Brown did not return, a couple hundred people, many in snowsuits and winter boots, offered to help police in the search. But officials sent the volunteers home so the search could be handled by professionals.
Green ribbons were tied around trees across town, and neighbors replaced porch lights with green bulbs in support of Brown, whose favorite color was green.
Residents said Brown's death was another blow to the city of about 27,000 people after a twister plowed through town in July, damaging numerous buildings that included the downtown courthouse.

(Photo: Carnival Cruise Line) One of Carnival Cruise Line's oldest ships, Carnival Paradise, is getting a massive makeover that includes the addition of a giant water park on its top deck, the line revealed this week. Taking place over the coming month, the overhaul of the 2,056-passenger vessel also will bring 38 new cabins and the addition of 98 balconies to existing cabins that don't have balconies. Sailing since 1998 and now based in Tampa, Fla., Paradise is one of Carnival's eight Fantasy Class ships, which as originally built featured almost no cabins with balconies. The new water park planned for Paradise will have an enclosed, 300-foot-long water slide called Twister and two 82-foot-long racing slides. It'll also have a splash zone for kids. RELATED: The parade of Baked Alaska is back at Carnival In another change to Paradise's deck-top areas, the ship's nine-hole miniature golf course will be relocated. The makeover of Paradise also will bring a Guy’s Burger Joint — a poolside burger venue developed in partnership with the Food Network's Guy Fieri that is now on almost every ship in the Carnival fleet. Other food-related additions will include BlueIguana Cantina, a poolside Mexican eatery that offers burritos and tacos on home-made tortillas and an extensive toppings and salsa bar. It's another venue that is now on almost every Carnival ship. Paradise also will get a BlueIguana Tequila Bar, a Mexican-themed, pool-side bar serving frozen drinks and beer that has been rolling out across the Carnival fleet; a RedFrog Rum Bar, another poolside venue found on Carnival ships that specializes in rum-based frozen drinks; and Camp Ocean, a marine-inspired play area for kids ages two to 11. Paradise sails year-round from Tampa to the Caribbean with a varied schedule of four- to eight-night voyages.

KIM CHANDLER and JEFF MARTIN / AP,"(BEAUREGARD, Ala.) — Picking through the twisted debris that had been her Alabama mobile home, Carol Dean found her wedding dress and a Father’s Day note to her husband reading, “Daddy, I love you to pieces.”
Her husband was “done and gone,” she said, one of 23 victims of what one National Weather Service meteorologist called a “monster tornado.”
She was on the clock Sunday afternoon at Walmart while her husband, David Wayne Dean, was home in Beauregard. He had heard the forecasts warning that stormy weather was heading toward their rural community. He sent a text message cautioning a friend to pay attention to the news.
Then the storm hit. Dean, 53, didn’t make it to safety. His body was found on the other side of an embankment in the neighbor’s yard.
“Our son found him,” Dean said between sobs Monday. “He was done and gone before we got to him. My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.”
The tornado packed winds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph) and chewed a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4 kilometers) wide in Alabama for nearly 27 miles (43 kilometers), the weather service said Tuesday after its crews surveyed the impact. The weather service said 90 people were injured.
Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half.
Surveyors found that the twister’s intensity peaked in Beauregard, a rural Lee County community, where it demolished multiple manufactured homes, emptying their contents into the woods. The tornado swept up and scattered the debris so widely that the metal frames of two of those homes could not even be located.
By Tuesday morning, authorities reduced the count of unaccounted-for people from dozens to about 7 or 8, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said.
Law enforcement teams have been searching amid splintered lumber and twisted metal from the air and by foot using cadaver-sniffing dogs, finding no more bodies since Monday.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said the dead included almost entire families and at least three children, ages 6, 9 and 10. A post on the Lee-Scott Academy’s Facebook page identified fourth-grader Taylor Thornton as being among those killed.
An unincorporated community of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia state line, Beauregard is in the same county as Auburn University. The community has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department dotting the main highway.
Volunteers responded in force, using chain saws to clear paths for emergency workers, helping neighbors and friends search the wreckage, and gathering donations.
Julie Morrison and her daughter-in-law picked through the remnants of Morrison’s home, looking for keys and a wallet. They managed to salvage the couple’s safe, her husband’s motorcycle boots and her embossed Bible.
Morrison said she and her husband took shelter in the bathtub — her husband jumping in at the last minute — as the twister lifted their house off its foundation and swept it into the woods.
“We knew we were flying because it picked the house up,” Morrison said, figuring that the shower’s fiberglass enclosure helped them survive.
County Emergency Management Director Kathy Carson said she was “pretty sure” tornado sirens in Beauregard sounded warnings.
The weather service found evidence that two tornadoes struck the area. Meteorologist Chris Darden said the one that did most of the destruction was a “monster tornado” classified as an EF4. He said it was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
“It looks like someone almost just took a giant knife and scraped the ground,” the sheriff said.
The twister was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning numerous tornado warnings in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
Tornado outbreaks in early March aren’t unusual in the Alabama-Mississippi area, tornado experts said — in fact, the weather service’s Storm Prediction Center had warned people three days before the disaster to be on the lookout for higher tornado activity in the region. University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said government forecasters “were all over it.”
An EF5 tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011 killed 158 people. And an outbreak of tornadoes in the Southeast a month before that left an estimated 316 people dead, including at least 250 in Alabama.
For Beauregard, the mourning has only just begun. The coroner said Monday that he would soon begin releasing bodies to funeral homes.
After the storm, Dean rushed home from work in time to say goodbye to her husband, a man others called “Roaddog” for his love of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. She pushed past sheriff’s deputies who tried to keep people from the area and went to where her husband’s body lay.
“They took me down to him,” Dean said, “and I got to spend a little time with him before they took him away.”

Chris Roling,"Square Enix The Just Cause 4 cover depicts hero Rico Rodriguez standing before a swath of chaos featuring helicopters, boats and highlighted by a tornado, which is fitting because the player rips through the game's fictional Solis much like a twister. As expected, JC4 is more of the samewhich is good and bad. Fans of the series will be able to drop in and immediately have fun with an array of tools and a military arsenal a few button presses away in mostly destructible environments. But the drawback is the charm of the series has faded enough that visual oddities, a forgettable story and repetitive missions don't get as much of a pass as they have in the past. Ambitious as ever, JC4 can leave a player grinning in a silly manner over some of the chaos and creativity possible when everything works right but rubbing the forehead moments later when something breaks the immersion. Understanding the balance required is key to enjoying a sequel that sticks close to its last two predecessors. Graphics and Gameplay At its peak, Just Cause 4 offers some of the most fun available in video games this year. Getting there isn't too difficult, either. The game doesn't block off tools through some silly progression scheme to start things off. Players have access to the parachute, wingsuit and grappling hook right from the start. Making it all better is three key elements to the grapple, the retractor, balloons and jets. The first functions just as it sounds: slap one end of the grapple down, put the other on another point and whatever they are attached to ends up slamming together. It's cool, but it doesn't come close to the balloons. Players can deploy multiple on anything, anywhere, then inflate them and watch as they carry stuff away. Ditto for the jets, which are a tad more violent. Attach it to something and hit the button and away it goes. Now throw these all into the mix that is JC4's world-best physics system and explosions and have some fun. Want to send two enemies careening into each other? Retractor. Tired of the army vehicle blocking the way? Attach a few balloons and send it on its way. Want to send an enemy flying? Thump a jet into their chest, click the button and watch them flail wildly around the map, into things and eventually off into the atmosphere. These opportunities scale in creativity and size, too. Creatively, mixing and matching creates some hilarious results. Throwing down a few balloons on the top of a car and some jets on the back makes that bad boy fly. The gameplay can lead to massive, spectacular results, such as throwing down jets on an explosive reactor and sending it flying at a group of enemies. While these tools leave the player in control of epic, grandiose set pieces if they so choose, actual gunplay is an auto-aim slog that almost feels like a handheld game. All A.I. is sloppy, too, with some escort missions going off the rails because friendlies decided to get suicidal or freeze (in one mission, a friendly got left behind because he didn't feel like leaving?). Enemy A.I. at times won't react to Rico blasting the bejesus out of their base. The radio says enemies are searching, but they never come. Overall, the gameplay here is more about style points than anything else. Rico can take more damage than any video game character on the planet at this point, and he's back to full health in the blink of an eye. The NPCs aren't exactly threats. Standing right in front of one will see them miss a handful of shots and not secure a kill for what could be as long as 10 seconds. As IGN's Dan Stapleton noted, fans could call Just Cause 4 the GIF game, as it's more about making mini-moments for social media than an actual challenge. That's a shame given the disappointing visuals. Solis features a handful of distinct biomes that help the game feel unique, and traversal from Point A to Point B is always interesting. Just Cause 4's unique weather systems are impressive feats as well, if not underused. A blinding sandstorm is fun to navigate, and getting as high up as the tornado itself while trying to dive through it is a good time. But in motion, JC4 struggles visually while otherwise running like a charm, which seems to be the massive tradeoff here. As of launch at least, there are some miserable-looking textures up close on NPCs and sometimes in the environment on rocks or water. Several times a character's hair had glossy, silver strands in them. While quickly traveling the map via wingsuit or otherwise, there are massive, distracting pop-ins. In vehiclesespecially carsthere is also a huge amount of motion blur. At times, bodies of water won't even react when something heavy like a vehicle passes through it. Granted, some of these issues felt like bugs on console and others will vary by the strength of the PC running them. But if unaddressed, these could be make-or-break issues depending on the player, as the visuals and pop-in can serve as a detriment to the experience. Just Cause 4 is also in a bit of a weird space, especially this year. Traversal in a game like Spider-Man feels smoother, while the destruction pulled off in Battlefield V is arguably more impressive. However, it's important to note that Just Cause 4 combines traversal with immense destruction. Cities also feel lifeless and lack density, which is what happens for a game releasing around some city-spanning offerings like Spider-Man this time of year. The vehicles inhabiting them and elsewhere, at least, look better and boast improved handling compared to past iterations. Little oddities still pop up here as wellit's almost impossible to knock an NPC off the bike they are riding, for examplebut by and large, the endlessly accessible vehicles on land, sea and air all felt solid. Don't expect the game to offer much help, though, as the button prompts on the bottom right show how to, say, exit with a parachute out but not how to actually control the jet. While on the traversal slant, it's still a great time to figure out the best way to combine the three tools creatively to travel quickly across the map. Like the rest, it takes a balancing act of accepting the hiccups in exchange for the fun factor. Story, Features and the Rest The story here is a throwaway affair, which is about what one should expect with the main villain being called something like the ""Black Hand Army."" After quickly discovering he can't do it all on his own, Rico is tasked with stirring up the overthrow of a dictator who has the power to control the weather and features like tornadoes. But the cutscenes suffer from visual issues as well, and, let's be honest, like any game in the series, this is a play-and-forget game when it comes to the story mode. The side missions are drab as well. Go to a location to blow up this thing, or protect this guy as he does a thing, or escort these guys while they do a thing. These side offerings unlock gadgets and such, but they routinely felt plainly slapped on. The real star of the show is the gadgets, so it feels like the game is throwing out some bland missions and asking players to inject the funwhich is a risky approach. There are a few unfortunate systems that put a bowtie on the situation. One is the progression of the map unlocking. It's a huge space, but missions in certain areas only become accessible via the advancements of locals fighting off the baddies, and players might find themselves wishing for the boring Assassins Creed or Far Cry-esque radio tower map unlocks instead. The attempt to do something different is appreciated, but it falls flat in large part because this isn't dynamic, as the bad guys don't try to take portions of the map back or anything. This progression is tied to the Chaos meter, which simply boils down to...do wild stuff. The bar fills up and the number goes up, and the story explanation is it inspires more rebels to join the cause and fight back. Yet killing off NPC's at the player's base and its infrastructure is pretty wild, too, and fills the bar all the same. Just saying. One of the better features is the implementation of airdrops. After unlocking something, a few key presses lead to a tank or some other form of hardware getting dropped down for usage. Having a full military arsenal a few button presses away should fuel the fun and make things even easier on the uber-creative. The game's menus are not only tough to figure out despite its best efforts to tutor, but they don't end up meaning much. It really, really wants players to think about the choices they are making with gadgets and their minor modifications, but in the heat of the moment, the thought doesn't arise often. Call it a microcosm of the game itselfwhy think about the minutia while blowing up everything in sight? It's disappointing to see no co-op or multiplayer in a game like this, because it would definitely become a cult hit of sorts. But with some of the systems already struggling on all hardware and the game clearly prioritizing performance over graphics, adding more than one player to the fray maybe wasn't in the plans. Speedrunning Tips and Appeal Interestingly enough, a speedrun of JC4 would be wildly entertaining in the right hands. Those hands would have to spam map-unlocking missions to help win the turf war and take down the overall story while figuring out the best possible way to use the varied options for travel. This series is a joy because of how the most dedicated and creative players can use the tools at their disposal to cause the most mayhem. Add in a new weather system and arguably the best physics system in video games today, and asking those minds to gear their talents toward a speedrun sounds brilliant. The top Just Cause 3 any-percent speedruns outline the basics. Prioritizing grapple-parachute combos to elevate and gain speed will make traversal a breeze. And while getting creative and finding fun ways to blow up objectives is fun, it's also time-consuming when a gun and explosives like RPGs work all the same, but faster. Like the arsenal itself, dissecting just how to attack the story is a must. In other words, spamming and snowballing the map-unlock missions is the way to go. Ignoring the side quests from three characters that offer gadget modifications isn't a terrible idea either, though further experimentation might reveal some of those gadgets are key to a better-timed run. Standard ideas behind speedruns also apply, such as skipping cutscenes and using checkpoints to the user's advantage. That those attempting speedruns can call in anything they want at a given time and use it will only make things more interesting. JC4 was destined for a huge Twitch and highlights community thanks to its niche brand of gaming. That speedrunners can crack knuckles and dive into a deep, layered system of tools and play with physics should only further the appeal and increase its reach. Conclusion Just Cause 4, unlike Rico who often finds himself in dangerous situations close to the atmosphere, has serious balance problems. Not-so-hidden within this release is some of the best laugh-out-loud, joyous moments gamers can find today. Whether it's spinning enemies out, sending a goat to the moon or ballooning up a warship and watching it float into a building before erupting, there is must-see fun here. But hidden within are graphical sacrifices and a weak open world presumably cut down for the sake of performance. Few games attempt what JC4 does on a power scale in terms of the physics, so a hit in the visuals department is to be expected. And harping on about it too much would explain why console makers in particular jam buzzwords like ""4K"" down gamers' throats all the time. But when there is such a noticeable compromise, it can create problems for many gamers. For would-be players, it comes down to whether more of the same, plus weather and an improved physics engine, is enough to overlook shortcomings. There are short, fast food-esque bursts of gameplay here wrapped around a neat central idea, which makes for a unique experience right in line with the past two games in the series. Surrounding pieces and lack of improvements from previous editions prevent a major leap forward in this release, but Just Cause 4 does wacky, action-movie fun in expert fashion.","The Just Cause 4 cover depicts hero Rico Rodriguez standing before a swath of chaos featuring helicopters, boats and highlighted by a tornado, which is fitting because the player rips through the game's fictional Solis much like a twister...",2018-12-06T16:42:02Z,"{'id': 'bleacher-report', 'name': 'Bleacher Report'}","Just Cause 4 Review: Gameplay Impressions, Speedrunning Tips and Appeal",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2809107-just-cause-4-review-gameplay-impressions-speedrunning-tips-and-appeal,https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/778/898/563aadf8aba505abc9cfb155ea8a1bd8_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75,bleacher-report,Bleacher Report,twister,1

"Girish Shahane, Scroll.in","Xi sells Seychelles on the seashore. This twist on a familiar tongue-twister doesn’t precisely describe how India’s jump to international military power status was thwarted, but isn’t entirely inaccurate. Back in 2011, China considered building a military base on an island in the Seychelles. India objected, but its protests were rendered moot once China shifted its attention to Djibouti. In 2015, Narendra Modi visited the Indian Ocean nation, the first such visit by an Indian prime minister in over three decades, and sealed a deal to develop Assumption Island as an Indian naval base. Now, it was China’s turn to try and scuttle the agreement. Three years on, after a number of fire-fighting attempts by top Indian diplomats, Modi’s outreach to the Seychelles feels like an episode of Presumption Island. The Seychellois president Danny Faure has terminated the naval base plan ahead of a visit to India. Perhaps he will receive as cold a welcome in New Delhi as the one accorded to Modi’s outreach to the Seychelles feels like an episode of Presumption Island. Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was greeted on arrival by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, a man virtually no Indian would be able to recognise on sight. Trudeau hasn’t forgotten the snub, which will certainly rebound on India at some point. We don’t know how much of a role China played in spurring protests against the Indian base, but I’m sure it was not negligible. President Xi Jinping and his colleagues take no prisoners in securing what they perceive as China’s interests. Consider another Modi initiative from his early days in power which seemed innovative but ended in a shambles: his visit to Mongolia. The idea was that, as China’s “string of pearls” threatened to encircle India, New Delhi would perform a counter-encirclement. In effect, Modi was saying to Xi, “I see your Hambantota and raise you Ulaanbataar.” He promised Mongolia a billion dollar credit line to secure the nation against any Chinese threat. The next year, following a visit to Mongolia by the Dalai Lama, China struck, blockading the landlocked nation and strangling its economy. The Mongolians turned to India for the promised relief, but found none forthcoming. Modi’s targeting of China turned out to be as feeble as the archery skills he had demonstrated on his Mongolian visit. Ulaanbataar was forced into a humiliating apology to a Chinese leadership that rules by the Nixonian dictum, “When you’ve got them by the balls, their hearts and minds follow.” Coining weird acronyms is among Modi’s favourite occupations, and in Wuhan last month he produced a new one, STRENGTH. Unfortunately, he misspelled it as STREANH while expanding on its meaning. The gaffe, like mistakes politicians commonly make, was good for a quick laugh, but the fact that it happened in China felt queerly appropriate. Faced with a ruthless and more powerful adversary, Modi has made a series of inept moves with respect to traditional allies such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, aside from the missteps in Mongolia and Seychelles. It feels like he is all hat and no cattle, to use a Texan phrase for boastful people who fail to back up their tough talk. The most compelling counter to such a view is the action on which rests his administration’s reputation for projecting military power: the targeting of launching sites for terrorists commonly referred to as “surgical strikes”. The government has given us no details about what Indian soldiers did in the early hours of Sept. 29, 2016, but there’s little doubt the operation was larger and more coordinated than any previously launched across the Modi has made a series of inept moves with Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Line of Control (LOC). Whatever its exact scale, it did no more to deter insurgents than demonetisation, called Modi’s “surgical strike on black money,” did to curb tax evasion. Since that bold act, dozens of Indian soldiers have succumbed to attacks by Pakistani soldiers crossing the L OC, shelling from across the border, militant attacks on army camps mirroring the one in Uri which led to the “surgical strike,” militant ambushes on patrols, and gunfights in Kashmiri towns. Security forces have given as good as they got, but the larger story is of escalation on both sides with great loss of life and civic disruption with no end in sight. According to official figures, Pakistan violated the ceasefire along the LOC an incredible 1,252 times in the first five months of 2018. In the official account, Pakistan is always the violator and India the responder, but whatever the truth of that, a ceasefire violated hundreds of times is no ceasefire at all. It is astonishing, then, that Amit Shah, in his maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha (upper house), claimed, “Kashmir has never been so safe in the last 35 years. We handled the Kashmir issue very well.” Even Modi’s most ardent devotees might be fazed by Shah’s sanguine description of the state of Kashmir. That might be why the BJP has pulled the rug from under the Jammu and Kashmir government’s feet. It does not want to enter the 2019 election owning the mess in the northern state and is, therefore, positioning itself as an outsider despite holding the reins of power in the state and at the Centre for years. It might work since Modi’s failure to walk the talk has thus far been successfully camouflaged by his ability to talk the walk.",Xi sells Seychelles on the seashore.

Kristen V. Brown,"Last month in an art gallery in Auckland, New Zealand, I stood in front of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel’s likeness cast in plastic, as a tiny board game figurine raising a shield and arrow in battle with democracy, portrayed as a snarling dragon. Fair elections, depicted as a fierce lion, was coming at him, too. This little plastic Thiel, who is so often depicted in news coverage as a villain and a foe of democracy, was dressed in a cape and thigh-high boots and looked a little like an extremely buff, green Daniel Craig. All this was the work of New Zealand artist Simon Denny, who rendered Thiel’s techno-libertarian philosophies as a board game in his exhibition, “The Founder’s Paradox.” The narrative of Thiel has always had the glossy sheen of fiction—a wealthy futurist who imagines utopia as government-free, man-made islands in the sea where we all live forever. From this absurd vision of humanity’s “ideal” future, Denny crafted an equally absurd fantasy in board games. Denny’s work has long focused on technology, its social influence and power structures. Though he now lives in Berlin, his work still frequently has New Zealand tie-ins. One past exhibition painstakingly recreated the entire inventory of confiscated items taken by police when they raided the New Zealand hideaway of German internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. Another, New Zealand’s entry in the 2015 Venice Biennale, used material from the Edward Snowden leaks to explore issues of mass surveillance and national identity. Often his view of technology appears ambiguous. Here it is not the case. Thiel recently received citizenship in New Zealand, and his presence has attracted suspicion. Buffness aside, Denny’s depiction of Thiel is not flattering. In “The Founder’s Paradox,” on view last month in Auckland, Thiel’s philosophies stand in contrast to the ideologies of Max Harris, a young Oxford-based Kiwi who has argued that New Zealand is undergoing the erosion of communal values. The antidote, he argues, is a new “politics of love.” It seems no accident that on entering the gallery, you ascend to a level of the gallery where reimaginings of cooperative games like Jenga and Twister explore Harris’ work, and then descend into a dank, cold basement to tour the world of Thiel. I visited the Auckland exhibition just a week after Peter Thiel himself had seen it during a rare visit to New Zealand. Coincidentally, his intellectual rival was visiting the exhibit as well. Harris reported later on Twitter that Thiel remarked it was “a work of phenomenal detail.” A gallery employee told me that Thiel appeared to really enjoy it. He has always seemed to revel in the criticism inherent in his role as one of democracy’s most influential detractors. (Thiel’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment.) Thiel—PayPal co-founder, Facebook investor, Trump supporter, immortality-seeker and, it should be mentioned, funder of the lawsuit that bankrupted Gizmodo’s former parent company, Gawker Media—is a figure more myth than man. “The Founder’s Paradox” is an unpacking of Thiel’s own self-made mythologies, and their hazards. In the most direct skewering of Thiel’s ideologies, Denny casts Thiel as a green-faced “contrarian hero” with anti-aging powers and a PayPal belt buckle battling monsters including the democracy and public activism in a recasting of the role-playing game Descent. In another, Thiel wields a glowing orb in a game that reimagines Settlers of Catan as “Founders,” a quest to leave behind Earth’s decaying lands for man-made seasteads, the moon, and Mars. Other nods to Thiel’s work are more subtle. In the Game of Life: Collective or Individual, players have “made it to Stanford” and must make choices between studying the humanities or technology and getting paid in crypto or fiat currency. Players collect literature cards for books including Atlas Shrugged and The Sovereign Individual, works often cited by Thiel. “It’s kind of hard to go anywhere without bumping into Peter Thiel,” Denny told me. “I’d meet a founder and he had read Zero to One or had an investment from Founders Fund. Thiel is quite a loud voice. You meet him at many turns when you’re looking at power networks.” The work is detailed in its study of Thielisms. In Founders, players navigate five different levels, asserting sovereignty through the acquisition of raw materials and capitalist dominance at each one. The first is Earth, rotting under the collapse of the welfare state, a prediction that runs through texts such as James Dale Davidson’s The Sovereign Individual that Thiel has cited as influential in his views. The next level is New Zealand, where Thiel recently and controversially received citizenship. Then on to the Pacific Ocean seasteads that Thiel has famously supported, and finally space colonies on Mars and the moon. In place of Catan’s robber, a piece that denies players of the opportunity to acquire resources in the original game, is a taxman, a bureaucrat, and a software glitch. The goal of the game, as in all of the mock games revolving around the philosophies of Thiel, is to assert power via the individual, and ultimately, achieve monopoly. “Without new technology to relieve competitive pressures, stagnation is likely to erupt into conflict,” the Founders’ rules advise. “We won’t all survive. But the age of individual economic sovereignty is coming.” It may seem odd that an exhibition in a place so far removed from Silicon Valley would focus so acutely on Thiel, but Thiel is especially visible in this small Pacific nation. In January, it was an investigation by the New Zealand Herald that revealed that Thiel had controversially obtained New Zealand citizenship in 2011 after only spending 12 days in the country, and used that citizenship to purchase land. New Zealand has a long history as a “ social laboratory,” a small, relatively forward-thinking nation where new social theories and polices can easily be tested. It seems feasible that Thiel might have his eye on the country as prime lab space for testing out some of his own ideas. “I am happy to say categorically that I have found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future than New Zealand,” Thiel wrote in his citizenship application. At one point, Thiel invested $3 million in Xero, a New Zealand accounting firm, according to the company, and $4 million into a company called Pacific Fibr that hoped to build a trans-Pacific cable. But New Zealand is a nation with socialized healthcare where those who seek success too aggressively are often derided as “tall poppies ” — many have viewed his presence in the country as an uncomfortable fit. More broadly, the exhibition also wrangles with changes that has been occurring in New Zealand itself. Thiel is representative of a shift that began in New Zealand with a radical embrace of free market economics in the 1980s. Subsidies were done away with and the New Zealand dollar devalued so that the country might become a bigger part of the global economy. Some feel it was a failed experiment that led to increases in poverty, unemployment and crime. “Founders Paradox” portrays two visions of utopia, radically different from one another. One represents New Zealand continuing on its free market path. The other perhaps a reversion to attitudes about the role of government in life prior to the 1980s. Board games, Denny said, made sense as a medium because the imagery of fantasy and role-playing is present through the tech industry. Thiel’s secretive data company, Palantir, for example, is a reference to the “seeing-stones” in Lord of the Rings. Denny’s past work has appeared ambivalent about the power structures it explores, but in “Founder’s Paradox” it takes a stance. “One of the big problems with libertarianism is that it starts based on the belief that the world can be fair as a meritocracy and that’s just not true,” he said. “It’s dangerous for redistribution and regulation to be ignored in favor merit-based systems.” In a sense, Denny’s work asks his fellow countrymen to examine both visions for the future, and make a choice between the two: All for one, or one for all?","Last month in an art gallery in Auckland, New Zealand, I stood in front of Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel’s likeness cast in plastic, as a tiny board game figurine raising a shield and arrow in battle with democracy,  portrayed as a snarling dragon.

As entertaining as tripping over tricky terms can be, early English twisters were also used to teach pupils proper speech. In a note to teachers in his 1878 book Practical Elocution, J.W. Shoemaker reminded them of the ""higher motive"" of these confounding sayings: ""To The Teacher—While many of the exercises... may create amusement in a class, a higher motive than 'Amusement' has prompted their insertion. Practice is here afforded in nearly every form of difficult articulation."" Whether it's selling seashells by the seashore or buying Betty Botter's bitter butter, some of these difficult phrases go way back to when elocution was practiced as routinely as multiplication tables. Come along as we untangle the history behind a few familiar phrases. Fittingly, many tongue twister origin stories are just as knotty as the expressions themselves. 1. PETER PIPER Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers; A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked; If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked? Peter and his famous pickled peppers first appeared in print in 1813 in John Harris's Peter Piper's Practical Principles of Plain and Perfect Pronunciation. But as is the case with many classic tongue twisters, the rhyme itself may have already been in common use by that time (the book offered similarly formatted phrases for each letter of the alphabet, and Peter clearly got top billing). Several spice enthusiasts have also suggested the Peter in question was based on 18th century French horticulturalist Pierre Poivre, though that connection should probably be taken with a grain of salt (or pepper, in this case). Much like Mary Anning and her rumored seashore seashells (more on this later), Poivre's ties to the poem, while feasible, aren't necessarily rooted in concrete evidence. Poivre is French for ""pepper,"" Piper was both Latin for ""pepper"" and a typical British last name, and the man was known for smuggling cloves from the Spice Islands in his day, so the supposed link makes sense. As a renowned gardener, Poivre may very well have pickled peppers with those stolen cloves, but we don’t actually know for sure. 2. HOW MUCH WOOD COULD A WOODCHUCK CHUCK? How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, If a woodchuck could chuck wood? While it likely predates her, Vaudeville performer Fay Templeton is credited with putting the woodchucking woodchuck on the map. “How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?” was the chorus of a number Templeton sang in 1903 in the Broadway musical The Runaways (not to be confused with the musical Runaways ). Robert Hobart Davis and Theodore F. Morse wrote Templeton’s "" Woodchuck Song,"" and a few years later “Ragtime” Bob Roberts covered it on his 1904 record, boosting its popularity. The tongue-tripping refrain stuck around and even inspired the title of director Werner Herzog’s 1976 documentary ""How Much Wood Would a Woodchuck Chuck: Observations on a New Language"" about the 13th International World Livestock Auctioneering Championship. More recently, scholars have focused less on the origin of the phrase and more on the answer to its central question. In 1988, a fish and wildlife technician for the New York Department of Environmental Conservation made national headlines when he posited if a woodchuck could chuck wood (because they actually can’t ) it would be able to chuck about 700 pounds of the stuff—but that little detail must not have fit into the linguistic flow of the original rhyme. 3. AND 4. BETTY BOTTER AND TWO TOOTERS Betty Botter bought some butter; ""But,"" said she, ""this butter's bitter! If I put it in my batter It will make my batter bitter. But a bit o' better butter Will but make my batter better."" Then she bought a bit o’ butter Better than the bitter butter, Made her bitter batter better. So 'twas better Betty Botter Bought a bit o’ better butter. ** A tutor who tooted the flute Tried to teach two young tooters to toot. Said the two to the tutor, ""Is it harder to toot, or To tutor two tooters to toot?"" Both these classic twisters can be traced to poet and novelist Carolyn Wells's writings in the late 1890s. Betty Botter would go on to be included in Mother Goose’s nursery rhymes and both verses can be found in several variations. While we don’t know who or what exactly sparked the characters of Betty or the tutor, we do know Wells was pretty prolific in terms of her writing. Her 1902 book A Nonsense Anthology —another volume of silly linguistic gymnastics—would be her most famous, but she was also behind more than 100 other books, including mysteries and children’s stories. As if her written contributions to the American language weren't enough, Wells was also known for donating her epic collection of Walt Whitman manuscripts and first editions to the Library of Congress. 5. SHE SELLS SEASHELLS She sells sea shells on the sea shore. The shells she sells are sea shells, I'm sure. And if she sells sea shells on the sea shore, Then l'm sure she sells seashore shells. The story behind ""She Sells Seashells"" has gotten perhaps the most attention in recent years. Legend has it the rhyme is a tribute to 19th century English paleontologist Mary Anning. Anning was an impressive fossil hunter who is thought to have been responsible for scientific achievements from discovering the first articulated plesiosaur to being among the first to identify fossilized poop —though her male contemporaries had a frustrating way of swiping credit from her. Anning is known in scientific circles (Charles Dickens even wrote about his admiration for her after her 1847 death) but the idea that she’s also the muse behind the tongue twister has given the general public a nice way to honor her as well. Of course, as Stephen Winick of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center pointed out, we don’t actually have anything that proves the rumored connection between Anning and the tongue twister. Many outlets cited the 1908 Terry Sullivan and Harry Gifford song that includes the phrase in its lyrics as the birth of this particular tongue twister, but Winick found a handful of earlier instances of its use (similar versions were included in Shoemaker’s elocution book and published in an 1898 issue of Werner’s Magazine, for example). The first known suggestion that the verse was related to Anning seems to be a 1977 book Henry De la Beche: Observations on an Observer, though it was only raised as a possibility and there was no source offered for the reference. 6. I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM I scream, you scream, We all scream for ice cream. Tongues didn't get particularly twisted with this one, but they did get cold. There’s some disagreement on who first came up with this ditty about everyone’s favorite frozen treat. Throughout the 19th century there were many jokes and comments about how similar “ice cream” and “I scream” sound. But in 1905 a company selling ice cream freezers in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, advertised “I Scream, You Scream, We all Scream for Ice Cream! This is certainly Ice Cream Weather. Have you a good Ice Cream Freezer?” While unlikely the first usage of the phrase (something very similar appears in Wisconsin a few months earlier), the rhyme probably became famous thanks to Howard Johnson, Billy Moll, and Robert King, who wrote the phrase into a song of the same name in 1927. Waring’s Pennsylvanians recorded the song, and it became a jazz standard in the '40s. It’s been making people hungry, and haunting ice cream truck drivers, ever since. 7. SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS Maybe the best-known one-word tongue twister, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious isn't short on complicated back story. Most people associate the mouthful of a nonsense word with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke dancing with cartoons from the 1964 movie adaptation of P.L. Travers's book series Mary Poppins. But according to songwriters Barney Young and Gloria Parker, they'd used the word first (or a slight variation on it, supercalafajalistickespeealadojus ) in their song, which was also known as ""The Super Song."" So when Disney came out with their song, written by Robert and Richard Sherman, Young and Parker took them to court for copyright infringement. The Shermans claimed they'd learned the funny word at camp as children in the '30s. Young and Parker said Young had made up the word as a kid in 1921 and the pair had sent their song to Disney in 1951. They sued for $12 million. The judge in the ordeal was so flustered by the 14-syllable term in court proceedings, he insisted they refer to it as simply ""the word."" He ended up throwing out the case, saying the tongue twister had been in common use in New York as far back as the '30s, but the controversy always lingered. Later, another instance of the word being used in 1931, this time spelled supercaliflawjalisticexpialadoshus, was discovered. It had appeared in the Syracuse University student newspaper [ PDF ], and the writer of the column claimed she'd been the one who made it up, too. 8. PAD KID Pad kid poured curd pulled cod Not yet as recognizable as some other more traditional rhymes, this short sentence was developed by MIT researchers in 2013 as the world’s trickiest twister. The phrase is deceptively harder than something like the ""I Scream"" song or even the woodchucking woodchuck. As part of the 166th meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, where the facilitators were looking to find how certain speech patterns work psychologically, volunteers were recorded during the project reciting different types of twisters—and Pad Kid caused the most trouble. Because of the phrase's alliteration and words with similar sounds, the brain makes it difficult to repeat quickly without a mistake. Previously, “The sixth sick sheikh's sixth sheep's sick” was often cited as the world’s toughest twister (it even held the Guinness World Record for a time). But as the official category no longer exists, the MIT creation just might take the tongue twister cake.","Whether it's selling seashells by the seashore or buying Betty Botter's bitter butter, some of these difficult phrases go way back to when elocution was practiced as routinely as multiplication tables.",2018-07-31T18:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mentalfloss.com'}",The History Behind 8 Famous Tongue Twisters,http://mentalfloss.com/article/513952/history-behind-famous-tongue-twisters,http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/mf_image_16x9/public/513952.twister.lede2x_1.png?itok=_tU8O8GQ,,Mentalfloss.com,twister,1
Associated Press,"(ELKHART, Ind.) — Crews used boats to help residents evacuate their homes in northern Indiana after rainstorms sweeping across the Midwest on Wednesday combined with melting snow to flood rivers, roads and other low-lying areas in several states. The storm system starting pushed heavy rain, snow and ice into the region this week, and the weather has already been blamed for hundreds of car crashes and several fatalities, including the deaths of four people in a crash along a slippery interstate in Nebraska. About 19 people had been evacuated from homes in Elkhart, a town just east of South Bend, by early Wednesday, said Mayor Tim Neese. Local schools were closed because of the flooding and an emergency shelter was set up to help evacuees overnight, The Elkhart Truth newspaper reported. “This city has not seen flooding like this in the last 45 years,” Neese said. “We also had record snowfall in addition to consistent rain.” Homes and streets also were flooded in the South Bend area, and forecasters predicted that the swollen St. Joseph River wouldn’t crest until Thursday. The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for parts of several states in the central and southern U.S., spanning from Texas to Illinois and Ohio to Arkansas, where strong winds topped power lines and damages buildings. Winter weather advisories also were issued, including in for Oklahoma and Kansas. In Michigan, flooded streets stranded motorists and a school bus in Flint, and a washout from heavy rains may have caused two freight train engines to derail near Grand Rapids. No injuries were reported there. Residents in Mattawan, in the southwestern part of the state, used sandbags to protect homes and businesses as a nearby river rose above its banks. “We just got to wait for it to go down,” Terry Teeter, who installed pumps to keep water away from his house, told WOOD-TV. “It’s going to be a couple of days like this.” In Illinois, the fear of rising water along the Illinois River forced the evacuation late Tuesday of the LaSalle County Nursing Home in Ottawa. Two days of rain in southern Wisconsin swelled waterways, leading to a handful of high-water rescues for people stranded in their vehicles. A 52-year-old woman from Bourbonnais, Illinois, was found dead Tuesday in a submerged car in Peotone, south of Chicago. The woman apparently lost control of her vehicle and ended up in a rain-filed ditch, said Peotone Fire Protection District Deputy Chief Bruce Boyle. In eastern Nebraska, speed and slippery pavement caused a crash between a pickup truck and a semitrailer along Interstate 80 on Tuesday that killed four people from Colorado, police said. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a 38-year-old woman died and two other people were injured in a collision on an icy highway late Monday. In Minnesota, state police said winter weather contributed to 400 crashes and 250 spinouts, including two fatal accidents. The storm system stretched to Texas, where weather service officials said three tornadoes hit. One struck early Tuesday in a rural area near Joshua, destroying at least two mobile homes and severely damaging several others. A mother and her disabled daughter were injured when one twister demolished their mobile home.","About 19 people had been evacuated from homes in Elkhart, Indiana, following the floods.",2018-02-21T20:12:20Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Rescuers Using Boats to Evacuate Victims as ‘Worst Floods in 45 Years’ Hit Midwest,http://time.com/5169171/severe-floods-midwest/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/south-bend-indiana-flood.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,twister,1

Reuters,"A rare tornado ripped through Havana late on January 27, leaving at least four dead and nearly two hundred injured as it tore off roofs, flipped vehicles and reduced some of the buildings in its path to rubble.
The twister was the strongest to hit Cuba in nearly 80 years, according to Jose Rubiera, a meteorologist with the Cuban weather service. It pummeled its way 11.5 km through Havana over 16 minutes, at times reaching 1 km in diameter.
The streets of the worse-hit neighborhoods, mainly in eastern and central Havana, were strewn on January 28 with shards of glass and debris as well as downed trees and power lines. Some areas lacked electricity and running water.
The noise made it seem like a plane was crashing down on us, said Victoria Infanta Rodriguez, 47, surveying the wreckage of her home. But when you looked it was more like a big ball of flame something red, red, red as if the whole country had caught fire. Infanta Rodriguez said her family had huddled in a corner of their home like Russian nesting dolls as the tornado sucked off the roof - she sheltered her 12-year-old son and her husband sheltered her, taking the brunt of the flying debris that scratched and bruised his back. All we have left is the skeleton of the house, she said. Like many of her neighbors in the capital's eastern, working-class borough of Regla, the tornado had smashed most her belongings while the rain had destroyed her appliances.
 President Miguel Diaz-Canel toured Regla shortly after the tornado hit and tweeted a preliminary death toll of three, that the state-run news broadcaster updated to four in the evening, adding that 195 were injured.
One Regla resident, Odalys Diaz, 51, said her neighbor was killed when the roof of a nearby five-storey building came crashing down onto his which then collapsed on top of him. Concrete debris also smashed into her flat, tearing down the wall of one room and shattering the windows. There was glass flying everywhere. I tried to hide under the bed, Diaz said.
The devastation wrought suggested it was an EF4 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale, the second most powerful category with winds up to 322 km per hour, Rubiera told state-run news agency Prensa Latina.
 Cuba prides itself on suffering relatively few deaths in hurricane season due in part to a rigorous evacuation scheme. Yet the tornado took Havana by surprise, although state-run media had warned residents that an approaching cold front from the north and winds from the south would create high winds, thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the area. Rubiera was later cited as saying that such phenomena were virtually impossible to predict when they affected such concentrated areas.
Diaz-Canel said the council of ministers had held an emergency meeting early on January 28 to assess the damage and take the necessary steps to speed up the recovery work.",The twister was the strongest to hit Cuba in nearly 80 years,2019-01-29T05:05:27Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}","Tornado hits Cuba; 4 dead, nearly 200 injured",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tornado-hits-cuba-4-dead-nearly-200-injured/article26117842.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xtf7sg/article26117837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXCUBATORNADO,the-hindu,The Hindu,twister,1
noreply@blogger.com (Richard Byrne),"There are dozens of great game builders, writing templates, and handy classroom tools on Classtools.net. I've tried nearly all of them over the years. My ten favorite Classtools tools are featured below. The Dustbin game is an activity in which students sort vocabulary terms. Playing a Dustbin game can be a good way for your students to review key vocabulary terms. In a science classroom you could create a game in which students sort animal names into the categories of mammal, reptile, fish, and bird. In a geography classroom you could create a game in which students sort city names according to state, province, country, or continent. The ClassTools Hexagons Generator lets you create an online hexagonal learning activity to share with your students. To use the template just enter a topic then a minimum of five terms related to that topic. For example, I entered the topic of ""American Revolution"" then entered the terms ""Stamp Act,"" ""Sugar Act,"" ""Boston Tea Party,"" ""Intolerable Acts,"" and ""Olive Branch Petition."" The generator then created five hexagons that my students can arrange online to show the connections between the topics. Students can also edit the hexagons to add explanations to the connections. The Diamond 9 template has students write text into nine boxes that form a diamond shape. Students have to sort the boxes into order of importance and connection to ideas in other boxes. A space is provided for students to write a justification for placement of each box. The Jigsaw template has students write keywords or phrases into jigsaw pieces. Students then arrange the pieces to show the connections between the keywords in the those pieces. Students can color code each piece in their puzzles. The ClassTools Source Analyser provides students with a simple template that can help them analyze the resources that they want to use in research papers and presentations. The template asks students to answer five basic questions about the reliability and utility of a source. Three hint buttons in the template can give students further guidance in analyzing a source. Mission MapQuest is a great tool for map-based quizzes and games. The concept behind it is simple, you create a series of clues that your students need to follow to identify places around the world. You can add as few or as many clues to your MapQuest as you like. When you're ready to have students try your MapQuest just give them the web address assigned to it. Watch the video embedded below to learn how to create your own map-based quizzes on Mission MapQuest. The Classtools Fake SMS Generator is free to use and does not require students to register to use it. In the video below I demonstrate how to create a fictitious text message exchange between historical characters. As I mentioned in the video, the Fake SMS Generator could also be used to create visuals for lessons on cyber-safety and etiquette. Connect Fours is a game in which that you have to create four sets of four related terms from sixteen terms displayed on the game board. Connect Fours is based on the concept of the connect wall in the BBC gameshow Only Connect. The idea is that you have to create four sets of four related terms from sixteen terms displayed on the board. For example, I created a game about the four major professional sports leagues in the United States. Sixteen team names are displayed on the board and players have to arrange the teams according to the leagues that they belong to. In the video embedded below I demonstrate how to use Connect Fours to create your own review games. The Random Name Picker and the Fruit Machine are two of those tools that can be used in almost every classroom setting. Both tools can be used to select names or numbers at random. In the video embedded below I demonstrate how to use both of those tools. Twister, like the Fake SMS allows you imagine what historical figures would have done if they had access to social media. On Twister you can create fake Tweets as if you were Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, or any other person in history. To create a fake Tweet on Twister just go to the site and enter a name, a Tweet, and date stamp for your Tweet. Twister will pull a public domain image for the profile picture and show you the fake Tweet. Your fake Tweet will be given its own URL. You can also just take a screenshot of it to save it.","There are dozens of great game builders, writing templates, and handy classroom tools on Classtools.net.

Mike Wehner,"Tornados can be absolutely devastating forces of nature, especially when they materialize over a populated area with little warning, but the destruction they bring often fades with time. That doesn’t seem to be the case in northern Wisconsin, where a 40-mile-long scar still remains from a strong tornado which tore through thousands of acres of forest over a decade ago. On June 7th, 2007, a large EF3 tornado sliced through thick woods in the north of the state, tearing down everything in its path for 40 miles before finally sputtering to a stop. An incredible 14,000 acres of forest was lost to the twister, and as The Weather Channel points out, the area still sports a nasty gash that can be seen from weather satellites. The huge scar is visible most clearly during the winter, when snow piles up on the now sparsely-wooded ground and highlights the large gap between the trees. The massive gash is around three-quarters of a mile in width, and while the area is beginning to regain some sizable vegetation it’s still nowhere near as dense as the surrounding forest. The tornado that touched down way back in 2007 didn’t claim any lives, but it did damage several buildings and vehicles. It was rated as an EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which classifies tornados based on their power and the damage they cause. An EF3 twister has winds of between 136 and 165 miles per hour, and can cause “severe damage” including damage to large buildings and the destruction of homes. In this case, most of the damage was done to a heavy forest, but the scale of course still applies.","Tornados can be absolutely devastating forces of nature, especially when they materialize over a populated area with little warning, but the destruction they bring often fades with time.

JEANNETTE CATSOULIS,"Photo Christopher Abbott and Jon Bernthal in ""Sweet Virginia."" Credit IFC A twisty, small-town thriller that blooms in the shadows and shies from the light, “Sweet Virginia” marshals a relentlessly threatening mood from dangerous secrets and unpleasant surprises. The first of these shocks occurs immediately, as a late-night card game explodes into a triple murder. The perpetrator, a restive stranger we will come to know as Elwood (played with chilling unpredictability by Christopher Abbott), has dark business with Lila (Imogen Poots), the young wife of one of the victims. Waiting to conclude that transaction, Elwood washes up in a motel owned by Sam (Jon Bernthal), a onetime rodeo star limping after too many falls and trembling with the early signs of Parkinson’s disease. Gentle and melancholy, Sam mutes his demons with routine and a long-term affair with a married neighbor (Rosemarie DeWitt, fabulous). And then Elwood invites him to dinner. Video Set in a remote Alaskan valley (softly photographed in British Columbia by the cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné), “Sweet Virginia” is a quiet knife-twister in which atmosphere and performance are everything. The story (by the twin brothers Benjamin and Paul China) is flimsy and the characters have just enough heft to keep the gears of the plot clicking. Accumulating suspense from the inevitability of a final showdown, the director, Jamie M. Dagg, uses long takes and uncluttered setups that leave his actors room to flex. And they do, especially Mr. Bernthal, who gives Sam an aw-shucks friendliness that belies the strength behind his wounded body language. From the moment he and Elwood meet, they’re familiar trains — the lone gunman and the broken-down hero — running on tracks whose intersection is preordained. Sweet Virginia Rated R. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes.

Samuel Axon,"reader comments 0 The entry to Two Bit Circus in Los Angeles, California. The park is in the Arts District near downtown Los Angeles, which is home to numerous artists' creative spaces, upscale restaurants, and experimental pop-up event venues. LOS ANGELES—Near downtown Los Angeles, a new kind of entertainment is opening next month: a large, carnival-like arcade filled with VR headsets, brand new arcade cabinets, holograms, escape rooms, a robot bartender named Guillermo del Pouro, hidden passages, and more. It's called Two Bit Circus, and it's run by a company of the same name. Founded by Eric Gradman (a computer programmer who has also worked as a circus performer) and Brent Bushnell (an engineer who is also the son of Atari and Chuck E Cheese's co-founder Nolan Bushnell), Two Bit Circus is something of a staple in the LA scene now. Their previous individual installations have appeared at nightclubs, corporate events, and more. But the company is also a branded experience studio—a sort of VR carnival ad agency that has produced installations and pop-up events for brands like Disney, Google, Intel, and the NBA. The team even organized an E3 event for Microsoft, and the founders worked together to create the Rube Goldberg machine in OK Go’s “ This Too Shall Pass ” music video Gradman and Bushnell told Ars they wanted to start this project to do their own thing, not just rep other brands. This space is Two Bit Circus' first attempt at launching a series of venues across the country that the founders hope will revive both the arcade and the carnival for digitally savvy audiences of adventurous 20-somethings and families. (At least, the space will be family friendly until 9pm, at which time it will shift gears for adults.) I took a multi-hour tour of the still-under-construction space, played several of the games, talked with the staff, and took lots of pictures. Two Bit Circus is broken up into several sections, with a circular bar in the center. This is the entrance to the still under-cunstruction Midway, an area that includes digital takes on traditional circus attractions. Here, a class carnival game that involves pushing balls on tethers to hit targets is given a video game twist that resembles Rampage. In addition to games, the Midway contains digital art installations. Here, attendees can sit behind TVs and have their faces displayed on them with oldschool distortion and noise. The staff is still fine-tuning their games. Here they can be seen testing one, but I wasn't sure exactly what the game was. They're looking at a digital projection, but are manipulating the game with these giant control balls. This is a VR room that guests can book for a few dollars an hour. It contains a VR headset and a variety of VR games—some you might know from your own VR setup, some unique to the setting. I saw a whole lot of HTC Vive headsets in the Arena. In this ""ModulMaze"" from AsterionVR, you put on a VR headset and navigate a maze. The real maze maps to the geometry of the in-VR environment, and there are multiple environments. Adjacent to that VR maze, you'll find the Story Rooms. These are bookable rooms that range from escape rooms with a digital twist, to a simulated Space Team-like starship bridge with multiple users. Traditional gamers will most likely head to The Arkane, a section dedicated to pinball machines and arcade cabinets new and old. A rotating set of classic arcade games like Street Fighter can be found here. There are pinball machines too. These elongated arcade cabinets are called ""Skidoos."" They run custom games, some of which are provided by third-party developers using Two Bit Circus' API. Instead of cashing in for tokens, you use these machines to load up refillable cards that let you play games around the venue. Many of the games are made for four players, not one or two. Here's a 4-player air hockey table. Here's another multiplayer game: this wall of buttons plays like the kids' game Twister. You'll also find this unusual musical instrument installation in the Arkane. Microsoft's Kinect is ubiquitous. This room is called Club 01. It seats dozens of people, and the space plans nightly events like trivia and live shows. Guests can answer questions on their own private touchscreens as part of group activities. A projector shows results on the wall, and an MC leads the activities on a stage. There's a dining area with an executive chef who serves ""farm-to-carnival"" fare. Nearby, a circular bar has these seats, for some reason. This robot bartender named ""Guillermo del Pouro"" can serve a variety of drinks. Its face changes to different animations and icons to enable it to communicate. There's a human bartender there too. There's a VIP area with comfy couches above the main space. Two Bit Circus employees and contractors work behind these windows, overlooking the park. The venue is broken into several sections: The Midway : A digital take on traditional circus games and attractions The Arkane : An arcade full of pinball machines, multi-player digital games, and arcade cabinets both old and new The Arena : A set of VR booths for playing a bunch of popular VR games, including multiple Battlezone stations Story Rooms : A set of room-scale experiences like escape rooms and a Space Team-like starship bridge simulator Club 01 : An interactive theater for dozens of attendees to participate in software-driven variety and game shows with live hosts A dining area : With a menu of food, snacks, and drinks prepared by a chef specifically for the menu The Arkane features not just classic arcade games, but new cabinets unique to the venue called ""Skidoos."" These can load up third-party games, and Two Bit Circus has an API that will allow indie developers to make games for them. (There's even a Unity plugin.) The company plans to rotate games in and out over time. The entire space runs on software called Walnut, which ties in with that API. The software can also be used to control the venue (or multiple venues, if the company launches more in the future) with lights and more. This ties into the idea that Two Bit Circus is not just an arcade, but an explorable space that tells stories itself. There are vending machines that spit out clues to find secret passages, and so on. Much of this can be managed with the venue's software. The idea of a VR arcade isn't new (or even uncommon), but Two Bit Circus is a much more robust operation that adds live performance, circus attractions, escape rooms, and more. Entry will be free, but the venue will charge for games, food, drinks, and room rentals—just like a Chuck E Cheese's restaurant. Two Bit Circus hopes to eventually open additional spaces in new cities, scaling the concept across the United States. For those in LA, Two Bit Circus will open to the public on September 7.",Digital takes on classic carnival and arcade ideas abound in this new LA space.,2018-08-22T23:06:05Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Inside Two Bit Circus, LA’s new VR and arcade amusement park",https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/inside-two-bit-circus-las-new-vr-and-arcade-amusement-park/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_4844-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,twister,1
Claudia Koerner,"At least 66 men and women were arrested on suspicion of possessing less than an ounce of marijuana and booked into jail over the weekend after police broke up a house party in Georgia. Police in Cartersville, a suburb of Atlanta, said they responded to a home around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday after a 911 call reported gunshots. When officers arrived, they smelled marijuana and found partygoers fleeing, Cartersville police said. The party had been billed as a Christmas lingerie-themed celebration for a 21st birthday and promised Jell-O shots, strip Twister, and beer pong, according to an invitation obtained by local TV station WXIA. People at the party told a reporter that the reported gunshots were actually fireworks. As they investigated, officers found a semiautomatic handgun and saw marijuana, Cartersville police said. Because of the presence of pot and the large number of people inside the house — including several minors — they notified the county drug task force. Ultimately, at least 66 people were booked into the Bartow County Jail after being arrested by the drug task force, jail records show. After obtaining a search warrant for the home, the drug task force reported finding an additional gun, which had been reported stolen from Detroit. Marijuana and smoking devices were found throughout most of the first-floor rooms, within the reach or control of each of the individuals who were arrested, the task force said. Jail records show the men and women arrested were primarily in their late teens and early 20s. Each was booked on suspicion of a misdemeanor charge, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana. Four men were also booked on suspicion of felonies related to other drug possession. For the misdemeanor, bail was set at $1,000. Some of the party attendees remained behind bars through Tuesday before posting bond, WSB reported. According to the Daily Tribune News, several of the people arrested were ""prominent high school athletes."" Many of them were black. The Georgia NAACP said it will investigate the arrests on behalf of all the young people arrested, black or white. In a statement, Cartersville police said the drug task force had been called onto the scene because of a long-standing policy — which is now under review. ""It has been a long-standing policy of the Cartersville Police Department that drug investigations routine patrol officers encounter are referred to the Bartow Cartersville Drug Task Force,"" police said in a statement. ""This current policy is now under review for any further drug investigations.""",The Georgia NAACP said it was investigating whether police overstepped by taking dozens of young men and women to jail on suspicion of possessing less than one ounce of pot.

"USA TODAY, Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","The death toll is expected to rise as authorities continue recovery efforts in Lee County, Alabama, after the deadliest tornado outbreak in years.
 USA TODAY
The tornado that devastated rural parts of eastern Alabama on Sunday left behind a deathly trail, compared by one observer to a giant knife scraping the ground.
Early reports put the number of casualties at 23, but that figure could rise as rescuers search amid the destroyed homes for victims.
The town of Beauregard, an unincorporated community of about 10,000 in Lee County, took a major hit from the twister, whose winds were estimated at 160 mph.
All we could do is just hold on for life and pray, said Jonathan Clardy, who huddled with his family inside their Beauregard trailer as the tornado ripped the roof off. Its a blessing from God that me and my youngns are alive.
Identities of the victims are starting to emerge.
Taylor Thornton
The Lee-Scott Academy, a Christian school in Auburn, Ala., reported on its Facebook page the passing of its fourth-grade student, saying Taylor was welcomed into the arms of Jesus as the result of the severe weather event in Lee County yesterday.
Our hearts at Lee-Scott Academy are broken this morning. Please pray for the Thornton family, our students, faculty, and staff during this difficult time.
The posting mentions that a GoFundMe page has been established on behalf of Taylors family. The page, which had already surpassed its goal of $15,000 by raising nearly $21,000 as of midday Monday, identifies the girls parents as Ashley and David Thornton of Auburn.

Words dont even come close to imagining the pain they are enduring, it says on the page, which requests donations to cover funeral expenses and/or prayers for the family. Taylor was an amazing example of a child of God. She brought so much joy to all that knew her. She was loved dearly and will forever be missed.
Our hearts are mourning with you Ashley and David. You raised an amazing daughter that fulfilled her purpose on this earth and it now with her creator. This community loves you both, and baby McCrae so much and will continue to walk through this by your side.

(March 4)
 AP
WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump said he will travel to Alabama on Friday to visit with the victims of a devastating tornado that killed at least 23 people. 
The tornado was part of a powerful storm system that ripped through parts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia over the weekend. The area had been warned of possible tornadoes days before the storm, but some Alabama residents were warned only eight to nine minutes before the killer twister struck.

""I'll be heading to Alabama on Friday,"" Trump said during a veterans event at the White House. ""It's been a tragic situation. But a lot of good work is being done."" 
Trump has made several trips to visit with the victims of natural disasters in recent months, including to California after last year's wild fires and to the Carolinas following Hurricane Florence.

The president was expected to travel to his resort in Florida this weekend to attend a fundraiser. Further details of his Alabama trip were not immediately available, and the White House has generally kept a close hold on schedule details for such trips until the president is on the ground.    
Trump said hes been in touch with the governors of Alabama and Georgia since the tornado struck.  
Authorities in Alabama released the names of the 23 victims of Sunday's tornado, including seven in one family, while meteorologists warned that another blast of severe weather could roar through the region in coming days.

YouTube says it plans to ban comments on most videos featuring young minors amid concerns of pedophiles using the platform to exploit children.
The video sharing platform, owned by Google parent company Alphabet, began disabling comments over the last week on ""tens of millions of videos that could be subject to predatory behavior.""
YouTube says in the coming months it's ""broadening this action to suspend comments on videos featuring young minors and videos featuring older minors that could be at risk of attracting predatory behavior."" 
Last week, several major companies began pulling advertisements from the site over concerns of ads being played on videos where child exploitation was occurring in the comments.
In the video comments, posters often note the time of the video in which children are in the most exploitative positions while doing gymnastics, playing Twister or doing yoga.
More: AT&amp;T, Disney, Epic Games drop YouTube ads over concerns of pedophile comments on videos
AT&amp;T and Epic Games, the publisher of massively popular online video game ""Fortnite,"" were among the high-profile companies to pull ads.
Concerns began after an investigation by Wired and videos posted by video blogger Matt Watson showed how the exploitation occurred. Wired found ""scores of videos"" with children in suggestive positions, and many of the videos had comments numbering in the hundreds of thousands or more.
YouTube responded last week by disabling and removing comments, removing accounts that made inappropriate comments and reporting illegal comments to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children.
YouTube said Thursday that some channels would be able to keep comments for videos with young minors but that they would need to actively monitor their comments and work directly with YouTube on the issue.
The company also says it will launch a new tool that better classifies comments and can identify and remove predatory behavior.
""We recognize that comments are a core part of the YouTube experience and how you connect with and grow your audience. At the same time, the important steps were sharing today are critical for keeping young people safe,"" YouTube said in a statement.

"Drew Schwartz, Lauren Messman","A Christmas and lingerie-themed birthday party outside Atlanta devolved into chaos on New Year's Eve after cops allegedly found a small amount of weed inside and carted more than 60 people off to jail, WSB-TV reports. Now, dozens of folks who were just looking to have a good time are fighting charges they say they don't deserve. Deja Heard told WSB-TV she rented the house in Cartersville, Georgia, on Airbnb for her 21st birthday. According to WXIA, the December 30 party promised a few Jell-O shots, ""drunk/strip Twister,"" and beer pong, but quickly got out of hand after a neighbor phoned the local police department to report hearing gunshots. When they showed up just after 2 AM on Sunday, the cops said they smelled pot outside the party and walked into the house to investigate, finding roughly 70 people inside—including a few high school athletes, the Cartersville Daily Tribune reports. According to a press release, the local cops called in the Bartow-Cartersville Drug Task Force to search the property. The search allegedly turned up a small amount of weed, a stolen handgun and two other firearms, a baggie of what's believed to be cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. When no one fessed up to owning the pot, at least 63 partygoers between the ages of 15 and 31 were booked and charged for possession of less than an ounce of weed, the Daily Tribune reports. ""All the subjects at the residence were placed under arrest for the possession of the suspected marijuana which was within everyone’s reach or control,"" Bartow-Cartersville Drug Task Force's major, Mark Mayton, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In interviews with WSB-TV, those arrested Sunday claimed the cops barged in without a warrant, and that the gunshots they responded to were actually just fireworks. Attendees also said the police roughed them up, binding them in zip ties and threatening to tase them. ""All of us are innocent,"" Heard told WSB-TV. ""It's just not right."" Several folks who were arrested have hired lawyers to fight their charges, and Georgia's NAACP has stepped in to help investigate what went down on Sunday morning. According to BuzzFeed News, the partygoers were each slapped with $1,000 bond, and some remained in jail until Tuesday before posting it.

Hannah Gold,"In November, Macauley Culkin announced that the fans would choose his middle name, all they had to do was vote on his website, Bunny Ears. He said hed make the adjustment in the new year, leaving Carson in the dust.
Well, the media was a bit slow on the uptake, but this Christmas Culkin announced the winning name. Its Macaulay Culkin. Whats the opposite of a tongue twister?
I say no big deal! Middle names are mostly silent and there to embarrass you on your passport. Sometimes they are meaningful (a grandparents first name, your moms last name, a beloved pop star), oftentimes not. It really depends.
A hyphenated last name on the other hand would have been bold. That shit sticks to you. Macaulay Macaulay-Culkin-Culkin is something you have to say all of, its just grammar. And grammar rules everything around us.

Ethan Gach,"Fewer and fewer new releases find their way into arcades these days. Even the latest version of Street Fighter, a series synonymous with the scene, ended up forgoing an official arcade cabinet having settled instead solely on the virtual arena of online multiplayer. Fortunately, there are still people trying to preserve the feeling of local co-op with new machines. The arcade cabinet for RotoRing is one example. A light puzzle game created by Gregory Kogos, t he original prototype was a small tabletop configuration with a tiny control mechanism and a little light display. There are concentric circles with small lights that rotate through them. The player controls a different light and has to hopscotch through the rings without colliding with on of the other lights. Putting it into a full-blown cabinet, however, makes it an infinitely more approachable experience, especially for the types of social spaces where the game does best in. The Mashing is another. Designer and artist James Medd put it together as part of the Awkward Arcade, a curated collection of small games with the intent of getting people to mix it up socially. It included the work of Anna Anthropy, Paolo Pedercini, and others, each manifested in physical form, whether a small arcade machine intended for a lap or table or a stand-alone-sided one. As “a love letter to and a critique of button-mashing,” The Mashing tried to play off the feeling of when you’re outclassed in a fighting game match and it all goes to shit. But rather than channel that jumbled desperation into a violent collision of pixels, Medd’s game has two teams of up to five players press their buttons as quickly as possible to try and pump up a square projected on the screen of the same color. Whoever square gets biggest wins. Though its commentary on button mashing might appear a bit on the nose, it clearly has something more in common with Twister than a high-strung competitive match. No doubt even more so if you’ve had a few to drink. And the people playing these games in their arcade cabinet habitat most likely will have, since these projects have increasingly found a home in boozy get-togethers and night clubs. We Throw Switches is one of the groups that’s helped coordinate their production. It both loans them out for other people’s events as well as showcases the machines at its own annual GamesAreForEveryone event in Edinburgh. “We tend to keep a lot of the curation under wraps until that night, because we love the sense of discovery that people get moving through the venue and seeing what’s in each vault, and around each corner,” said Andrew Dyce and Craig Fairweather, the duo who runs We Throw Switches, in an email. “For Vol.VI we’ve got a double-ended dog simulator, a googley-eyed VR dance game, a 4 player architectural co-op game, and a chance to reign majestically—it should be wild!” Some of the group’s arcade cabinets were at this year’s EGX, one of the UK’s biggest gaming expos held in September. Others are currently on display at the Paradigm Electronic Arts festival going on right now in Edinburgh. “We have a really diverse audience, as well, which is really cool,” they said. “It’s devs and creators and people who are are really into games, through to people who are just curious and want have a drink and explore.” Their work has even drawn fans to visit multiple events in the hopes of getting more time on a specific machine since most of the games aren’t playable in the same way with just a computer and keyboard. “We had a really lovely moment when we showed them in the V&amp;A Museum in September where someone managed to just blast through RotoRing so quickly on their first try,” said Dyce and Fairweather. “It turns out that they’d actually played the cabinet a tonne up at EGX, and it was super cool to know that this person already had a history with this one-of-a-kind cabinet that we’d only showed like three times, hundreds of miles apart. That was awesome.” The cabinets were designed by them specifically in the ways they thought would best show off the experimental games they’d be placing inside. The cabinets are still adaptable for things like wired pads, keyboards, and mice but are also able to house joysticks, buttons, and the occasional alternative controller. “We also designed the cabs to be a sort of be an installation in their own right,” they said. “We wanted them to be intriguing, physical things that draw you to them, even before you know what games they’re showing. Shape-wise, they’re large enough that they have a real presence in a space, and we also decided pretty early on that we wanted each cab to have its own distinct personality, so they all have a different art style commissioned from a different local artist. (Part of what we like most about this is that, because every cabinet is different, it allows people to form attachments and have favorites, which is ace).” Unfortunately, the nature of an arcade cabinet means it’s hyper-localized, and We Throw Switches isn’t in the business of mass producing its cabinets yet. They are hardly alone though. Every day, other designers like them with a passion for both video games and artful craftsmanship have set themselves to creating the arcade machines of the future. Left only to the predilections of big game publishers, arcade cabinets would surely go extinct. For now, however, others have taken up the call.","Fewer and fewer new releases find their way into arcades these days.

Beth Elderkin,"Welcome to the Gaming Shelf, io9's new roundup of tabletop gaming news, releases, updates, and interesting Kickstarter campaigns—focusing on sci-fi and fantasy games, with the occasional exception of course ( Machi Koro is too cute to ignore!). Seeing as we’re on the heels of GenCon, board game companies have been showing off some of their best and brightest stuff over the past few weeks. Even as we head into mid-August, there’s still a lot of great scoops and news. Here’s a few of the highlights we spotted for this week. News and Releases Horizon: Zero Dawn Board Game Steamforged Games recently announced it’s making a tabletop version of popular PS4 video game Horizon: Zero Dawn. The company hasn’t released much information about what it’s going to look like or how the gameplay will go, but it will be a tabletop miniatures game that looks to have some impressive robot dinosaur miniatures. The Kickstarter is expected to launch soon. Machi Koro Legacy To Celebrate Machi Koro’s fifth anniversary, the series is getting a Legacy Edition! I’m a huge fan of narrative games, so naturally, this has me pumped. According to Pandasaurus Games, the new Machi Koro Legacy will have a narrative arc that takes place over 10 games. After completion, players will have their own custom game they can continue using. Pandasaurus worked with famed legacy game maker Rob Daviau (Pandemic Legacy, Risk Legacy) to create this version, and it will feature new artwork from Nobura Hotta, the original artist for Machi Koro. The game is set to come out next spring. Return to Dark Tower Following its successful Fireball Island Kickstarter campaign from earlier this year, Restoration Games (which revitalizes and re-releases older board games) has announced its next project: revamping Dark Tower, a popular electronic board game from the 1980s where players race to defeat a great evil at the top of a big tower. According to a post in Beasts of War, this version may differ a bit from the previous one, as it could be cooperative instead of competitive. The game will get a Kickstarter campaign sometime next year and is expected to come out in 2020. Forbidden Lands Free League Publishing’s latest open-world survival fantasy RPG, featuring lore by fantasy author Erik Granström and art by Nils Gulliksson and Simon Stålenhag (Tales From The Loop), has released its digital copy to Kickstarter backers. Anyone else who wants early access can make a pledge on the website, but only through Sept. 1. The Witcher Pen &amp; Paper RPG The much-anticipated The Witcher tabletop RPG is finally here for digital download for $25. Announced over three years ago by R. Talsorian Games, the role-playing game takes place between The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 3, and lets players create their own monster hunters. Not everyone gets to play as Geralt, okay! I know we all want to, but we can’t. A’Writhe: A Game of Eldritch Contortions Think Twister meets Lovecraftian horror. A’Writhe: A Game of Eldritch Contortions is now available. Players join up in teams of two—one is a cultist, the other is a Great Old One—and work together to bring the Great Old One to our plane of existence. The cultist tells their deity where to place their limbs on a series of landmarks, and the deity obeys, creating a mash of limbs and god worship that’s perfect for people who think Twister doesn’t summon enough evil magic. Expansions Guardians of the Abyss (Arkham Horror: The Card Game) Fantasy Flight Games hosted a special event at this year’s GenCon called The Eternal Slumber, an investigation and storyline which will continue at Arkham Nights 2018, which takes place in October. The 1-4 player standalone scenario is called Guardians of the Abyss, and surrounds a mysterious curse in Cairo, Egypt that’s putting people into comas. It’s now available for pre-order—for those who are interested in experiencing this year’s event for themselves. Return to the Watch (A Game of Thrones Catan) Another expansion from Fantasy Flight Games, this brings more of the Brotherhood of the Night’s Watch to A Game of Thrones Catan. This is a follow-up extension to the Brotherhood of the Watch 5-6 Player Extension that came out last year, and brings new threats and hero cards—including Jon Snow himself, as the newest member of the crew. Uprising Hero Pack (Guardians) Plaid Hat Games’ Guardians tactical card game is getting a new hero pack featuring four new heroes: Atrivoxx (a shadowy figure who can manipulate aberrant Void energy), Chamber (a daredevil pilot with an arm cannon), Nightshade (who can control nature), and Pandora (who has the ability to reshape time). General rules about Guardians can be found here. Crowdfunding Saban’s Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid A board game for 2-5 players—though honestly, you’re gonna want five—where you team up to save Angel Grove from Rita Repulsa and her army of monsters. The Renegade Game Studios game has already surpassed its fundraising goal and will be on Kickstarter until Sept. 6. The game is expected to come out next summer. Free Spacer A sandbox tabletop RPG where players team up as a starship crew that works on different contracts during a quadrant-wide civil war. As creator Christoph Sapinsky puts it: “We play to find out how the crew gets the job done, the choices they make, the rules they break, and the lengths they will go for their patrons.” It will be on Kickstarter through Sept. 18, and the game is expected to come out next May. Control &amp; Chaos (Unstable Unicorns) This is a Kickstarter-only expansion for Ramy Badie’s competitive card game Unstable Unicorns, and lets participants become directly involved in the process of observing how the Unstable Unicorns Universe (or UUU) is being expanded, and even sometimes deciding what characters get made. Control &amp; Chaos reached its fundraising goal in less than half an hour, and it will be on Kickstarter through Sept. 14. The expansion is set to come out next March, but again, it’s only for people who participate in the Kickstarter. Nights of Payne Town (City of Mist) This is the first story arc expansion for City of Mist, a neo-noir tabletop RPG “where legends and stories incarnate in ordinary people, granting them mythical powers.” Figures like Captain Hook and Little Red Riding Hood find themselves embodied in regular citizens, unbeknownst to the rest of the city, forcing them to join the criminal underbelly. Nights of Payne Town will include 10 individual cases that connect into one overarching plot. It’s already reached its fundraising goal and will be on Kickstarter until Aug. 31. The expansion is set to come out next March. Dungeon Challenge Cards For any GMs looking for some interesting new dungeon twists and turns, Philip Reed has made a series of challenge cards that can be used to randomly generate new dungeon crawl objectives. It will be on Kickstarter until Aug. 24, and the cards are set to come out this December.

"USA TODAY, Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY","An Alabama coroner says all 23 people found dead after a tornado have been identified, with their ages ranging from 6 to 93. He says one family alone lost seven people. (March 5)
 AP
BEAUREGARD, Ala.  Jordan Miller now knows the terror that comes from calling 911 and not getting help. Thankfully, he also knows how to use a chainsaw.
Miller, 17, survived the Sunday afternoon tornado that devastated a swath of his rural hometown and killed 23 people, including his best friend's grandmother. His skills with a chainsaw helped save several lives.
Miller huddled with his friend's family inside their double-wide mobile home on Lee Road  his friend's sister, mom and grandmother beneath a mattress  as the twister roared through, plucking the house from the ground and tossing it like a toy.
""Ain't nobody in Beauregard deserved this,"" Miller said Monday night after helping sort through debris at the home. Sitting in a battered pickup plastered with tornado-shredded grass and mud, Miller shuddered as he remembered what happened barely 24 hours earlier.
We heard it coming, but by the time we knew what it was, it hit us. Thats when all hell broke loose, said Steve Whatley, 36, a refrigerator mechanic who owns the home where Miller sheltered. It picked us up and dumped us back down 50 feet away.

The winds were so intense, they ""sucked the contacts out of my eyes,"" Whatley said in disbelief.
Whatleys wife remains hospitalized with multiple injuries, grieving the loss of her home and her mother, Vicki Braswell, 69.

The mobile home collapsed upon its occupants, trapping the three women beneath the mattress and a wall. Whatley, his son and Miller squirmed free and tried to lift the wall from the women. Too heavy.
Miller called 911, the phone ringing and ringing and ringing. A full minute went by.  No one answered.
Panic began to set in. The women were trapped, injuries obvious. The wind had died and an eerie calm fall over the area as the temperature plummeted. 
""It's like we were all alone,"" Miller said. ""You call the one person you call when you need help, and nothing.""
Rain poured from the sky, soaking the men as they frantically tried to rescue the women. That's when Miller remembered the chainsaw sitting in Whatley's nearby shed  a shed mangled beyond recognition by a storm that snapped trees like toothpicks and sent power lines snaking across the road. He grabbed the saw from where the wind jammed it into the ground, fired it up and got to work.

""Once I saw the girls were stuck, my first thought was 'Find the chainsaw, 'cause thats the only thing that will work,'"" Miller said.
The chainsaw made quick work of cutting the wall into smaller pieces, freeing the three women. Whatley said they tried CPR on his mother-in-law but couldn't save her.
Miller and the others then ran down the road, helping those who were hurt, including an Alabama state trooper and neighbor who was trapped and injured. Miller said he pulled a piece of metal off the trooper and rushed off to help others. Authorities say the trooper suffered significant injuries and remains hospitalized. Rubber gloves used by medics still litter the area.

Picking up the pieces
The twister was part of a brutal storm system packing strong winds that also roared through parts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida on Sunday. Meteorologists say it hit Lee County as an EF4 tornado with winds of 170 mph, slicing a nearly mile-wide path over at least 24 miles.
About 10,000 people live in Beauregard, which is 60 miles east of Montgomery and has a few small stores, two schools and a volunteer fire department along the main highway. Monday night, stunned residents continued their cleanup and tried to work through their grief at the loss of life and property.
Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said the 23 dead ranged in age from a 6-year-old boy to an 89-year-old man. Names and ages of victims were released at news conference Tuesday in Lee County, Alabama, held by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and local law enforcement. One man lost seven family members, officials said. 
Many of the people who died were sucked from their homes and either thrown or hit by swirling debris  including one victim who died after being tossed into a parked car outside as surviving family members watched in horror, Harris said.

Whatley and his friends spent several hours on Monday picking through the crushed remains of his family home. A native of the area, Whatley rubbed his eyes as he thought of what might come next. The fresh scent of pine from the broken and cut trees hung in the air as he surveyed the damage, the clean smell at stark odds with the devastation on display.
Pink fiberglass insulation torn from homes fluttered in the shattered trees. Nearby, a cabinet drawer sat alongside the road, hairbrushes and rollers apparently thrown clear by wind but left otherwise untouched. The remains of Whatley's beige trailer slumped against a tree, its top snapped off.

""That's my house upside down, right there,"" he said with a sigh.
About 100 volunteers descended on Whatley's property earlier in the day, combing through the rubble to find clothes, pictures, cookware, even a mattress that escaped without much damage.
Mostly gone are the trees that once surrounded Whatley's property, snapped off by the wind. Debris remains scattered along the winding two-lane road, even though utility workers have already replaced dozens of downed power poles.
Scars for years to come
A few driveways down, Kevin Davis, 41, burned a towering pile of branches, sparks soaring high into the cold night air. Like Whatley, Davis' home was once completely screened from passing drivers, the trees encircling a cozy compound of buildings. Davis' property suffered little damage, even though it's only about 1/3 a mile away from where Whatley's once stood.
""Yesterday, I was scared for the first time in my life,"" said Davis, a crane operator, as he watched the bonfire.

The Sanford Middle School parking lot became Harris' makeshift morgue, where coroners and investigators brought 22 of the victims' bodies. The 23rd body was that of a child who suffered major injuries and who was rushed to a hospital, where he died, Harris said.
As a cold rain fell, Harris watched as morticians and hearse drivers wheeled the bodies from a refrigerated trailer into hearses and minivans, each covered carefully with a blue blanket, workers' breath steaming in the near-freezing temperatures.
Harris called upon Alabama's S-MORT volunteers  coroners and funeral home workers  to assist with the body recovery, identification and cause of death. He then sat with the families for about four hours on Monday afternoon and evening, formalizing IDs and explaining how their loved ones died.

He said many family members knew their kin had died, simply because so many families were together on Sunday afternoon when the storm hit on a warm Sunday afternoon.
""I thought I could handle this, but I found out right quick it was beyond my scope,"" Harris, 64, said. Still, he's already focused on the future. This community, he said, has shown ""phenomenal"" strength and resilience.
Miller and Whatley acknowledge their hometown will look very different for decades to come.
Even once the physical damage has been repaired or removed, Beauregard will bear the scars from this disaster. Family celebrations will be irrevocably altered, schools will be missing kids, and churches will memorialize parishioners who perished.
""I wish I could just go to sleep and wake up in a few years,"" Miller said.

Reuters,"Children walk among debris thrown up by a tornado in Havana, Cuba, Monday, January 28, 2019. (Source: AP Photo)
A rare tornado ripped through several working-class districts of eastern Havana late on Sunday, leaving at least three dead and scores injured as it tore off roofs, flipped vehicles and reduced some of the buildings in its path to rubble.
The twister was the strongest to hit Havana in nearly 80 years, according to Jose Rubiera, a meteorologist with the Cuban weather service. It left the streets of the worse-hit neighborhoods strewn with shards of glass and debris as well as downed trees and power lines.
“The noise made it seem like a plane was crashing down on us,” said Victoria Infanta Rodriguez, 47, surveying the wreckage of her home. “But when you looked it was more like a big ball of flame – something red, red, red as if the whole country had caught fire.”
Infanta Rodriguez said her family had huddled in a corner of their home like Russian nesting dolls as the tornado sucked off the roof – she sheltered her 12-year-old son and her husband sheltered her, taking the brunt of the flying debris that scratched and bruised his back.
“All we have left is the skeleton of the house,” she said. Like many of her neighbors in the capital’s eastern borough of Regla, the tornado had smashed many of her belongings and appliances while the rain had soaked the rest.
Rubiera told state-run news agency Prensa Latina the damage wrought suggested it was an “EF4” tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale, the second most powerful category with winds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kph).
President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who toured Regla shortly after the tornado hit, earlier tweeted a preliminary toll of three dead and 172 injured.
As of 1830 EST (2330 GMT), the official toll had not been updated.
Odalys Diaz, 51, said her neighbor was killed when the roof of a nearby five-storey building came crashing down onto his which then collapsed on top of him.
Concrete debris also smashed into her flat, tearing down the wall of one room and shattering the windows.
“There was glass flying everywhere, I tried to hide under the bed,” Diaz said.
The worst-hit areas – Regla, 10 de Octubre, Guanabacoa and San Miguel de Padron – are also among the most dilapidated, meaning the buildings stood a lesser chance of withstanding such strong winds.
“When I rushed up to the first floor to look for my mother, I found this disaster – the roof and front wall had gone, and she’d fallen into the street,” said Victor Leiva Ramos, 41.
Leiva Ramos, who was injured while trying to find her in the rubble, including a severed tendon, had his arm bandaged. His 73-year-old mother survived with a few fractures.
Cuba prides itself on suffering relatively few deaths in hurricane season due in part to a rigorous evacuation scheme.
Yet the tornado took Havana by surprise.
State-run media had only warned residents that an approaching cold front from the north and winds from the south would create high winds, thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the area.
Rubiera was later cited as saying that such phenomena were virtually impossible to predict when they affected such concentrated areas.
Diaz-Canel said the council of ministers had held an emergency meeting early on Monday to assess the damage and take the necessary steps to speed up the recovery work.","The twister was the strongest to hit Havana in nearly 80 years, according to Jose Rubiera, a meteorologist with the Cuban weather service.",2019-01-29T01:49:53Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}","Rare tornado ravages Havana, at least three killed",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/rare-tornado-ravages-havana-at-least-three-killed-5558694/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/01/havana-759.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,twister,1
AppleInsider,"A key Apple engineer responsible for leading development teams working on proprietary processor core designs has left the company after nine years of service, according to a report on Friday. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNET reports Gerard Williams III vacated his seat as Apple's senior director in platform architecture in February. 
Williams joined the company in 2010 after a 12-year stint at ARM, where he worked as a fellow on various projects including the development of legacy ARM chips, as well as Cortex-A8, Cortex-A15 and next-generation processor technology. Prior to ARM, the engineer was design team lead at Texas Instruments, where he assisted in the development of the TI TMS470 micro-controller program, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
At Apple, Williams spearheaded core design for in-house Apple chips like the A7, which debuted in iPhone 5s as the world's first 64-bit mobile processor. 
""Chief Architect for all Apple CPU and SOC development. For CPU, lead the Cyclone, Typhoon, Twister, Hurricane, Monsoon, and Vortex architecture work. And everyday, I still work on very very cool stuff,"" Williams writes in his LinkedIn bio.
Building on the A7's success, Apple has gone on to release multiple A-series chip generations, each with Williams helming core design. More recently, Williams' duties expanded to encompass not only the processor core, but also the layout of components on Apple's system-on-chip silicon, the report said. The escalation in responsibility came with the departure of SoC architect Manu Gulati, who left Apple for a similar role at Google in 2017.
A now-former report to SVP of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji, considered the mastermind behind Apple's in-house chip team, Williams leaves a significant hole in the company's executive lineup.
The reason for Williams' departure is unknown. According to CNET sources, the engineer has yet to take a position at another company.","A key Apple engineer responsible for leading development teams working on proprietary processor core designs has left the company after nine years of service, according to a report on Friday.",2019-03-29T21:40:33Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Appleinsider.com'}",Apple engineer who led development of A7 through A12X chip cores departs company,https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/29/apple-engineer-who-led-development-of-a7-through-a12x-chip-cores-departs-company,https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/30390-49820-a7-130920-xl.jpg,,Appleinsider.com,twister,1
Doug Lynch,"Much like Google’s has a team of researchers working on experimental applications, Microsoft has its own. It’s called Microsoft Garage, and it recently published a new tool for iOS and Android called Outings. Outings lets you explore, discover, and search for interesting places around the world. Under the hood is a curated collection of information from high-quality travel blogs and image galleries, all of which is quite educational. Even if you aren’t planning on taking a trip to, say, the lavender capital of North America, Outings can teach you about it and show you gorgeous photographs from it. We’ve talked about a few of the projects that Microsoft Garage’s released over the years. One of these — Arrow Launcher, which we covered in October 2015 — and it became the Microsoft Launcher. A few months later, the team published an application called Mimicker Alarm, an alarm clock that forced you to mime actions like making a certain facial expression, reciting a tongue twister, or getting out of bed before the alarm would switch off. If one thing’s for sure, it’s that Microsoft Garage is an inventive bunch that loves to experiement. Here’s hoping they don’t slow down the pace of innovation anytime soon.

Jon Ryan,"I made a blimp out of a tow truck, need I say more? By Jon Ryan I spent countless hours in Just Cause 3 and it’s subsequent DLCs doing little more than wingsuiting around, blowing up bridges and messing with the physics engine. The fun of Just Cause has always been hurling vehicles around, tethering items together, and attaching rocket thrusters to things that have no business having rocket thrusters attached. If the number of times I found myself ugly-laughing as the newly-redesigned Apex engine worked its magic in my recent hands-on demo was any indication, I’m probably going to end up dumping countless more hours into Just Cause 4. That said, while the impossibly chaotic action that ensued as I chased a massive tornado across an airfield was an impressive spectacle, for my money the best part of our 30-minute hands-on gameplay demo was the simple tutorial section where we were introduced Rico’s new and improved grappling hook. We first saw the new Grapple Mods in action during our first look at JC4 at E3 2018, but getting to actually put them to use is an entirely different experience than just seeing them in action. Even in the simple tutorial area, experimenting with combinations of the new Booster Mod, which adds small rocket engines to your grapple point, and the Airlift Mod, which deploys a Fulton-esque balloon that can lift objects off the ground, ended in hoots of laughter and more than the occasional “awwwww” as an unsuspecting NPC’s car was flung into the air and propelled off into the sunset. These new mods came in especially handy during the mission demo as well - as you may have seen in the new gameplay trailer (you can watch it in the video above), once the tornado reaches the airfield, it’s kept at by giant wind cannons that Rico must destroy to progress the mission. They teased an idea in the trailer that I thought I’d give a try - using the booster grapples to turn the air cannon into a deadly whirligig worked like a charm, as not only did the tornado edge closer, but the cannon proceeded to careen around the airfield like a giant steel balloon with its knot cut. Things got messier (read: way better) when the next cannon got the same treatment, only this time I added Airlifters to make sure that it stayed airborne, blasting unsuspecting enemies and vehicles into the path of the oncoming twister. Watching the cyclone rip through the cars, trucks, planes and chaos objects that dotted what was left of the airfield - especially as I sped along in my wingsuit to avoid getting sucked in as well - was exhilarating. We did run into a couple of visual hiccups, the most egregious of which was a fluctuating polygon count at the base of the tornado - but it wasn’t noticeable enough to make the action less enjoyable, and according to the dev team graphical tics like that “won’t be in the final game”. That said, even in its most chaotic moments, the framerate held solid, I noticed little to no screen tearing what few loads we witnessed were exceptionally quick. We were playing on PC, likely a high-end one, but based on my experience I’d be surprised if we saw anything akin to the console launch of JC3. My time with Just Cause 4 was all too brief - though it was intensely satisfying, and I’m eager to experiment with all of the chaos-inducing combinations that all of Rico’s new tools offer. Allegedly there are over four million potential combinations, though, so I’ll probably have to settle for my favorite hundred-and-fifty or so when Just Cause 4 releases at the end of this year.",New tools of destruction make Rico's newest adventure the one most rife with possibilities.,2018-08-23T20:50:11Z,"{'id': 'ign', 'name': 'IGN'}",Just Cause 4's New Tools Offer Insane Possibilities,http://ca.ign.com/articles/2018/08/23/just-cause-4-physics-preview-gamescom-2018,http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/10/juc-blog-1528667505373_1280w.jpg,ign,IGN,twister,1

"Dennis Perkins on News, shared by Dennis Perkins to The A.V. Club","Tuesday’s Late Show saw host Stephen Colbert introducing the winner of a fundraising raffle, a nice lady named Rachel who, for her help in raising nearly half a million dollars for the organization Next For Autism, got the ultimate prize of staring at Colbert’s junk for an hour. Okay, technically the prize was the coveted opportunity to sit under Colbert’s Late Show desk for an entire show, but we all know that under desks is where all junk lives. At any rate, Rachel didn’t seem fazed, happily claiming her additional rewards of delivering a Stormy Daniels/Trump/STD punchline during Colbert’s monologue, and asking guest David Cross about his sort-of cameo in Avengers: Infinity War. Plus, Rachel was not alone in cramming herself in close proximity to Stephen Colbert’s nethers. Colbert’s pal, former Daily Show boss, and guy who clearly misses goofing about on late-night TV Jon Stewart joined her under the table. With the game and obviously limber Rachel mugging along, Stewart acted the hooky-playing delinquent, chucking throwing stars at Colbert from below frame, and noisily kicking off a killer game of cubbyhole Twister. “Always a pleasure, first of all, to see your lower half,” joked Stewart, before holding up a proof-of-life fake newspaper (aka: actual fake news) to show that he and the lucky Rachel were, indeed, chilling out unseen by Colbert’s feet. Never let it be said that Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert won’t go all the way for a good cause, and a silly bit.","Tuesday’s Late Show saw host Stephen Colbert introducing the winner of a fundraising raffle, a nice lady named Rachel who, for her help in raising nearly half a million dollars for the organization Next For Autism, got the ultimate prize of staring at Colbert…",2018-05-23T05:31:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",Jon Stewart returns to (the underside of) the late-night desk on The Late Show,https://news.avclub.com/jon-stewart-returns-to-the-underside-of-the-late-nigh-1826249432,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1arUehtM--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/okjg8kti3kyq2pffn5eq.png",,Avclub.com,twister,1

But if you thought SNL cast members broke a lot during the live sketches, you should see what it’s like during the taped segments, where minor flubbed lines aren’t played off so quickly. Jessica Chastain, Ryan Gosling, Kevin Hart, and a number of other Season 43 hosts all make appearances in this four-minute blooper reel that comes to us courtesy of the SNL digital shorts department. While most of the screw-ups are a result of cast members and hosts cracking themselves up or tripping over a tongue-twister, the real highlight is seeing Charles Barkley curse like a sailor each time he messes up a line.

Judith Humphrey,"I was a pretty confident writer when I became a regular contributor for Fast Company three years ago. After all, I’d taught writing at the university level, written several books, and worked with leading CEOs as a corporate speech writer. So I was surprised by how much I had to learn. Working with my editor, Rich Bellis, has given me a new appreciation for what it means to write like a pro. Even if you’re an experienced writer, you can probably polish your skills. Here’s what I’ve learned: 1. Good writing takes collaboration A good editor makes writing—which can be a lonely undertaking —a collaborative process. Collaboration builds strength on strength. Typically, I’ll run four or five ideas by Rich before I undertake a full article. In most cases he’ll say, “Yes, go for it,” or, “Great, I like your idea of structuring the piece around those four instances.” He’ll also tell me when he thinks an idea won’t fly. For example, he told me my proposed, “Get your meeting mojo on,” was too broad and too familiar a topic. Our collaboration at this stage goes beyond his approving my suggestions. Often we’ll toss a story idea back and forth until it works as a publishable piece. He helped refine the focus of one of my recent pieces that became, “How employers can curb depression in the workplace.” He guided me carefully on this deep dive into a sensitive topic. Frequently, Rich provides a better angle than I had envisioned. The bottom line is that the story is always better because we’ve worked together. 2. To grow as a writer, you have to step out of your comfort zone Over the last three years I’ve written 38 articles for Fast Company on a wide variety of topics. Many have been on language and its pitfalls, emotional intelligence, and public speaking skills. But with Rich’s encouragement I’ve ventured further afield, examining the science of happiness, depression in the workplace, my experience with a personal trainer, my newest book, and what I learned when I spent three hours listening to conversations in an elevator. What writer wouldn’t be thrilled to explore such a vast terrain? Right now I’m contemplating a piece on, “What a trained balloon twister can teach us about the workplace.” Thanks to Rich, I remain open to a host of creative ideas. 3. Writing doesn’t have to sound like writing, it can sound like a conversation Rich is also wonderfully skilled at punching up my prose. I never thought of myself as a stuffy writer, but working with him has made me sound clearer, more hip, and engaging. Just look at some of the “before” and “after” lines that reflect his fine editorial touch: Before: The work of leaders is to be found in the very moments when we’re interrupted. After: The true test of leadership—at every level of the workforce—is to make time for others even when it isn’t convenient. Before: To begin with, be sure to reinforce and praise the best ideas put forth in meetings. After: This one’s easy. Praise and reinforce the best ideas you hear being put forth in meetings. But it goes beyond just noting the contributions with, “Great idea.” 4. Your headline should sell your idea without giving it away Finally, Rich has helped me write headlines that advertise the piece without giving everything away. He’s put my headlines and deck titles through the same punching-up process as my prose, and I’m always grateful for it. One title I submitted was, “Don’t wait until year-end: Inspire your team every day with impromptu feedback.” The published headline was, “5 emotionally intelligent ways to inspire your team every single day.” Shorter and snappier. Rich Bellis is heading off to the Wall Street Journal, where I’m sure his skills will help many readers and writers. It has been an honor to work with him, and benefit from his talent and graciousness. Best wishes, Rich, in your new role.","A longtime Fast Company contributor shares the tips she’s gathered for creating compelling writing.

This was the culmination of Adams’ charming recent efforts to pay tribute to Colorado media outlets. First, there was “ 105.5 The Colorado Sound, ” an ode to the song’s namesake radio station, and then there was “Denver7 (Piece Of Heaven),” which he wrote with news anchor Shannon Ogden.

Adams cut a striking figure alongside the buttoned-up anchors, who seem as baffled as they are amused. Adams credits the 1996 movie Twister for his interest in weather before being whisked to a green screen, where he then discusses the city’s forceful winds (“For anybody that’s super into the wind, there you go”) and high temperatures (“95?

Richard Speed,"Lovers of big screens in boardrooms, rejoice! The first of Microsoft's Ginormonitors (aka Windows Collaboration Displays) has arrived at Redmond's partner shindig in Las Vegas. The device, made by UK-based manufacturer Avocor, is the first in Microsoft's range of big screens aimed at users unwilling, or unable, to fork out for a Surface Hub. To stop those customers looking at less expensive options, such as Google's Jamboard, the software giant hopes that big touchscreens into which users plug their own Windows 10-based computers will fill the gap between Hub and traditional whiteboard. The Avocor hardware follows Microsoft's guidelines for its ginormonitors, featuring far-field mics, speakers, cameras and a pen, for all that inky collaborative goodness. IoT connectivity bleats the state of the device back to Azure for administrators to study and the screens come equipped with a single USB-C connector. Handy for plugging in a Windows 10 PC unless you have one of Microsoft's own devices, in which case you'll likely need a dongle. Oops. Equipped with a 20-point touch display, the screen would be ideal for an expensive, if brief, game of Twister, or more likely as a tool for teams or classrooms of students to paw at. It is anyone's guess how big the 60Hz, 4K display actually is. All Avocor would say was that it is ""room scale"", which frankly could mean anything. The company was equally coy when asked about the price and availability of the thing, simply saying it would be launched ""later this summer"". Microsoft will be relieved to see manufacturers beginning to make good on the promise of Windows Collaboration Displays, and those same manufacturers will be eyeing the niche carved out by the Surface Hub and seeking their own piece of the action. Customers, on the other hand, may be delighted to have another way of drawing crude representations of body parts on boards in the minutes before a meeting.

Corinne Iozzio,"I t took Ernõ Rubik more than a month to solve his namesake puzzle the first time. Today, competitive cubers can best the classic brain teaser in less than five seconds, and casual players can do it in minutes. Their not-so-secret weapon is math. More specifically: algorithms. Devising or memorizing sequences of moves that accomplish a particular goal—for instance, swapping two corners—is key to cracking your Rubik’s Cube. When game designers start stacking more layers onto a standard 3-by-3-by-3-square cuboid, it doesn’t change those algorithms much; it just makes the solve mega-tedious. But changing other variables like rotation angles and block depths creates puzzles for many skill levels and breaking points. 1. Easiest The nine-block Floppy Cube is one layer of a classic Rubik’s, so it’s perfect for a beginner twister. When it is scrambled, smooth movers can solve it in as few as eight clicks. Even random guessers will get there eventually; the colors have only 192 possible combinations. 2. Easier Instead of rotating faces, the Dino Cube has rotating corners. The arrangement creates 12 moving parts that can’t go upside down and confuse you. That simplicity means novices can solve the cube by sight alone—no Googling for the algorithms. 3. Easy The Gear Cube is more likely to crunch your fingertips than your gray matter, thanks to the way its toothed pieces intertwine and move together.

"Montgomery Advertiser, Nate Chute, Montgomery Advertiser","President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, visited Beauregard, Alabama Friday to survey the damage left after a powerful tornado roared through the town last Sunday. While there, they visited a row of 23 crosses, one for each person killed. (March 8)
 AP
President Donald Trump signed Bibles for survivors of the Alabama tornado that killed 23 people during a visit of the disaster area on Friday.
During his visit five days after the storm hit, Trump met with state and leaders and assessed the damage for himself in Beauregard. He also met with the families of tornado victims, including Marshall Lynn Grimes, who died alongside his fiance.
Prior to being on the ground, Trump took an aerial tour of the devastation after landing at Fort Benning.
I saw this and its hard to believe, Trump said. You saw things that you wouldnt believe.
After surveying tornado damage with Gov. Kay Ivey, the President's motorcade pulled up to a memorial of 23 crosses in front of Providence Baptist Church. The crosses were constructed and put in place by a volunteer all the way from Illinois.
Trump paused to read the names of the 23 victims, who ranged in age from six to 89, alongside First Lady Melanie Trump. From there, the President entered the church, which has been operating as a shelter since the storm hit.

Volunteer Ada Ingram told reporters that Trump signed several hats and Bibles, including one for a 12-year-old boy, an action which drew applause from people who came to see Trump.
I enjoyed him coming, said Ingram, who said she voted for Trump and would again in 2020. I think its a godsend. Im sorry. The situation is bad. And there are going to be people who will say 'why did he come to my town?' I dont know why. I dont why the hurricane happened [either]. But there is a reason.""
After spending time looking at tornado damage in Alabama, Trump head to Mar-a-Lago for a Friday night fundraiser.

Editors,"Stunned Alabama searches for missing after tornado kills 23
First responders in Alabama continue to hunt for survivors after a devastating tornado killed at least 23 people, injured dozens more, smashed homes, snapped power lines and toppled a massive steel cell tower on Sunday. The tornado was part of a powerful storm system that also ripped through parts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. The area had been warned of possible tornadoes days before the storm, but Lee County residents only had warnings eight to nine minutes before the killer twister struck. Evidence indicated the storm roared through as an EF-4 in strength with winds of about 170 mph. At least three children  ages 6, 9 and 10  have died. The tornado was the nation's most deadly since 2013.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon and Nick Siano and Alyssia Pacheco, USA TODAY","At least 23 people are known dead and more are injured after a tornado struck southeastern Alabama on Sunday. Crews are still searching for more dead and wounded. (March 4)
 AP
First responders in Lee County, Alabama, were picking through the rubble Monday of a devastating tornado that killed at least 23 people and injured dozens more.
The tornado smashed homes and toppled power lines and a massive steel cell tower. The twister was part of a brutal system packing strong winds that also roared through parts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
The devastation is incredible, Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said. Jones said several people were missing, but that it was not clear whether they actually had fled the area without telling all of their concerned friends and family members.
Here is what we know about the storm so far:
How strong was the tornado?
The National Weather Service in Birmingham said the initial tornado to hit Lee County was ""at least"" an EF-3, considered a ""severe"" tornado with winds 158 to 206 mph. The storm cut a path at least a half-mile wide, the weather service said. The information was pending further investigation in coming days, the weather service added.

How many people were injured and missing?
The numbers were not firm, but East Alabama Medical Center said it had received more than 40 patients as a result of the tornado. Some patients have also been sent to surrounding hospitals, the medical center said. Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said two people were in critical condition. Harris also said he knew of at least six people who were not accounted for, but that he had heard that the number could be as high as 20.

Was there any warning?
A warning had been issued for the deadly tornado in Lee County about 20 minutes before it hit, said Bryan Wood, a meteorologist at Assurant. And for tornadoes in general in that area, the Storm Prediction Center had given a head's-up about 90 minutes prior to touchdown. 
How severe is the property damage?
Rita Smith, spokeswoman for the Lee County Emergency Management Agency, said numerous homes were destroyed or damaged in Beauregard, about 60 miles east of Montgomery. A massive cell tower collapsed. Smith said about 150 first responders are aiding the rescue effort and assessing damage.
Was this the deadliest tornado in years?
It was the nation's deadliest tornado outbreak in six years, since May 20, 2013, when a tornado killed 24 people in Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center said.

Chris Matyszczyk,"Absurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. Recently, Kanye West has been occupying human minds as only, well, Donald Trump can. West's apparent admiration of the president and his suggestion that slavery was a choice have caused discussions, ructions and conniptions. One character in all this is Adidas. Its collaboration with the famed Yeezy fashion designer and rapper has been going on for some time. It's been good for Adidas. It's brought the brand back to some sort of street relevance. Some have wondered whether West's latest pronouncements might signal a good time for the sportswear company to untie its laces with such a controversial figure. Yet, unlike so many brands that leap to dissociate themselves from any controversy, Adidas appears unmoved. Could it be that Adidas is desperate not to lose its association with the coolness it believes comes from being associated with West? Or could it be that the company knows more than it's letting on? I ask only because of a gloriously stimulating theory that's suddenly bouncing its way around Twitter. Presented by Kansas City radio host Spencer Wolff, the idea is that West is acting out one large, perfectly acted performance art piece. It involves friends and collaborators of West's and a level of artistic planning that, if the theory turns out to be true, qualifies for its own sort of Oscar, Emmy or even digital Pulitzer. Well, perhaps. Or perhaps, at least, a Theater of the Grotesque prize. Here's a taste of Wolff's theory. Get your tinfoil hats and red string, I've got a conspiracy theory: @kanyewest is in the middle of a performance art piece and the clues are right in front of us. A thread: -- Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 1. First we need to establish who @DenimTears is. Forgive me if this is well known info, I'm not great at keeping up with every celebrity. His name is Tremaine Emory. He's a collaborator and friend of Kanye. pic.twitter.com/aI0S5SUUMU -- Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 2) last night Kanye tweeted this picture. This appears to be Tremaine at the table. We also know from a previous tweet from Tremaine that he's in Calabasas, where Kanye lives. pic.twitter.com/w3OKmN5QTs -- Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 From there, we go on a Twittered journey that involves artists Joseph Beuys and David Hammons, as well as famed, deceased comedian Andy Kaufman. Kaufman's act involved creating a discomfort in his audience by never relenting from his chosen character. Which, some say, is exactly what West might be doing. For his part, Beuys once locked himself inside a room with a wild coyote for three days. By the end, the coyote became much quieter, even tamed a little. The theory goes that this is what West's doing with his embrace of those who are more right-sided. Politically, that is. Think of it, says Wolff, like a magic trick from The Prestige -- a book and movie in which the elements of a great magic trick are revealed in some detail. As for how the performance art piece might have a forerunner, Wolff references Joaquin Phoenix. Some years ago, the actor began to behave (more) oddly, to people's uncomprehending stares. This turned out to be a real-life performance for the dryly amusing movie I'm Still Here. Wolff presents the elements so cleverly that it's worth reading his whole Twitter thread. I've come across another large clue to support my theory. Tremaine tweeted ""let's play twister, let's play risk, yeah yeah yeah"" which is a lyrics from REM's Man on The Moon which is about Andy Kaufman and believing everything you see. pic.twitter.com/q39t1nBBmy -- Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 There's a certain tempting plausibility about it. But let's go back to Adidas for a moment. Yes, it could be that it just can't quit Kanye and his constant news presence. But what if the company knows that performance art is the purpose of all West's pronouncements, or, at least, has some inkling that this might be the case? Might this explain its reluctance to bid him goodbye? Naturally, I contacted Adidas to ask. I will update, should I hear word. West has five albums which he either produced or performed on coming out over the next few weeks. Would anyone be surprised that Wolff's theory is at the heart of these albums' launches? And would anyone be surprised if Adidas at least suspected that this (hopefully) brilliant artistic endeavor will suddenly reflect upon its brand gloriously, raising it to far greater heights, as its rival Nike struggles? Of course, it could be that West's just gone off the rails -- again. If that's the case, where will that leave Adidas?",Is there a secret buried inside the famed fashion designer-cum-rapper's recent behavior?,2018-05-05T22:53:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}","Why Hasn't Adidas Fired Kanye?

Brian K Sullivan,"Start with summer heat, add a dash of humidity and a misbehaving jet stream and suddenly the Northeast is the new Tornado Alley. A spate of tornadoes tore across the Northeast from New Hampshire to New York in the past several days, including one in Queens late Friday that ripped up trees, knocked down power lines and stripped the siding off several houses, according to the National Weather Service. The instigator is the jet stream, said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the U.S. Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The ribbon of high winds that circles the globe made a southerly dip into the eastern U.S., providing just the right push to get twisters spinning all the way down to Georgia. A similar pattern in May led to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the Northeast. Meanwhile, over in twister-prone Oklahoma, a buckle in the jet stream earlier this year, this time in the opposite direction, has kept the the U.S. tornado capital relatively quiet this. “The jet stream hasn’t been well behaved,” Bunting said.","Start with summer heat, add a dash of humidity and a misbehaving jet stream and suddenly the Northeast is the new Tornado Alley.",2018-08-06T16:02:11Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Tornado Alley Moves to Northeast as Twister Lands in New York,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/tornado-alley-moves-to-northeast-as-twister-lands-in-new-york,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwnfN4xtHUoE/v1/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,twister,1

SEE ALSO: 7 of the best Dyson vacuums that will (hopefully) make all your cleaning dreams come true If youre a pet owner, you know that staying on top of pet hair cleanup is no joke.

Whether youre looking for an upright bagless model, a cordless option, or even a robot vac for everyday maintenance, weve just the right pick to help keep you and Fido living together in hair-free harmony. Featuring the strongest suction of any competitor and engineered specifically for pet owners, the Dyson Ball Animal 2 doesnt mess around when it comes to effective, efficient cleaning of pet hair. Packed with features and at a price point that wont break the bank, this canister vac snags our top spot for the best vacuum cleaner for pet hair. The Ball Animal 2 has a lot of suction power. Its specifically designed to tackle the level of dust, dirt, and debris that pets can leave behind in your home, and it does a great job of it. Featuring a self-adjusting cleaning head, the base plate automatically raises and lowers to lock in suction across multiple floor surfaces like wood, carpet, tile, and vinyl. It also comes with a counter-rotating brush tool thats specially designed for animal hair; with no brush bar for the hair to wrap around, its totally tangle-free, meaning you wont have to stop every five minutes to bend down and yank dog hair from the bottom. (Its the little things, really.) Although this canister vac is heavy, its easy to turn and maneuver thanks to Dysons ball technology. It also features a washable, reusable filter, easy bin emptying, and an extra-long hose that quickly pulls out from the vacuums side to clean blinds, ceilings, and other hard-to-reach spots. With over 350 positive reviews on Dysons website and over 700 on Amazon, the Ball Animal 2 is a definite crowd-pleaser. Amazon customer Jennifer Olney writes: WOW! I knew this vacuum was rated among the very best, but I am in shock and just how incredible it is. We have a sweet Siberian husky baby that we love more than anything...but OMG THE FUR. Pregnant with our first human baby, I couldn't handle the thought of baby rolling on the floor and getting covered in fur, despite my best efforts to keep the carpet vacuumed. This arrived today and my husband had it put together in about 5 minutes after unboxing everything. I vacuum nearly every day...and yet this thing pulled up PINE NEEDLES that must have been buried deep in the fibers of our carpet since Christmas. I can't say enough good things about this machine. Easy to use, incredibly powerful and worth every penny! If youre looking to spend considerably less but still get a vacuum thats tough on pet hair (and just about anything else), the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Professional Upright is the way to go. The most unique feature of this bagless, upright vac is the Lift-Away canister. Simply push a button and the main canister lifts away from the main body of the vacuum, turning it into a portable cleaning powerhouse thats perfect for going after pet hairand just about anything elseon stairs, upholstery, and other hard-to-reach spots. The Navigator boasts a sealed system and a HEPA filter to trap the dust and allergens left behind by pets. The roller brush turns on and off with the push of a button, so it seamlessly transitions between carpet and bare floor. And although its low in price, it doesnt skimp on accessories. The Navigator comes with a dedicated pet hair attachment, as well a microfiber hardwood attachment that wipes away dust as its vacuuming. Amazon customer TJsGracie writes: This is the best vacuum I've ever owned. I use it on tile, laminate, and my large area rugs, as well as using the detachable wand on my cloth covered chairs. I have 2 dogs and occasionally have 2 cats that visit and every time I vacuum I have a canister full of hair! It's very powerful, so if you are using on a long shag type carpet you may need to turn the beater bars off as it may shut the beaters off automatically. I have truthfully never had a vacuum that has this amount if suction. The canister is easy to detach and clean. The cord is nice and long so you don't have to keep plugging it in every 2 minutes! I would, and have recommended this to my friends. Miele is to the world of vacuums what Mercedes-Benz is to carsa well-made, uber-luxurious German brand thats been trusted for decades for its superior products and high quality performance. If youre someone whos got a whole lot of cleaning to do and is looking to invest in a versatile, powerful, and dare we say stylish vacuum for the long haul, the Miele Complete C3 Marin is for you. Short of actually vacuuming for you, theres not much this canister vac cant do. The Marin features a powerful yet quiet six-speed motor, controlled via +/- buttons on the footswitch, that works on hardwoods and carpeting and anything in between. And if figuring out motor settings isnt for you, not to worrytheres also a self-adjusting automatic setting that senses the floor type and adjusts the motor accordingly, meaning youll never have to risk a foot cramp while cleaning. The Marin tackles pet hair with ease. It comes with two cleaning heads, an electrobrush for carpeting (with LED lighting, so you can see all your grossness!), and a Parquet Twister head with super soft bristles that will take it easy on your hardwood floors while youre chasing after those stray balls of cat fur. Theres also a self-retracting power cord, a HEPA filter, and of course the satisfaction of knowing youre driving the Mercedes of vacuums. Amazon customer R. Julka says: With 4 kids, a dog, and a lot of hardwood floors, this vacuum is amazing. I love that I don't have to adjust the suction when I'm vacuuming hardwood floors and throw rugs. Also, the LED lights are very helpful for highlighting all the dog hairs and dust in the corners. I also like the portability of the machine-- the canister is not too heavy to move around. Last, the maneuverability of the machine is also great. And Amazon customer LK says: Such a great vacuum.... it is so worth the price. A family member has a similar Miele that has been bombproof with very few repair or maintenance issues for probably 12-15 years... now that's the kind of product that is worth a significant cash outlay. Really love this as much as you can love a vacuum. Put your hands together, folksthe future vacuuming is here, and it means youll never have to get off your ass again. Cue the applause. Robot vacuums are an ideal option for pet owners who are looking to keep up on the daily chore of pet hair maintenance without a ton of effort. Although there are certainly fancier and more expensive options on the market, we think the Eufy Robovac 11S is an affordable, efficient robotic option that really gets the job done. The Eufy has everything youd wantor needin a robotic vacuum. Its the brands slimmest option, yet still packs a big punch in the suction department. It clocks in with a run time of 100 minutes, so its able to vacuum an entire floor without needing to go back to its home base for a recharge.

Hundreds of Amazon reviewers are pleasantly surprised by how well this affordable vacuum handles and are raving about Eufys customer service. Carlos Fernandez writes: Bought this two days ago. It's been a cycle of charging, cleaning, charging, etc since it arrived. Every time it's been a full deposit of dog fur and dust. I can't believe how much dirt a carpet can hide.Two years ago we bought a Roomba but returned it because it couldn't deal with our carpet. It was stuck all the time, lots of noise, took forever to clean a room.We're amazed at how well this one is working. It's really silent, too. iRobot better watch out. And Amazon customer Nick Carraway says: This thing has changed my life. I know that sounds weird but honestly of all my Amazon purchases, and there have been a lot, this is one of the very best.

An Amazon customer writes: I have 2 Siberian Huskies and thought it would be impossible to get all the hair... my old vacuum couldn't pick it up at all. I use to have to get down on my hands and knees with a small bristle dog brush and scrape the carpet to get it off the carpet. I haven't picked up the hair in 3 weeks.. I gave this new vacuum the ultimate test... and it passed with flying colors. It got ALL the hair. I could ask for a better vacuum.

It also does a great job of transitioning over lots of different flooring surfaces; simply pop out the CrossOver handle on the main brush roller, and seamlessly go from cleaning your carpet to cleaning your hardwood floors without ever having to bend down. An Amazon Customer writes: I could not be more pleased with this vacuum. I have pets so shedding is a problem. This vacuum has great suction (has suction levels) and did the job.

Laurel Mintz,"' New year, new me ', a phrase that sounds off in the digital space and IRL for people for everything from eating, drinking and fitness to jobs, family, and even stress management. Resolutions may not be your thing, but finding a new way to handle stress might help you solve more problems than you think. 2018 is the year of the dog, predicting an exhausting but fulfilling year overall. While the rule of thumb is that hard work = more money, this year is predicted to be a very successful financial year. Now wouldn't it be nice if that came as easy as it was to read? As per regular zodiac rules, the good news doesn't come without the bad, meaning the financial success is an option but it may take a little toll on overall health. While increased finances sound great, poor health and exhaustion don't sound quite as thrilling. Though you should always take zodiac predictions with a grain of salt, you CAN use the following five de-stress techniques this year and beyond to stay calm and collected no matter what year it is. Breathe. Working at a creative agency has its ups and downs, some days are easier than others but when the stuff hits the fan - it can be chaos with a capital 'C'. Many people on the team are regular yogis, and practice the art of mindful breathing. Though this is tricky at first, pausing everything for just a moment to breathe in and breathe out can truly bring focus and realign the issue. Will that take away the problem completely? Of course not. But it can put the problem(s) into perspective and turn the mountain back into a molehill. Move. Jump, run, dance, walk up and down the stairs, get upside down even! Pick your poison, but get some blood pumping. At EMB, Twister is the current office movement of choice. Studies show getting the blood moving can have a positive impact on overall mental health. Thank the infamous Elle Woods for this gem, ""Exercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don't kill their husbands. They just don't."" In all seriousness, getting up and moving can not only take your mind off the stress point, it can also potentially help you see the problem from a new angle, and help you work on your fitness goals. Play. This can go along with movement, but taking time to be silly can get you in a better mood or at least in a better head space. Word association games, sudoko, word finds, or even a puzzle can be a great. Get your team together and play Heads Up or even Around the World after a long conference call, meeting, or when the stress levels are high. Even just 15 minutes can be the refresh your brain needs. Laugh. Laughter is the best medicine, truly. There are science-backed reasons, and of course, it's just fun. Do yourself a favor and find something to laugh at, you can thank me later. Think. With all the commotion of technology, social media, and the constant need for attention the feeling of FOMO is real. While there are apps and gadgets at our beck and call to do practically everything, the one big thing that apps and technology cannot do for us yet is to think. When deadlines, clients, or even family start to add to your stress load, focus your thoughts on something simple to carry through that moment and on to the next. Drawing all your attention on a simple thought or phrase for even just a minute can help you collect yourself to tackle the obstacle ahead of you and get past it. Meditation can be the next step, but for now simple thoughts can get you through. You can interchange these methods, or even just focus on one but don't let this year be a year of stress, live, make mistakes, and have as close to a stress-free future as possible.","Don't let stress hold you back this year, try these tried-and-true ways to get out of your own way and stay cool.",2018-01-17T22:04:41Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inc.com'}",Get ready For A Successful Year: 5 Steps to Decompress,https://www.inc.com/laurel-mintz/get-ready-for-a-successful-year-5-steps-to-decompress.html,https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_504377322_341011.jpg,,Inc.com,twister,1
Al Jazeera,"Torrential rain has been lashing Hong Kong over the past few days. The downpours have been so severe that the Hong Kong Observatory issued amber or red warnings on four consecutive days, something that hasn't happened since 2002. Shek Kong in the north of the territory was the worst affected, being hit by over 300 millimetres of rain. Streets were submerged as the flood water rose. The deluge was accompanied by squally winds which were blamed for the sinking of a ferry travelling between two of the territory’s islands. 13 passengers and 2 crew members had to be rescued when the boat ran into difficulties and started taking on water. The severe weather also produced a waterspout, which formed near a bridge connecting the Tsing Yi with the mainland. Waterspouts can be dangerous for ships, particularly the small vessels which often crowd Hong Kong’s waters, but fortunately this twister dissipated before it caused any significant damage. A landslip warning is still in force in Hong Kong, advising people to keep away from steep slopes and to avoid driving in hilly areas. The Observatory also urges people to cancel all non-essential appointments and stay at home. Although the risk of landslips remains, it seems that the worst of the rain is now over.

JILL COLVIN / AP,"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — President Donald Trump surveyed damage on Friday from a deadly tornado that devastated a small Alabama town, killing nearly two dozen people.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump, flew south to Georgia and then took a helicopter to Alabama, landing at a regional airport in Auburn. The Trumps greeted people awaiting their arrival before departing by motorcade.
The president was expected to tour rural Lee County in eastern Alabama, where 23 people died Sunday in a massive EF4 tornado that carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide with 170 mph (270 kph) winds. Air Force One first landed at a military base along the Georgia border, where Trump boarded a helicopter for an aerial tour of some of the damage.
It was one of at least 38 tornadoes confirmed to have touched down across the Southeast in a deadly weekend outbreak.
As he left Washington, Trump said he expected to meet with Gov. Kay Ivey and people who “got hit very hard by the tornadoes.” He also planned to thank first responders.
Trump has said he’s instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to give Alabama “the A Plus treatment” as the state recovers.
The Alabama damage was officially deemed a disaster on Tuesday, with Trump ordering federal aid to supplement ongoing state and local recovery efforts.
Ivey has also signed a disaster assistance agreement with FEMA and ordered state flags flown at half-staff until sunset Sunday.
The Beauregard, Alabama tornado was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
The dead included four children and a couple in their 80s, with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family. Several people in Georgia were also injured by twisters that also extended to Florida and South Carolina, according to the National Weather Service.
Trump had said earlier this week that the country was “sending our love and prayers to the incredible people of Alabama” and that “whatever we can do, we’re doing.” He was traveling to politically friendly territory for him: Alabama supported Trump by a wide margin in the 2016 presidential election.
The area where the tornado struck is generally Trump country: He carried about 60 percent of the Lee County vote in 2016, and blue Trump flags flying outside homes are a frequent sight in Beauregard.
Standing amid bricks and lumber that used to be her mother’s home, Renee Frazier waved at Trump’s helicopter as it passed overhead during an aerial tour of the destruction. Minutes before, she was arguing with relatives who opposed Trump’s visit, calling it more about politics than compassion.
“I want the president here to see what happened to my mom’s house,” she said. “I want him right here on this land because my mom is about love and unity.”
Just down the road, where several people died, Trump supporter Bobby Spann said he hoped the president learned “how to be a Southerner, and how to respect people” during his brief visit.
Spann, 63, said he also hoped Trump realizes how much help is needed. The roof of Spann’s mobile home was partially peeled away.
“Houses need to be replaced. You can’t help the dead folks, but you can try to help the ones that’s still living,” said Spann, chewing on a yellowroot twig.
Trump’s reaction to natural disasters at times has seemed to vary with the level of political support he’s received from the affected region.
In the months after wildfires ripped through California, Trump threatened to cut off federal aid unless the state embraced forest management policies he championed.
He also engaged in a sustained back-and-forth with lawmakers from hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico, repeatedly blaming the territory for its problems and noting how much money recovery efforts had cost the federal government.
The administration at one point considered redirecting disaster aid from places like Puerto Rico and California to pay for the president’s long-promised border wall. The administration ultimately chose to target other sources of federal dollars.
Trump had already been scheduled to fly south Friday for a weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club and will be heading there after the tour.

noreply@blogger.com (Derrick Lin),"This project was part of my Packaging Design course, in which, I chose to work on “sauce-tubes” for the brand Veeba. I feel these small packs allow people to test out sauces in smaller quantities rather than having to buy a full jar. However, these tubes are difficult to store individually in the fridge. Since these small packs also allow for offering Variety Packs, my focus narrowed down to creating an outer casing for a variety pack that would offer an interactive element to engage the customer with the product, not only in the grocery-store aisle but also in their kitchen. This design includes a polypropylene “tray” that firmly holds together 3 sauce tubes, allowing customers to test out multiple new flavours for a discounted price. What's Unique? The tubes are housed by an outer tube (also polypropylene) which contains a window, which allows users to rotate the blue tray and select whichever sauce of the three they want and then slide it out of a slit at the top. This element brings an appealing interactivity to the product and makes the activity of picking sauces for a sandwich more fun for children and parents alike. The tray and outer-tube are re-usable and can be refilled the next time the user buys individual sauce tubes. The individual sauce tubes feature a similar, but more consistent character; a cheerful bread-slice which enjoys dressing-up and face-painting.","Design: Nikhil Baveja Project Type: Student Project School: MIT Institute of Design Course: Product Design Location: Pune, India Packaging Contents: Sauce Packaging Substrate / Materials: Plastic Printing Process: Digital Printing This project was part of my …",2018-10-09T07:12:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Packagingoftheworld.com'}",Veeba Twister Tubes,https://www.packagingoftheworld.com/2018/10/veeba-twister-tubes.html,https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HnEC2c8VZvY/W7xJD-YbdBI/AAAAAAAFa4M/hYjR0Q7jOtYXyTZ-dRiIWzQ2ky4qlf0-wCLcBGAs/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Veeba%2B%25280a%2529.jpg,,Packagingoftheworld.com,twister,1
"Redding Record Searchlight, Mike Chapman, Redding Record Searchlight","The Carr Fire has left a large path of damage through the River Ridge Park neighborhood in Redding, California. Wochit A memorial to Redding Fire Department inspector Jeremy Stoke has been erected near where he was killed while battling the Carr Fire, August 3, 2018 (Photo: Jay Calderon/USA Today Network) REDDING, Calif. – A powerful fire tornado trapped a firefighter who died last month while battling a devastating blaze in northern California, according to a report released Wednesday. The report describes events leading up to the death of Redding firefighter Jeremy Stoke and a chaotic scene immediately afterward as bulldozer operators tried to withstand the fire tornado that blasted into west Redding. The 18-page report, prepared by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also describes how 81-year-old bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith lost his life in the Carr Fire. The report gives this dramatic sequence of events on July 26 when temperatures tied a daily record of 113 degrees in Redding: Stoke, 37, a fire prevention inspector, was conducting welfare checks that day with other firefighters at Salt Creek Heights, a newly built subdivision in west Redding. That evening, the fire crossed the Sacramento River. A public memorial service was held Saturday for 37-year-old Redding firefighter Jeremy Stoke who died in the line of duty during the Carr Fire. (Photo: Contributed) At 7:35 p.m. PDT, Stoke went to the Land Park neighborhood just as the river-jumping fire burned into it, along with nearby Stanford Hills. Three minutes later a Cal Fire captain, looking north from Land Park, saw the fire tornado swirling near a segment of Buenaventura Boulevard that connects Land Park to Keswick Dam Road. Three bulldozer operators, not including Smith, found shelter from the advancing fire beside cut banks on Buenaventura. More: Support pours in for couple who accidentally started deadly Carr Fire More: Calif. 'fire tornado' had 143 mph winds, possibly state's strongest twister ever At 7:39 p.m., Stoke, identified in the report as ""FPI1,"" was driving south on Buenaventura between Lake Keswick Estates and the Land Park/Stanford Hills subdivisions. One minute later, he broadcast a mayday on his fire radio. ""FPI1 identified himself by his radio call sign, and stated that he needed a water drop and was getting burned over,"" the report said. A second transmission immediately followed, with Stoke repeating he was in the middle of the road, getting burned over and needed a water drop. An engine captain tried to contact Stoke to get his location. ""There was no response,"" the report says. A fire captain and a battalion chief talked face-to-face to confirm they heard Stoke's radio calls. About the same time, the dispatch center tried to locate Stoke by pinging his cellphone. The Carr Fire burning down to the Sacramento River as an example of swirling air created by turbulence. (Photo: Cal Fire) Meanwhile, a Cal Fire supervisor was dring along Buenaventura to lead residents out of Land Park and Stanford Hills. As these evacuations were occurring, the fire tornado approached the River Ridge subdivision east of Buenaventura. Just after 8:02 p.m., the three bulldozer operators who were going north on Buenaventura toward Keswick Dam Road got caught in the violent weather. ""Approximately one-half of a mile from Land Park, all three dozers were violently impacted by flying debris, rocks, embers, smoke, and intense heat,"" the report says. ""As hot air entered the cab of Dozer 2, the operator repositioned the dozer and parked next to Dozer 3. When Dozer 3’s windows shattered, airborne glass entered the operator’s eyes. Dozer 3 stopped on Buenaventura Boulevard and deployed his fire curtains."" The final resting place of Don Ray Smith's bulldozer. (Photo: Cal Fire) Elsewhere and earlier that evening, Smith arrived at the Buckeye Water Treatment Plant in his dozer about 5 p.m. and went about improving a fire-break line toward Spring Creek Reservoir as the blaze started picking upe. A crew leader tried to contactSmith over a radio ""to tell him to 'get out of there.' "" Two firefighters left on foot to contact Smith but were turned back by flames. Smith finally was able to make radio contact and said he couldn't get out because the fire had cut him off. Just after 5:45 p.m. Smith asked for water drops. Several Cal Fire helicopters made drops through smoke as the fire conditions worsened. A helicopter coordinator, looking through a clearing in the smoke, saw Smith's bulldozer engulfed in flames. At 7 p.m., a fire captain made it to the dozer line and confirmed Smith had died in a burn-over. Investigators found Smith's fire shelter behind his dozer seat and the fire curtains weren't deployed, the report says.

(Photo: Cal Fire) The report's authors describe the fire tornado as a large, rotating fire plume that measured about 1,000 feet in diameter at its base, with winds ranging from 136 to 165 mph, the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado. The report lists a number of safety issues encountered in the fire and some lessons learned, including: ""Firefighters must recognize the wildland firefighting environment is becoming more extreme due to a combination of a changing climate, overly dense and dry fuels, changing weather patterns, and continued growth of communities into fire-prone landscapes.""

"Randall Colburn on News, shared by Randall Colburn to The A.V. Club","“There is pride to be had where the prejudicial is practiced with precision in the trenchant triage of tactile terminations.” No, this is not a tongue twister you’d hear muttered in the wings of a high school stage play. This is, no lie, just one of several deadening excerpts from Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, the debut novel of actor Sean Penn, who, terrifyingly, seems to be giving up acting in favor of poorly aping Thomas Pynchon and successfully embodying Charles Bukowski. The 160-page novel tells the story of its namesake character, a septic tank entrepreneur and contract killer who Forrest Gumps his way through Hurricane Katrina, Baghdad at the outset of the Iraq War, and the “penis-edency” of a Donald Trumpian commander in chief. Huffington Post ’s Claire Fallon describes it as “an exercise in ass-showing, a 160-page self-own.” Other reviews are kinder, if similarly unimpressed. The New York Times calls it “agonizing” and “conspicuously un-fun,” while Entertainment Weekly criticizes its “woozy gender politics” while dubbing it “shrill,” “confounding,” and “a little hypocritical.” But one needn’t dig far to discover the dissertation’s most dunk-worthy declarations, which allow for an astonishing abundance of alliterative announcements. Fallon’s collected some examples of her own: “Bob’s boyhood essence set him up for a separation from time, synergy, and social mores, leading him to acts of indelicacy, wounding words, and woeful whimsy that he himself would come to dread.” ― page 12 “Silly questions of cherries saved served to sever any last impression Bob might have had of Spurley as a serious citizen.” ― page 94 “There is pride to be had where the prejudicial is practiced with precision in the trenchant triage of tactile terminations.” ― page 125 “His dream’s desert daylight diffusion dictated disturbances in the void of visual detail.” ― page 142 And she’s not the only one who noticed. And then there’s the book’s epilogue, a six-page poem about the #MeToo movement. “Was it really in our interest to trample Charlie Rose?” he asks. Maybe he should ask the 11 women the dude groped against their will? And we thought he couldn’t sink lower than The Last Face.",“There is pride to be had where the prejudicial is practiced with precision in the trenchant triage of tactile terminations.” Read more...,2018-03-28T17:22:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}","Excerpts from Sean Penn's book are here, and they are worse than can be imagined",https://news.avclub.com/excerpts-from-sean-penns-book-are-here-and-they-are-wo-1824147378,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--JdMYcg4k--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/zorzrlfdemgyrlwphtq4.jpg",,Avclub.com,twister,1
"Marissa Martinelli, Marissa Martinelli","Enhance … enhance … enhance … Here is a fun new chapter in the otherwise exhausting saga that is Kanye West’s rightward turn: an elaborate conspiracy theory. Over the course of just a couple of weeks, West has allied himself with conservatives like Candace Owens, tweeted his “love” for Donald Trump, and said that slavery was “a choice.” All of this has prompted a flurry of deliberation about West’s motivations and even some unwelcome speculation about his mental health. But could it all be a Joaquin Phoenix-style stunt? It certainly wouldn’t be out of the question, given West’s track record as a provocateur—remember the Confederate arm patch ? Perhaps no one has put more thought into this than the man known as Snowcone, co-host of the Kansas City-based radio show The Church of Lazlo, who laid it out in detail in a Twitter thread worthy of Charlie Kelly : Get your tinfoil hats and red string, I’ve got a conspiracy theory: @kanyewest is in the middle of a performance art piece and the clues are right in front of us. A thread: — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 1. First we need to establish who @DenimTears is. Forgive me if this is well known info, I’m not great at keeping up with every celebrity. His name is Tremaine Emory. He’s a collaborator and friend of Kanye. pic.twitter.com/aI0S5SUUMU — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 2) last night Kanye tweeted this picture. This appears to be Tremaine at the table. We also know from a previous tweet from Tremaine that he’s in Calabasas, where Kanye lives. pic.twitter.com/w3OKmN5QTs — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 3) Kanye also mentioned in his interview with @cthagod “my boy Tremaine tweeted...” so we can assume that he’s both friends with Tremaine and looks at his Twitter account. I promise this info will be important coming up. — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 4. A week or so after rejoining twitter, Kanye tweeted these images on 4/22. The first two images involve David Hammons and the third and fourth involve Joseph Beuys. pic.twitter.com/Q1NdrXq91J — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 5. So let’s start with the first two images involving David Hammons. After Kanye tweeted these images, Tremaine quote tweeted them with this emoji: ♠️. I believe this is referring to Hammons work which aimed to “turn racist cliches (spade) on its head.” pic.twitter.com/HF0Qaqjcxd — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 6. As for the other two images of Joseph Beuys- the image Kanye tweeted was from an art installation Beuys did in 1974 called I Like America and America Likes Me, where he locked himself into a room with a coyote for 3 days. — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 7. The purpose of this performance with a coyote, “a wild spirit - often thought of as America’s untamed spirit” was to hopefully make the coyote “tolerant and accepting through Beuys’ desire to heal.” pic.twitter.com/Z6NYJapmwL — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 8. I believe Kanye is doing a modern take on Beuys piece with the coyote. He’s embraced what might be considered the coyote of today. Gotten close to it. Trump, Candace Owens, Alt Right. Maybe he sees this as a better chance to “tame” the coyote than more traditional methods. — Snowcone (@Snowcone965) May 2, 2018 Snowcone goes on to flag a number of Kanye’s tweets to support his theory, including one that encourages artists to “take ideas and update them at your will” and another with a drawing that Snowcone suggests resembles performance artist Andy Kaufman. He also points out that Tremaine Emory has, on multiple occasions, shared West’s posts with the comment “the prestige,” which you may remember from the Christopher Nolan movie of the same name as the part of a magic trick or illusion. The whole thing really comes together when Snowcone spotlights another potentially revealing Emory tweet … Let’s play twister let’s play risk, yeah yeah yeah... — DenimTears (@DenimTears) April 25, 2018 … which he notes are lyrics to REM’s “Man on the Moon,” a song that references—yep—Andy Kaufman. The theory is actually pretty compelling, but even if it’s true, there’s still one big question left to answer: Why is he doing this to us? Is West’s performance a cynical move to stir up controversy and sell more albums? A commentary on how celebrity culture has overtaken our politics, and vice versa? A sincere effort to try to infiltrate the right and change some conservative minds? Some combination of all three?! Please excuse me for a moment while I unspool my skein of red yarn.

Maria Popova,"“There is nothing quite so tragic as a young cynic,” Maya Angelou wrote in contemplating courage in the face of evil, “because it means the person has gone from knowing nothing to believing nothing.” How to prevent that cultural tragedy, which poisons the heart of a just and democratic society, is what Theodore Roosevelt (October 27, 1858–January 6, 1919) examined when he took the podium at the Sorbonne in Paris on April 23 of 1910 to deliver one of the most powerful, rousing, and timelessly insightful speeches ever given, originally titled “Citizenship in a Republic” and later included under the title “Duties of the Citizen” in the 1920 volume Roosevelt’s Writings ( public library ). Theodore Roosevelt A century before Caitlin Moran cautioned that “cynicism scours through a culture like bleach, wiping out millions of small, seedling ideas,” Roosevelt admonishes against “that queer and cheap temptation” to be cynical, and writes: The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twister pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement. A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticise work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life’s realities — all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness. The rôle is easy; there is none easier, save only the rôle of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance. One of the tendencies I find most troubling in contemporary culture is that of mistaking cynicism for critical thinking. This confusion seeds a pernicious strain of unconstructive and lazily destructive opprobrium. Amid this epidemic of self-appointed critics, it becomes harder and harder to remember just how right Bertrand Russell was when he asserted nearly a century ago that “construction and destruction alike satisfy the will to power, but construction is more difficult as a rule, and therefore gives more satisfaction to the person who can achieve it.” With an eye to those lazy critics — the dead weight of society — Roosevelt offers: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat… The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. The entire twenty-seven-page speech, found in Roosevelt’s Writings and on par with JFK’s superb speech on the artist’s role in society, is a masterpiece of thought and feeling, replete with insight into what it means to be a good citizen, a good leader, and a complete human being. Complement this particular fragment with Leonard Bernstein on the countercultural courage of resisting cynicism, Goethe on the only criticism worth voicing, and philosopher Daniel Dennett on how to criticize with kindness, then revisit Eleanor Roosevelt on how uncynical personal conviction powers social change.","""It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

Jim Carlton,"HAMMON, Okla.—When residents of this remote rural area were warned to take cover from an approaching severe storm, tour director Bill Reid aimed his vanload of six giddy passengers into its path. “It’s going to get crazy,” said Mr. Reid of Tempest Tours, which takes visitors on excursions into some of the wildest weather on the continent, amid reports of torrential rain, baseball-sized hail and possible tornadic activity. As the U.S.’s tornado season kicks into high gear, so does the booming-but-risky business of taking paying passengers on storm-chasing tours in the nation’s tornado alley. The 1996 movie, “Twister,” and the 2007-2011 Discovery Channel reality TV series, “Storm Chasers” have helped to fuel the growing popularity of the tours—in a trend that worries some safety experts. Although the storm tour companies offer no guarantees, spotting—and taking photos of—twisters is the Holy Grail for storm chasers and tourists alike. With only about half the normal number of twisters so far this year, the tornado season has gotten off to its slowest start in years. But that hasn’t stopped Tempest Tours, among others, from selling out its storm-chase tours, which can last from a day to 11 days and run $300 to $3,850. The company started in 2000 with 20 tourists now hosts about 200 passengers a season who come from around the country and world, said founder Martin Lisius. “People kept asking if they could go storm chasing with us, so we decided to create this company so they could book a tour like a cruise,” said Mr. Lisius of Arlington, Texas, a veteran storm chaser. Over the past two decades, at least a dozen other companies have sprung up around Texas and the Midwest, including Silver Lining Tours, Extreme Tornado Tours and Extreme Chase Tours, which hauls about 80 passengers a season in its vans compared with just five when it started in 1999, said owner Lanny Dean. Though storm-chasing companies say they don’t know of any tourists who have died or been seriously injured so far, the trips can be dangerous. Three storm chasers died in 2017 when their vehicles collided while chasing a twister in Texas. In 2013, three other chasers were killed when a tornado they had been following turned on them in El Reno, Okla. In both cases, the storm chasers weren’t leading tours. Law-enforcement authorities say they worry that adding more people on the road adds to the dangers. “The truth is it is becoming dangerous (for the chasers), with the traffic congestion and unsafe speeds,” said Sheriff Darren Atha of Roger Mills County, Okla. “And I have great concerns about their passengers.” Even some storm chasers think the tours are a bit much. “It puts more cars on the road,” said Greg Robbin, a 42-year-old storm chaser from Mountain View, Calif., as he patrolled for tornadoes on the Oklahoma prairie recently. Tour operators say they emphasize safety, such as avoiding unpaved roads where a vehicle might get stuck. They also make sure to have an escape route. The biggest risk, they say, is from getting hit by one of the hordes of storm-chasing vehicles that clog back roads this time of year. Some passengers complain the tour operators are overly cautious. “Bill is like a nervous mother cat,” said Chris Alba, a 62-year-old retired geologist from Houston, referring to Tempest Tour’s Mr. Reid. Mr. Alba was joining his first storm tour this month because “seeing a tornado is on my bucket list,” he said. “Today could be a day of large violent tornadoes on the ground for quite a while,” Mr. Reid told his passengers, which included a three-person documentary crew from Japan, after checking the weather. “I like the way this looks.” On the four-hour ride over to a corner of Texas and Oklahoma, the van passengers passed the time taking in sights like a dust devil in a vacant lot in Kansas. Previously, they had stopped for a steakhouse meal in Amarillo, Texas, which offers money back to anyone who can eat a 72-ounce steak in one sitting. “For me, it’s 50% storm and 50% an anthropological exploration in America,” said Kathy Newton, a 60-year-old retired police officer from Australia. This was Ms. Newton’s fourth straight tour, and she had yet to see a twister. After traveling hundreds of miles, Mr. Reid’s group finally got word of a tornado touching down on a nearby Oklahoma farm. The van turned south to chase it. “Try [ing] not to get too excited so I’m not too disappointed,” said Mr. Alba, the retired geologist. But that twister disappeared back in the clouds before they could catch it, and the group was overtaken by a good, old-fashioned thunderstorm. For Ms. Newton, the retired cop, that was enough “I had never driven through a lightning storm until today,” she said. “I like it.” Write to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com","As the U.S.’s tornado season kicks into high gear, so does the booming-but-risky business of taking paying passengers on storm-chasing tours—in a trend that worries some safety experts.",2018-05-18T14:37:38Z,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",Storm-Chasing Tours Become Big -- and Risky -- Business...,https://www.wsj.com/articles/storm-chasing-tours-become-bigand-riskybusiness-1526646565,https://images.wsj.net/im-11020/social,the-wall-street-journal,The Wall Street Journal,twister,1
Warrior Maven,"The US Navy aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) underway on its own power for the first time. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Ridge Leoni The US Navy is planning to finalize weapons integration on its new USS Ford carrier and explode bombs in various sea conditions near the ship to prepare for major combat on the open seas. ""Shock Trials,"" as they are called, are typically one of the final stages in the Navy process designed to bring warships from development to operational deployment. The Navy's decision to have shock trials for its first Ford-Class carrier seems to be of particular relevance in today's modern threat environment, as potential adversaries have in recent years been designing and testing weapons specifically engineered to destroy US carriers. The US Navy is planning to finalize weapons integration on its new USS Ford carrier and explode bombs in various sea conditions near the ship to prepare for major combat on the open seas, service officials said. Service weapons testers will detonate a wide range of bombs, to include a variety of underwater sea mines to assess the carrier's ability to withstand enemy attacks. ""Shock Trials,"" as they are called, are typically one of the final stages in the Navy process designed to bring warships from development to operational deployment. ""The USS Gerald R. Ford will conduct further trails and testing, culminating in full-ship shock trials. The ship will then work up for deployment in parallel with its initial operational testing and evaluation,"" William Couch, an official with Naval Sea Systems Command, told Warrior Maven. Testing how the carrier can hold up to massive nearby explosions will follow what's called a Post Shakedown Availability involving a final integration of various combat systems. ""The Post Shakedown Availability is planned for 12 months, with the critical path being Advanced Weapons Elevator construction and Advanced Arresting Gear water twister upgrades,"" Couch added. The Navy's decision to have shock trials for its first Ford-Class carrier, scheduled for deployment in 2022, seems to be of particular relevance in today's modern threat environment. In a manner far more threatening than most previously known threats to Navy aircraft carriers, potential adversaries have in recent years been designing and testing weapons specifically engineered to destroy US carriers. The flight deck of the USS Ford. Daniel Brown/Business Insider One such threat is the Chinese built DF-21D ""carrier killer"" anti-ship missile. This weapon, now actively being developed and tested by the Chinese military, can reportedly hit moving carriers at ranges up to 900 nautical miles. Accordingly, unlike the last 15 years of major US military counterinsurgency operations where carriers operated largely uncontested, potential future conflict will likely require much more advanced carrier defenses, service developers have explained. A 2007 Department of Defense-directed Shock Trials analysis by the non-profit MITRE corporation explains that many of the expected or most probable threats to warships come from ""non-contact explosions where a high-pressure wave is launched toward the ship."" MITRE's report, interestingly, also identifies the inspiration for Shock Trials as one originating from World War II. ""During World War II, it was discovered that although such ""near miss"" explosions do not cause serious hull or superstructure damage, the shock and vibrations associated with the blast nonetheless incapacitate the ship, by knocking out critical components and systems,"" the MITRE assessment, called ""Navy Ship Underwater Shock Prediction and Testing Capability Study"" states. The MITRE analysis further specifies that, following a nearby explosion, the bulkhead of a ship can oscillate, causing the ship to move upward. ""Strong localized deformations are seen in the deck modes, which different parts of the decks moving at different frequencies from each other,"" MITRE writes. USS Gerald R. Ford underway on its own power for the first time in Newport News, Virginia, April 8, 2017. US Department of Defense The existence and timing of USS Ford Shock Trials has been the focus of much consideration. Given that post Shock Trial evaluations and damage assessments can result in a need to make modifications to the ship, some Navy developers wanted to save Shock Trials for the second Ford-class carrier, the USS Kennedy. The rationale, according to multiple reports, was to ensure the anticipated USS Ford deployment time frame was not delayed. However, a directive from Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shannahan, following input from the Senate Armed Services Committee, ensured that shock trials will occur on schedule for the USS Ford. Data analysis following shock trials has, over the years, shown that even small ship component failures can have large consequences. ""A component shock-qualification procedure which ensures the survivability of 99% of the critical components still is not good enough to ensure a ship's continued operational capability in the aftermath of a nearby underwater explosion,"" MITRE writes. Also, given that the USS Ford is introducing a range of as-of-yet unprecedented carrier-technologies, testing the impact of nearby attacks on the ship may be of greater significance than previous shock trials conducted for other ships. For instance, Ford-class carriers are built with a larger flight deck able to increase the sortie-generation rate by 33-percent, an electromagnetic catapult to replace the current steam system and much greater levels of automation or computer controls throughout the ship. The ship is also engineered to accommodate new sensors, software, weapons and combat systems as they emerge, Navy officials have said. The flight deck of the USS Ford. Daniel Brown/Business Insider The USS Ford is built with four 26-megawatt generators, bringing a total of 104 megawatts to the ship. This helps support the ship's developing systems such as its Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System, or EMALS, and provides power for future systems such as lasers and rail-guns, many Navy senior leaders have explained. In addition, stealth fighter jets, carrier-launched drones, V-22 Ospreys, submarine-detecting helicopters, laser weapons and electronic jamming are all deemed indispensable to the Navy's now unfolding future vision of carrier-based air power, senior service leaders said. Several years ago, the Navy announced that the V-22 Osprey will be taking on the Carrier On-Board Delivery mission wherein it will carry forces and equipment on and off carriers while at sea. However, despite the emergence of weapons such as DF-21D, senior Navy leaders and some analysts have questioned the ability of the weapon like this to actually hit and destroy carriers on the move at 30-knots from 1,000 miles away. Targeting, guidance on the move, fire control, ISR and other assets are necessary for these kinds of weapons to function as advertised. GPS, inertial measurement units, advanced sensors and dual-mode seekers are part of a handful of fast-developing technologies able to address some of these challenges, yet it does not seem clear that long-range anti-ship missiles such as the DF-21D will actually be able to destroy carriers on the move at the described distances. An F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 23 flies over the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78). U.S. Navy photo by Erik Hildebrandt Furthermore, the Navy is rapidly advancing ship-based defensive weapons, electronic warfare applications, lasers and technologies able to identify and destroy approaching anti-ship cruise missile from ranges beyond the horizon. One such example of this includes the now-deployed Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air system, or NIFC-CA. This technology, which travels in carrier-strike groups, combines ship-based radar and fire control systems with an aerial sensor and dual-mode SM-6 missile to track and destroy approaching threats from beyond-the-horizon. The Navy is also developing a new carrier-launched tanker, called the MQ-25A Stingray, to extend the combat range of key carrier air-wing assets such as F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-35C Joint Strike Fighters. The range or combat radius of carrier-based fighter jets, therefore, is fundamental to this equation. If an F-35C or F/A-18 can, for instance, only travel roughly 500 or 600 miles to attack an inland enemy target such as air-defenses, installations and infrastructure - how can it effectively project power if threats force it to operate 1,000-miles off shore? Therein lies the challenge and the requisite need for a drone tanker able to refuel these carrier-launched aircraft mid-flight, giving them endurance sufficient to attack from longer distances. As for a maiden deployment of the USS Ford slated for 2022, Navy officials tell Warrior Maven the ship will likely be sent to wherever it may most be in need, such as the Middle East or Pacific.","The US Navy is planning to finalize weapons integration on its new USS Ford carrier and explode bombs in various sea conditions near the ship to prepare for major combat on the open seas. “Shock Trials,” as they are called, are typically one of the final stag…",2018-05-15T15:28:25Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Themaven.net'}",The Navy is about to explode bombs near the USS Ford to prepare it for major combat,https://www.themaven.net/warriormaven/sea/navy-to-explode-bombs-near-new-uss-ford-carrier-finalize-weapons-Q2R91cWqzEuwVmsbLq3B0g/,https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5afaf87f9aa4ceec068b4c26-640-320.jpg,,Themaven.net,twister,1
Dennis Perkins,"There aren’t many actors on a bigger roll at the moment than Sterling K. Brown. A pivotal role in the worldwide smash Black Panther, his first Saturday Night Live hosting gig this weekend, and an award-winning triple play ( Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG award) for his role as Randall in everyone’s destination ugly-cry series This Is Us ? That’s more success than most actors get in a career, so Brown’s infectious enthusiasm on Thursday’s Tonight Show was completely understandable. Host Jimmy Fallon doesn’t need much prompting to gush over his guests, but, with the genial and funny Brown in the house, at least Fallon’s giggly effusiveness was understandable, too. On his role as N’Jobu in the record-crushing Black Panther, Brown, pointing to his childhood worshipping superheroes played by Christopher Reeve and Michael Keaton, told Fallon how tickled he is at the thought of little white and Asian kids dressed up as T’Challa this Halloween. “I never saw someone who looked like me,” enthused Brown, pointing to the genuinely moving recent Tonight Show bit where starstruck fans were overcome at the reveal of Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman. “It means something to people,” said the clearly moved Brown. As to Saturday’s live SNL comedy endurance test, Brown assured Saturday Night Live vet Fallon that his theater experience has him both suitably impressed by the SNL staff, and approaching the stint in a state of relative calm. Indeed, Brown schooled Fallon in an impromptu tongue-twister vocal warmup and in one of those farting-around party games Fallon makes everyone play. (Brown thoroughly outplayed Fallon in the lightning round word association game. Remember: cookies are the most dangerous food.) But, with the This Is Us season finale coming up on Tuesday, Brown—who in a previous visit had played it spoiler-cagey with Fallon about his Black Panther role—teased the Tonight Show audience with hints of yet another major This Is Us heartbreak. Noting that the season has been building up to the wedding of Chrissy Metz’s Kate and Chris Sullivan’s Toby, Brown’s seemingly offhand remark “whether they happen or they don’t happen” caused the sort of audible, justifiably anxious moans This Is Us fans emit with regularity.

I kind of looked up and laughed and told my wife, I think were missing part of the roof, he said.
First responders arrived within minutes, shining flashlights through a bedroom window and asking if any survivors were inside. They told the family to stay put because of the danger from debris and downed electric lines.
They emerged from their house a couple of hours later. But they wouldnt comprehend the scope of the damage until the next day. 
It really didnt hit me until we came back over and it was daylight and I was able to see, he said. And I was just thankful to God because I couldn't believe we survived this. It was pretty horrific.

The four walls of their house were still standing. But the entire roof was gone. And nearly everything inside their furniture, TVs and most of their clothing was either destroyed or scattered to the winds. 
They lost old wedding and baby pictures, school projects and drawings by the kids. 
Its the sentimental stuff that you miss, Gail Sanders said.
The family gathered Tuesday at their house to sort through what was left and toss out what they couldnt salvage. Gail Sanders clutched a big stuffed bear her husband won for her at the fair in Tallahassee during one of their first dates more than 20 years ago. They named the bear Nijal at the time. Later, they gave their first born the same name.
He was in the family before the kids, she said. Im so grateful. Both my Nijals made it.
'Long recovery' ahead

The tornado, an EF2 with winds of 120 mph, touched down at 7:54 p.m. and tracked 2.7 miles, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee. Six minutes after it touched down, the tornado lifted northeast of Highway 84.
The twister damaged or destroyed 129 residences and 38 businesses, said Richard Phillips, director of the Grady County Emergency Management Agency. No one was killed. The National Weather Service reported two injuries.
A woman in her late 70s who lives on Second Street Southwest just behind the Sanders family was lucky to be alive after the tornado ripped the red metal roof off her house and knocked down two exterior walls. The woman, whose house was shown on the front page of the Tallahassee Democrat, was injured and taken to the hospital after the storm.
The Rev. Dr. Debra Knight, pastor of Bethlehem AME Church, located across the street from the womans house, said Tuesday her condition was improving. The woman sings in the church choir, serves on the Stewardess Board and always volunteers to help, Knight said.
She was the most injured person that was in her house during the time of the tornado, Knight said. But thank goodness for the support of EMS and the community members. They were able to get her out and get her to a hospital.

The church, which has been giving out food, water and tarps, escaped major damage from the tornado.
About 4,000 city electric customers lost power after the storm, Phillips said. But by Friday, that number was down to 120; most without power had major damage to their homes. All roads were clear by Friday. A shelter, which no one stayed in, was set to close over the weekend.
Its going to be a slow recovery, Phillips said. But we are bouncing back. And theres been a good outpouring of everyone coming together and helping the neighbors. And I would like to thank all the surrounding counties for offering aid and help.
'The end of the rainbow'

The tornado left telltale signs throughout Cairo, a small town about 35 miles north of Tallahassee that also saw significant damage during Hurricane Michael.

Pieces of red tin from the womans house on Second Street Southwest were left twisted around branches of nearby trees. At the Sanders house, Natural Lite beer cans from somewhere else were deposited in the trusses of their roof. A neighbor found Nayas seventh-grade yearbook in his yard. A jacket Raymond Sanders left slung over a chair in his dining room was found by another neighbor.
Its been kind of crazy around here, Raymond Sanders said.
Gail Sanders hopes the family can rebuild in the same spot theyve lived in the past 17 years. They're staying with family members for now.

Ill miss this house, she said. I raised my kids up in this house. My kids first birthday parties were here. So hopefully we can just get a mansion in this same spot and continue our memories right here.
Raymond Sanders said a heavy loss adjuster was coming out to determine whether the house could be saved. He expects insurance will cover his losses, including their destroyed carport and damage to their cars.
Were believing and were hopeful that things will get better, he said. I truly believe anytime you go through a storm, theres a blessing at the end. Its kind of like that rainbow and the gold at the end of it. So were just waiting to get to the end of the rainbow.

jacobbogers,"libRmath.js This is a 100% Pure Javascript ( TypeScript ) re-write of Statistical R nmath ""core"" numerical library found here. This is a manual re-write, ""emscripten"" was not used. Summary libRmath.js port contains all functions implemented in R nmath counterpart: probability and quantile functions related to 21 distributions. functions to work with Special functions in mathematics ( Bessel, Gamma, Beta ). 7 uniform PRNG's. (same output pseudo-random sequence in R for the same initial seeding). 6 normally distributed PRNG's. (same output sequence in R for te same initial seeding). Function vector (array) arguments follow the R recycling rule. With this library it becomes trivial to implement hypothesis testing in javascript, calculating p-values and (1 - α) confidence intervals. ( ANOVA uses the F-distribution. Tukey HSD uses ptukey function, etc, etc). All functions in libRmath.so has been re-written to Javascript ( Typescript ). Use the library with either vanilla Javascript or Typescript. Type definition files are included in the npm package. Node and Web The library is an UMD library, it can be used in a web client as in server side node environment. Installation serverside npm install --save lib-r-math.js web The module directory contains a minimized bundle for use in html &lt;script&gt; tag. The library is attached to the window.libR object after loading. &lt; script src = "" your_server_url/libR.min.js "" &gt;&lt;/ script &gt; &lt; script &gt; const libR = window. libR.; // fetch some distribution namespaces const { Tukey, Normal, Beta, StudentT, Wilcoxon } = libR; &lt; / script &gt; Table of Contents Differences with R Some implementation differences exist with R nmath PRNG's are not global singletons, but separate object instances and you can have as many as you want. The programmer has the choice of having different deviate generators sharing a common source PRNG. Wilcoxon Sum Rank functions dwilcox, pwilcox, qwilcox use a fraction of the memory, (R will give memory allocation errors for samples ~1000). The JS solution allocates memory sparsely. Helper functions for porting R programs Summary R language operators and function arguments can work with vectorized input. These helper functions are used to mimic this functionality and assist porting of scripts from the R ecosystem using libRmath.js. div Divides scalar or an array of values with element of the second array or scalar. Usage: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { div } = libR. R ; // 1 div ( 3, 5 ); // = 3/5 // 0.6 div ([ 0, 1, 2, 3 ], 5 ); // [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6] div ([ 10, 2, 3 ],[ 2, 4 ]); // Uses R recycling rules // [ 5, 0.5, 1.5 ] mult Multiplies scalar or an array of values with another scalar or array of values. Applies R recycling rules in case of arguments of unequal array length. Usage: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { mult } = libR. R ; // 1 mult ( 3, 5 ); // = 3*5 // 15 mult ([ 0, 1, 2, 3 ], [ 5, 2 ]); // R recycling rules apply // [ 0, 2, 10, 6 ] sum Analog to R 's sum function. Calculates the sum of all elements of an array. const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { sum } = libR. R ; // 1 sum ( 5 ); // trivial // 5 // 2 sum ([ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]); // 10 summary Gives summary information of numeric data in an array. typescript decl declare function summary( data : number []) : ISummary ; // output interface ISummary { N : number ; // number of samples in ""data"" mu : number ; // mean of ""data"" population : { variance : number ; // population variance (data is seen as finite population) sd : number ; // square root of the population variance }; sample : { variance : number ; // sample variance (data is seen as a small sample from an very large population) sd : number ; // square root of ""sample variance"" }; relX ; // = x-E(x) relX2 ; // = ( x-E(x) )^2 stats : { min : number ; // minimal value from ""data"" ' 1st Qu.

R ; summary ([ 360, 352, 294, 160, 146, 142, 318, 200, 142, 116 ]) /* { N: 10, mu: 223, population: { variance: 8447.4, sd: 91.90973833060346 }, sample: { variance: 9386, sd: 96.88137075826292 }, relX: [ 137, 129, 71, -63, -77, -81, 95, -23, -81, -107 ], relX2: [ 18769, 16641, 5041, 3969, 5929, 6561, 9025, 529, 6561, 11449 ], stats: { min: 116, '1st Qu.': 143, median: 180, '3rd Qu.': 312, max: 360 } } */ numberPrecision Truncates numbers to a specified significant digits. Takes single numeric value as argument or an array of numbers. Usage: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const digits4 = libR. R. numberPrecision ( 4 ); // 1 single value const pr4a = digits4 ( 1.12345678 ); // 1.123 // 2 works with arrays const pr4b = digits4 ([ 0.4553, - 2.1243 ]); // [ 0.4553, -2.124 ] any Test a Predicate for each element in an Array. Returns true or false depending on a test function. Usage: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const any = libR. R. any ; // 1 any ([ 1, 2, 3, 4 ])( x =&gt; x &lt; 2 ); // true // 2 any ([ 1, 2, 3, 4 ])( x =&gt; x &gt; 5 ); // false arrayrify (DEPRICATED use multiplex ) Mimics R vectorized function arguments. Wraps an existing function changing the first first argument to accept both scalar (number) or an array( number[] ). Note: Only the first argument is vectorized typescript decl declare function arrayrify&lt; T, R &gt;( fn : ( x : T,... rest : any []) =&gt; R ); R example # raise each element by power of 2 c( 1, 2, 3, 4 ) ^ 2 # [1] 1 4 9 16 Javascript equivalent const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { arrayrify } = libR. R ; // create vectorize ""/"" operator const pow = arrayrify ( Math. pow ); pow ( 3, 4 ); // 81 pow ([ 3, 4, 5 ], 4 ); // 81 256 625 each Functional analog to Array.prototype.forEach, but can also loop over object properties. The return type can be either an new array or a scalar (see Example ). Example: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { each } = libR. R ; each ( 11 )( v =&gt; console. log (v * 2 )) ; // single element array result are forced to return scalar each ([ 3 ])( v =&gt; console. log (v * 2 )); each ([ 11, 12 ])( ( v, idx ) =&gt; console. log ({ v, idx})); // looping over object properties each ({ p : 1, name : ' myname ' })( ( value, key ) =&gt; console. log ( ` ${ key } = ${ value } ` )) flatten or c (alias) Analog to R's c function. Constructs a final array by (recursively) flattening and merging all of its arguments which can be a combination of scalars and arrays. Example: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); // optionally rename as `c` to make it look like `R` const { c } = libR. R ; c ( - 1, 0, [ 1 ], ' r ', ' b ', [ 2, 3, [ 4, 5 ]]); // [ -1, 0, 1, 'r', 'b', 2, 3, 4, 5 ] map Functional analog to Array.prototype.map, but can also loop over object properties. The return type can be either an new array or a scalar (see Example ). Example: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { map } = libR. R ; map ( 11 )( v =&gt; v * 2 ); // 22 // single element array result are forced to return scalar map ([ 3 ])( v =&gt; v * 2 ); // 6 map ([ 11, 12 ])( ( v, idx ) =&gt; idx); // [0, 1] // looping over object properties map ({ p : 1, name : ' myname ' })( ( value, key ) =&gt; ` ${ key } = ${ value } ` ) // [""p=1"", ""name=myname""] selector Filter function generator, to be used with Array.prototype.filter to pick elements based on their order (zero based index) in the array. Usually used together with seq to pick items from an array. NOTE: Always returns an instance of Array. Example: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { selector } = libR. R ; [ ' an ', ' array ', ' with ', ' some ', ' elements ' ]. filter ( selector ([ 0, 2, 3 ]) // select values at these indexes ); // [ 'an', 'with', 'some'] [ ' an ', ' array ', ' with ', ' some ', ' elements ' ]. filter ( selector ( 3 ) // just one value at position 3 ); // ['some'] const seq = libR. R. seq ()(); // see ""seq"" for defaults. [ 7, 1, 2, 9, 4, 8, 16 ]. filter ( selector ( seq ( 0, 6, 2 ) // creates an array [ 0, 2, 4, 6] ) ); // returns [7, 2, 4, 16] seq typescript decl const seq = ( adjustUp = 0 ) =&gt; ( adjustDown = adjust ) =&gt; ( start : number, end : number = 1, step : number = 1 ) =&gt; number []; R analog to the seq function in R. Generates an array between start and end (inclusive) using step (defaults to 1 ). The JS implementation ignores the sign of the step argument and only looks at its absolute value. Like in R, If (end-start)/step is not an exact integer, seq will not overstep the bounds while counting up (or down). Arguments: adjustUp : (default 0). If end &gt;= start then adjust value is added to every element in the array. adjustDown : (default 0). If start &gt;= end then adjustMin value is added to every element in the array. start : (inclusive) the sequence start value stop : defaults to 1. (inclusive) the sequence stop value if possible with step step : defaults to 1, sign is ignored. Sign is inferred from the values of start and stop. First we look how seq works in R. R seq( 1, 3, 0.5 ); # [1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 seq( 7, - 2, - 1.3 ); # [1] 7.0 5.7 4.4 3.1 1.8 0.5 -0.8 Equivalent in Javascript const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); // seqA is a sequence generator let seqA = libR. R. seq ()(); seqA ( 1, 5 ); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] seqA ( 5, - 3 ); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3 ] seqA ( 3 ) // [3, 2, 1] // add 1 if stepping upwards, add -2 if stepping downwards let seqB = libR. R. seq ( 1 )( - 2 ); seqB ( 0, 4 ); // range will be adjusted with '1' // [ 1, 2, 3, 4] seqB ( 6, 5, 0.3 ); // range will be adjusted with '-2', step // [4, 3.7, 3.4, 3.1] multiplex Turns an existing javascript function into one that follows the R argument recycling rule. Multiplexes the value of several array arguments into one array with the use of a mapping function. The length of the result is the maximum of the lengths of the parameters. All parameters are recycled to that length. const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { multiplex, c } = libR. R ; // make the build in Math function follow R-recycling rule const pow = multiplex ( Math. pow ); // pow ([ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], 2 ); // squared // [ 1, 4, 9, 16 ] // powers of 2 pow ( 2, [ 2, 3, 4 ]) // [ 4, 8, 16 ] // R recycling rule pow ([ 2, 3 ], [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ]); // [4, 27, 16, 243] // 4 = 2 ^ 2 // 27 = 3 ^ 3 // 16 = 2 ^ 4 // 243 = 3 ^ 5 timeseed Generates a number based by on your system time clock. Intended use is with PRNG (re)initialization. Its a synchronized function that will wait for some milliseconds before sampling the system clock and returning a result. Usage: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { rng : { timeseed } } = libR; timeseed (); // 2632999169, based on timestamp Uniform Pseudo Random Number Generators Summary In 'R', the functions that generate random deviates of distributions (Example: Poisson ( rpois ), Student-t ( rt ), Normal ( rnorm ), etc) use uniform PRNG's directly or indirectly (as wrapped in a normal distributed PRNG). This section discusses the uniform distributed PRNG's that have been ported from R to JS. The 7 Uniform Random Number Generators All 7 uniform random generators have been ported and tested to yield exactly the same as their R counterpart. Improvements compared to R In R it is impossible to use different types of uniform random generators at the same time because of a global shared seed buffer. In our port every random generator has its own buffer and can therefore be used concurrently. General Usage All uniform random generator classes have these public methods: init : set the random generator seed. Same as R set.seed() seed (read/write property) : get/set the current seed values as an array. Same as R.Random.seed. unif_random : get a random value, same as runif(1) in R ""Mersenne Twister"" From Matsumoto and Nishimura (1998). A twisted GFSR with period 2^19937 - 1 and equi-distribution in 623 consecutive dimensions (over the whole period). The seed is a 624-dimensional set of 32-bit integers plus a current position in that set. usage example: const libR = require ( ' lib-r-math.js ' ); const { R : { numberPrecision }, rng : { MersenneTwister, timeseed } } = libR; // helpers const precision = numberPrecision ( 9 ); // 9 digits accuracy // example const mt = new MersenneTwister ( 12345 ); // initialize with seed = 12345 // example mt. init ( timeseed ()); // Use seed derived from system clock // example mt. init ( 0 ); // re-initialize with seed = 0 // show first 8 values of the seed buffer of the mt instance. mt. seed. slice ( 0, 8 ); /* [ 624, 1280795612, -169270483, -442010614, -603558397, -222347416, 1489374793, 865871222 ] */ const rmt1 = mt. unif_rand ( 5 ); precision (rmt1); // [ 0.8966972, 0.265508663, 0.3721239, 0.572853363, 0.90820779 ] Equivalent in R RNGkind( "" Mersenne-Twister "" ) set.seed( 0 ) # show first 8 values of the seed buffer.

All 6 normal random generators have been ported and tested to yield exactly the same as their R counterpart. General Use All normal random generator adhere to the same principles: A constructor that takes an instance of a uniform PRNG as an argument A function norm_random : get a random value, same as rnorm(1) in R. A function unif_random : the underlying uniform PRNG. The default argument for the constructor for normal PRNG is : Mersenne-Twister. The class instance property rng contains the wrapped uniform PRNG instance. All PRNG producing normal variates are packaged under the JS library name space rng.normal. ""Ahrens Dieter"" Ahrens, J.

Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution. Likewise, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values. dlnorm, qlnorm, plnorm, rlnorm These functions are properties of an object created by the LogNormal factory method. The factory method needs the result returned by the Normal factory method. Various instantiation methods are given as an example.

MICHAEL WEISSENSTEIN and ANDREA RODRIGUEZ / AP,"(HAVANA) — A tornado and pounding rains smashed into the eastern part of Cuba’s capital overnight, toppling trees, bending power poles and flinging shards of metal roofing through the air as the storm cut a path of destruction across eastern Havana.
Power was cut to many areas and President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Monday at least three people were killed and 172 injured.
Julio Menendez, a 33-year-old restaurant worker, said his neighborhood in Havana’s 10 de Octubre municipality looked “like a horror movie.”
“From one moment to the next, we heard a noise like an airplane falling out of the sky. The first thing I did was go hug my daughters,” who are 9 and 12, he told The Associated Press.
Driver Oster Rodriguez said that amid a fierce storm, what looked like a thick, swirling cloud touched down in the central plaza of the Reparto Modelo neighborhood “like a fireball.” He saw a bus blown over, though he said the driver escaped unharmed.
Miguel Angel Hernandez of the Cuban Center for Meteorology said the tornado was a Category F3, with winds between 155 and 199 miles per hour, produced when a cold front hit Cuba’s northern coast.
Members of the Provincial Defense Council of Havana said 90 homes collapsed completely and 30 suffered partial collapse.
More than 200,000 people lost water service, largely because of power cuts that left pumps out of service. Some 100 underground cisterns close to the coastal section of Havana were contaminated by seawater.
Three electric substations were knocked out by the tornado, the strongest to hit Cuba since Dec. 26, 1940, when a Category F4 tornado hit the town of Bejucal, in what is now Mayabeque province.
The windows in the seven-story Daughters of Galicia Hospital in 10 de Octubre section were sucked out of their frames by the wind, leaving curtains flapping in the breeze, and all the patients, new and expectant mothers, had to be evacuated. In the streets, a palm tree more than 30 feet (9 meters) tall had crushed a pre-revolutionary American car.
Some of the heaviest damage from Sunday night’s rare Havana tornado was in the eastern borough of Guanabacoa, where the apparent twister tore the roof off a shelter for dozens of homeless families.
Cubans enduring long waits for government housing often live in such multifamily shelters for years.
María Esther Linares, 54, was killed while hunting for safe shelter after the tornado broke the roof of the home where she was living with two granddaughters, said her grandson, Yoelkis Dip.
Dianabys Bueno, 31, was living in the shelter with her husband and son after they were forced to relocate by the collapse of their home in Central Havana. Much of the housing in Havana is in dire condition due to years without maintenance, and building collapses are routine even in ordinary storms.
“This has already happened to us once,” Bueno said. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Around Havana, cars were crushed by fallen light posts and vehicles were trapped in floodwaters. The neighborhoods of Regla and 10 de Octubre appeared to have suffered some of the worst damage.
State media said the city had been hit by winds in excess of 60 mph (100 kph).
Leanys Calvo, a restaurant cook in the 10th de Octubre borough, said she was working Sunday night despite heavy rain and wind when she heard a rumbling noise outside and looked out to see what appeared to be a tornado touching down.
“It was something that touched down, and then took off again. It was like a tower,” she said, describing it as displaying colors of red and green. “It was here for two-three seconds, nothing more. They were the most frightening seconds of my life.”
The tornado tore the concrete roof off an apartment building in the Regla section of Havana and dumped it into an alleyway, briefly trapping residents in their homes.
Marlene Marrero Garcia, 77, said she was in her ground-floor apartment with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren Sunday night when she heard electrical transformers begin to explode. Then the tornado passed.
“It looked like fire, everything was red, then everything began to fall,” she said.
Marrero said she and her family were trapped by debris for about half an hour before firefighters arrived.
She and other residents said two of their neighbors had been hospitalized.

,"At a Glance
A tornado left serious damage in Port Orchard, Washington, Tuesday afternoon.
Authorities said no serious injuries were reported.
The twister was in progress just 15 miles southwest of Seattle.
Multiple homes were damaged in the town of Port Orchard, Washington, by a tornado that struck the town Tuesday afternoon.
The National Weather Service confirmed the twister was in progress just before 2 p.m. local time Tuesday. Minutes later, local news helicopters showed serious damage to several homes in one neighborhood, including one that had its roof ripped off.
""There's roofs ripped off of things. There's windows bashed in. There's (power) lines down everywhere. It's just a mess,"" local resident Emily Silverman told KOMO-TV. ""There's big chunks of metal everywhere. It's just bad. It's really bad.""
(MORE: Late-Week Storm Could Cause Problems for Holiday Travelers)
Local authorities said no serious injuries were reported. The National Weather Service said it would send a survey crew Wednesday morning to determine the strength of the twister.
If confirmed to be at least EF2, it would be the first F2/EF2 or stronger tornado confirmed in the state of Washington since May 13, 1986, according to the Tornado History Project. In Kitsap County, where Port Orchard is the county seat, only one other tornado has been confirmed since 1954 an F0 twister that struck on April 9, 1991, the website also said.
""A low-pressure system west of British Columbia sent surges of moisture into the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday as a cold front slid eastward across Washington state,"" said weather.com meteorologist Brian Donegan. ""Tornadoes are rare in the state, where just shy of three tornadoes touch down in an average year, typically in the late spring or early summer.""

Mike Wehner,"Tornadoes are some of the most destructive weather events on the planet, so understanding how they form is vital in forming early warning systems that give people plenty of time to take cover. It’s long been thought that rotation in storm clouds is the very first sign that a twister is taking shape, but new research suggests that the cloud rotation might actually be the last piece of the tornado puzzle. While monitoring a large tornado-producing storm in central Oklahoma, meteorologist Jana Houser of Ohio University gathered readings using a mobile Doppler radar that logged wind speeds twice per minute. This painted a detailed picture of the exact moment the clouds began to rotate, but it wasn’t until afterward that Houser and her fellow researchers noticed an anomaly. After comparing the timeline of the Doppler readings with observations made by witnesses, the researchers noticed that the tornado was already tearing up the ground before it was detected by cloud rotation. The rotation, it seems, began near the ground before carrying up to the storm cloud. That’s the opposite of how tornadoes are typically thought to form, and raises some serious questions about how best to forecast them. “We need to reconsider the paradigms that we have to explain tornado formation, and we especially need to communicate this to forecasters who are trying to make warnings and issue warnings,” Houser said in a statement. “You are not going to really ever be finding strong evidence of a tornado descending, so we need to stop making that a priority in our forecasting strategies.” If ground-level rotation is the first piece of the tornado puzzle, finding a way to detect it before waiting for rotation in the clouds high above could help to improve warning systems and even save lives. Houser presented her findings at a recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union.","Tornadoes are some of the most destructive weather events on the planet, so understanding how they form is vital in forming early warning systems that give people plenty of time to take cover.

"Marnie Shure, Becca James, Dan Neilan, Jose Nateras, Dan Jakes, Zach Brooke, Brianna Wellen, and Caroline Siede on AUX, shared by Marnie Shure to The A.V. Club","In Podmass, The A.V. Club sifts through the ever-expanding world of podcasts and recommends the previous week’s best episodes. Have your own favorite? Let us know in the comments or at podmass@avclub.com. Twice a month, Mary Kay McBrayer and Maegan Stone Brooks analyze horror movies “because no one wants to be scared alone. But no one wants to stop watching scary movies, either.” A literature professor and a behavioral therapist, respectively, McBrayer and Brooks apply serious lenses to the films they watch to determine how stuff scares you and why, while also supplying humorous insights. It’s a balance that lends itself well to the psychological horror of Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film Black Swan as the hosts delve deep into character motivation and the threatening relationships that are often fostered in the dance world and which are on full display between the film’s ballerinas Nina (Natalie Portman) and Lily (Mila Kunis). All this before a sillier look at the dancers’ and hosts’ skills, which leads to this episode’s namesake quote “I’m the fucking Gravitron.” Give the podcast a listen to discover exactly what that’s about. [Becca James] My Neighbor Totoro is a common entry point into the Studio Ghibli canon, so it makes sense that Film4’s Michael Leader and Jake Cunningham are tackling it early on in their new podcast. Though it was one of the studio’s first films—and was paired in a jarring double bill with the heart-wrenching Grave Of The Fireflies — Totoro was a huge success and managed to contain all the elements that audiences would come to expect from Ghibli’s most recognized director, Hayao Miyazaki. The themes of childhood innocence, the confrontation of the surreal, and the quintessentially Japanese setting are all present in Miyazaki’s work right out of the gate. Basically, if you like this movie, you’re going to like what else Ghibli has got going on. And since this podcast is being produced in conjunction with Film4’s retrospective of Ghibli films this summer, Ghibliotheque is offering a first-time viewer perspective for people coming to these classics a little late. Jake Cunningham’s fresh-eyes take on these films is a reminder that they are, in many ways, timeless. After all, there’s never a bad time for a Catbus. [Dan Neilan] Halloweeners: A Horror Movie Podcast Nosferatu Because the horror genre is so prolific and its canon grows steadily every year, it can be easy to forget some of the iconic films from the early days of filmmaking that set the stage for newer entries. In this episode of Halloweeners: A Horror Movie Podcast, hosts Cody and Kira take a look at just one such film: Nosferatu (1922). With both hosts having seen different versions of the German silent film, there were minor discrepancies in subtitles and intertitles, allowing for the two to compare and contrast their viewing experiences. Both Cody and Kira offer a lot of fun commentary, while still drawing attention to Nosferatu ’s less-than-subtle xenophobia and allusions to anti-Semitism. With a colloquial back-and-forth and plentiful allusions to the music of ABBA, Halloweeners offers an entertaining exploration of this highly influential horror movie, and may well lead listeners to join in as the charming hosts bounce through horror movie history, sharing their thoughts on everything from recent releases like Get Out and Hereditary to 1954’s The Creature From The Black Lagoon. [Jose Nateras] If you’re going to do a podcast about theme parks, you damn well better get some guests who are passionate about theme parks. That’s exactly what guest Matt Rogers ( Las Culturistas ) brings to Podcast: The Ride in this episode: passion. Specifically a passion for the bygone genre of theme-park rides commonly known as “special effects shows.” These rides (or perhaps we should call them “experiences” since you don’t actually ride anything) prioritized behind-the-scenes looks at movie-making over heart-pounding thrills. But Twister…Ride It Out at Universal Studios might have managed to deliver on both. It’s since been replaced by Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show ride, but you can basically relive every moment of Twister…Ride It Out through Rogers’ and the hosts’ descriptions. From the welcome video featuring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt to the artificial, indoor twister and accompanying explosions during the finale, this baby had it all. The whole conversation really harkens back to a simpler time when audiences were more than eager to “ride the movies” and theme-park designers didn’t think a realistic simulation of a natural disaster might be in bad taste. [Dan Neilan] Comedians Lauren Lapkus and Jon Gabrus broadcast on-site from Bayside High’s KKTY-FM—or more specifically, an elaborately recreated pop-up version in Los Angeles’ popular Saved By The Max restaurant concept, which pays homage to all things Saved By The Bell. Go Bayside podcast host April Richardson joins the duo to discuss the sitcom’s indelible influence on their young adult styles and their childhood understanding of high school, as well as the comforting effect it had on them as kids—even when they recognized it as the cheesy mess written by old men that it was. Just like their recent explorations of topics like professional wrestling and Oprah Winfrey, Gabrus and Lapkus mingle funny, off-the-cuff observations about the show’s idiosyncrasies they now understand as adults (how often did school principals visit teen students in their rooms in the ’90s?) with observant criticism, like how TV for young audiences regularly aged up girls while aging down boys. In a follow-up chat with Saved By The Max co-creator Derek Barry, the hosts discuss the restaurant’s long, unusual journey from party pop-up to ongoing business, and how he and his team worked to push his exercise in fandom beyond simply an Instagram-able moment. [Dan Jakes] Slate’s breakout political history podcast is back for a second season, this time tackling the Clinton impeachment saga blow by blow. The sexual relationship between Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky came to light a generation after Watergate assumed an air of mythology, forcing Americans to again confront the prospect of ousting a sitting president. But while Bill’s shameless libido encapsulates his impeachment, fellatio is but a single charge upon which his adversaries tried to nail him, as this episode demonstrates. The Clinton administration was dogged by appearances of wrongdoing from the onset; an early controversy erupting over the dismissal of White House Travel Office staff, dubbed Travelgate, proved consequential and established a depressing motif. Someone in the administration, in this case Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, looked to have acted unethically. Strident critics seized upon the perception to allege a pattern of corruption. The wounded Clintons would respond with intense secrecy, which only fed the narrative they had something to hide, especially after Foster’s death by suicide. Slow Burn further reveals that the person who served Foster his last lunch is none other than seminal Starr Report figure Linda Tripp. [Zach Brooke] Rachel Moscovich was ready to go to college when she was diagnosed with cancer. Then years later after getting her dream job, she relapsed. Then a decade later, she was diagnosed with two kinds of cancer at once. It’s a lot for one person to handle. She ended up finding the best support in an unlikely place: Tinder. Neither Moscovich nor host Nora McInerny gloss over the gravity of these situations, but in the spirit of this podcast they’re still able to take moments to be lighthearted and playful. Moscovich’s story is inspiring without sounding like a motivational poster. She doesn’t skip over the bad moments and doesn’t romanticize the good moments, but instead relies on her raw emotion to be completely vulnerable and honest about everything she went through. While it seems tragic and rare on the surface, by the end of the episode the realizations she comes to are universal: We’re all just people who want to live without being defined by outside sources. [Brianna Wellen] One downside of the rise of streaming is the loss of DVD commentaries, but The Empire Film Podcast is here to help. The British pod crew released six hours of interview content with Mission: Impossible—Fallout writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. And the spoiler-filled discussions reveal that making a Mission: Impossible movie is just as difficult as any one of Ethan Hunt’s missions. Parts one and three of the Spoiler Special series feature the lengthy conservations with McQuarrie, while part two is a shorter chat with the Empire magazine staff about the movie itself. It’s enough to satiate even the most die-hard Mission fan. Open, honest, and hugely detail-orientated, McQuarrie happily discusses every aspect of the filmmaking process, from on-set disasters to the value he places on the test-screening process. Fallout was largely written on the fly, and it’s fascinating (and nerve-racking) to hear McQuarrie discuss the improvisational way he constructed the film’s plot around its action set-pieces. Hearing him describe the chaotic process, it’s almost hard to believe the film came together at all, much less that it was one of the best movies of the summer. It helps that (according to McQuarrie) Tom Cruise can maybe control the weather. [Caroline Siede] A podcast about pretzels instantly raises the question of sustainability, but fret not, this niche NPR offering has been going strong since December 2017, releasing on average one episode per month. Hosted by Michelle Maternowski and Mitch Teich of Milwaukee radio station WUWM, The Pretzel Podcast delivers everything “from pretzels in the news, to pretzels throughout history, to pretzels in pop culture.” The latest episode comes after Teich’s return from a weeklong trip to France, which means new varieties of pretzels for the duo to consume and critique. It also spurs an interest in international pretzel news, leading Maternowski and Teich to question “how support for a pretzel-maker is affecting the prospect for peace in the Middle East.” The full story nudges Teich to elevate the salty snack, as the podcast often does in various ways, to something of a primetime cultural player and remind listeners how important food can be to politics.

Tonya Garcia,"One of the most popular attractions at SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. during the third quarter had nothing to do with the wildlife people were enjoying lots of free beer. SeaWorld SEAS, +0.16% executives have taken a number of steps to improve business performance, including focusing on season passes to drive attendance. On the earnings call, Chief Executive John Reilly said the companys free beer promotion has also proved to be popular. [W]eve committed to bring that promotion back to both parks [SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay] this summer, Reilly said on the call, according to a FactSet transcript. In fact, our free beer promotion will be available year-round at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay starting in January as part of their 60th anniversary celebration. Bier Fest also made a return appearance at Busch Gardens Williamsburg for the third year. And that event was launched at SeaWorld San Antonio. Read: Airlines offset rise in fuel costs with aggressive cost management Other SeaWorld attractions to come include what will be Floridas tallest roller coaster, Tigris, which will have educational content about tigers along the queue; Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando; and Tidal Twister, a roller coaster that will include Rising Tide Conservation, a focus on protecting the oceans and coral reefs, which is coming to SeaWorld San Diego in 2019. Overall, successful events were part of the reason Reilly gave for the better-than-expected revenue results. Revenue totaled $483.2 million, up from $437.7 million and ahead of the $475.0 million. Admission revenue was up 5.6% to $279.9 million, and food, merchandise and other revenue was up 17.7% to $203.3 million. Earnings of $1.10 per share were below the FactSet guidance of $1.11 per share. Shares closed Monday down 4.3%, and are down 0.6% in Tuesday trading. In our view, these strong results were more than just the benefit of easy comps as SeaWorld continues to make significant progress on strategic pricing, new attraction/events and streamlining its overhead cost base, wrote SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts in a note. See: Amazon offers free shipping to all customers for the holidays - why thats more appealing than dollar discounts They rate SeaWorld shares buy with a $36 price target. Wedbush analysts weigh the price decline versus the attendance increase. On the one hand, this is a trade-off that investors would be more than willing to accept going forward, especially when coupled with high-single digit attendance growth, analysts wrote in a note. On the other, investors are unlikely to see high-single digit in-park growth as a sustainable trend, and at least some of the excitement surrounding the 10% attendance growth number announced in early October was undone by a 4% decline in ticket prices. Wedbush rates SeaWorld shares neutral with a $27 price target. KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded SeaWorld to overweight less than one week ago, confident that the companys turnaround is under way.

Al Jazeera,"US rescue crews are using dogs and heat-detecting drones to search for victims of a tornado that has left 23 people dead in southeast Alabama.
Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones told a news conference on Monday that dozens are still missing a day after the giant twister hit the rural Beauregard community, leaving a path of destruction nearly a mile wide.
Jones said search crews were ""basically using everything we can get our hands on"" to comb through wreckage and debris.
That includes dogs brought in from across Alabama and neighboring states as well as drones equipped with ""infrared capability to detect heat signatures"".
Jones said the hardest-hit areas have been checked, but the searches are far from over.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said President Donald Trump called her mobile phone on Monday morning to offer help after the deadly tornadoes struck her state. 
Trump has told the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to give Alabama ""the A Plus treatment"", he said in a tweet.
To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2019
""To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!"" Trump tweeted.
'We will stand together'
Addressing storm victims in one hard-hit county, Ivey said, ""I want you to know I've got your back. We will do everything in our power to help the citizens of Lee County recover.""
""So to the people of Lee County, please know we are here today to stand with you today, tomorrow and in the weeks ahead,"" she added. ""We will stand together and get through this together."" 
At least three children are among the 23 killed by the tornado. Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said that the children killed were aged six, nine and 10.
Harris said all but six of the people killed in the storm have been identified, and his office soon will begin contacting families about funeral homes and arrangements.
Searches continue
Harris warned that the overall death toll could still increase as searches continue.
Jones said search crews are still checking addresses of people who have been reported missing.
He would not give a number for how many are still missing, but said, ""I would say dozens"".
A National Weather Service official said a tornado that struck southeast Alabama was an EF4 twister with wind speeds estimated at 170 mph (274 kph).
Meteorologist Chris Darden said the Sunday storm had a path nearly one mile (1.6 kilometers) wide, and 24 miles (39 kilometers) long, stretching towards Georgia. 
He said officials on both sides of the state line are surveying the severe storm's damage.
Darden said it was one of several tornadoes that struck southeastern Alabama.
The Sunday tornadoes were part of a powerful storm system that also slashed its way across parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.
The storm left more than 10,000 people without power as the temperature dropped.
In rural Talbotton, Georgia, about 80 miles (130km) south of Atlanta, a handful of people were injured by either powerful straight-line winds that destroyed several mobile homes and damaged other buildings, said Leigh Ann Erenheim, director of the Talbot County Emergency Management Agency.
Televised news footage showed smashed buildings with rooftops blown away, cars overturned and debris everywhere.

Joanna Goddard,"How do you sign your emails? This made me laugh…
The New Yorker wrote a funny piece about what various sign-offs really mean. “Contrary to popular belief, [XOXO] does not mean ‘hugs and kisses.’ If anything, its intended to convey light affection, like a pat on the butt from a Texan aunt,” writes Emma Rathbone. “[XO] is like when you lean in to kiss your Texan aunt on the cheek but you both turn the wrong way and kiss on the mouth.”
What about idiosyncratic sign-offs? My friend David always writes, “All good things,” which feels so elegant. “Love and other indoor sports” is the way a Judy Blume character signed all her letters. Writer Sadie Stein goes with “As ever.” An old crush once ended an email, “Yours and yours and yours,” and I almost blacked out from the romance.
I’ve written “xoxo” for so many years that it has now become a part of my name. My sign off, whether I’m writing to my husband or our exterminator, is “Joannaxo.” If it’s an important work email, I’ll sometimes leave it off, but a plain “Joanna” just looks SO RUDE.
Some people really stick with theirs. When Churchill declared war on Japan in 1941, he signed his letter to the Japanese Ambassador, “Your obedient servant, Winston S. Churchill.” When asked about it later, he pointed out, “It costs nothing to be polite.”
Do you have a signature sign-off? Do you ever sign “xo” in work emails? (Busted.)

Ryan McCaffrey,"Avalanche didn’t just dial it up to 11. They rewrote the dial. By Ryan McCaffrey Just Cause 4 reminds me of Tim Allen’s old standup act, where he’d complain about a power tool in his yard or garage not having enough power, and then the punchline would be, “So I rewired it” with that animalistic grunt for a chaser. Just Cause has always been a potent sandbox -- a power tool in its own right -- rife with possibility for players to wreak untold havoc and destruction. But Just Cause 4 doesn’t just offer more ways to wreck shop. Instead, developer Avalanche Studios rewired the whole damn thing. And by that I mean they threw away their old game engine, which had been added on and upgraded to for years, and installed the bespoke APEX engine -- complete with physics-based rendering, actual wind, and a totally new animation system. And though I didn’t get to play it myself, I did see the team’s most recent build running in real-time on a PC, and it is no joke. When I sat down to see Just Cause 4, I expected more of the playground of destruction that the series is known for. But I honestly wasn’t expecting Avalanche to have taken it this far. There’s even a tornado! (More on that shortly.) A Metal Gear Solid-esque device that lets you stick balloons to your targets, which inflate shortly after impact, lifting giant shipping crates, cars, or yes, individual bad guys into the air. After expertly parachuting and wingsuit-ing his way around Just Cause 4’s new fictional South American country of Solaris to show off the beautiful, variety-laced setting, narrative director Omar Shakir perched atop a mountain. Flecks of pollen floated in the wind, the rising sun glinting off of it. The breeze then carried Shakir, playing of course as beloved Just Cause hero Rico Rodriguez, gently towards a bridge when he hopped off the mountaintop and opened his chute. Then the real fun began. Just Cause 4 now has mods you can attach to your grappling hook. The Pulse mod, for instance, adds an electrically charged explosion when you stick your Retractor to things (the Retractor being the toy that lets you stick two things with a wire and then smash them together). How about attaching booster rockets to people so that they go spinning wildly into the air before exploding? There’s also the Air Lifter, a Metal Gear Solid-esque device that lets you stick balloons to your targets, which inflate shortly after impact, lifting giant shipping crates, cars, or yes, individual bad guys into the air. At which point, by the way, they are physics objects and can be grappled onto or otherwise toyed with. Just Cause 4 might have the most impressive large-scale physics system I’ve ever seen. Shakir then took off and wingsuited his way behind a frontline -- basically, enemy territory. Avalanche wasn’t saying much about the story, other than it revolving around Gabriella, the leader of the Black Hand organization. Things get absolutely nuts behind the frontline, with fire coming from every which way, dozens of soldiers firing away at you at a given time, etc. Next came the grand finale of the demo: the tornado. These massive weather events -- blizzards, sandstorms, and lightning storms are apparently also in Just Cause 4 -- are comprised of actual physics. So yes, things get sucked up into the tornado as they should, from random debris to cars to passenger jetliners. It’s a hell of a sight to behold, honestly. I’ve seen many games tout their physics in the past -- some of them even doing so impressively -- but I think Just Cause 4 might have the most impressive large-scale physics system I’ve ever seen. The Black Hand is evidently trying to keep the tornado from getting to the capital city, and for some reason Rico wants that to happen, so Shakir went around destroying several wind cannons that were keeping the twister at bay. It’s hard to overstate how impressive the tornado’s path of destruction is. He could only do this, mind you, after doing a little stormchasing in the yellow armored vehicle known, fittingly, as the Stormchaser, which is the one vehicle you’re safe in near the storm. It’s hard to overstate how impressive the tornado’s path of destruction is. It ripped away parts of bridges, sent the rockets Shakir fired into it spiraling up into it and out the top, and seriously, watching it vacuum up 737s was pretty damn cool. It’s rare that we see a sequel in a well-known franchise throw out its tech, especially in the middle of a hardware generation. I asked game director Francesco Antolini about it, and he told me, “We want to make our players happy. We didn't want to come to market with the same shortcomings that we did with Just Cause 3. We wanted to have something new.” I asked if the shortcomings of the console versions of the last game compared to the PC version helped seal the decision, and they acknowledged that it was one of their motivating factors. The decision seems to be paying off handsomely in Just Cause 4’s initial showing, and the December 4 release date means we don’t have to wait too long. Tim Allen would approve.

Cheryl Eddy,"Author, screenwriter, producer, and director Michael Crichton would have left an incredible legacy even if the only sci-fi works associated with him were Jurassic Park and Westworld (and their many sequels and related titles). But he had so many more movie and TV credits to his name.
Crichton, who died in 2008, did plenty of non-genre work, of coursehe created medical drama ER, which ran for a staggering 15 seasons on NBC. He also, for instance, wrote and directed the Sean Connery-Donald Sutherland period crime drama The Great Train Robbery, and produced The 13th Warrior, a Norse-mythology-meets-Antonio-Banderas (cast as an Arab man, which was apparently an OK thing to do in 1999...) adventure based on Crichtons historical fantasy Eaters of the Dead. Just to name a few.
But beyond his resurrected dinosaurs (still raking in billions as the Jurassic Worldtrilogy continues) and killer humanoid robots (both in 1973's Westworldand the current HBO series), here are nine other sci-fi movies with Crichtons DNA in them. Youll notice many of them share the authors signature themes, like technology that runs amok and science that gets way weirder than anyone intended.
9. Twister
Does the ever-entertaining Twister, released 23 years ago, still count as sci-fi? At the rate were going, concentrated outbreaks of massive tornados will be the climate change-spawned norm, rather than some incredible phenomenon that sends rival teams of weather nerds racing with glee and terror through rural Oklahoma. Crichton and his wife, Anne-Marie Martin, co-wrote the screenplay; their relationship no doubt helped inform the separated-but-still-obviously-in-love couple played by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. Crichton also co-produced the film, which was made by Stephen Spielbergs production company, Amblinand you cant help but hear Jurassic Parks dinosaurs every time one of Twisters funnel clouds starts improbably, but hilariously, growling and howling at the puny humans in its path.
8. Runaway
Crichton wrote and directed this 1984 thriller, which stars Tom Selleck at the height of his Magnum, P.I. fame as a vaguely futuristic cop on the malfunctioning robots beat. One day, his job shifts from glorified repairman to something way more dangerous when a domestic robots cooking, cleaning, and door-answering skill set suddenly expands to include cold-blooded murder. Technology out of control? Where have we seen that before? In this instance, at least, theres a villainous human hand directly controlling all of the machine mayhem. Runaway is not a particularly great movie; it does things like heavily foreshadow its dangling-off-a-skyscraper climax by reminding us over and over again how much Sellecks character hates heights. But its vintage special effects (those deadly lil robot spiders!), synth score, and castespecially a glowering Gene Simmons as the movies evil-inventor antagonist, though Kirstie Alley and Cynthia Rhodes (pre-Cheers and pre-Dirty Dancing, respectively) also add mid-1980s interestmake it a fun-in-retrospect slice of classic Crichton.
7. Looker
Crichton wrote and directed this 1981 thriller about a Los Angeles plastic surgeon (Albert Finney) whos puzzled when a stream of gorgeous models start appearing at his office, asking for microscopic alterations that will make them perfect. Since theyre already as close to perfect as most humans can get, he hesitates at firstbut finally goes through with it, even sparking romantically with one of them (played by Susan Dey). Naturally, something sinister involving technology is afoot. The perfected womenwho are all working for the same agency, the ominously-named Digital Matrix, which has been creating computer-generated 3D copies of its clients to use in commercialsstart dying off, and the true purpose of those copies (it involves hypnosis and mind control) is soon revealed. Looker has, shall we say, some plot holes, and the early-80s modeling milieu allows a certain amount of sleaze to seep in. But its warnings about subliminal advertisingseveral years before They Livedelivered the definitive take on the ideaare still intriguing, as is its exploration of verrrry early (pre-Tron!) CG.
6. Coma
Crichton directed and adapted the screenplay from Robin Cooks best-seller for this 1978 medical thriller. It has some things in common with Lookerits also about a doctor (here, played by Geneviève Bujold) who becomes suspicious when patients undergoing seemingly routine procedures at her hospital start falling into deep comas and being declared brain-dead. Much like Twister, its a bit of a stretch to call Coma sci-fi, although some creepy technology involving remote-controlled poison gas does go into the illicit coma-inducing. When the doctor eventually realizes the lucrative black-market organ trade is to blame, Coma leaps from paranoid freak-out into gruesome body-horror territory. The cast overall is outstanding, with Michael Douglas, Rip Torn, and Richard Widmark playing hospital colleagues good and evil; future Runaway star Tom Selleck as a victim; and a young Ed Harris making his big-screen debut as a helpful pathologist, several decades before his chilling turn on HBOs Westworld.
5. Sphere
Barry Levinsons 1998 undersea sci-fi thriller is based on Crichtons 1987 novel, and it has maybe the most impressive cast of any film on this list: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Liev Schreiber, Peter Coyote, Queen Latifah, and Samuel L. Jackson (whose career had picked up rapidly after his turn in Jurassic Park, mostly thanks to 1994's Pulp Fiction). And, well, the cast is about the best thing Sphere has going for it. After what appears to be a 300-year-old alien spacecraft is discovered deep beneath the ocean, the U.S. military corrals four experts to investigate and maybe even make contact. But what starts off as a pretty weird mission gets even stranger. As a dangerous typhoon closes in topside, the group realizes that its not an alien ship, but an American craft that apparently traveled way back in time through a black holethough it is carrying a large floating sphere that appears to be controlled by a vaguely malicious intelligence, but soon reveals itself to be much freakier than that. Too bad its not enough to elevate Sphere into truly suspenseful, scary, or even original territory; the films main distinguishing characteristic, other than all those A-list actors, is how talky it is. And somehow, even with all the explaining and discussion, the story still doesnt quite make sense in the end.
4. The Terminal Man
Mike Hodges (Get Carter, Flash Gordon) directed and adapted this 1974 film based on Crichtons 1972 novel. Its about a genius computer scientist (played by George Segal) who suffers from seizures that cause him to unknowingly commit acts of violence. Desperate to cure his out-of-control homicidal urges, he agrees to a radical new procedure that will install electrodes on his brain and zap him whenever a seizure starts to strikedespite his nagging (and, as it turns out, prophetic) dread about letting a computer take control of his mind. Though The Terminal Man struggled to connect with audiences, it did have some high-profile fans, notably directors Terrence Malick and Stanley Kubrick.
3. Timeline
Crichtons 1999 novel formed the basis of Richard Donners 2003 adventure about a group of archaeology students who must teleport through a wormhole to rescue their professor (Billy Connelly), whos trapped in 14th century France. Of course, things get just a little complicated once they find themselves back in 1357. A mop-topped Paul Walker, as the professors kid, gets top billing; Gerard Butler (a few years pre-300, with his Scottish accent turned on full blast) is third-billed but actually ends up with the most important role, playing a scruffy historian who falls in love with a rebellious noble (Anna Friel)and then stays behind to make sure time-travel shenanigans havent ruined the future everyone else is trying to return to. Timeline is amusing enough, but it takes itself just a touchtooseriouslyand its cast has so many characters its hard to get invested in anyones fate. But perhaps worst of all, its conflicting plot threads of eggheads with clashing agendas in the present day frantically trying to repair their wayback machine and eggheads in the past trying to outsmart a medieval army make for some awfully jarring transitions.
2. Congo
Crichton wrote Congo in 1980, and though he hoped to shepherd it to the big screen himself, it didnt get adapted (by John Patrick Shanley) into a movie (directed by Frank Marshall) until 1995. Obviously some of that was due to Jurassic Park fever (the OG JP came out in 1993), but also because of the special effects necessary to visualize Congos story, which prominently features a talking, martini-drinking gorilla named Amy (played by an actor in a furry suit that was surely cutting-edge 24 years ago). Congo wasnt entirely well-received at the time of its release (it was showered with Golden Raspberry nominations, though it had the good fortune to be released the same year as Showgirls), but if you approach it knowing that its truly a throwback B-movie masquerading as a big-budget adventure, youll be surprised at how stupidly fun it is.
When a Congo expedition funded by a communications company (and led by Bruce Campbell!) gets slaughtered while searching for a rare blue diamond, which they need for laser-related purposes, a rescue party of one (Laura Linney, who adds some gravitas) follows their trail, looking for answers. Along the way, she meets an earnest primatologist (Dylan Walsh), a swaggering guide (Ernie Hudson), a warlord (Delroy Lindo), and a treasure hunter (Tim Curry doing a hilariously theatrical Romanian accent), as well as the previously-mentioned Amy (who really does talk, and trash-talk, using a high-tech electronic voice), and a pack of extremely badass jungle creatures who can only be described as guerrilla gorillas. Oh, also, theres a greedy corporate boss (Joe Don Baker), cameos by Joe Pantoliano and James Karen, a questionable tribal ritual scene, parachutes, a sing-along, a hippo rampage, laser guns, and a massive volcanic eruption. With all that, who needs robots or dinosaurs?
1. The Andromeda Strain
Jurassic Park and HBOs Westworld aside, maybe the most-praised Crichton adaptation is this tense 1971 thriller, directed by Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, The Haunting, The Sound of Music) with a script by Nelson Gidding. (Crichtons 1969 novel also inspired a 2008 A&amp;E miniseries co-produced by Ridley Scott, which offered an updated take on the original story.) Considered to be one of the early standouts of the killer virus genre, The Andromeda Strain begins as a satellite carrying some kind of deadly-to-humans space germ crashes down in New Mexico. An elite team of military scientists (one of whom is played by Arthur Hill, who later co-starred in 1976 Westworld sequel Futureworld; my favorite, though, is the snarky doctor played by Kate Reid) frantically works to study the malevolent organism deep within Wildfire, a fortified lab thats set to self-destruct using nuclear means if theres a containment breach. Only one key exists to both start and end the self-destruct sequence, and its foisted upon the sole unmarried man on the team...setting up the films climactic race against time to stop a worldwide biological catastrophe.
The Andromeda Strain taps into fears that the space program (which was then at the height of its moon-landing era) might accidentally bring something alien and dangerous back to Earth, while also preying on Cold War-era paranoia about nukes gone wild. But the most fascinating thing about the movie might just be its production design, particularly when the story shifts almost entirely into the laba sleek, shiny, high-tech (for 1971) underground bunker that makes use of both all-white interiors and brilliantly monochrome rooms, and is so isolated the humans that populate it might as well be in outer space.

Dvora Meyers,"Two weeks ago, we saw the first glimpses of Simone Biles’s comeback after a full year off and it was impressive. In practice footage, Biles showed that she could still do most of her big skills despite the break from full-time training. Perhaps even more impressive is Biles’s Olympic rival’s return to competition. This week in Kazan, Russian Aliya Mustafina, the 2016 Olympic all-around bronze medalist and gold medalist on the uneven bars, returned to competition at the Russian national championships. It’s her first time competing since Rio. And more significantly it’s Mustafina’s first competition since giving birth to a baby girl just 10 months ago. Mustafina married bobsledder Alexey Zaytsev shortly after Rio and their daughter Alisa was born in June 2017. Mustafina returned to Round Lake, the national team training center outside of Moscow, in the beginning of September. In discussing her reasons for returning at all—something relatively rare in gymnastics—Mustafina wrote on her Instagram account: “Why did I decide to return to sport? Because I miss you, girls, the coaches who worked with me for so many years, miss being in shape (since my abs practically dissolved and the rest of the muscles, too), miss the competitions. Of course, I have a huge desire to test myself. I’ve been able to recover from injuries and I’m wondering whether I can do this after Alisa’s birth. I hope that I can.” Well, judging from how she performed in Kazan, Mustafina’s abs and other muscles have been restored. She placed fourth after two full days of competition, just short of the podium. Mustafina was edged by 2012 Olympic teammate and all-around silver medalist Viktoria Komova, who is in the midst of her own comeback from only occasional competition over five injury-spotted years. Here’s Mustafina competing today on the uneven bars, her specialty. This bar routine is very similar to the routine she performed in Rio—which earned her a second consecutive Olympic title on the event—save for missing inbar elements and a different dismount. (The inbar skills put strain on the back.) In Kazan, she performed an easier full twisting double back instead of the one-and-a-half twister that bears her name. On the second day of all-around competition, Mustafina recorded the highest score on the event, which is no small feat in a country like Russia, which is lousy with superior bar swingers. Mustafina is one of only a handful of gymnasts who have competed after giving birth. Most famously, Oksana Chusovitina returned to competition after giving birth to her son Alisher in 1999. Chusovitina is still competing. Soviet Larisa Latynina returned to competition after giving birth to her first child. In fact, she was four months pregnant while competing at the 1958 world championships. Latynina won five out of six golds at that competition.","Two weeks ago, we saw the first glimpses of Simone Biles’s comeback after a full year off and it was impressive.

Carsten Schlipf,"Editing images with software like Lightroom typically involves changing parameters like exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and so on for more than 90% of your work. These parameters are controlled using sliders that you have to drag with your mouse — sliders that emulate physical controls. But why not use such physical controls like sliders or control dials directly?
Instead of using the mouse to point to virtual controls and focus on these virtual controls, why not just use a physical control and focus on the effect on the picture while changing the values instead?
Trust me – once you get accustomed to using physical controls to directly control an image’s parameters instead of fiddling with these virtual slides in Lightroom you’ll never want to go back. It’s just way more natural and more efficient. Your workflow will benefit a lot once you focus on the image while blindly using a physical controller to adjust the parameters until the image looks right instead of focusing your eye on the mouse pointer hovering over the slider and looking at the image afterward to check whether the current position fits your desired result or not.
What’s a MIDI Controller?
A MIDI controller is a device that is typically used for music production. Each controller offers a set of various controls like buttons, control dials or faders (sliders). Movements on these controls are sent to the computer, either through specialized MIDI interface connectors or through a standard USB connector.
There is a huge variety of different MIDI controllers available today, but not all might be suitable for image manipulation since their primary purpose is music production.
Using the free open source software MIDI2LR, signals from any MIDI controller can be sent to Lightroom to control an image’s parameters. For example, turning a control dial can increase or decrease the exposure of an image.
Comparison with Palette Gear and Loupedeck
Other alternatives to using a MIDI controller that allows you to use physical controls are Palette Gear and Loupedeck. I do not want to go too much into details of these alternatives, so here is a quick overview of my personal pro and cons. Check out the manufacturer’s websites to dive into more details.
As you can see from the comparison above, Palette Gear seems to be the clear winner feature-wise, but once you collect a couple of additional controls it becomes very pricey. Loupedeck+ is ideal for the Lightroom user, who prefers an easy-to-use pre-configured solution at a fair price.
At first glance, the MIDI Controller may not look too attractive in this comparison. Depending on the controller it can be either a cheap solution or a more expensive solution, but it always requires quite some effort: You first need to think about what controls you need, then find a suitable controller, and finally assign all the functions using a not so user-friendly software. However, the reason I wrote this article is to help you get started with these drawbacks and get your own MIDI2LR setup running more easily.
Now I will explain which controls you may want to have on a MIDI controller for Lightroom, give you some criteria for selecting a suitable MIDI controller, and also present a few MIDI controllers that might work well for you.
One of the biggest challenges, when trying to use a MIDI controller with Lightroom is to find a controller that works well for Lightroom. As already said in the first part of this series, MIDI controllers are optimized for sound production, not for photo editing.
So when you start you will face a chicken-egg problem: You do not know yet how well it works and which parameters can work best for editing, while you do not have a controller yet to try it out.
Increasing contrast by turning a knob
I would like to go over some basics and then suggest a couple of selected controllers I stumbled upon on my search for the perfect controller.
MIDI Controller Controls
MIDI controllers typically feature three different types of hardware controls: buttons, faders, and knobs. Those may work more or less well for Lightroom depending on their implementation.
Different types of controls found on a MIDI controller
Buttons
The most simple controls are simple push buttons. With Lightroom you can use these for tasks like applying a rating, switching to certain panels, activating modes like crop, spot healing, brush,… and so on.
In addition the software MIDI2LR allows to load profiles by pushing a button. Every profile represents a different set of function assignments. So you can re-define all assigned functions for multiple different use cases.
For example imagine one profile for the library module, where the controls have different functions like supporting culling. With a single button’ press you can then switch to another profile for the development module that opens the development module and changes the controls for photo editing functions at the same time.
A Bit More Background
Buttons can send two types of MIDI messages: toggling states and momentary signals. Usually, MIDI controllers come with software that allows you to customize functions of a controller. For MIDI2LR make sure that all buttons are set to momentary signals. In MIDI terms a command sent by a button is called ‘note’.
The other major types of controls, faders, and knobs, which we’ll discuss next, are called ‘encoders’ and can send a number between 0 and 127. Such encoders are also called continue controller or control change and their commands are therefore called ‘cc’.
So why is this important? As soon as you start MIDI2LR you will see the terms ‘note’ and ‘cc’ as MIDI commands, when you start mapping functions.
MIDIR2LR main window showing some MIDI command mappings.
Faders
Faders (also called ‘sliders’ very often) can be used to change adjustment values like exposure, white balance, shadows,… and so on: essentially every adjustment value that is represented as a slider in Lightroom.
Lightroom basic adjustment panel.
At a first glance, faders seem to be the most natural and best way to change values as Lightroom displays most settings as sliders. The current slider position will always reflect the absolute value. For example, when a slider like the one illustrated above is positioned at a position of 75% it will always translate to an exposure value of +2.50 EV in Lightroom.
Issues arise once you have adjusted the values of an image and then move to another image with different current adjustment values.
Motorized faders work very well in this case. Motors in the faders ensure that the physical location of the fader’s thumb always matches the current value of the currently displayed picture. In case of Lightroom once you move to the next photo the motor will automatically move the fader’s thumb to the position of the current value very quickly. However motorized faders can be found in the more expensive and bigger MIDI controllers only.
Cheaper MIDI controllers typically have non-motorized faders. So when you adjust the exposure of a photo for an image to +2.5 EV by moving the fader to the position 75% the thumb of the fader will stay in this position. Now you move to the next image, where the current value is still at 0 EV. The thumb position (75%, which would translate to +2.5 EV)) is no longer in sync with the value (0 EV, which should be a thumb position of 50%). However, once you start moving this non-motorized fader slightly now then the exposure value will jump to the current position at +2.5 EV no matter what the original value was.
Now imagine you have a set of already finished images, each with different adjustment values and not just adjusted exposures, but also highlights, shadows, whites, blacks, and so on. When moving through the pictures the non-motorized fader positions will almost never match the current value.
In essence this renders non-motorized faders useless for Lightroom usage, so do not buy a controller with non-motorized sliders.
Note: MIDI2LR provides the optional ‘Pickup Mode’ to minimize the danger of unintended changes with non-motorized faders. In this case, moving the fader will not change any values until the fader has been moved to the current value. However, I still consider this as a workaround for a wrong type of control — like how you can use a hammer to drive a screw into wood.
Knobs
Similar like faders turning knobs (or control dials) can change adjustment values. However when buying a controller be careful to select the right type of knobs here as there are absolute and relative knobs.
Absolute knobs have hard stops at the start and the end and therefore have the same disadvantages as non-motorized faders: The current position will not match the current adjustment value after changing photos most of the time. Therefore do not buy a controller with absolutely positioned knobs.
Relative knobs are the cheapest and the best solution. When you look at other solutions like Palette Gear or Loupedeck, you’ll notice that both are using relative turning knobs or similar relative dials as well. Such knobs have no stops and will simply increase or decrease the current value just like the scroll wheel of a mouse.
Some controllers like the Behringer X Touch Mini have dial knobs that can also act as push buttons at the same time. This is my recommended type of control, as such a pushable turning knob allows you to not only adjust a value by turning the knob but also to reset the same value by simply pushing it.
Another plus of some turning knobs is that they have a LED ring that displays the approximate current value.
MIDI Controllers
OK, so far we have discussed the different types of controls a typical MIDI controller can provide. This should already help you to find a fitting MIDI controller on your own. Let’s have a look at a few MIDI controller that I personally consider as good candidates.
Behringer X Touch Mini
Behringer X-Touch Mini (image: Behringer with permission by Music Tribe Commercial NV Inc)
This is the controller I own and which seems to have been evolved as the most popular MIDI controller for controlling Lightroom as lots of tutorials indicate. One big plus is that at a price of less than 70 (~$80) this is a pretty cheap controller, which makes it an ideal first controller when you want to try out MIDI2LR for the first time. However, at the same time, it offers a great selection of controls for Lightroom as well.
It has 8 pushable knobs with LED rings – my favorite kind of control for adjustments. Below the knobs, you have 16 buttons. Then there is one fader on the right, which is unfortunately non-motorized and therefore more or less useless in my opinion for usage with Lightroom. I am not using it and would rather favor to not have it at all. All controls are organized into two layers (typically called ‘banks’) that you can change by pressing the A/B buttons on the right. This allows you to allocate two functions to every single control without switching MIDI2LR profiles. So in total, you have 16 knobs and 32 buttons available for mapping functions: 8 knobs and 16 buttons in layer A and another 8 knobs and 16 buttons in layer B.
Drawbacks are the already mentioned non-motorized fader and a cheaper build-quality (relatively spoken). However, I consider the build-quality very well for the given retail price.
Arturia Beatstep
Arturia Beatstep (image: Arturia)
The Arturia Beatstep looks very similar to the Behringer X Touch Mini. But it offers an additional row of knobs, plus one larger instead of the useless slider. As far as I know, the knobs are not pushable and do not have LED indicators showing the current values, which are minor drawbacks. Also, it does not seem to have two banks like the Behringer. There are 8 additional buttons on the left, where I am not sure whether you can use these for MIDI2LR. The price of about 99 (~$113) is very reasonable.
So in case you want to have twice the knobs without the need to switch through Banks, you might favor the Arturia Beatstep over the Behringer X Touch Mini.
DJ TechTools Midi Fighter Twister &amp; Midi Fighter 3D
If price is not a concern for you, you might want to take a look at the controllers Midi Fighter Twister and Midi Fighter 3D by DJ TechTools.
DJ TechTools Midi Fighter Twister (image with permission by DJ TechTools)
The Midi Fighter Twister offers 16 turnable knobs that are also pushable in four separate banks (64 knobs in total without having to switch a profile). What’s unique here is that you can configure the color of the knobs’ illuminations individually. For example, if you want to assign color adjustments, each knob can be illuminated in the color of the actual adjustment.
DJ TechTools Midi Fighter 3D (image with permission by DJ TechTools)
The Midi Fighter 3D supplements the Twister with 16 Buttons that are also organized in four separate banks. Also here you can change the color of the illuminated buttons. It also has motion detection, which might not be useful for this use case. If you are lucky you might be able to get the cheaper previous version Midi Fighter Spectra, which just had the buttons without motion detection.
I don’t have any doubts that both devices are made of the highest quality.
Now imagine the Midi Fighter 3D with its buttons below your left hand to switch functions and the Midi Fighter Twister with its knobs below your right hand to adjust values. I could imagine that this would make a great setup. However each controller costs about 250 (~$285), so the total setup will set you back about 500 (~$570). More expensive than a Loupedeck controller while still way less expensive than a comparable Palette Gear setup.
Behringer X Touch Compact
If you absolutely want a controller with motorized faders, have a look at the Behringer X Touch Compact.
Behringer X Touch Compact (image: Behringer with permission by Music Tribe Commercial NV Inc)
It has 9 motorized faders, 39 buttons and 16 knobs (the same as the X Touch Mini) in two banks. You might want to take a look at this video by Bryan Shattuck for some tips. By the way: The video also shows how motorized faders work when he is switching between photos. The faders jump to the position of the current value very quickly.
Given what the Behringer X Touch Compact provides at a price of around 300 (~$342) it looks very attractive. You just need to figure out what to do with all these controls. Also be aware that it will take away more space on your desk and it also needs an AC power connection.
Final Words
After reading this article, you should have gained the basic knowledge for selecting a MIDI controller. 
Whatever MIDI controller you will use with MIDI2LR, once you are using it consider how much time and cost it will save you once you have gotten used to it. And then consider to donate a share of the saved costs to the MIDI2LR developer through his website. The developer, Rory Jaffe, is doing a great job and is very responsive.

Ryan McCaffrey,"Avalanche didn’t just dial it up to 11. They rewrote the dial. By Ryan McCaffrey Just Cause 4 reminds me of Tim Allen’s old standup act, where he’d complain about a power tool in his yard or garage not having enough power, and then the punchline would be, “So I rewired it” with that animalistic grunt for a chaser. Just Cause has always been a potent sandbox -- a power tool in its own right -- rife with possibility for players to wreak untold havoc and destruction. But Just Cause 4 doesn’t just offer more ways to wreck shop. Instead, developer Avalanche Studios rewired the whole damn thing. And by that I mean they threw away their old game engine, which had been added on and upgraded to for years, and installed the bespoke APEX engine -- complete with physics-based rendering, actual wind, and a totally new animation system. And though I didn’t get to play it myself, I did see the team’s most recent build running in real-time on a PC, and it is no joke. When I sat down to see Just Cause 4, I expected more of the playground of destruction that the series is known for. But I honestly wasn’t expecting Avalanche to have taken it this far. There’s even a tornado! (More on that shortly.) A Metal Gear Solid-esque device that lets you stick balloons to your targets, which inflate shortly after impact, lifting giant shipping crates, cars, or yes, individual bad guys into the air. After expertly parachuting and wingsuit-ing his way around Just Cause 4’s new fictional South American country of Solis to show off the beautiful, variety-laced setting, narrative director Omar Shakir perched atop a mountain. Flecks of pollen floated in the wind, the rising sun glinting off of it. The breeze then carried Shakir, playing of course as beloved Just Cause hero Rico Rodriguez, gently towards a bridge when he hopped off the mountaintop and opened his chute. Then the real fun began. Just Cause 4 now has mods you can attach to your grappling hook. The Pulse mod, for instance, adds an electrically charged explosion when you stick your Retractor to things (the Retractor being the toy that lets you stick two things with a wire and then smash them together). How about attaching booster rockets to people so that they go spinning wildly into the air before exploding? There’s also the Air Lifter, a Metal Gear Solid-esque device that lets you stick balloons to your targets, which inflate shortly after impact, lifting giant shipping crates, cars, or yes, individual bad guys into the air. At which point, by the way, they are physics objects and can be grappled onto or otherwise toyed with. Just Cause 4 might have the most impressive large-scale physics system I’ve ever seen. Shakir then took off and wingsuited his way behind a frontline -- basically, enemy territory. Avalanche wasn’t saying much about the story, other than it revolving around Gabriella, the leader of the Black Hand organization. Things get absolutely nuts behind the frontline, with fire coming from every which way, dozens of soldiers firing away at you at a given time, etc. Next came the grand finale of the demo: the tornado. These massive weather events -- blizzards, sandstorms, and lightning storms are apparently also in Just Cause 4 -- are comprised of actual physics. So yes, things get sucked up into the tornado as they should, from random debris to cars to passenger jetliners. It’s a hell of a sight to behold, honestly. I’ve seen many games tout their physics in the past -- some of them even doing so impressively -- but I think Just Cause 4 might have the most impressive large-scale physics system I’ve ever seen. The Black Hand is evidently trying to keep the tornado from getting to the capital city, and for some reason Rico wants that to happen, so Shakir went around destroying several wind cannons that were keeping the twister at bay. It’s hard to overstate how impressive the tornado’s path of destruction is. He could only do this, mind you, after doing a little stormchasing in the yellow armored vehicle known, fittingly, as the Stormchaser, which is the one vehicle you’re safe in near the storm. It’s hard to overstate how impressive the tornado’s path of destruction is. It ripped away parts of bridges, sent the rockets Shakir fired into it spiraling up into it and out the top, and seriously, watching it vacuum up 737s was pretty damn cool. It’s rare that we see a sequel in a well-known franchise throw out its tech, especially in the middle of a hardware generation. I asked game director Francesco Antolini about it, and he told me, “We want to make our players happy. We didn't want to come to market with the same shortcomings that we did with Just Cause 3. We wanted to have something new.” I asked if the shortcomings of the console versions of the last game compared to the PC version helped seal the decision, and they acknowledged that it was one of their motivating factors. The decision seems to be paying off handsomely in Just Cause 4’s initial showing, and the December 4 release date means we don’t have to wait too long. Tim Allen would approve.

Ma Madre Natura, sotto forma di una serie di tempeste intense che attraversano l'Oklahoma, ha altri piani. Presto i tre si uniranno alla squadra di cacciatori di tempeste mentre cercano di piazzare un dispositivo di misurazione rivoluzionario nel cuore di diversi tornado estremamente violenti. Il nostro commento Il regista Jan De Bont, all'epoca reduce dal sucesso dell'action Speed, mette in scena un mirabolante disaster-movie che lascia ampio spazio ai personaggi che non si lasciano fagocitare dagli effetti spociali davvero realistici, che avrebbero vinto l'Oscar a mani basse se quell'anno non ci fosse stato Independence Day, altro disaster-movie stavolta in formato kolossal fantascientifico. Twister diverte, coinvolge e punta su una suspense in crescendo amplificata dalla sincopata ""caccia"" ai tornado, insomma un ""evergreen"" del filone catastrofico che regge davvero bene al trascorrere degli anni. Curiosità Il film è stato candidato a 2 Premi Oscar (Miglior sonoro e Migliori effetti speciali). Quell'anno per gli effetti speciali vinse Independence Day. Il film ha vinto un Razzie Award per il Peggior film con un incasso oltre i 100 milioni di dollari. Le riprese in Oklahoma sono state brevemente ritardate a causa dell'attacco terroristico dell'edificio federale Alfred P. Murrah a Oklahoma City, il 19 aprile 1995. Gran parte della troupe si è recata sul sito per aiutare i soccorsi. E' il primo film pubblicato su DVD. Una registrazione del gemito di un cammello è stata rallentata e usata come suono del tornado. (A circa 42 minuti) Secondo il libro sulla produzione del film, la mucca in CG sollevata dai tornado gemelli era originariamente una zebra in CG del film Jumanji (1995). Dopo la morte di Bill Paxton, Spotter Network ha coreografato 200 cacciatori di tempeste per formare le lettere ""BP"" con i loro blip sui tracciatori GPS in un display radar per onorare l'attore. Questo tipo di omaggio era stato realizzato solo cinque volte in precedenza e la prima volta ad essere realizzato per qualcuno che non fosse un cacciatore di tempeste. Secondo una leggenda urbana, un tornado ha colpito un cinema drive-in a Stoney Creek, Ontario, mentre questo film si stava girando. In realtà, un tornado ha colpito un drive-in a Thorold, Ontario, il 20 maggio 1996, danneggiando uno schermo. Il film non si stava girando quando il tornado ha colpito, ma era programmato per essere proiettato quella sera. Un motore jet di un Boeing 707 è stato utilizzato per generare vento in alcune scene. Il dispositivo utilizzato nel film e soprannominato ""Dorothy"" è un omaggio al vero dispositivo che i cacciatori di tornado cercano di posizionare sui percorsi dei tornado denominato ""T.O.T.O."". Sia Joss Whedon che Steven Zaillian sono stati ingaggiati per una revisione della sceenggiatura ad un costo di 100.000 dollari a settimana. Helen Hunt è stata ferita alla testa durante la ripresa della scena in cui il camion attraversa il campo di mais. Per dare al cielo sullo sfondo un aspetto tempestoso, le sequenze con i furgoni dovevano essere inondate con illuminazione ad alta intensità per creare il giusto contrasto. Di conseguenza, Helen Hunt e Bill Paxton hanno subito delle micro-bruciature della retina per gran parte delle riprese. Il film è stato girato in 95 giorni. Jan de Bont ha ricordato l'enorme difficoltà nel realizzare la sequenza della grandinata. La troupe non riusciva a trovare blocchi di ghiaccio abbastanza grandi in Oklahoma per la macchina della grandine. Hanno finito per trovarli in altri stati e alcuni sono stati ottenuti dalla Burlington Ice Company a Burlington, Iowa. Speciali blocchi di ghiaccio sono stati realizzati versando del latte con l'acqua, in modo che la grandine avrebbe avuto una migliore resa visiva sulla pellicola. Michael Crichton e sua moglie Anne-Marie Martin sono stati pagati 2 milioni di dollari per la loro sceneggiatura. Tom Hanks era la scelta originale per il ruolo di Bill Harding. Hanks ha anche accettato brevemente il ruolo e letto alcune pagine dello script con il cast prima di abbandonare. I finalisti per il ruolo sono stati Kurt Russell e Bill Paxton. Il personaggio di Lois Smith sta leggendo l' Inferno di Dante Alighieri quando il tornado colpisce Wakita. L'opera presenta anche un tornado nel secondo cerchio dell'Inferno che punisce le persone governate dalla lussuria. Il nome sull'autocisterna che allontana il pick-up di Bill dall'albero è ""Benthic Petroleum"", la stessa compagnia petrolifera per cui lavora l'equipaggio di Ed Harris in The Abyss (1989). Nella città di Wakita, location del film, l'edificio che i protagonisti utilizzavano per prepararsi alle riprese è stato trasformato in un museo per il film in cui si può trovare in mostra ""Dorothy"" e molti altri oggetti di scena. Il direttore della fotografia originale era Don Burgess (meglio conosciuto per le sue collaborazioni con Robert Zemeckis), ma lui e molti altri membri della troupe hanno abbandonato il set a metà riprese dopo una serie di scontri con il regista Jan de Bont. (A circa 59 minuti) Uno dei personaggi guarda lo schermo del loro computer meteo e urla ""Non è la luna, è una stazione spaziale!"" Questa è la battuta di Obi-Wan Kenobi quando lui, Luke, Han e Chewbacca scoprono per la prima volta la ""Morte Nera"". (A circa 1h e 35 minuti) Subito dopo che Bill e Jo escono dalla casa rovesciata, l'orsacchiotto che colpisce il suo camion è realizzato in CG. Garth Brooks ha rifiutato il ruolo di Dustin Davis. Jan de Bont che è vegetariano ha dichiarato di odiare la ripresa della scena nella casa di zia Meg quando tutti mangiano uova e bistecca. Helen Hunt aveva precedentemente sostenuto un provino per il ruolo della dottoressa Ellie Sattler in Jurassic Park (1993). Il ruolo andò a Laura Dern che a sua volta è stata considerata per il ruolo della dottoressa Jo Harding in questo film. Il nome ""Dorothy"" e l'immagine sul lato del dispositivo sono un omaggio a Judy Garland nel ruolo di Dorothy Gale in Il mago di Oz (1939). In un incontro pubblico ad una proiezione del film, Bill Paxton ha dichiarato di aver incontrato il produttore esecutivo Steven Spielberg solo un anno e mezzo dopo aver finito il film. Ha detto che Spielberg lo ha salutato con: ""Grazie per aver fatto un sacco di soldi"". Il film proiettato durante la scena del drive-in è Shining (1980), diretto da Stanley Kubrick. Ci sono un totale di otto tornado nel film. Il film costato 92 milioni di dollari ne ha incassati nel mondo circa 495. La colonna sonora Le musiche originali del film sono di Mark Mancina (Bad Boys, Con Air, Speed 2). Jan de Bont è un fan della cantante Tori Amos e ha voluto includere alcuni dei suoi brani nel film. La canzone che si può ascoltare dall'altoparlante esterno del bus di Dusty mentre sta lasciando la tavola calda è ""Child In Time"" dei Deep Purple. Una delle canzoni della colonna sonora del film, ""How"" di Lisa Loeb, si trova anche nella colonna sonora del film Jack Frost (1998) con Michael Keaton. Le canzoni dei film: 1.

Greg Evans,"The family of Bill Paxton says the Titanic actor’s death a year ago following heart surgery was unnecessary and preventable, and has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the surgeon who operated on him. Paxton, one of Hollywood’s most popular actors with such credits as Twister and Big Love, was 61 when he died following a stroke last February 25, 11 days after the heart surgery to replace an aortic valve and repair an aortic aneurysm. In the suit filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court (read it here ), Paxton’s widow, Louise Paxton, and their children James and Lydia claim Cedars-Sinai, Southbay Medical Partners and Dr. Ali Khoynezhad acted “negligently, carelessly, recklessly and unskillfully.” The surgical procedure is described variously in the lawsuit as “maverick,” “novel” and “unconventional.” The surgery, Paxton’s family claims, contributed to the post-surgical complications that led to stroke and the actor’s death. The suit further claims that Khoynezhad was “not in the hospital” as Paxton suffered complications, causing a delay in treatment. “Bill Paxton and his family trusted the physicians and staff at this medical facility but instead Cedars-Sinai betrayed their trust,” said Paxton family attorney Bruce Broillet in a statement to press. “The surgeon’s actions resulted in this tragic and preventable death.” The statement says Khoynezhad left his position at Cedars-Sinai shortly after Paxton’s death.

Jared Nelson,"Back in the summer of 2013, Graveck (yes, the makers of the ridiculous 10 Balls 7 Cups ) released the super clever puzzle game Strata ($2.99) which, at long last, put your basketweaving skills to the test. It tasked you with weaving various colored ribbons into one another in the proper order to complete each level, and it was a game we really enjoyed in our review. Now Graveck is readying the release of a spiritual successor to Strata called Optica, and it is even more of a brain twister than its predecessor. Honestly I don’t even know where to begin explaining what you do in Optica so I’ll just leave the trailer here so you can see for yourself. The developer does a good job at putting Optica into words: “Embracing simplicity with a geometric design, Optica reveals puzzles in complex and mind-bending ways. From curious shapes and optical illusions to unexpected perspectives, Optica puts spatial thinking to the test through 70+ challenging levels. Create pathways of light while strategically connecting the spaces along the way. But not all is what it seems. Rotate shapes to shift your perspective, discover hidden planes, and traverse optical illusions."" While no pricing information is available, we do know that Optica is slated to launch next week on August 28th and it’ll be published by GLITCH.

 A researcher from the Center for Severe Weather Research monitors a thunderstorm in Texas
For a few brief seconds, the rain stopped pummelling the front windscreen of the storm chasers' truck.
Not that the weather was clearing - Kelley Gene Williamson and Randall Yarnall were heading northbound directly towards the storm. At the time, on 28 March 2017, they were covering the event for the Weather Channel programme Storm Wranglers.
As they neared a junction a few miles outside Spur, Texas, a bright red Stop sign came into view on the right-hand side of the road.
Yarnall was driving his Chevrolet truck at about 70mph (113km/h) at the time, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday. A video the friends were live-streaming for the Weather Channel's Facebook page showed they made no attempt to stop at the junction.
The footage cut out a split second before a Jeep driven by Corbin Jaeger drove westbound into the junction. Jaeger, who had the right of way, was driving away from the storm.
Williamson, Yarnall and Jaeger - a respected storm chaser working for the National Weather Service - were all killed on the spot.
The lawsuit, filed by Jaeger's mother, seeks up to $125m (£95m) in damages. It puts the blame firmly at the door of Williamson and Yarnall, whom it calls ""habitually reckless and dangerous"", as well as the Weather Channel.
The lawsuit also alleges that the network's ""concept of presenting storm chasing as an adventurous, thrilling sporting event and to make its two stars 'heroes'"" caused her son's death.
The official history of tornado forecasting began in Oklahoma City in a rather informal fashion.
When a tornado ploughed through Tinker Air Force Base on 20 March 1948, it was the costliest in Oklahoma's history. It destroyed 32 military planes, tossing them across the runway with recorded wind speeds of 78mph (126km/h).
An investigation was launched, and Major Ernest Fawbush and Captain Robert Miller began compiling weather data from before and after the storm - only to realise just five days later that conditions were worryingly similar to those of 20 March.
The base issued the first ever official tornado forecast. Men found cover and aircraft were put away into hangars, before another storm of similar intensity passed through.

Within just a few years, the Severe Local Storm Warning Center was created to predict storms, based in part on Fawbush and Miller's indicators.
But even then, predictions remained unreliable. Forecasters were often wary to announce storms for fear of causing panic or making people complacent if the storms did not appear. It was only through adopting computers in the 1960s that forecasters' work became more reliable, and as the science of storm prediction became more accurate, storm chasing soon developed into a phenomenon.
David Hoadley is credited as being the father of the pursuit. After a thunderstorm tore through his hometown of Bismarck, North Dakota, in 1956, he began studying and tracking extreme weather across the US.
In a magazine interview, Hoadley described setting off alone to see his first major tornado, driving against a wave of fleeing traffic near Dodge City, Kansas, in 1965.
""It was a moment I'll always remember - the police radio; the patrolman describing some unreal, hypnotic event; the ghostly sirens moaning in the wind; and that classic cone tornado, so close and deceptively graceful as it descended to create a moment of history in the life of a small town.""
In the 1970s, the National Weather Service (NWS) created the Skywarn programme to train storm spotters. After a two-hour training course, volunteers around the country provide reports on dangerous weather and their main responsibility is to inform the service about severe local storms. 
The NWS says there are now about 400,000 trained weather spotters across the US, and while not all chase tornadoes, there has been an anecdotal rise over the past 25 years in the number of people turning out to follow storms. Storm chasers tend to put this down to one event: the release of the film Twister in 1996.
The film, starring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, profiles a team of principled but poorly-funded tornado chasers competing against richer rivals. One meteorologist reported that applications to study meteorology jumped 47% in the years after the film was released. 
During the peak tornado season, typically from April to June, hundreds of storm chasers can gather in parts of the Great Plains in the US, especially in states like Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.
There are now even tour operators who take groups out to chase storms throughout Tornado Alley - a vertical belt across the US where the storms usually form.
But despite the risks of tailing a violent and unpredictable weather system, the first deaths of storm chasers directly attributed to a tornado itself were in 2013.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Oklahoma is one of the states most prone to deadly tornadoes, like this one in 2011
Early in the evening of 31 May that year, a violent weather system produced eight tornadoes near Oklahoma City in a little more than two hours. One proved much more damaging than the others.
The tornado that struck near the town of El Reno was the largest ever recorded - stretching across 2.6 miles (4.2 km) and carrying winds of up to 302mph. The tornado and associated flooding killed 22 people, including four storm chasers.
Three of those were experienced, and known to be responsible, but were caught out when the tornado accelerated and suddenly changed direction. The fourth victim was a local inexperienced storm chaser who drove directly into the tornado's path.
They weren't the only ones around that day. An animation produced by one weather watcher showed how many registered storm chasers were in the path of the tornado as it struck.
Most storm chaser deaths - seven - have been in car accidents, and all but one of those have occurred since 2005.
Even before the fatal collision in Texas in 2017, one meteorologist and storm spotter of 45 years, Charles Doswell, had warned of the risks some chasers were taking while driving after he witnessed the aftermath of one collision.
In a follow-up blog post written after Williamson, Yarnall and Jaeger's deaths, Doswell said he was increasingly concerned about ""chaser hordes"" who were obsessed with getting as close as possible to tornadoes, rather than observing from a safe distance.
""The so-called 'chase community' (which really isn't a 'community' at all, but rather a group of people with a shared hobby) needs to take a long look at their behaviour during their chase activities,"" he wrote. ""If someone has done some irresponsible driving in the past, this might be a good time to resolve to discontinue such practices for good...
""The time is long overdue to get serious about ceasing illegal and unsafe driving during a storm chase [or any other time, for that matter!]. No one gets a free pass on the roads, and this includes people chasing for TV.""
The Weather Channel is not alone in broadcasting thrilling documentaries chronicling the lives of storm chasers: the Discovery Channel, National Geographic and the BBC, among many others, have done so too.
But the lawsuit against the Weather Channel alleges that the network had been warned by other storm chasers about Williamson and Yarnall's ""history of reckless driving"". It also says that their failure to stop at the junction where the collision occurred was their fourth traffic violation that day.
""Instead of using meteorologists experienced in the tracking of tornadoes,"" the lawsuit says, the Weather Channel ""knowingly chose two chicken farmers and cattle ranchers from Missouri without any emergency/first responder or meteorological training to star in their show.
""TWC then instructed them to barrel into dangerous weather conditions to obtain footage, needlessly endangering local residents fleeing impending catastrophe.""
The channel told the BBC it could not comment on pending litigation.

Meteorologists and storm chasers appear split over whether televised storm chasing is increasing risks to people on the ground, and whether those live-streaming tornadoes for television are providing a valuable service or not.
Jeff Frame, of the University of Illinois' Department of Atmospheric Sciences, says forecasters often watch live streams to understand a storm's changes in real time. Images distributed from the scene on social media are often ""extremely helpful"" for those who need to issue warnings, he adds.
But meteorologist Ryan Maue says he could see ""no net benefit to live storm chasing on TV"" and that ""the risk to chase the storms may outweigh the arguably minimal extra information provided"" to forecasters.
Tour operators say they warn groups about the dangers of what Kim George at Tempest Tours calls ""citizen chasers"", which she says is ""a greater issue every year"".
""When you have too many people going down the same roads it can be difficult to stop and move off the road,"" she says. ""We have a radar that shows where most of the chasers are converging and we avoid those areas.""
A spokesperson for Cloud 9 Tours agrees, advising people ""to look both ways before crossing the road - even if it's a one-way road"". 
""Other chasers may be focused on the storm and not watching the road ahead of them.""
For Dr Frame, who will take a group of students to the Great Plains in May and June, the number of people storm chasing is not the problem - this has remained fairly constant since the mid-2000s, he says.
The bigger problem, according to Dr Frame, is bad driving from chasers who are either distracted by the storm, do not park far enough off the road to keep it clear, or who do not rest sufficiently before chasing.
""I would say it is a few bad apples,"" he says. ""Most storm chasers are safe.""
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The aftermath of a 2013 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, where 24 people were killed
Captain Paul Timmons agrees. He has worked for the Oklahoma Highway patrol for three decades and he says chasers typically don't cause problems on the roads.
""It kind of depends on the season,"" he says. ""There are some people who go out storm chasing just to get a closer view of a tornado or a hail storm, and they end up having to ride it out.""
""Leave it to the professionals,"" he advises. 
Dr Frame also says that problems are likely to occur among inexperienced chasers who are more likely to panic when they find themselves trapped by a storm that changes direction suddenly. Inexperienced chasers should look to buddy up with someone who better understands storm systems, he says. 
Controlling crowds of enthusiasts is not the answer, Ryan Maue says: simple good, sensible behaviour is.
""Special laws are not required in the US to regulate storm chasing,"" he says. ""The activity is entirely legal as long as one adheres to appropriate traffic laws, stays in a safe position with respect to the storm, and does not waste the time of emergency responders by blocking roads. 
""Common sense goes a long way and this tragedy in Texas could have easily been prevented.""",A lawsuit claims reckless behaviour by storm chasers before a fatal crash.

BREMERTON, Wash. Trees were knocked into houses, roofs ripped from their buildings and gas lines were clipped as a rare tornado struck suburban Seattle on Tuesday afternoon.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
The Red Cross has opened an emergency shelter for those affected by the tornado in Port Orchard, about 15 miles west of Seattle.
Hannah Lawhead was pumping gas at a Safeway when the tornado touched down.
It was busting through the Walmart parking lot, she said. It was crazy.
National Weather Service Meteorologist Jeff Michalski said it appeared the winds and rain broke off from a larger thunderstorm line marching through the Puget Sound region.
Based on radar, it seemed pretty quick and isolated, there have been no other reports of damage, Michalski said. Thats the nature of these types of storms.
According to NOAA, the last tornado to hit Kitsap County was in 1991, when a twister struck Tracyton, pelting the area with record-setting hail.
Calls to 911 reporting trees into houses started at about 1 :55 p.m. Tuesday. The worst damage hit near the Port Orchard Walmart on Bethel Road.
Kathleen Matthews followed her daughter-in-law downstairs to a closet where they took shelter until the storm passed.
She described hearing a ""freight train.""
After the storm passed, she went outside to survey the damage and check on neighbors. Two homes were destroyed in the neighborhood. One family was inside when in happened.
""They were home and they were a little rattled, shall we say,"" Matthews said. 
Matthews said she had to evacuate her home because of a gas leak, but she found little damage.
""Other than the fact that are fence blew down, which was no big deal. If there was, I don't care, because I have a home still standing,"" she said.
The Kitsap County Sheriff's Office tweeted that the damage is ""catastrophic:""
""Most of the damage is contained to the area and neighborhoods east and south of Wal-Mart. Active power lines are down and gas companies are checking their supply lines for leaks. STAY OUT OF THE AREA OR SHELTER IN PLACE! This area has not been deemed 'safe.'
Some areas have been isolated by knocked down trees and emergency responders are going door-to-door checking on residents. As the tornado struck, 911 dispatchers received word of trailers being knocked over. One man was trapped inside but apparently freed himself.
Officials are planning to go to the area Wednesday and conduct a storm survey to gauge the strength of the tornado.
As the wind raged, rain fell in torrents nearby.
Bremerton National Airport showed about a one-third of an inch of rain from about 1:20 p.m. to 2:20 p.m. but did not experience heavy winds.

The timing of the incident delayed all South Kitsap School District buses, district spokeswoman Amy Miller said. As high school students prepared to leave the building the storm hit. Students were held at school until officials there could assess the safety of routes.
Ken Cole lives in area where the tornado struck and described the wind as ""massive.""
About six houses in that cul-de-sac are all destroyed, he said.
Now we gotta find somewhere to go, Cole said.
John Mueller and his wife were working at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard when he saw a video of the tornado churning above the Walmart  near their home. They left work and headed home to find it almost unrecognizable. The upstairs was destroyed the entire roof had been ripped off the downstairs walls were off their foundations, shattered glass was everywhere, boards were sticking out of the walls.
""It's just not our house,"" Mueller said.
Firefighters went into the house and rescued their animals.
""God is with us, it's OK,"" he said. ""Everybody's OK.""

Jay Reeves,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. (AP) Cousins Cordarrly Jones and Demetria Jones have a hard time counting all the relatives they lost to a monster tornado that wiped out a rural community in Alabama.
Their grandparents, 89-year-old Jimmy Jones and 83-year-old Mary Louise Jones, were killed in their home on a two-lane road where most everyone shares family ties.
The couples son Emmanuel Jones, a 53-year-old uncle to the cousins, is gone too. Also dead, they said, were seven cousins by both blood and marriage: Eric Jamal Stenson, 38; Florel Tate Stenson; 63; Henry Lewis Stenson; 65; James Henry Tate, 86; Tresia Robinson, 62; Raymond Robinson Jr., 63; and Maggie Delight Robinson, 57.
Stunned by the loss of 10 relatives and worried about still more who are hospitalized with serious injuries, the cousins stood Tuesday amid the wreckage of a row of family homes in tiny Beauregard, near the Georgia state line.
It really hasnt fully hit me yet. Im still trying to process it, said Cordarrly Jones, 29.
Everybody in this area just about was related, said Demetria Jones, 28. Its devastating.
With winds of as much as 170 mph (275 kph), the deadliest U.S. tornado in nearly six years rolled mobile homes across fields and caused even brick homes to collapse into unrecognizable heaps. At least 23 people were killed, some of them children. The full scale of the loss came into focus with the release of the names of the dead. The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 89.
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma. The enormous twister apparently churned for about 70 miles (110 kilometers), crossing the state line and ending in neighboring Georgia, the National Weather Service said. Government teams that surveyed Sundays damage confirmed there was an outbreak of at least 20 twisters in Florida, Alabama, Florida and South Carolina.
On Tuesday, the search for bodies, pets and belongings continued in and around Beauregard amid the din of beeping heavy machinery and whining chain saws. Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of the missing shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
Richard Tate, who is part of the same family and lost four close relatives, said he was lucky to be alive. It could have taken all of us the way it was moving, said Tate, who was inside his home with his wife when the structure was destroyed.
Bernard Reese, a distant relative of the Jones cousins, picked through the remains of his aunts house on Tuesday. He said he found more than a half-dozen bodies or fatally injured residents along Lee County 39, the road where so many of the family members died.
It bothers me, but it had to be done, said Reese, who lives about 2 miles away. He arrived in his truck after the twister passed and climbed over downed trees and power lines to get to the scene.
Reeses friend Dexter Norwood said he found three more bodies and the severed leg of a woman.
I keep seeing it. I aint slept worth a crap, said Norwood, 46. He suffered a fractured vertebra when the twister hit the mobile home he shared with his wife, but he said both are fine.
The bloated corpse of a gray horse lay on the ground beside the couples home. Norwood said he had to euthanize the animal after the storm because it suffered a serious leg injury.
The extent of the damage and death left him shaken.
I never thought Id see it, he said. Its rough.
The Jones cousins, who survived at least in part because dont live on the road where their relatives died, said they had to talk their way past police barricades to get to the scene. Officers, they said, kept asking for something to prove they were related to the victims.
I just had to tell them that everything that proves who I am is out on that road, Cordarrly Jones said.","Monster twister takes 10 relatives from 1 Alabama family The Associated Press BEAUREGARD, Ala.

'Leaving Neverland' leaves us shook
HBO's Michael Jackson documentary ""Leaving Neverland"" debuted Sunday, prompting a wave of celebrity reactions on Twitter. The documentary, which airs its second part Monday at 8 EST/PST, centers on Wade Robson, 36, and James Safechuck, 40, who say Jackson sexually abused them at ages 7 and 10, at the height of the singer's fame. Rosie O'Donnell called the documentary haunting. Wendy Williams said she didn't think ""there was any sexual touching."" Jackson's estate sued HBO over the documentary after repeatedly urging the network not to air it, denouncing the film as ""tabloid character assassination"" by ""two admitted liars.""

'Grooming and abuse' in figure skating
A  culture of ""grooming and abuse"" in figure skating has gone ""unchecked for too long,"" according to a chilling assessment Monday from the U.S. Center for SafeSport. The nonprofit's evaluation stems from work on sexual misconduct allegations against late national champion John Coughlin as well as other cases. The results come amid a war of words between the Center and U.S. Figure Skating over the investigation of Coughlin, 33, who took his life Jan. 18, one day after receiving a suspension from SafeSport. USA TODAY Sports reported that Coughlin was facing three reports of sexual misconduct against him, two of them involving minors. 
ISIS wife's case won't be fast-tracked
A federal court ruled that a woman who fled Alabama in 2014 to marry an Islamic State fighter doesn't deserve special treatment in her quest to return to America with her 18-month-old son. The Trump administration has barred Hoda Muthana, 24, and her son from returning to the U.S., contesting her claim to U.S. citizenship in a move that, if successful, could have serious implications for American citizens around the world. Muthana's family wanted her case to be expedited to avoid ""dangerous conditions in Syria. She joined ISIS after leaving the University of Alabama in 2014 for Syria, where she twice married ISIS fighters who later died in combat. While in Syria, Muthana called for the death of Americans on social media.

"USA TODAY, Editors, USA TODAY","Time to 'Spring forward'
On Sunday the vast majority of Americans lose an hour of sleep as clocks are set ahead for daylight saving time. While most cellphones and other devices take care of the time change automatically, traditional clocks need to be adjusted manually when the time changes at 2 a.m. Sunday and turns to 3 a.m. The time difference can affect your health, and may change sleep patterns, often for about five to seven days. Daylight saving was ostensibly started to save energy, but it turned out people enjoyed having an extra hour of daylight after work. Not in Arizona, though, where sunlight only extends the heat-related misery. Another state that does not observe daylight saving time is Hawaii. In 2017, California, along with several other states, proposed a bill to enact daylight saving time year-round.
Daylight saving time has some unexpected consequences. Tony Spitz has the details.

Another winter storm is on its way  
A massive storm will bring a mix of wild weather to the central and southern U.S. this weekend, including blizzard conditions in the Midwest and the chance for tornadoes in the Southeast. The snowstorm will likely be at its strongest later Saturday and into Sunday. The heaviest snow is expected in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Wind gusts of up to 45 mph are likely, which could result in reduced visibility, drifting snow and blizzard conditions in some locations in the northern Plains. Winds from the storm will howl around the Great Lakes states on Sunday; gusts of 60 to 70 mph are possible in Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo, New York. Meanwhile, another outbreak of severe weather and tornadoes is taking aim on the Deep South on Saturday nearly a week after a twister killed 23 people near Auburn, Alabama.

Record bull market turns 10 years old
As the longest bull market in U.S. history celebrates its 10th anniversary Saturday, Wall Street pros are debating whether the old-timer is on its last legs or mustering a second wind. The question is pivotal for the 401(k) plans and other investments of millions of Americans who have built robust nest eggs on the back of the markets impressive rise. A bull market is generally defined as a sustained rise in stock prices without a 20 percent drop from its peak or bear market based on closing prices.

HBO doc examines murder mystery featured in popular podcast
The first season of journalist Sarah Koenig's 12-episode true-crime investigation podcast ""Serial"" became an instant phenomenon when it premiered in 2014, generating more than 40 million downloads in its first two months. On Sunday, HBO's four-part docuseries ""The Case Against Adnan Syed""  begins delving further into the central mystery featured in the podcast. Adnan Syed was convicted of the first-degree murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in Baltimore. The 18-year-old high school student was allegedly strangled and buried in a park. His conviction came despite inconsistencies in witnesses' testimony that Koenig tried to unpack on ""Serial."" In the end, the podcast was inconclusive. But new details in the HBO docuseries could provide legal ammunition Syed, now 38, needs in getting a new trial.

Making its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in the Midnight Madness section, the film is a genre mashup of a supernatural thriller and a Western. The trailer above unravels to reveal that there is something odd and spooky going on with the wind on a frontier in the late 1800s. Caitlin Gerard ( Insidious: The Last Key ) stars as a gun-toting plains-woman who is slowly driven mad by new neighbors, isolation, the harshness of the untamed land, and, of course, the wind, which is more than just an element of weather. It’s pretty much the boogeyman in this movie. The Wind is written by Teresa Sutherland and marks the directorial debut of Emma Tammi. Ashley Zukerman ( Succession ), Julia Goldani Telles ( The Affair ), Dylan McTee, and Miles Anderson also star. The film is produced by Soapbox Films and Divide/Conquer and will premiere at TIFF on Sept. 10 at Ryerson Theatre. ICM/YXZ is handling the sales.","EXCLUSIVE: First, there was Earthquake.

Josh Jones,"“If God had designed the orchestra,” remarks a character in Rick Moody’s Hotels of North America, “then the cello was His greatest accomplishment.” I couldn’t agree more. The cello sounds sublime, looks stately… even the word cello evokes regal poise and grace. If orchestral instruments were chess pieces, the cello would be queen: shapely and dignified, prime mover on the board, majestic in symphonies, quartets, chamber pop ensembles, post rock bands…. With all its many sonic and aesthetic charms, I didn’t imagine it was possible to love the cello more. Then I saw Romanian artist Adrian Borda ’s magnificent photos taken from inside one. The photo above, Borda tells us at his Deviant Art page, was taken from inside “a very old French cello made in Napoleon's times.” It looks like the belly of the HMS Victory mated with the nave of Chartres Cathedral. The light descending through the f-holes seems of some divine origin. Borda has also taken photos from inside an old double bass (above), as well as a guitar, sax, and piano. The stringed orchestral instruments, he says, yielded the best results. He was first inspired by a 2009 ad campaign for the Berliner Philharmoniker that “captured the insides of instruments,” writes Twisted Sifter, “revealing the hidden landscapes within.” Without any sense of how the art director created the images, Borda set about experimenting with methods of his own. He was lucky enough to have a luthier friend who had a contrabass open for repairs. Later he traveled to Amiens, where he found the French cello, also open. “To achieve these shots,” Twisted Sifter notes, “Borda fit a Sony NEX-6 camera equipped with a Samyang 8mm fisheye lens inside the instrument and then used a smart remote so he could preview the workflow on his phone.” Depending on the angle and the play of light within the instrument, the photos can look eerie, somber, ominous, or angelic—mirroring the cello’s expressive range. Borda gives the cello interior shot above the perfect title “A Long, Lonely Time….” Its play of smoke and light is ghostly noir. His photo below, of the inside of a saxophone, pulls us into a haunted, alien tunnel. If you want to know what’s on the other side, consider the strange surrealist worlds of Borda’s main gig as a surrealist painter of warped fantasies and nightmares. Unlike these photos, his paintings are full of lurid, violent color, but they also filled with mysterious musical motifs.

Stunned residents of a small Mississippi city were picking up the pieces Sunday after a violent tornado ripped through town, leaving one person dead and marking the first tornado death of 2019. 
The tornado in Columbus, which was triggered by a line of intense thunderstorms on Saturday evening, was confirmed by the National Weather Service in Jackson.  The twister, part of a severe weather outbreak that battered the South, toppled trees and shattered businesses and homes in the city of 24,000 on the eastern border of the state. 
Ashley Glynell Pounds, 41, of Tupelo died after a building collapsed on her and three other people, the office of Columbus Mayor Robert Smith confirmed in a Facebook post. Smith said 12 other people were injured.
Pounds' death was the first tornado death of 2019, according to the Weather Channel. 
Your @MSEMA team has been working with local first responders during these storms. So far one fatality has been confirmed and damage assessments are now underway. We are saddened by the loss of life but thankful it was not much worse. We are grateful this Sunday morning. https://t.co/9xIBRqplB4

Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said Sunday in a tweet that state emergency officials were working with first responders. ""So far one fatality has been confirmed and damage assessments are now underway. We are saddened by the loss of life but thankful it was not much worse. We are grateful this Sunday morning,"" he said.
The tornado seriously damaged a school, two community center buildings and other warehouses and businesses, city spokesman Joe Dillon said.

Pastor Steve Blaylock of the city's First Pentecostal Church hugged his wife, Pat, on Sunday amid the broken lumber, destroyed pews and sheared-off roof that was once his church. 
The building was a total loss, Blaylock said. But he said the church would still hold a Sunday prayer service and a scheduled baptism, using a borrowed portable baptismal pool.
We will rebuild. Weve got a good church here, Blaylock said. It will be a testimony of God.
Residents described a harrowing rainstorm and powerful winds Saturday evening.  
The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close, Lee Lawrence told the Associated Press. Lawrence said four buildings on his used car lot were destroyed, car windows were blown out and uprooted trees were flung across vehicles.

Dax Clark, a meteorology student at Mississippi State University, told The Weather Channel he and some classmates took refuge at a gas station.
""We knew from the radar on our phones that the tornado was moving north of us, but the wind was still crazy,"" Clark said. ""It did not hit our gas station directly but it was still pretty substantial.""
More: 2018 was an all-time record quiet year for tornadoes in the U.S.
Clark witnessed a trail of destruction after the storm roared through. ""We saw homes without roofs and outer walls, a car flipped over into a ditch, and lots of trees and power lines down,"" he said.
Elsewhere, a man died after his vehicle became submerged in high water fueled by heavy rains in Knoxville, Tennessee. Officials in some eastern Kentucky counties also declared emergencies because of  flooding and mudslides.

"Montgomery Advertiser, Kirsten Fiscus, Montgomery Advertiser","Drone captures devastation in Beauregard, Alabama left by massive tornado.
 Wochit, USA TODAY
BEAUREGARD, Ala. Sheila Creech narrowly missed the full force of Hurricane Michael when it devastated Panama City, Florida, in October.
The roof of her apartment had been ripped off, but she fared better than most. Her granddaughter, Desteni Clifton, lost everything from her apartment, the 21-year-old said Tuesday. Both women evacuated ahead of the hurricane, Creech to Beauregard, and Clifton to Birmingham, Alabama.
Marshall Lynn Grimes, a man Creech married young and had two children with before the relationship fell apart was in Beauregard, Clifton said.
They reconnected on Facebook, I believe, Clifton said of the couple. They were both pretty avid Facebookers. Even hours before the tornado hit.

Grimes and Creech, both 59, were two of 23 victims of an EF-4 tornado that ripped through the Beauregard community in Lee County on Sunday. 
Creech had been with Grimes for the weekend, as she was known to do to visit her fiancé. The couple, recently engaged, had planned to wed in January, Clifton said.
We were just looking at wedding invitations the other day, she said. I had just seen her. She was planning on moving up here by the fall.""
The couple, along with Grimes' 11-year-old daughter, a preacher and 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, one of the tornado's youngest victims, were camping when the storm blew through, Clifton said.

""I guess they maybe didn't hear the sirens, or if they did it was too late for them to get anywhere safe,"" Clifton said. ""It was a total surprise. She was very young and so was he. We were very very shocked to hear the whole thing happened.""
“I called my grandma and she didn't answer. I just wanted to check that her fiancé was OK, but when she didn't answer I just got the worst gut feeling.”

Grimes' young daughter suffered two broken legs. The preacher, who had been with them, identified all of the victims to authorities, Clifton said. 
It wasn't until Monday morning that Clifton learned of the devastating twister. 
""I worked all day Sunday and didn't hear about it at all,"" she said. ""When my alarm went off yesterday, my alarm starts playing the news and that's the first I'd heard about it.""
Unsure where Lee County was, she did a quick internet search, only to find that the county included Beauregard, where Grimes lived. 
""I called my grandma and she didn't answer,"" she said. ""I just wanted to check that her fiancé was OK, but when she didn't answer I just got the worst gut feeling. She lived with her phone right next to her at all times. She would have called me back if she could have.""
Clifton, unlike most young adults, does not have many social media accounts, and with a strained relationship with her mother, it took time for her worst fears to be confirmed.  
Clifton's extended family found one of her friends on social media and reached out to her in an effort to reach the 21-year-old.

""My friend had to tell me what had happened. She was heartbroken to have to tell me,"" Clifton said. 
Having never experienced a close death in the family, Clifton turned to an anonymous internet community, Reddit, to express her emotions. On her post, she included the last photograph Grimes took of himself and Creech last week. 
""It's been a long six months y'all,"" she wrote under a pseudonym. ""I was supposed to be a bridesmaid. I can't even really articulate proper sentences right now but my grandma has helped me out a lot and we were very close. I always told everyone that she would live forever because she's a strong woman.""
The majority of those who commented on Clifton's post were supportive, she said. 
""So many people reached out to me in my messages,"" she said. ""So many from Opelika, Auburn, Beauregard even. They are just saying that 'well get you anything you need,' tons of people reaching out. If I need a meal. People just want to meet up and that was crazy to me. I'm very appreciative.""
Clifton said plans were being made to have Creech buried in LaGrange, Georgia, where she grew up. She said she was unsure about arrangements for Grimes.

Dennis Perkins,"On a night where Fire And Fury author Michael Wolff, continuing his ID badge-burning White House tell-all tour on The Daily Show, called Donald Trump straight-up “stupid,” the late-night comey-scape was awash in similar sentiments. Following the weekend-long government shutdown—just in time to commemorate Trump’s one-year anniversary in office and wreck his $100,000/couple “look at me!” gala at Mar-a-Lago —no one was more scathing in his assessment of Trump’s performance than Seth Meyers. In his “A Closer Look” segment, the Late Night host spent a solid ten minutes comically excoriating Trump for a weekend’s-worth of being Trump. Only, you know, moreso. In response to Trump’s trolling tweet attempting to spin the massive second Women’s March against everything he stands for as a “look at me, I’m awesome!” rally, Meyers compared Trump’s actual or feigned cluelessness to a husband coming home to all his clothes dumped in the street and thinking, “I get it, you wanna see me naked.” (Trump should really file that one away for later.) Meyers then pointed out the thoroughly documented phenomenon that, “there’s literally not one situation where there isn’t an old Trump quote that doesn’t completely contradict his current position” by showing clips of Trump condemning then-President Obama for the government shutdown that happened on his watch. Showing then-Trump (the reality show laughingstock claiming that the responsibility for a shutdown rests wholly on the president, Meyers noted how he, shockingly, agrees with everything that that Trump said—about current (presidential laughingstock) Trump. Old school Trump claimed, “It’s pretty sad because the whole world is looking at us and laughing at us,” which, in retrospect, is doubly sad, since, unlike President Obama, “ultimate deal-maker” Donald Trump saw the government grind to a halt when his Republican Party controls the White House, Senate, and House, something that’s never happened in modern U.S. history. Doubling down on the whole deal-maker myth that Trump trumpeted as one of his chief assets as presidential candidate (along with the best words, huge hands, bigly intelligence, and pretty much every other possible human attribute), Meyers went after Trump’s disengagement with the weekend shutdown negotiations and, seemingly, everything else. Quoting Trump’s own Chief of Staff John Kelly’s assertion that Trump’s demands for what Meyers termed Trump’s “absurd” border wall of racist awesomeness were ‘uninformed,” Meyers came down hard. Calling Trump a president, “who makes cartoonish demands that everyone knows are impractical, who has absolutely no guiding principles or knowledge of policy, and who changes his views on a whim,” Meyers sought to debunk the idea that Donald Trump is somehow ignorant of what’s expected of the leader of the free world, suggesting that the giant ego-baby with the nuclear launch codes simply doesn’t care enough to learn. Citing a New York Times quote from a Trump campaign staffer about the issue, Meyers admirably ripped off a tongue-twister to the effect, a nifty linguistic trick whose intricacies Meyers no doubt spent more time learning than Donald Trump spent on formulating a coherent immigration policy with the fates of hundreds of thousands of DREAMers in the balance.","On a night where Fire And Fury author Michael Wolff, continuing his ID badge-burning White House tell-all tour on The Daily Show, called Donald Trump straight-up “stupid,” the late-night comey-scape was awash in similar sentiments.

Al Jazeera,"The youngest victim was 6, the oldest 89. One extended family lost seven members.
The cornor released the names of the 23 people killed in the country's deadliest tornado in nearly six years on Tuesday.
They included six-year-old Armando Hernandez Jr, known as ""AJ"", torn from his father's arms two days after singing in his first-grade class musical; 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who loved horses and was visiting a friend's home when the twister struck; and Jimmy Lee Jones, 89, who perished along with his wife of six decades, Mary Louise, and one of their sons.
""Just keep those families in your prayers,"" Lee County Coroner Bill Harris said, two days after the disaster.
The search for victims, pets and belongings in and around the devastated rural community of Beauregard continued amid the din of beeping heavy machinery and whining chain saws. But Sheriff Jay Jones said the list of the missing had shrunk from dozens to just seven or eight.
""We've got piles of rubble that we are searching just to make sure,"" said Opelika Fire Chief Byron Prather Jr ""We don't think we'll find nobody there, but we don't want to leave any stone unturned.""
Four children were killed, ages six, sight, nine and 10.
The youngest, Hernandez, had taken shelter in a closet with his father and older brother when the tornado hit, said Jack Crisp, the boy's uncle. The punishing winds tore the family's home apart, Crisp said, and pulled both boys from their father's arms. 
""He had them squeezed tight, and he said when it came through, it just took them,"" Crisp said. ""It just demolished the house and took them."" 
Hernandez's father and brother both survived.
Jackie Jones said she rushed with her siblings to her parents' house after the storm passed and nobody answered the phone. ""They usually answer on the first ring,"" she said.
The siblings found the home reduced to its foundation. One of their two brothers who lived at the house survived and was taken to a hospital. But Jimmy Lee and Mary Louise Jones, married for more than 60 years, had died along with their 53-year-old son Emmanuel.
The body of David Wayne Dean, 53, was found by his son in a neighbour's yard after the twister demolished his mobile home. He was known as ""Roaddog"" because of his love for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
""He was done and gone before we got to him,"" said his sobbing widow, Carol Dean, who was at work at Walmart when the storm hit. ""My life is gone. He was the reason I lived, the reason that I got up.""
'The community is torn up'
The tornado was an EF4 with winds estimated at 170mph (274kph) and carved a path of destruction up to nine-tenths of a mile (1.4km) wide in Alabama, scraping up the earth in a phenomenon known as ""ground rowing"", the National Weather Service said. It travelled a remarkable 70 miles (112km) or so through Alabama and Georgia, where it caused more damage.
Ninety people were injured in the Beauregard area, authorities said. Most have been released from the hospital.
President Donald Trump said he will visit Alabama on Friday to see the damage. ""It's been a tragic situation, but a lot of good work is being done,"" he said at the White House.
Along the two-lane country road where some of the victims died, firefighters used heavy machinery to overturn pieces of houses that were blown into a gulley. A car sat atop the remains of one house. A red-brick foundation was all that was left at another lot.
The search took its toll around Beauregard, an unincorporated area of roughly 10,000 people near the Georgia line. Church chaplain Ike Mathews walked down a road lined with broken trees and debris as he went to check on members of his congregation and emergency workers.
""Yesterday I talked to some team members who had found bodies. They're hurting. The community is torn up. They started crying talking about it,"" said Mathews, an associate pastor at Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church.
Many of the people living in the area are senior citizens who moved to the country after retiring from textile mills or an old magnetic-tape manufacturing plant that closed years ago, Mathews said.
""They start with a mobile home and hope they can build a house someday. They invest in their homes, and they have a sense of legacy. It's something to leave their kids and grandkids,"" he said.
'It was God'
It was the deadliest tornado to hit the US since May 2013, when an EF5 twister killed 24 people in Moore, Oklahoma.
Government teams surveying storm damage confirmed that at least 20 tornadoes struck on Sunday in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
Cindy Sanford said one of her neighbours in Beauregard died in the storm, and another neighbuor remained missing on Tuesday.
""I pray to God that they find her,"" Sanford said as picked through remains of her home, which tumbled in the wind and is now scattered across neighbours' land.
Sanford said she left home with her five-year-old grandson about five minutes before the storm struck after she got a feeling it was unsafe.
""It was God,"" she said. ""And then I heard the siren.""","Deadliest tornado in US in six years killed at least 23, aged 6 to 89, including seven members of one extended family.",2019-03-06T00:17:03Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",'We're hurting': Alabama town mourns victims of deadly tornado,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/torn-alabama-town-mourns-victims-deadly-tornado-190305231239583.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/3/5/62e53bd7fec742b3b363fa8c04011ea6_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,twister,1
Lori McCue,"When Church and State closed in April, H Street lost one of its most romantic, cozy cocktail bars. Opening today in its place—and from the same owner—is Idle Hands: a sort-of church-themed bar that promises ""drunken Twister with strangers"" and ""confessions with twisted 'priests'"" on its site. ""It's a sexy nerd bar,"" says owner Erik Holzherr, who also owns Capitol Hill's Wisdom and Atlas Arcade downstairs from Idle Hands. The new spot, which opens at 6 p.m. tonight with a grand opening party, offers board games (Chess, Candyland, and Cards Against Humanity among them) to rent for $4 per hour. Larger games (including the aforementioned ""drunken Twister with strangers""—sober Twister is presumably also allowed) are $8. Games are free during happy hour (6-7:30 p.m. Tues.-Fri. and Saturday). Tabletop games—including the original ""Miss Pac Man"" tabletop game—are available on a first-come, first-served basis. And then there's the space formerly known as ""the Casting Couch."" As first reported Wednesday by Frozen Tropics, the bar's Facebook page hinted, ""Feeling like a Boss? Reserve a spot for four on our V.I.P 'Casting Couch.'"" Said space is a leather couch facing a flat-screen television, decked out with video games. The couch can be reserved for a group of four to play video games. ""We were just having fun with it,"" Holzherr says of the name, which he says one of the Idle Hands bartenders came up with. It's a reference, he says, to the porn site of the same name. When reminded by this reporter of the other connotations that phrase has, like say, Harvey Weinstein, Holzherr responded: ""Maybe we'll change that."" It appears they already have: As of Thursday, the site now calls the area a ""gaming couch."" Meanwhile, the bar also has surprises in store for one of the most-loved parts of Church and State: the confessional. The teeny room can be reserved for ten or so guests—when it's not occupied, it's open on a first-come, first-served basis. There's even a tiny window with access to the bar, so you can order cocktails without leaving your seat. Holzherr plans to host events in there, including sessions with the aforementioned ""twisted 'priest.'"" Describe your sins and receive ""fake penances,"" Holzherr says. He's planning to offer the role to a few comedians. Cocktails ($9-11) are organized on the menu by flavor profile: The Shawshank (made with vodka, housemade pickle brine, and lime, with cracked pepper on top) is listed as ""Savory""; the Usual Suspects (a orange syrup-laced negroni) is labeled ""Bitter."" The menu includes 14 beers and six wines by the glass or bottle. Other items on the menu include temporary tattoos for a dollar each or pages from an ""adult coloring book"" to complete while you're at the bar (""Makes a great gift!"" the menu promises.) Though the stained glass windows of Church and State remain, the decor has been updated with neon lights as part of a 1980s-1990s theme. Cheeky murals from local artists Rachel Wallach and Mike O'Brien adorn the walls—in one, the Virgin Mary cradles a video game controller; in another the devil revs a motorcycle. Holzherr says he wanted Idle Hands—which he describes as ""more accessible"" than Church and State—to help alleviate crowds that tend to accumulate at Atlas Arcade on weekends. ""I’m hoping it’ll appeal to a slightly older crowd than downstairs,"" he says. ""Sometimes I feel like I’m a little too old for Atlas.""","At least they ditched the ""Casting Couch"" idea.

Chris Evangelista,"A Micro movie, adapted from one of the final novels of Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton, has been in development at Amblin Entertainment since 2015. Now there’s an update on the project: Neil Widener and Gavin James have been hired to take over screenplay duties. The film’s plot appears to be lifted right out of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, focusing on a group of people shrunk down to miniature size and forced to navigate the rain forrest. More on the Micro movie below. What’s going on with Micro, the film adaptation of one of Michael Crichton’s last novels? The movie was announced in 2015, and last year, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales co-director Joachim Ronning was hired to direct. Now, Deadline has a new update. Neil Widener and Gavin James, who wrote Liberty Road and Battle Of Alcatraz, have been hired to write the script. Here’s the synopsis of the story they’ll be dealing with: In the vein of Jurassic Park, this high-concept thriller follows a group of graduate students lured to Hawaii to work for a mysterious biotech companyonly to find themselves miniaturized and cast out into the rain forest, with nothing but their scientific expertise and wits to protect them. An instant classic, Micro pits nature against technology in vintage Michael Crichton fashion. Completed by visionary science writer Richard Preston, this boundary-pushing thriller melds scientific fact with pulse-pounding fiction to create yet another masterpiece of sophisticated, cutting-edge entertainment. Darren Lemke was previously hired to pen the script, but now Widener and James will take over. Frank Marshall is producing and Sherri Crichton and Laurent Bouzereau of CrichtonSun are executive producers. Deadline states that a director currently isn’t attached to the project, which indicates that Ronning is no longer at the helm. Micro was unfinished when Crichton died in 2008. Author Richard Preston completed the novel, which was then published in 2011. It was one of three posthumous publications from Crichton, the other two being Pirate Latitudes, published in 2009, and Dragon Teeth, which hit bookstores in 2017. Steven Spielberg’s Amblin has a history with Crichton’s work, having produced the Jurassic Park films, as well as Twister, which Crichton co-wrote. The Micro premise tiny people battling giant elements! certainly sounds cinematic enough. It recalls both Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and the 1958 sci-fi flick Attack of the Puppet People. And of course, the Ant-Man movies as well. Crichton movie adaptations have had a rough time outside of the Jurassic franchise, but maybe this will work out in the end.

Now ReadingHow To Turn Tangled Jewels Into Organized Luxury
Like the earbud wires that used to mysteriously play twister in our purses and pockets post Ariana Grande jam sessions, our jewelry seems to follow aggressively-tangled suit, no matter where or how gingerly we lay it down. Attempting to accessorize from a chaotic pile of necklaces that have somehow worked themselves into a Gordian knot of rings, bracelets, and backless earrings, is nothing short of our darkest nightmare especially after hitting snooze about ten times too many on Monday morning. But just as wireless headphones solved our tangled music dilemmas, there also exists a secret weapon for our war against disorganized jewelry: the over-the-door organizer.
Unlike jewelry boxes or dishes, the over-the-door solution battles against jumbled messes (a.k.a. constrictor knots) by suspending our accessories in individual compartments instead of laying them flat in clumped heaps. These crafty products go beyond a more streamlined jewelry storage system by opening up space and style-showcasing opportunities inside our bedrooms too. So opt out of wrestling with the one necklace you want to wear on Monday morning and shop the ten over-the-door hangers ahead instead. These secret weapons will keep your most unruly chains to clunkiest statement pieces organized and in line for nightmare-free accessorizing.

timgray2013,"Fox Searchlight’s “The Favourite” is nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture and best director for Yorgos Lanthimos. Supporting actress contender Rachel Weisz says working with the filmmaker was similar to the audience’s experience with the film: “There is a high level of the unknown and mystery in his process, but there is a lot of fun.”
The film earned a rare three acting nominations: Weisz and Emma Stone as supporting, and Olivia Colman as lead. Weisz says Lanthimos’ attention to the actors and to the script (by nominees Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara) was clear even before production began.
During three weeks of rehearsal, “there never was any camera blocking. He didn’t dictate things from the camera. On the day of filming, we’d just do it, and he’d adapt the cameras to how we were playing the scene.” And while he always emphasized the script, “there was nothing discussed or analyzed” during rehearsals.
So with no camera blocking and no analysis, what did they do for three weeks?
“It was all about playing,” she laughs. “Anyone who’s done theater would find it normal: theater games, trust games, games that made you laugh and broke down barriers.
“We would play games like Twister — but not Twister — while saying our lines very fast, or saying someone else’s lines. It was about familiarizing us with the text, to know the script really well, so it became second nature, so we were freed to act spontaneously.”
Weisz was first mentioned in Variety in 1994, when she starred in Noel Coward’s “Design for Living” at London’s Donmar Warehouse, which then transferred to the West End. Since then, she has done a wide range of roles onstage and onscreen (including her Oscar-winning “The Constant Gardener”).
And 2018 was particularly gratifying, personally and professionally. Aside from giving birth to a daughter with husband Daniel Craig, she starred in two very different films about triangles: Bleecker Street’s “Disobedience” (directed by Sebastian Lelio) and “The Favourite.”
Writer Tony McNamara has spoken about the “casual cruelty” of the characters in the latter, but Weisz isn’t sure she agrees. “Sarah can be defensively aggressive, but she’s not cruel. With cruelty, there’s a pleasure in administering nastiness to others. I see her as practical. I think she’s a lioness. In nature, females can be quite aggressive. Sarah is definitely alpha, very territorial; she’s working to protect her patch of land, which happens to be the whole of Britain. It’s a big patch,” she deadpans.
A character this complex can be exhausting. Weisz was asked the secret of keeping her energy up during production.
“Tea, cups of tea! And then playing with incredible performers like Olivia and Emma; their energy is very invigorating. It was an unusual experience. To work with all those actors, including those two extraordinary performers — it’s something I’ll never forget.”
Weisz had collaborated with Lanthimos on the 2015 “The Lobster,” so his methods and style weren’t new — though “The Favourite” still held plenty of happy discoveries.
“Everything surprised me! On the page, the script was excellent, but nothing prepared me for the way Yorgos moves from the text to framing a story — the way he shot it, the tonal shifts from the absurd to the tragic, to a love story, to a political thriller. The mastery of tone still surprises me.”","Fox Searchlight’s “The Favourite” is nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture and best director for Yorgos Lanthimos.

The Associated Press,"BEAUREGARD, Ala. —A tornado that splintered homes, killed 23 people and injured 90 more in Alabama was the deadliest to hit the U.S. since May 2013, when a twister near Oklahoma City killed 24 people.
The twister that struck Beauregard , Alabama, was part of a powerful storm system that slashed its way across the Deep South, spawning at least 20 confirmed tornadoes in four states.
Mobile homes tucked among tall pine trees were swept from their bases and smashed into unrecognizable piles of rubble. Toys, clothes, insulation, water heaters and pieces of metal were scattered across the hillsides where once towering pines were snapped in half. The tornado swept up and scattered the debris so widely that the metal frames of two of those homes could not even be located.
Church chaplain Ike Mathews checked on emergency workers who found some of the bodies .
""They're hurting. The community is torn up. They started crying talking about it,"" said Mathews, an associate pastor at Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church.

Samuel Martinez,"Smart speakers and smart displays are slowly making their way to the market and especially our homes. Now we see that LG has also been preparing one of these devices to compete with major names like Google and Amazon. The LG XBOOM AI ThinQ WK9 is already listed in LGs website and in B&amp;H Photo Video. Its not currently for sale but it looks impressive, and man does it pack a punch. This new tongue twister name can get some of us mixed up, but the LG XBOOM AI ThinQ WK9 is a new smart display with Google Assistant and 20W speakers. It also includes an 8 touchscreen and it’s going to be able of communicating with the rest of your LG products. Now, if you didnt like the name, youre probably going to hate the price. It’s $299, even though we are supposed to find it for $199 during the Holiday Season. This would make the LG XBOOM AI ThinQ WK9 just $50 more than the Google Home Hub, and it would match the price of Lenovos Smart Display.

Terry Dunn,"I estimate that I'm about halfway through my first winter in Buffalo. And in this weather, I'm always on the lookout for RC gadgets that can thrive in the snow. My latest project began life as a toy-grade RC vehicle with a dubious reputation, but a few simple modifications turned it into a super snow machine. More-extensive tweaking made it even better! Terrain Twister The Terrain Twister is an RC toy that was previously sold by Mattel under both the Hot Wheels and Tyco RC labels. It's discontinued now, but new and used examples are readily available on the internet. What caught my attention is the Twister's really unique screw propulsion system. Rather than wheels or tank treads, this vehicle is motivated by a pair of counter-rotating cylindrical pontoons that have external threads like a screw. There have been a few examples of screw-propelled vehicles throughout history. The buoyancy of the rotating pontoons allows them to move across swampy or muddy terrain that would cause wheeled or tracked vehicles to get hopelessly stuck. Screw-propelled vehicles also excel in the snow. Online reviews of the Terrain Twister are all over the map. Some people love them, and lots of people despise them. A cursory analysis hinted that many of the haters had tried using the Terrain Twister on surfaces that it wasn't meant for. Spoiler: a screw-propelled toy is NOT going to work well on your concrete driveway or the tile floor of your kitchen. I eagerly pulled the trigger on a used unit I found on eBay…a whopping $5 investment (+$9 for shipping)! Basic Modifications My Twister included the actual vehicle and the control transmitter. It did not include the proprietary battery or 5-hour charger. That suited me just fine since I planned to use LiPo batteries anyway, and who the heck wants to wait 5 hours to play with their RC toy? The proprietary battery is a 6-cell, 7.2-volt NiMH unit of unstated capacity. Hinges on the battery allow it to bend to fit the unusual stepped battery compartment of the Twister. A fully-charged 6-cell NiMH battery has a voltage of about 8.4 volts, which is also the charged voltage of a 2-cell LiPo battery. Perfect! I found a few different 2-cell LiPo packs in my stash that physically fit into the battery compartment. Metal electrical contacts in the battery compartment engage with mating contacts on the stock battery when it is installed. My LiPo batteries obviously had no such contacts. They use hobby-grade plugs. I simply soldered a pigtail with a Deans Ultra Plug to the vehicle contacts. There are even marks on the plastic body that indicate the polarity of each contact. I made sure to solder quickly to avoid melting the plastic around the contacts and stinking up my shop! Swapping batteries was my only initial change to the Terrain Twister. Input voltage was the same and I retained all of the stock onboard electronics. Perhaps the only delta affecting performance was the weight savings of my LiPo battery over the stock unit. I would guess that the 2S-700mAh LiPo I chose shaved three or four ounces off of the original weight. The transmitter uses a standard 9-volt battery. For some reason, 9-volt batteries disappear around my house. That's okay because I found that most 9-volt devices work just fine with a 2-cell LiPo. Several of my seldom-used 9-volt electronic tools (ex: stud finder, tachometer) have been fitted with hobby-grade battery connectors. When I need to use one of those tools, I just connect a small 2-cell LiPo. I made the same modification to the Terrain Twister transmitter. Once again, I soldered a pigtail to the contacts in the battery compartment. I used a Deans Micro Plug since that is the connector on the battery I planned to use. The 300mAh LiPo doesn't fit inside the battery compartment. So, I added self-adhesive Velcro to the back of the transmitter to hold the battery during use. With the simple addition of those two battery leads, my Terrain Twister was ready for testing. A quick check in my workshop confirmed that everything was operational. My next move was to head outside. Using the Stock Radio The weather was a little above freezing that day. All of the snow in my back yard had condensed into a smooth dense blanket. I soon found that conditions were ideal for driving the Terrain Twister. The little machine plowed its way over the snow with surprising authority. It did great on flat areas and was even able to climb snow drifts. The Terrain Twister may be a toy-grade machine, but I was having serious fun with it! A joystick on the left side of the transmitter controls the spinning motion of the pontoons. Pushing the stick forward commands both pontoons to rotate for forward motion. Moving to the top left corner causes the left pontoon to stop while the right pontoon moves forward. This results in a left turn. With the stick directly left, both pontoons rotate counter-clockwise, which makes the Twister crab to the left. The same control methodology applies to all four quadrants of the joystick's range of motion. On the right side of the transmitter is a 3-position, spring-loaded toggle switch. In the default, center position, the pontoons are parallel to each other as viewed from above. The upper switch position commands the front of the pontoons closer together and separates them at the rear. Moving to the bottom position has the opposite effect. This movement allows some degree of turning ability while using the crabbing motion. While the control methods are intuitive and effective, there are limitations. The biggest problem I found is that the motor speeds are not proportional. A pontoon will spin either full forward, full reverse, or not at all. This made control response a bit choppy and harsh. I also thought that the function of the right switch wasn't very useful…especially on snow. I didn't do much crabbing to begin with and didn't need to turn those times when I did crab. As a result, I rarely used the switch. While I was having fun with the mostly stock Terrain Twister, I thought that the deficiencies of the controls could be easily overcome by installing a hobby grade radio system. However, I had one more test before ripping out the stock electronics. I found a YouTube video that mentioned using a 3-cell LiPo (12.6 volts when charged) in a Terrain Twister. I wouldn't normally consider such a significant voltage boost with mystery toy-grade electronics. But I had nothing to lose here since I was gutting the model anyway. I popped in a 3-cell 850mAh LiPo and had several more minutes of fun with the Twister. The extra voltage provided a significant jump in top speed and didn't seem to create any adverse effects. I'm sure that the cold weather helped the circuit board deal with the extra volts and amps, but it never let out any magic smoke. If you just want a quick and easy upgrade on a Terrain Twister, keep the stock electronics and throw in a 3-cell LiPo. My experience suggests that there could be enough headroom to handle the performance boost over the long haul. Then again, maybe it will self-destruct…it's hard to say with certainty. Choose your level of risk. As with any project that inserts a LiPo in place of a NiCad/NiMH battery, I suggest that you also use a cheap plug-in voltage alarm to prevent over-discharge. Radio Upgrade My first step in the radio overhaul was to remove the top of the Twister's body. Most of the screws are easy to see. But it took me a few minutes to figure out that four screws in the center of the body are hidden under stickers. I needed to identify the wires attached to the drive motor within each pontoon and remove everything else. The motor wires were easy to spot since they are the only wires routed into the pontoons. I desoldered these wires from the exposed circuit board inside the main body. After that, I just went from front to back removing all of the stock electronics. The radio gear is housed in a sealed container near the front. I pulled the whole container in one piece. The mechanism for changing the pontoon angles is very clever. It is also heavy and complex. An electric motor turns a jackscrew through a series of gears and causes the pontoons to rotate in unison. My experience with the stock set-up convinced me that I didn't care about being able to change the pontoon angles. I removed the control motor, but left the gears in place. I manually turned the gears to set the pontoons parallel and they have not shifted position at all. All of the removed electronics weigh 6.2 ounces. The equipment that took its place weighs less than a single ounce. The main component is a Tactic TR624 2.4GHz receiver. It is a 6-channel receiver, but I'm only using 2 channels here. The only other components were two 20-amp Electronic Speed Controls (ESC) for the brushed motors in the pontoons. The transmitter I chose is a Tactic TTX650, 2-stick radio. As with most 2-stick radios used in the US, fore/aft movement of the left gimbal is not spring-loaded to return to center when released. It simply stays where you put it. I modified the gimbal on this radio so that this movement would self-center. The main idea was to set up the controls like you imagine driving a tank. Moving the left gimbal fore and aft would control the throttle of the left pontoon, while the right stick would be connected to the right pontoon's ESC. My original plan was to use ESCs capable of forward and reverse operation. However, the only ESCs I found in my stash are forward-only. I decided to press ahead with these units, figuring that I could invest in reversing ESCs if my initial results were positive (I ordered the new ESCs yesterday). Each ESC was soldered to the motor leads from a pontoon. The left ESC was then plugged into channel 3 of the receiver, while the right ESC went to channel 2. Like most modern ESCs, these units have a Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC) which uses the vehicle battery to power the radio gear with a 5-volt feed. I removed the red wire from one of the ESC receiver plugs to prevent the BECs from interfering with one another. The power input leads were combined in parallel and joined to a single XT-30 battery connector. I am using the same 3S-850mAh LiPo battery from my earlier 3-cell tests. There is plenty of room in the front of the Twister's body for the receiver and ESCs. I cut a hole in the floor of the battery compartment for the XT-30 to poke through. Then it was time to reinstall the top of the body and go for a test drive. The Modernized Terrain Twister We had a few 50-degree (F) days that melted all of the snow and left my yard with a large, deep puddle surrounded by mud. This was good proving ground for my modifications. Did I mention that the Terrain Twister floats? The improvement in control afforded by the individual, proportional throttles was immediately apparent. I was able to get the vehicle moving gradually, rather than the lurching full-throttle starts of the stock system. I was also able to turn with much better precision by using more or less throttle differential. The Terrain Twister transitioned seamlessly from the mud into the puddle and back. It never even slowed down. Much of the puddle was deep enough to float the Twister. It performs quite well on the water. I was really surprised by how nimble it is. It splashes a lot of water while it moves, but the body stays mostly dry. Later that day, the warm spell was replaced by a storm that brought 6+ inches of snow. The Terrain Twister didn't perform nearly as well on the fresh, fluffy snow. In fact, it often became stuck. I moved to plowed areas with a thin layer of snow bordered by nice, dense snow banks. The Twister was once again at home. The 3-cell battery provides good speed, while the updated radio is much more authoritative. I can't wait to install the reversing ESCs for even more control options. Ready for More This cheap experiment has really made me wonder about the performance potential of screw-propelled vehicles. Throughout this whole process, I still have not cracked open the pontoons to check out the motors and drive systems of these toys. Rest assured that I will be doing that soon. I recently bought another used Terrain Twister on eBay. It should be arriving any day. This one did not include a stock transmitter. That doesn't matter to me since it will immediately get gutted and equipped with a Tactic receiver. I will then see if there are any logical ways to REALLY get those pontoons spinning. If I find something that works, I'll be sure to share it here. Check your attic and local thrift stores for toy-grade RC stuff. Many of these machines respond well to a little TLC and a simple battery upgrade. Others, like the Terrain Twister can be the foundation for an even more-exciting project!

CBS/AP,"CONNEAUTVILLE, Pa. -- A tornado struck a nursing home in northwestern Pennsylvania, blowing a roof off one building and causing moderate to heavy damage, authorities said. No serious injuries were reported. Meteorologist Mike Griffin of the National Weather Service office in Cleveland said the EF-2 twister packing winds up to 115 mph struck Rolling Fields Elder Care Community in Conneautville, about 40 miles south of Erie, at about 2:40 p.m. Tuesday. Rolling Fields said in a statement that all residents were being evacuated, and there were no serious injuries, although ""two residents have been hospitalized for unrelated concerns."" ""At this point our main priority is the elders (residents), care-partners (employees) and all others on site,"" said Lisa Haglund, vice president of marketing and development. The American Red Cross opened a reception center for the community's 162 residents at Conneaut Valley Middle School. The American Red Cross said in an email to CBS Pittsburgh that the senior residents will stay at the middle school until housing can be arranged. David Peterman, 67, told the Erie Times-News that he saw the storm that uprooted 10 large trees on his property. ""I saw the twister coming and I could see the debris flying in a circle,"" he said. ""I went in the house and told my wife to get down into the cellar. She got about halfway down the steps and the lights went out. It was only a couple of minutes and it came right through our property."" Peterman said the storm did some damage to the mobile home his niece owns across the road, knocking down a couple of trees and blowing off everything on her deck. Chief Randy Boyle of Hayfield Township Volunteer Fire Department said the storm downed trees and limbs and damaged roofs of several buildings, but there were no reports of injuries.

Jared Nelson,"I’m ALWAYS excited to hear of a new game from developer Kumobius, makers of such classics as Bean’s Quest ($2.99) and Bean Dreams ($2.99), Duet Game ($2.99), Time Surfer ($0.99), and more. Their latest game is called Wall Kickers and it actually feels like it could be the wall-jumping cousin of their 2016 endless floor-climbing platformer High Risers (Free). In Wall Kickers your goal is to jump as high as possible using wall-jumping and backflipping mechanics. When you have a surface across from you, just tap to wall-jump and cling onto it. If you DON’T have a surface across from you, you can tap in mid-air to backflip back onto the surface you jumped from. Using these simple one-tap mechanics you’ll try to get as high as possible in Wall Kickers. Like High Risers, the main monetiziation in Wall Kickers is based around unlocking a huge assortment of playable characters and environments. You earn random unlocks every 100 coins you collect or you can straight up purchase most of the items for 99¢ apiece. There are also some opt-in video ads to watch for things like a head start, a continue, and so on. Basically it’s stupidly fair and the kind of pay model that makes you want to spend a buck or two on something just to show your appreciation.

Ben Yakas,"Since leaving The Daily Show a few years ago, Jon Stewart hasn't really had a major new comedy project—his lack of public exposure has started to make him feel like the friendly ghost of the Bush/Obama years. But we're always happy to see him, and he popped up last night for one of his periodic appearances on Late Show with Stephen Colbert. And he wasn't there to talk about Trump, but rather to make silly jokes about attending the Royal Wedding under Colbert's desk. Stewart spent the whole segment (above) underneath Colbert's desk with Omaze raffle winner Rachel, who won a contest launched last November on Late Show. She won a ""night under Stephen Colbert's desk"" to benefit Next for Autism, and as it turned out, the chance to be in close quarters with Stewart as he dished on the Royal Wedding, played a game of Twister, and showed off his collection of ""Chinese death throwing stars."" The segment ended with Stewart throwing Colbert a surprise party with a cake that referenced the previous segment of the night, which focused on the hilarious Publix ""summa cum laude"" scandal. You can watch that below.","Since leaving The Daily Show a few years ago, Jon Stewart hasn't really had a major new comedy project—his lack of public exposure has started to make him feel like the friendly ghost of the Bush/Obama years.

mark,"Comparing 3 different styles of kitchen shears In this Cools Tools video we’re going to compare 3 different styles of kitchen shears good for cooking prep, but also for general household stuff. Here are today’s contenders: I’ve got a classic $30 pair of kitchen shears made by Wiss, then an $11 pair of take-apart shears made by Fiskars, and as a wildcard, an $8 pair of medical shears. To put them to the test, we’re going to cut up some food, cut some tape, and break down some boxes. First up, the classic Wiss shears. These are an all-metal design with a notch that’s great for locking in stems and twine. They also have a removable screw so you can completely clean out the hinge. These worked great for chopping up carrots, and the notch was helpful holding things in place. The long blade made it easy to cut tape of any size, even lengthwise. For breaking down boxes, the pointy end made it easy to just force your way into cardboard and cut wherever you want. In general, these definitely feel like $30 scissors that will last a long time, They have a good heft to them, and there’s also a bottle opener and a lid twister on here for extra utility. Next up the Fiskars. These also have a notch in the blade, though it’s actually more of a bump. The plastic handle is a little more ergonomic. And the take-apart design really makes it easy to clean if you’re using these with food. These also tackled produce well. I even used them to cut a pizza, which was a revelation. Cutting tape was a surprise. It handles lightweight packing tape fine, but it actually couldn’t cut thicker tapes like duct tape and gaffer tape. It just gets gummed up between the blades. So, kind of a fail on tape. Breaking down boxes was no problem, though I preferred the heft and length of the Wiss. Generally, at a third the price of the Wiss shears, I actually preferred these for food prep. The lightweight design made me less worried about dropping them, and the easy clean hinge made it feel natural to pop these in the dishwasher. Finally, we have the medical shears. These particular ones have a non-stick fluoride coating. They’re autoclavable and can be boiled or run through the dishwasher. They’re short, with a blunt tip, but they have great leverage and known for their cutting power. I was worried that without the notch these wouldn’t work as well on produce, but the serrated blade did a great job gripping things as it cut into them. I didn’t have a chance to use these on meat and bone, but that’s kinda what they’re made for, so I suspect they’d do well. One thing I noticed is that because these are tensioned so tight by design, they’re not great for making lots of quick cuts. You’re trading speed for power. For cutting tape, the good news is that the non-stick coating resists tape. I think it would be hard to get these gummed up. The bad news is that the relatively short blade length makes long, precise cuts more difficult. Breaking down boxes was also a mixed bag. On one hand, the little blunt lip on the end made it easy wedge under tape for taking boxes apart carefully and not accidentally stabbing yourself or whatever’s in the box. On the other hand, the inability to just jab these into cardboard and get the job done forced me to approach the task a little differently. Overall, for $8, I’m definitely keeping these around. The blunt tip makes them more kid-friendly. You don’t have to be precious with them. And they’re incredibly powerful. As cooking scissors, though, it bugs me a little that I can’t completely open up this joint. There’s a channel here that a dishwasher or a good boil can probably take care of, but the pull apart design of the other two seems a better fit for food prep. So there you go, three different takes on kitchen scissors. I think the Fiskars are probably the best value, the Wiss will probably last the longest and stand up to repeated sharpening, and the medical shears are the lovable misfit that will probably live in my workshop instead. -- Donald Bell 03/24/18 Wiss KSRN 8"" Kitchen Shears Fiskars 7in Take-Apart Shears Prestige Medical Fluoride Scissor",Comparing 3 different styles of kitchen shears,2018-03-24T08:59:28Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kk.org'}",Finding the best kitchen shears,http://kk.org/cooltools/the-best-kitchen-shears/,http://kk.org/cooltools/files/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-22-at-1.24.38-PM.jpg,,Kk.org,twister,1
Valerio Farris,"There’s obviously the spaghetti western, that mid-century film genre much less about the pasta and much more about sandy expanses, riding horseback, and blazing bullets. And then there’s the spaghetti movie: Films that aren’t named after the pasta, but feature cinematic moments that center the long skinny noodle. There is, most obviously, Lady and the Tramp, Disney’s 1955 animated canine romance that gifted us with what is probably the single most iconic appearance of spaghetti on screen. Ever. During the most romantic first date known to dogkind, the newly minted lovers share a candlelit dinner of spaghetti and meatballs. And as they clumsily share one noodle, and a kiss, they vault themselves into cinematic history— spaghetti cinematic history. But what other filmic representations of the classic Italian pasta can we turn to? Who else can join Lady and her rugged lover, Tramp, in the pantheon of famous on-screen spaghetti slurpers? I dove deep into the internet to find out. In no way is this list exhaustive, but rather a collection of the ones that stand out to me. There are, what we could call, honorable mentions—a particularly chilling example from The Killing of a Sacred Deer comes to mind as does an the iconic Goodfellas post-murder dinner. Food in films has the express ability to propel a plot or reveal an unspoken, unseen truth about a character. Spaghetti is but one food that holds a place in the grand cinematic canon, yet it lists as one of the more important. Maybe next time we give cinematic bagels their moment in the sun... 1. Elf Will Ferrell, here as Buddy the Elf, wakes up to the most caloric, sugar-laden breakfast I’ve ever seen. It’s cute, I guess, but also revolting to watch the North Pole transplant pour maple syrup, marshmallows, and a crushed Pop-Tart over a plate of undressed spaghetti. It's like a dessert disguised as a dinner masquerading as a breakfast. That’s his brand, I guess. If you can’t tell, I’m no Buddy the Elf fan. (Don’t @ me.) 2. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs Here, spaghetti goes from dinner to diabolical when a machine goes awry. It gets so bad that food literally starts to terrorize the denizens of Swallow Falls (never underestimate the potential for food puns in this one). As much as I’ve always been into the idea of an endless tower of spaghetti, never have I ever wanted it to approach me like a Wizard of Oz–style twister, threatening to envelope me in a vortex of saucy carbs. This is, quite possibly, the most disastrous incarnation pasta can take. 3. Gummo Sometimes spaghetti, especially in film, is so much less about propelling a plot than it is about setting a mood. Take Gummo, for example: Food isn’t necessarily central to Harmony Korine’s indie tour de force. But in an iconic scene that continues to haunt long after it finishes, his character slurps a plate of s'ghetti while his mom shampoos his hair. Dolls hang from a rack in the background. The walls are a discomfiting electric blue. The whole thing is great, but oh so strange. 4. Tampopo In what is, some would argue, the best food movie of all time, spaghetti might take a back seat to another thin noodle, ramen. But in one iconic scene, a group of Japanese women get together to learn the best way to eat ramen’s Western counterpart. I won’t spoil it—just watch below—but what happens should not be watched without headphones. (Those with misophonia be warned: There is lots and lots of slurping.) 5. Eat, Pray, Love A plate of spaghetti can be transcendental. Life changing, even. For the central character in this tale of self-discovery and self-love, it is, in many ways, just what the doctor ordered. Julia Roberts slurps noodles to the tune of a very dramatic aria, and lunch suddenly becomes an extravaganza. Is there anything better than Roberts twirling away at a perfectly portioned plate of spaghetti? Is there anything better than Julia Roberts? 6. Se7en For all the exuberance we usually afford spaghetti, there's always space for the sinister. Enter the brooding and terrifying Se7en, David Fincher’s reimagined New York noir. Without giving anything away, all you need to know is that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, partner detectives, happen upon a man who’s been killed by overeating—you guessed it—a plate of spaghetti. Why? Who? That, I won’t tell you. As for what’s in the box? I most definitely won’t give that away either. 7. Brooklyn Before she was Lady Bird, Saoirse Ronan was a fresh-faced transplant from Ireland in Brooklyn (which also scored her an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination). Her character Eilis Lace falls in love with the son of an Italian family and, like any Brooklynite in the 1950s is wont to do, gets invited to his house for dinner. In preparation, she spends a good portion of the movie perfecting her pasta eating techniques all in the hopes she'll spill nary a drop on her dress. Come dinnertime: forks are twirled, parents are met, thinly veiled prejudices are quickly revealed. Oh, and she leaves with a very clean frock. What are some of your favorite spaghetti movie moments?

christina capatides,"A day after 36,000 Oklahoma teachers took part in a massive walkout demanding higher pay and an increase in school funding, the music teachers among them picked up their instruments and blasted out an unlikely anthem: ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" by Twisted Sister. ""If I didn't have a second job, I'd be on food stamps,"" Rae Lovelace, a single mom and a third-grade teacher at Leedey Public Schools in northwest Oklahoma told CBS News. She works 30 to 40 hours a week at a second job teaching online courses for a charter school, and she isn't alone. Inside the state capitol on Tuesday, hundreds of teachers booed as members of the Oklahoma House adjourned without taking up Senate-approved revenue-raising measures for public school classrooms. And outside, protesters let their brass instruments do the talking. Thanks to its catchy and direct refrain, teachers in Kentucky, New Jersey, West Virginia and Pennsylvania have also taken up the metal anthem as a sort of rallying cry over the past several months, prompting Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider to tweet about the peculiarity of the song choice. ""While I totally support underpaid teacher's cause, it is kind of weird that a song that was on the ""Filthy 15"" is now every oppressed groups battlecry,"" the singer wrote on Twitter. While I totally support underpaid teacher's cause, it is kind of weird that a song that was on the ""Filthy 15"" is now every oppressed groups battlecry. #GODBLESSAMERICA ! https://t.co/G7PBHpgsIZ — Dee Snider (@deesnider) April 3, 2018 ""We're Not Gonna Take It,"" released in 1984, was Twisted Sister's sole Top 40 hit. And while Snider originally penned it as an anthem of rebellion against adult authority, the classic rock hit has actually seen its fair share of political action. In 2012, when House Speaker Paul Ryan was running on the Republican presidential ticket with Mitt Romney, he used ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" at campaign stops, until a disgruntled Snider eventually put a stop to it. ""I emphatically denounce Paul Ryan's use of my band Twisted Sister's song, 'We're Not Gonna Take It,' in any capacity,"" the singer said at the time. ""There is almost nothing he stands for that I agree with except the use of the P90X,"" he added, referring to Ryan's favored workout regimen. When President Trump launched his run for the White House, he asked Snider's permission to use the song as exit music at his rallies, and Snider (a former contestant on ""Celebrity Apprentice"") initially agreed. The singer later retracted his permission upon hearing Trump's positions on several issues. ""When Donald started running for office, he asked me,"" Snider told CNN. ""He says, 'Can I use the song?' And he's a buddy. And I said, 'Yeah. Go ahead.' But as the months went on, I heard a litany of his beliefs that I'd never discussed with him. I finally called him, and I said, 'Man, you've gotta stop using the song. People think I'm endorsing you here. I can't get behind a lot of what you're saying.' … He has not used it since."" Thus, while Snider may consider the song an odd anthem for the teachers' movement, it has certainly been tapped as a rallying cry in the past, transitioning somewhat seamlessly from big hair to big issues... from MTV's ""Headbangers Ball"" to the political arena.","Twister Sister singer Dee Snider says he supports the movement, but thinks the song choice is ""kind of weird""",2018-04-04T15:37:57Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}","""We're not gonna take it"": The unlikely anthem of the teachers movement",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/were-not-gonna-take-it-twisted-sister-hit-becomes-unlikely-anthem-of-teachers-movement/,https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/04/0108407d-8059-438f-920b-e596013bf809/thumbnail/1200x630/1c81a88d70559a6ef3b24ea165114c1e/werenot-1538087-640x360.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,twister,1
Ray Flook,"Credit: AMC Fans of AMC ‘s Fear the Walking Dead have had a lot to process coming out of the first-half of the show’s season 4: the loss of show mainstays Madison ( Kim Dickens ) and Nick ( Frank Dillane ); the first full crossover with The Walking Dead in the form of Morgan ( Lennie James ); and the introduction of new – and very popular – characters Althea ( Maggie Grace ), John Dorie ( Garrett Dillahunt ), and Laura/Naomi/June ( Jenna Elfman ). Credit: AMC After warring between themselves and then with The Vultures, our group of surivivors find themselves on the road – some looking for a place to settle and call home, while others still harboring a need to atone for past sins or mourn tragic losses. As we can see from the extended season trailer released during FTWD ‘s San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) panel on Friday (panel/press conference report coming this week), Alicia ( Alycia Debnam-Carey ), Strand ( Colman Domingo ), and the others are going to have to trust each other pretty quickly because it looks like Mother Nature – and maybe something else – is coming their way. But does the biggest threat come from within? The first half of season four began with one figure huddled around a campfire, and ended with nine. Characters who started their journeys in isolation collided with each other in unexpected ways and found themselves in one of the last places they ever expected to be…together. In the back half of the season they will explore who they are now – as individuals and as part of the greater group – and how they will forge ahead. They will find themselves pitted against new adversaries – human, walker, and even nature itself. Theirs will be a journey wrought with danger, love, heartbreak, loss, and ultimately, hope. The series is executive produced by Scott M. Gimple, showrunners Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg, as well as Robert Kirkman, David Alpert, Gale Anne Hurd and Greg Nicotero, and produced by AMC Studios. The series stars Lennie James, Alycia Debnam-Carey, Colman Domingo, Danay Garcia, Garret Dillahunt, Maggie Grace and Jenna Elfman.

Justin T. Westbrook,"The new big-dog 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 is finally here with at least 700 horsepower from a supercharged cross-plane V8, and it backs it up with an all-new dual-clutch gearbox. Its the most powerful street-legal Ford ever. Will this be the American performance car to beat?
First of all, listen to it below. My God!
OK, then. Im OK.
Following the leak of what appeared to be a brochure for the new Shelby GT500 last night, Ford finally ripped the sheet off of its highest-performance street Stang this morning at the Detroit Auto Show. Its Fords answer to wanting more from the current GT350, as well as wanting to kick the ass of Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and family of Dodge Hellcats. 
The Ford Shelby GT350 has been the top of the Mustang heap for a few years now, but weve known for 
Read more Read
Ford hasnt delivered exact power figures yet, but promises a quarter-mile time under 11 seconds and a zero to 60 mph time in the mid-three second range. Ford calls it a takedown artist, so theyre not shying away from how weaponized the muscle car competition is these days.
Heres what we do know.
The GT500's 5.2-liter supercharged V8 is paired with an all-new seven-speed dual-clutch transmission from Tremec and has no manual option, at least not at launch. The chassis is fitted with a carbon fiber driveshaft, MagneRide dampers and high performance Michelin tires Ford claims were specifically engineered for the car, with Pilot Sport 4S tires optional. Theres also huge Brembo 16.5-inch rotors with six-piston calipers, so the thing can stop hard, too.
The new gearbox is claimed to be capable of shifts in under 100 milliseconds, markedly faster than any manual gearbox, Ford says.
Theres also the aero kit: A more aggressive front end than your standard Mustang, an adjustable carbon fiber spoiler, and a new front air dam. The face openings have more than doubled since the Shelby GT350 to give it tons of air.
It also gets an electronic line-lock for ripping sick burnouts (on the track, or whatever), launch control, and some apps for tracking your track attack accurately.
As for looks, who wants a sleeper when you get that very pronounced front splitter and redesigned grille, massive functional slatted hood vent, black and glossy 20-inch wheels, and paint options like Twister Orange Metallic, Red Hot Metallic, and Grabber Lime. Theres also a silver. 
You can also option a Carbon Fiber Track Pack which includes 20-inch carbon wheels with the Pilot Sport 4S tires, exposed carbon fiber on the rear wing and instrument cluster, Recaro leather and suede seats, and a rear-seat delete.
And then there are all of the stripes. Vinyl stripes over the top, painted stripes over the top, and vinyl side-stripes are available. Each undoubtedly add a few horsepower, so definitely check those boxes.
Its also still a Mustang that you could technically drive every day, if you were incredibly cool, so it comes with the Sync 3 infotainment setup, a 12-inch digital instrument cluster, a 4G LTE hotspot for Instagramming from the track that much faster, and a rear-view camera.
If that new seven-speed DCT is any good at putting the power down, the GT500 seems to promise a truly terrifying new level of Mustang.

Encouraging children to sharpen their precision skills and improve their dexterity is all well and good, but when the 5-year-old accidentally touches the tweezers to Cavity Sam's body while attempting to pluck out a toothpick-sized bone that's hypothetically paining the battery-operated patient, an earth-shatteringly loud buzzer blares, signaling the end of a turn and a rude awakening to a kindergartener's dream of someday becoming a surgeon. As if the original Cavity Sam wasn't traumatic enough back in the day, now parents have a whole new way to entice their offspring to join the lucrative medical field. Only this time, it's a crash course in dermatology — pimple-popping, to be exact. Dr. Pimple Popper, a.k.a. board-certified dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, has just announced a collaboration with Spin Master, a leading global children’s entertainment company, to bring a ""Pimple Pete"" board game to the masses. The objective of the game is to gently extract pull-able gummy pimples from Pete's face, but what makes it an anxiety-ridden, Operation-esque challenge is that, when the aspiring derm rocks Pete's face forward or back in the midst of an extraction, the ""mega-zit"" on his nose explodes, spraying the losing player with a sharp shot of pus water. Unfortunately, Cavity Sam's adolescent grandson, Pimple Pete, doesn't hit mass retailers until this fall. In the meantime, popaholics of all ages can catch Dr. Sandra Lee in her new TLC TV series, Dr. Pimple Popper, premiering on July 11th, where she'll be tackling real-life patients’ debilitating skin conditions and helping them reclaim their lives in the process.

CBS/AP,"Columbus, Miss. — Weekend storms raked parts of the Southeast, leaving deaths and injuries in their wake as a tornado smashed into a commercial district in a small Mississippi city and drenching rains fed a rising flood threat. The twister destroyed one church – but a baptism went ahead as scheduled the very next day.
At First Pentecostal Church in Columbus, Mississippi, the Rev. Steve Blaylock said the building was ""a total loss,"" with a wall pushed in, holes in the roof and substantial water damage. He and his congregants tried to salvage what they could on the morning after the storm.
